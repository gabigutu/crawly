		<shortDescription>The seal of confession is highly illustrated by Hitchcock's "I Confess."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the transfer of culpability was a basic theme in Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train," it furnished the provocative dilemma to "I Confess."A German refugee, Keller (O.E. Hasse), murders a lawyer named Vilette (Ovila Legare) when he is caught stealing... Keller thereupon confesses his crime to Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift), a priest at the Quebec church where he is a sexton...Vilette was blackmailing Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter), who was in love with Logan before he was ordained and who continues to love him in spite of his religious vows and her subsequent marriage to Pierre Granfort (Roger Dann).Keller wore a cassock when he committed the crime and Father Logan is unable to supply an alibi for the time of the murder - a series of coincidences which eventually find the priest on trial for murder...The dilemma of "I Confess" relates to Catholic church law which specifically forbids the clergy from disclosing those sins exposed in the privacy of the confessional... Thus forced into complicity with the murderer, Father Logan behaves as though he is guilty despite his innocence in much the same way Guy Haines takes on some of Bruno's guilt in Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train." The film's tension derives from the audience's knowledge of the cleric's ethical problem and its desire to see him break his vows to save his own life...Montgomery Clift makes the clergyman's inner torment apparent simply by the anguished expression in his eyes, and creates sympathy for a man who could be an object of mockery by maintaining his dignity... Compassionate, grave, and restrained, Clift delineates the priest's conflicting emotions with the distinguished nuances of expression... His face, vulnerable but brighter by discerning yet kind eyes, reveals his suffering with eloquent intensity...While a determined Karl Malden looks for every scrap of information to clear the murder, an embarrassing crown prosecutor (Brian Aherne) is in despair to establish a motive for the murder...With moody atmosphere, set against the background of picturesque Quebec photographed in black and white, "I Confess" is solemn and entertaining, never getting out of control, with an overpowering sense of doom and enough amount of suspense in the manhunt of a killer...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Confess" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's least famous films, and it's easy to see why: there is no mystery (we know who the killer is right from the start); there is some suspense but no major set-pieces; there is very little humor (no Cary Grant-type wisecracks here). The movie is a somber psychological drama, and the story of a forbidden love, and perhaps a Christ allegory (the priest has to suffer for another man's sins - he has to bear his own cross). I wouldn't rank it among Hitchcock's best, but it certainly has some of the best acting you can find in a Hitchcock film: Montgomery Clift is superb in a difficult role, Anne Baxter is warm and utterly believable as the woman who is consumed by her love for him, and Karl Malden is perfectly cast as the nosy (no pun intended) inspector on the case.

		<shortDescription>Superior, if not superlative Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's never been satisfactorily explained why this wasn't a commercial success. It's not a bad film. Nor is it good in an inaccessible way. Hitchcock's explanations for its failure aren't at all convincing... Non-Catholics don't know about the seal of confession, he said; they can't believe that a priest will sacrifice his freedom and career just to keep a secret. Rubbish. They can and they do. EVERYONE knows about the seal of confession, and Montgomery Clift makes Father Logan's sacrifice perfectly plausible. (Besides, I've never had much time for the objection that a lead character is "too good".) The one thing some people don't know about the seal of confession is that the priest can't mention the sin even to the guilty party, but this is made clear enough in the film in one of the confrontations between Keller and Logan. (All such confrontations are excellent, by the way.) Hitchcock also complains that audiences missed the point by hoping for Logan to tell the police what he knows, a complaint which betrays a misunderstanding of audience psychology. We NEVER hope that the hero will "get out of jail" by doing something dishonourable or morally wrong; so long as there is some other way for the plot to be resolved, THAT'S what we're hoping for. Besides, it's obvious that Logan will never break his vows. Another reviewer says that Logan should simply say to the police: "The seal of confession prevents me from answering your questions"; but the film makes it clear he can't say even this. It would put the police on Keller's scent, and Logan feels - rightly or wrongly, but at any rate plausibly - that his vows force him to be genuinely silent, not nudge-nudge wink-wink silent. I'm on his side here. It's hard to feel much sympathy for the "I won't say who did it, but I WILL drop a hint" attitude adopted by the priests of modern police dramas.So what IS wrong with "I Confess"? Too much "Teutonic[?] gravity", as some have alleged? "Not enough humour"? Please. those imposing shots of stony Quebec MAKE the film. And let's face it: Hitchcock isn't funny. Give me this kind of thing over the leaden levity of "North by Northwest" any day. No: the short answer is that there's NOTHING, or nothing to speak of, wrong with "I Confess"; certainly nothing that explains its unpopularity.A few things weaken it a little. If Montgomery Clift plays one of Hitchcock's most likeable characters, Anne Baxter plays one of the least likeable ones; I found it hard not to hope that Ruth would fall into the sea, or walk in front of a bus, or induce a casual passer-by to strangle her. This is okay: the fact that she's irritating helps the story. All the same, her explanatory flashback DOES tend to drag, and one wishes her scenes could be speeded up a little. Then there's Dmitri Timokin's score. It's a fine score, in its way, but it DRONES. Tiomkin is never allowed to get a crescendo out of the orchestra; instead, the sound engineer turns up the volume every so often.Not that any of this matters much. Overall it's one of Hitchcock's more engaging films. The worst that can be said of it is that it's not a masterpiece, nor is it among his very best. Try it if you think that all the critical carrying-on over such films as "Foreign Correspondent", "Notorious", "Strangers on a Train" and "North by Northwest" is a bit much, and you long for something that isn't so theory-driven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hitch's sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Confess" is the most under exposed/appreciated/rated of Hitchcock's films. It is as convincing (except for the minimal flashbacks) as "Shadow of a Doubt" in terms of both its art and its reality. Its mise en scene captures Quebec City, its specifically Catholic culture, its history, its moral dramas, and its character types. I think Clift and Baxter are perfectly cast, as are Aherne and Maldon. Keller and Alma truly hit home as Catholic parish staff and carry effectively much of the drama and suspense of this true Hitch sleeper, which is also a memorable romance. (There is indeed a great deal of genuine emotion and deep feeling in this very ordinary and convincing world).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Confess" is a strong candidate for Hitchcock's most forgotten film. It never gets mentioned in any Hitchcock documentaries or when discussing about his movies. The film doesn't offer the usual amount of excitement or thrilling entertainment than his better known ones ("North by Northwest", for instance). In fact, there isn't much of "real" suspense at all, but well-sketched characters, fine acting performances, and captivating plot development are more than compensating matters."I Confess" is a very interesting piece of film making and should be viewed by any Hitchcock fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch Asks Moral Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Alfred Hitchcock film with very little action or suspense, this moral issue- drama still maintains interest for the most part. Montgomery Clift is intriguing as "Father William Logan," a Catholic priest from Quebec who hears a murder confession, is charged with the crime himself, and never wavers from his vow to keep confessions private.The question Hitchcock apparently poses with this is is, "Is that still morally right when it means you leave a killer out on the loose?"Complicating the matter is an old girlfriend, played by Anne Baxter, who still loves the priest. However, once again the cleric remains true to his vows and doesn't get involved with her.Karl Malden, meanwhile, plays a gung-ho cop out to solve the crime.This movie could use a little more suspense and action, plus a bit of the old Hitchcock humor, but still is more than passable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nos Deux Consciences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Confess's story takes place in Quebec City, Canada is adapted from the French story Nos Deux Consciences. And the whole thing is about a priest's conscience. Does he keep his vows even at the cost of his own freedom and maybe his life, certainly his reputation.That is what Montgomery Clift is faced with. German actor O.E. Hasse who Clift worked with on The Big Lift is the caretaker of a church where Clift is assigned. He takes the priest's garments and commits murder in them. And then offers confession to Clift. Clift knows the murder victim as well and could have his own reason for doing him harm. Of course police detective Karl Malden suspects him.How this all gets resolved is the plot of the story. But let me give you a hint. The title of the original story is Our Two Consciences. And the consciences referred to are Monty Clift's and someone else's.Clift and the rest of the cast do a fine job in this minor Alfred Hitchcock film. But the acting honors in this go to O.E. Hasse, an really oily malevolent villain who is enjoying the predicament he's put the priest in. You won't forget him.Fans of Hitchcock and Clift will be entertained and others will enjoy it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooding, moody, deceptively simple, and beautiful study of guilt and honor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Confess (1953)This is one of Hitchcock's darkest films, and one of the best for seamless believability--it lacks some of the breaks from verisimilitude that bigger hits like Psycho and Vertigo famously use. It also has the incomparable Montgomery Clift, who took intensity to new heights as the first in a series of great method actors in the 1950s. He really wasn't a Hitchcock kind of actor (the director liked the artifice and changeability of a Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart much more), but he makes the film what it is, and Hitchcock surely knew it, and made the most of it. When the camera (in the hand of Robert Burks) sweeps up to a full screen view of Clift's face and you see those glowing, brooding eyes, you fall under their collective spell. Yeah, it's great stuff.The plot is pretty simple and amazing--a priest (Clift) learns something in a confession that come to haunt him in unexpected and very threatening ways. Hitchcock manages to push the envelope a little, as usual, in this case by having an illicit-seeming sexual affair be one of the keys to the plot. This implication naturally complicates the priest's life, but during the main plot of the movie and in a cheery flashback for backstory. Anne Baxter, the principled, strong woman (also not a Hitchcock forte) is terrific throughout, terrific the way Ingrid Bergman was in Notorious. Unlike most of Hitchcock's output, there is essentially no comic relief here, and the light and camera-work are equally dark--and truly gorgeous.The French New Wave directors really admired this particular film of Hitchcock's, and you can see why. But it is also just a great, fast, distressing American melodrama set in France. It's not sensational, but it is spectacular, one of my favorites among many by this odd, brilliant auteur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new DVD is excellent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may not be one of Hitchcock's greatest movies, but it's still a great film, since it was made by the master, who somehow managed to survive beautifully in Hollywood for many years. It contains many of his favorite things: lamps, the backs of people's heads, bedposts, ladies pacing in front of mantelpieces, obvious symbolism, architecture, performing arts halls, etc. More somber in tone than most Hitchcock thrillers, it should not be missed by any Hitchcock fan.Nor by any Montgomery Clift fan. At one point Clift is juxtaposed against a statue of Christ dragging his cross, taunted by soldiers. This could be the impishly sadistic Hitchcock poking fun at the "plugged-up" persona that Clift was developing for himself, but Clift is nevertheless excellent as the brooding, sensitive priest trapped by his own devotional vows. And of course he's physically beautiful: the hair, the eyes, the eyebrows.Less effective, although she has her moments, is Anne Baxter who was a replacement for a European actress. It's too bad, because it's hard to buy Baxter as the luscious Hitchcock blonde. Her hairdo is awful (well, it was 1953, so it's not entirely her fault)and she does that line reading that she does in every movie, including "All About Eve," where each line fades to a whisper, or starts as a whisper and stays that way. Once you become aware of it, you can't not notice it! She does, however, have at least one great Orry-Kelly dress and the way she snaps "Yes" at her husband was worth a rollback for a second viewing.The new DVD is excellent. It has a little documentary which is enjoyable, if you can stand Peter Bogdanovich doing his Hitchcock impersonation. Hitchcock's daughter is also in the documentary. It's amazing how she seems to not really understand what her father was up to sub-textually, but she continues to enjoy his success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest spiritual denouement in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the other comments on this film and nobody seems to have grasped the single essential point that makes it timelessly relevant, and that lifts it, in that respect, above all other movies: its portrayal of an individual of total spiritual integrity. All candidates for the priesthood should view this film and then decide whether they can live up to the standard set by this priest - if not they might as well give it up and become auto mechanics or carpet cleaners. Montgomery Clift's priest believes utterly in the essential worth of all human beings, regardless of their spiritual condition - and believe me Otto Keller is not in good condition. Clift is willing to take his integrity to the electric chair - who does this remind you of? Only by sheer accident is he vindicated - if had he not been, and been executed, it would not have made the slightest bit of difference to his destiny. Here is a man who has his house in order. Forget about the romantic subplot, and look at this movie as spiritual education -- just set your lights by this man and your problems are over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and thrilling movie by the Master of Suspense in which a good priest is accused of killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining suspense movie packs thrills ,intrigue , tension and ordinary Hitch touches . Indispensable seeing this quintessential Hitch movie , demanding various viewings . Classic and haunting suspense by the master himself , Hitchcock , dealing with tragic events when a priest (Montgomery Clift) takes confession from a man who coincidentally killed a blackmailer who he knew of pre-vows relationship with a married woman (Anne Baxter). Refusing to give into police investigators' questions of suspicion, due to the seal of confession, the Father becomes the prime suspect in a murder. The murderer is called Otto Kellar (O.E.Hasse) and his wife Alma (Dolly Haas) work as caretaker and housekeeper at a Catholic church in Quebec . Meanwhile , the priest named Fr. Michael Logan walking through the town, passes in front of a cinema showing ¨The enforcer¨. Interesting Hitch film shot in Canada's colorful Quebec by Warner Bros , being based on the 1902 play "Nos Deux consciences" by Paul Anthelme, but little is known about any production of the play. However , in the original play, the priest was hanged ; this scene had to be eliminated and replaced with another scene to avoid the wrath of the censor. Alfred Hitchcock's films have become famous for a number of elements and iconography : innocent men wrongfully accused, blonde women , long non-dialogue sequences, etc . Hitch apparently decided to leave this movie location unspecific and without recognizable landmarks and filmed it in the city of Quebec . In spite of some shortcoming , this is the picture that best reflects many of Hitchcock's puritanical ethics . Hitch plays on the senses and keeps the suspense and action in feverish pitch . All the elements for a suspenseful evening are in place and things move at an intelligent pace . The story is typical Hitch fare , an issue of wrong accusation , dual guilt , and treason that embroils a man in murder . Hitch had two of most charming actors of all Hollywood as Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter . As a pretty good acting by Montgomery Clift as a priest falsely framed of killing and Anne Baxter as his old friend who cannot handle the situation wrought in her life by the gross injustice . Montgomery Clift drank during the shooting and his eyes appear glazed during the ferry scene , Hitchcock was a very non-confrontational director and delegated an assistant director and Karl Malden to talk to the actor about it . Supporting cast is frankly excellent such as Karl Malden as Inspector Larrue , Brian Aherne as prosecutor Willy Robertson , O.E. Hasse as Otto Keller , Roger Dann as Pierre Grandfort and Dolly Haas played Alma Keller in this film ; Haas was selected to play "Alma" Keller, because of her physical resemblance to Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville . As usual , Hitch's cameo as man walking , as he is uncredited crossing the Top of Long Staircase . Atmospheric and moody cinematography in evocative style by Robert Burks , Hitch's ordinary . Very good sets and production design by Haworth and Beckman . Riveting and thrilling musical score by classic Dimitri Tiomkin . The motion picture was well directed by Alfred Hitchcock , he was famous for making his actors follow the script to the word, but in this movie the Hitch's method filmmaking clashing with Clift's method interpretation and the result falls short of the Master of Suspense's best pictures and never quite comes off at all . This is one of Hitch's most stylish and discussed films and will keep you riveted and excited until the edge-of-your-seat .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average For Hitchcock, Good By Any Other Standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Confess" is merely an average entry in Alfred Hitchcock's filmography, but it is a pretty good film by any other standard. It has some basic weaknesses, but also some major strengths that make it worthwhile. The basic story is established early: Catholic priest Father Logan (Montgomery Clift) hears a confession from the church caretaker, who has just killed a man. Circumstantial evidence leads to Father Logan himself being suspected, but he is bound by the seal of the confessional and is unable to clear himself, putting him in serious danger of being wrongly convicted.Two basic weaknesses keep "I Confess" from being one of Hitchcock's better works. First, too much of the plot hinges on the priest's confessional responsibility. In itself, this is an interesting plot device, leading to an interesting twist on one of Hitchcock's favorite themes, the wrongly accused man. But there are not enough other significant plot elements, and this one point cannot bear the load that it has to carry. In particular, a non-Catholic viewer, without an intuitive sense of the importance of confessional, will find it difficult to remember just how impossible it is for Father Logan to clear himself. This could have been established somehow earlier in the film - Hitchcock could be very creative when demonstrating things like this - but as it is, it is assumed that we already appreciate its importance.The two leads also are less than ideal in their roles, making it harder for the audience to develop the deep identification with them that makes Hitchcock's best movies such exciting experiences. The ever-brooding Clift is very believable as a priest, but his acting range is too limited to make us fully appreciate his dilemma, nor can he make the romance angle as compelling as it could have been. Anne Baxter is also too melodramatic as Logan's old friend who wants to clear him. Baxter is a good actress in the right part - for example, her breathlessness is ideal in "All About Eve" - but her character here really called for something different.Yet there are some strengths to "I Confess". One that stands out is the wonderful black-and-white photography. The film was made on location in Quebec, and Hitchcock masterfully uses a careful selection of shots throughout the picture that establish Quebec's distinctiveness and its stark beauty. It is one of Hitchcock's best pieces of location filming, rivaling the French Riviera scenery of "To Catch a Thief", although of course with a much different tone. In both films, the location nicely complements the story.Karl Malden is good as the inspector assigned to the case. Malden must accept the usual role of a Hitchcock policeman - hard-working, honest, and earnest, but not very perceptive. Malden makes what could have been a bland character come to life.There is also a fine climactic sequence: Father Logan is finally put on trial, and the verdict sparks public outrage and a carefully filmed and suspenseful chain of events. The climax is perhaps less satisfying than those of Hitchcock's best films, but that is mainly because we never learned to identify very much with the characters; it is not a fault of the ending itself. There are some fine Hitchcock touches here that you have to catch on repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crisis Of Conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder, blackmail and romance all feature strongly in Alfred Hitchcock's "I Confess" but the story's most compelling component is the moral dilemma faced by a Catholic priest who, after hearing a murderer's confession, is unable to disclose what he knows to the police. The priest's duty to honour the sanctity of the confessional is paramount but by doing so he becomes complicit in concealing the guilt of a killer and later, when the priest becomes the prime suspect, he's left to face not only a crisis of conscience but also the possibility that he'll be executed if he refuses to tell the police what he knows.This movie was based on Paul Anthelme's 1902 play called "Nos Deux Consciences" and the fact that the plot involved certain issues (Catholicism, the wrong man theme and reasons to mistrust the police) which had preoccupied Hitchcock throughout his life, makes it easy to understand the appeal that this project had for the great director and also the seriousness with which he focuses on the priest's predicament. It's this seriousness that determines the mood of the movie and also contributes to the tension that's a constant feature of everything that takes place.Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) is a young Catholic priest in Quebec who, late one night, discovers the church's caretaker in one of the pews looking very distressed. Otto Keller (O.E.Hasse) asks Father Logan to hear his confession and in the confessional describes how he murdered a local lawyer called Villette (Ovila Legare) when he'd been caught in the act of stealing some money. Keller tells his wife Alma (Dolly Hass) what he's done and next morning goes to Villette's house, as usual, where he's also employed as a part-time gardener. On "discovering" the body, he calls the police and Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden) and some other officers soon arrive to investigate.Father Logan also goes to the victim's house on the same morning and claims that he had an appointment to meet Villette. After he leaves, Larrue sees him talking outside to Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter) in a way that raises his suspicions and later when two young girls report that they saw a priest leaving Villette's property at about the time of the murder, Larrue's suspicions are reinforced.Ruth and Logan had been in a relationship before he became a priest and on one occasion, after having been separated for some time, had spent the night together. Logan was unaware that during his absence, Ruth had married a politician named Pierre Grandfort (Roger Dann) and unfortunately for the young couple, they were seen together by Villette who throughout the following years blackmailed Ruth.On the night of Villette's murder, Logan was with Ruth because she'd sought his advice about the blackmail problem and so when he's subsequently interviewed by Larrue, Logan doesn't feel able to account for his whereabouts at the time of the murder. This makes Larrue convinced of the priest's guilt and later when Ruth comes forward to provide Logan with the alibi he needs, she actually makes matters worse for him because the fact that she was being blackmailed provided a strong motive for wanting to bring an end to Villette's activities by any means possible. A number of further complications and problems then follow before Logan's ordeal is finally brought to an end."I Confess" is a great-looking movie with wonderful expressionistic cinematography which perfectly complements the sombre mood of the piece. The use of numerous close-ups and low-angle shots creates an unsettling atmosphere and some camera techniques, such as the way that Larrue's face is revealed just before he sees Logan and Ruth together in the street, create a frisson of their own.The quality of the acting is impeccable throughout but Montgomery Clift's contribution really stands out because of the dignity, sensitivity and intensity that he brings to his character's anguish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unappreciated Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this recently and am somewhat perplexed by the relatively low score (for a Hitchcock film) that it has received. I thought the performances by Anne Baxter, Karl Malden, and especially Monty as the tortured priest were pitch perfect. The stark black and white photography also contributed greatly to the gloomy almost defeatist mood of the film. The extended flashback interlude of the past romance between Logan and Madam Grandfort was also very moving. The 'villain' Keller (Hasse) was sympathetic to a slight degree and the understated tension of his encounters with Logan were spine tingling. All in all, this is yet another gem from The Master, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Confess is one of those movies that almost reaches the brink of greatness, but just doesn't quite make it. Hitchcock's direction is certainly fine, if not a bit pedestrian. There are no signature scenes that seems to be present in many of his other films (such as the shower scene in Psycho, or the Mount Rushmore chase in North By Northwest). There is a flashback sequence, showing Clift before his character was a priest, that starts off beautifully....the camera is slightly cock-eyed, and Anne Baxter descends the staircase in slow motion, almost flowing down the stairs. However, the rest of the flashback just doesn't live up to the potential established in that first shot. Karl Malden is good as usual. Clift does an okay job in the role of the priest who hears the confession of the murderer. Anne Baxter is very good, and the supporting cast is certainly fine. I have also had a problem with the musical score of this film. Seems that Jack Warner had a standing rule at WB studios, of filling nearly every second of a film's soundtrack with background music. I'm sure Hitchcock and Tiomkin both cringed at this insane policy. Tiomkin DOES provide the film with a beautiful love theme of sorts. I recommend this film, but I don't guarantee that you'll be watching a classic. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ruth loves Michael, but he...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the disregarded works in Hitchcock's career. Roger Ebert in the Great Movies series has plenty of good things to say about Notorious, Strangers on a Train and other films of this period, but nothing on the only film Hitchcock made with Montgomery Clift, Anne Baxter and Karl Malden. This picture must stand alone in his work, since it is dependent on the remembrance of the past playing a decisive role in the present-day actions of the characters. A typical Hitchcock story has characters who seem to have no past at all--they seem to spring to life to fulfill the demands of the script.I Confess starts as a typical thriller, then at the 42 minute mark, the story comes to a halt in Robertson's office as Ruth recounts the story of how she fell in love with Michael Logan, who was not fully in love with her (an obvious parallel with Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge). For 16 minutes, we forget there is a murder story to unravel--surely the only time in Hitchcock's work that we are taken away so completely from the matter at hand. This is what makes I Confess a great movie, and a peak in the director's career.Montgomery Clift has all the attributes of a dedicated priest, and he easily distinguishes himself from the urbane, sympathetic Charles Andre and the monumentally clumsy and distracted Gilles Pelletier playing the other two priests at the rectory. His solitary devotion is just as apparent when he wears a uniform in the wartime scenes. Anne Baxter has always been a favourite actress of mine, from All About Eve to The Razor's Edge, and she is wonderful here as a politician's wife who fails to protect her friend. Roger Dann as the husband does little; it's a shame that Glenn Ford didn't play the part, he would have been excellent (he was born in Quebec City, by the way).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon viewing in a current day context, it is a genuine shame that I Confess, visionary director Alfred Hitchcock's follow up to his smash hit Strangers on a Train, was greeted with such a stigma of controversy and negative reaction. While it is true that having a priest as the lead character in what was essentially marketed as a suspense thriller may have been a storytelling trait slightly ahead of its time, (the religious connotations must have no doubt caused some mumblings of discontent back in 1953) but it does lead to a simply brilliant and unique story premise: Father Michael Logan (Clift) hears the confession of a murder from a man working in his rectory, but due to the sanctity of confession, can break his trust and tell no one, even when he himself is framed for the murder, unable to clear his own name. Hitchcock is in familiar territory here as he revamps his trademark "wrong man" plot, but with the interesting tweaking of the lead role - instead of the protagonist fighting to clear his name when he is wrongfully accused, Father Logan must instead struggle in silence, dutifully refusing to breach the confidentiality of confession. This submission of the lead character did not sit well with audiences, nor Hitchcock himself when the film was first released,but this is ultimately what makes I Confess stand out among so many of Hitchcock's similar thrillers, without ruining the plot in the slightest - the suspense element is still there, albeit slightly more serious (there are no light heated wisecracks here) and subdued, as the audience still clings to the edge of their seats, wondering how Father Logan's name will be cleared without him personally attempting to clear it. And despite the complaints in regards to the film's 'forced religious messages', it is hard to comprehend the reputation as there are none really, apart from the lead character being a priest. Hitchcock handles his subject matter, (including the priest character being suspected of murder and having an alleged love affair) with just as even a hand, and as careful and classy a touch as in all his other efforts.Also, I Confess proves to be not only Hitchcock's last film in black and white (except for Psycho seven years later) but also one of his strongest films in terms of visual style and feel for the film. The Quebec location and sets are pitch perfect throughout, and Hitchcock and cinematography director Robert Burks deploy subtle but innovative cinematography techniques throughout to heighten the mood, making more liberal use of camera movement and extended shots of behind characters heads, as if hiding their inner turmoil from the audience - a superb touch. Composer Dimitri Tiomkin's score toes the line of becoming too dramatic, but it settles as being suitably powerful and affecting. The screenplay by George Tabori and William Archibald is an intelligent piece, not afraid to push social boundaries given the time period, though it is disappointing that the motivation of Clift's character is more often than not chalked up to martyrdom, when the real intent was to demonstrate his struggle to remain faithful to his principles and faith. As usual, Hitchcock also proves to be an expert actor's director, as the cast turn out universally excellent performances, each one emoting surprisingly genuinely and proving particularly convincing in their roles. Montgomery Clift gives a superb performance as the priest in question, Father Logan, remaining subtle to the point of seeming not to emote throughout, yet hinting at surging emotions kept carefully under a facade of calm. Anne Baxter is also a notable presence, one of the more memorable of Hitchcock's icy blondes as the mysterious woman connected with him, and she manages to retain interest enough to keep the audience interested through a long and potentially hazardous and tedious voice-over flashback sequence. Karl Malden is charismatic and engaging as the police officer investigating the murder case, and Brian Aherne is perfectly cast as a suave yet sleazy prosecutor. German actor O.E. Hasse debatably steals the show as the actual murderer, switching from despairing, to coldly logical, to sadistically enjoying Father Logan's plight as he is accused of the murder they both know he did not commit. All things considered, it is a real shame I Confess is one of Hitchcock's more overlooked films, as the sheer quality and inventiveness bursting out of every frame should be easily enough to cement the film alongside other classic thrillers and dramatic films of the decade. Don't let the alleged religious connotations and occasional bad reviews steer you away - this is one of Hitchcock's strongest works, as the unique variation on his time worn themes, combined with a visually sumptuous look, a quick and intelligent script and a consistently impressive cast easily make the film worth a watch. -9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fitting end to a magical era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Confess" is a landmark film in the Alfred Hitchcock collection. It is the last black and white film Hitchcock made (with the notable exception of Psycho seven years later). But it was made at a time when Hitchcock was at the peak of his career. I Confess was sandwiched between internationally-acclaimed classics Strangers on a Train and Dial M for Murder. And so I Confess, not being a stunning Hitchcock film, fell between the cracks into that category of Hitchcock known as: "The Underrated Films"."The Underrated Films" are those films that Hitchcock made that did not meet with box office success, but have been re-evaluated by his next generation of fans and have been found worthy of mention, most notably: Topaz, Stage Fright, Marnie and I Confess.I Confess is definitely not standard Hitchcock. There's no really stunning visual effects (apart from the excellent background photography), no incredible camera angles, no definitive Hitchcockian scenes. It's just a typical movie with a typical plot.That plot however, is indeed the purveyor of the modern courtroom drama. A priest takes confession from a man that works in the rectory. The worker confesses he has murdered a man in a robbery attempt. The victim also happened to be blackmailing the priest and his former lover. The priest falls under suspicion and is arrested, but he cannot clear himself because his religious duties forbid him to reveal what a man has confessed.True, the plot hasn't aged well. Every show from Matlock to Diagnosis Murder has used it. But considering the age of the movie (Going on 50 years), it is safe to say that this was the source for such tales. The ever-present Hitchcock plot twist is also quite good. The verdict (it should be noted that this is one of the only Hitchcock movies to feature a good portion of the trial, and not just the verdict/sentencing), the verdict sparks public outrage and the ensuing events are shocking indeed.Overall, Montgomery Cliff is excellent as the falsely accused priest, and Hitchcock - although unspectacular - is still the closest thing to a perfect director the film world has seen. The plot is good, the story flows well and it is a fine sendoff for Hitchcock's black and white era.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not worse mystery stories than those that are resolved by a confession. This picture starts with a confession, and starts well. But the very complicated, and very absurd story's denouement is another confession: The real murderer confesses by shooting people. Hitchcock himself said to Francois Truffaut that he did not remember why he bought the old play in which this picture is based. Lots of coincidences do not construct a suspense story.The picture is saved by the performances of Montgomery Clift (even if it is slightly monotonous), Anne Baxter and Anny Ondra. Imagine a Hitchcock picture without humor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten Hitchcock's gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Confess is one of the less seen Alfred Hitchcock films that deserve much more attention. It remotely based on a French Stage Play of the beginning of the 20th century by Paul Anthelme called Nos Deux Consciences. It was a film Hitchcock wanted to make for a about a 20 years, but kept postponing it realizing difficulty of acceptance it would have in the society because of the subject the film is about. Father Michael Logan is a young priest in the late 1940s Quebec who hears a confession from Otto Keller (Otto Hasse), a poor German refugee who works as a caretaker at Father Logan's church, who tells him that he has just committed a murder of a lawyer by the name Vilette, in whose home he broke in with the intent to rob a big sum of money that would improve his, and most importantly his wife Alma's life, whom he can't stand seeing working hard anymore.  Soon the body of the victim is found and Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden) begins to conduct an investigation. He finds witnesses who had seen a priest going out of Vilette's home around the time he was killed. The suspicion falls on Father Logan when discovered that he knew Vilette personally and had a strong personal motive to kill him. In addition to that Otto starts to testify against him also. Now Logan has to make a choice of remaining silent and probably being hanged for a crime he didn't committed or break the secrecy of confession and tell the truth about who the real murderer is. An intelligent, neatly constructed in the best Hitchcock's trademark style film, definitely deserves to be seen. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'I Confess' is carefully construed. It begins straight away with Hitchcock walking through the top of the screen and the signs saying 'direction-&gt;', 'direction-&gt;', 'direction-&gt;', as if Hitchcock is saying: 'Follow me please, and - please again - don't lose me.' At first the emphasis lies with the oath of silence of a priest, but then, with a couple of strategic twists, the viewer is lead to a secret romance (only alive in the hearts of Ruth and Michael), wherein the clever police inspector Larrue begins to suffer from tunnel vision, because Killer, I mean Keller, should not be considered innocent for any policeman, or even a laymen (he finds the victim when visiting him by appointment, ánd he lives under the same roof as Michael, where the bloody piece of clothing is found). But no, he is left alone...I'm assuming Hitchcock let things play out this way on purpose, and thus did not just aim for religion to be considered. When the culminating love story does not turn out to exonerate the main suspect, and a rather dry trial follows. During the trial the evil side of Keller is clearly exposed to the viewer, but he does have his motives; he 'wanted to survive' and he 'did it for his dear wife'. But the next moment he shoots his 'dear wife' in the stomach, just to stay in the clear - and so he gives himself away, finally.Maybe it is an awful lot to process for the viewer, but I found it to be intriguing to see this plot develop. And Hitchcock's direction is a great pleasure to watch, as usual. Quebec, Canada offers a great backdrop for this handsome, clever and compelling film.A big 8 out of 10, and I'm already looking forward to watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing But Talky Hitchcock Suspenser Of Priest Who Shields A Killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Logan is a priest in Quebec when the handyman in the church where he works confesses to a murder. To complicate things, Father Logan had a grievance with the dead man. When the police come calling, will he break his confessional vows to save himself ?This is a minor Hitchcock picture I guess, a little too static and talky for me, but it's still a good story with many interesting themes going on. If ever there was a film about guilt it's this one. Father Logan feels guilty for loving Ruth and for not reporting Otto, Ruth feels guilty for ruining her marriage, Otto feels guilty for what he has done and for the actions of his country, Pierre feels guilty for keeping Ruth from the man she loves, and so on. In Hitch's cinema, pretty much everyone is guilty of something - it's our subsequent actions which either redeem or condemn us. It's not that well known that he was raised in a fairly strict Catholic household, although this is one of his few films to explore religion in any detail. Whilst the concepts and conflicts are intriguing, for me the movie is let down by a lack of action - there are lengthy exposition sequences and dull conversations which lead nowhere. Also, Clift's method acting does not really suit Hitch's suspenseful style and it's hard to identify with a man who alternately clams up and protests his innocence. The rest of the cast are pretty solid though. Arguably the best performance is from German actor O.E. Hasse as the killer, whose insistent doubt and fear that Logan will give him away to the police consumes any decency he has left. Hasse's first name was Otto, the same as his character, and he had an interesting if low-key career in both European and American films, notably Jean Renoir's 1962 Le Caporal Epingle. Note also the intense performance by Haas as the wife (named Alma, Hitch's real life wife's name) who ultimately cannot bear the weight of the secret. Technically however, there is a lot to enjoy here. The black-and-white Quebec location photography by Robert Burks is first-rate throughout, and the fine score by Dimitri Tiomkin is probably the best of the four he did for Hitch (although the three other movies are all better). Note the subtle but inspired use of the Latin hymn Dies Irae in the creepy opening church sequence as Logan first confronts Otto. A lesser but thought-provoking exploration of an age-old question - can you keep a secret ? Hitch appears in one of the opening shots for his standard enigmatic cameo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical but underrated Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Alfred Hitchcock is my favourite director of course I would see I Confess. And on the most part I wasn't disappointed, for my tastes Dmitri Tiomkin's music score is too much of a drone(unusual for Tiomkin) but while not among Hitchcock's finest I Confess is what I consider Hitchcock's most underrated(Stage Fright got that honour before I saw this though). We do know who the killer is right at the start and after the first 40 minutes it is somewhat more talky and not quite as suspenseful as other Hitchcocks, there's also the unfamiliarity at the time of the Catholicism codes. It is strikingly shot, helping a lot with the atmosphere, and the settings and costumes are rendered nicely too. The dialogue is talky but is thoughtfully written and gripping, just don't expect the wit of North By Northwest and To Catch a Thief or black humour of The Trouble with Harry and Family Plot(it's not that type of film) and be thankful that it isn't overwrought and stilted like Under Capricorn, Juno and the Paycock and Paradine Case. The story is quite slow but very atmospheric with a suspenseful(in that you wonder whether Logan will betray the confessional's secrets or not) first 40 minutes and reasonably tense climax, like 39 Steps and North By Northwest it is a classic wrong man story with also the idea of guilt seen in Strangers on a Train. The idea of Logan's dilemma throughout the film is one we can relate to, no matter how unfamiliar it was at the time, and it is relevant today I think. Hitchcock's direction is fine, and so are the performances. I can see why people may not like Montgomery Clift's performance, but I loved his brooding intensity and methodical nature for the difficult role he has to do, a similar style of acting to Paul Newman in Torn Curtain but far more convincing. In fact for any of the actors who did any of the brooding intense roles for a Hitchcock film that aren't Cary Grant or James Stewart, I consider Clift one of the better ones. Anne Baxter is very good as a less likable but just as interesting character, while Karl Malden is perfectly cast and Brian Aherne does menacing and sympathetic rather well. All in all, not typical for Hitchcock but it is a great film and his most underrated. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, But Lacks Bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching any Alfred Hitchcock film can be enjoyable when you know something about the director going in. That he got his start as an expressionist filmmaker, that he was a Catholic, and that he had a deep suspicion of law are all points thrashed out enjoyably in "I Confess". It's when you try to watch it as a movie that it feels unsatisfactory.Late one night, Father Logan (Montgomery Clift) sees someone enter his church. It's Keller (O.E. Hasse), an attendant at Logan's rectory. Keller tells Logan he has a confession to make: He just murdered a man. Logan is now bound by the seal of the confessional from telling what he knows, a tough thing as suspicions begin to center around Logan himself.From the opening shot, of a church spire set high atop the city of Quebec, the film makes clear this is going to be a dark and psychological treatment of the sort Hitchcock did in the 1920s with "The Lodger" and "Blackmail". The Catholic angle is presented sincerely, if a bit grimly, making clear the depth of Logan's dilemma. And the authorities are even more overbearing here than usual, pressing not only Logan but his former lover Ruth (Anne Baxter) with cold certainty and some shady tactics.If only the film worked better as a mystery. The film hinges on a pretty goofy coincidence, that the victim of Keller's murder just happened to be blackmailing Ruth about her relationship with Logan. With the notable exception of Karl Malden as a police investigator, the cast seems to be sleepwalking through the film, Clift so woodenly you might call him the Manchurian Prelate. Hearing Keller's confession, he seems almost catatonic, and you get as tired as Malden's character listening to his polite evasions. "There is nothing I can add to what I've already said," he basically says, and seems a bit miffed that it's not enough.The confession is the heart of the film, and at the heart of the film's problem. Like JoeytheBrit and other posters here, I'm struck by the turn in Keller's character, from genuinely remorseful to taunting and even conniving to set Logan up. If he's so depraved, why did he confess in the first place? Understanding Logan's position (he can't rat out Keller no matter how he deserves it because he is now the keeper of Keller's soul), it seems he's still too passive, not giving Keller any grief when it becomes clear Keller is not turning himself in.It's not a bad film, just convoluted and underdeveloped. The exploration of Hitchcock's faith is fascinating stuff, and skillfully presented in an expressionistic way; plenty of shots where crucifixes are seen in shadow, reflection, and profile. The encounters between Keller and Logan in the rectory have a certain power even when (because?) Clift is not projecting very much; as if presenting a kind of Christian existentialist message of a lost shepherd left undeveloped in the script. Cinematographer Robert Burks' work on other Hitchcock films is easier to appreciate, but his contribution relative to everyone else may not have been greater than it was here.A good film to see with this one is Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man", which showcases Catholic guilt in a different but no less complicated light. Both are darker films, but speak to qualities that undergirded Hitchcock's artistic vision and, in more measured doses, lifted his work above that of anyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To what extent will a priest go to protect a man that has told him during confession about a heinous crime he has committed? That is the moral issue in this 1953 picture. The sanctity of the confessional is put to a test in this account of how an honest priest has to pretend he doesn't know anything about the murder of an unscrupulous man when in reality he knows who the real culprit is. Circumstantial evidence piles up against father Michael Logan, who happens to be in a reflective mood on the night the church sexton, Mr. Keller, a German refugee, arrives in a state of panic. Keller wants father Logan to hear his confession in which he discloses his guilt in having murdered the man that used to employ him as a gardener, in order to steal a sum of money that he thinks will help his economic situation.The following morning we watch as Father Logan goes to the house of the murder victim where the police are investigating. Of course, we are taken by surprise knowing he knew before hand what had happened. He has come for another reason, which will be revealed later on. Through a window, Inspector Larrue witness how Logan meets a woman, a Mrs. Ruth Grandfort, and both walk away from crowd that has gathered outside. As it turns out, Logan and the woman have known each other intimately before he became a priest. In flashbacks we are told their story of a love gone sour because Ruth didn't wait for Michael's return from the war. The murdered man turns out to have been blackmailing Mrs. Grandfort, so the dynamics of the situation changes everything for the former lovers that have not done anything wrong. Alfred Hitchcock directed this seldom seen movie that is based on a stage play, probably more of a courtroom drama, although in the adaptation the trial involving Michael Logan is only an afterthought. The director emphasis is on the crime itself and the investigation that follows. Contrary to other Hitchcock films there is no overwhelming suspense since the viewer gets to know all the details. The screenplay was by George Tabori and William Archibald.Montgomery Clift, an otherwise personable actor, was not at his best as the priest at the center of the tragedy. He barely register any emotion, even in the flashbacks when he was still a civilian. Anne Baxter, blond for the occasion, fares better because she has a lot to explain about her relationship with the priest, even though there was never anything to be ashamed of. Karl Malden has a much interesting part to play and brings his usual righteousness to the policeman in charge of the investigation. Brian Aherne made an impression as the D.A. prosecuting the case. German actor O.E. Hasse does a wonderful job with Keller.Hitchcock got an amazing work from his cinematographer, Robert Burks, with his black and white photography of the Quebec City of those years. The music score was by Dmitri Tiomkin. Although not one of Hitchcock's more memorable American films, it merits a viewing by fans of the director. The new DVD is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why isn't this well known?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently rented this one and on first viewing I'm amazed that this is considered a minor work of Hitchcock's...it's not.There's no special efforts or an ironic, memorable way of doing in the bad guy (O. Hasse)...but it's brilliant none the less.Briefly...a curator confesses to his young parish priest (Clift) that he's just committed murder. He's still caught up in the emotion of doing the deed and morally guilt ridden. He knows the priest can't break his vow of confessional secrecy and as the story moves along we find that the killer uses this to implicate the innocent priest...who it turns out is trying to shield a socialite (Baxter) from further scrutiny. It turns out the murdered lawyer has been blackmailing Baxter over an assumed affair (she's willing, the priest isn't) that if exposed could ruin everyone.The priest is charged (Karl Malden is very good) as the detective working the case, tried and acquitted. However, the jury of public opinion convicts the priest anyway. He's cleared as the killer strikes again.In a great climax, the priest publicly confronts the killer and shows all his deep faith, conviction to his vows and courage. Here is where Clift is at his silent best...he's chosen to suffer and even be railroaded into a crime to protect a woman he clearly loves, though he's restricted to act on that love only so far. It's a nice look on how very often things are not as they seem and none of us should pre judge and how often the facts as we know them can be misleading.It's not classic Hitch, but still enters the realm of very good and should be checked out by all Hitchcock fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>German paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Alfred Hitchcock's "I Confess" I had watched a cycle of films dealing with Second World War, its protagonists and its effects. The Hitchcock film apparently has nothing to do with those movies, but the villain being a German servant - whose reasons for living in Canada after the war or his past are never mentioned (was he a member of the Nazi party?) - makes it an interesting artifact, as evidence of the way Germans were still perceived after eight years of the end of the war. As has been said elsewhere, the interest in this minor Hitchcock lays in his handling of morality ? after a play by Paul Anthelme -, but it's fascinating nevertheless. In part, the excellent black-and-white cinematography by Robert Burks makes it a darkly attractive piece, the use of peripeteia as the trigger for third act is moving in its ingenuity and the fact that the priest never mentions why he cannot accuse the culprit creates empathy with anybody raised as a Catholic, as myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging dilemma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this had come from anyone but Hitchcock in 1953 it would have been regarded as a great success. The story has its holes but is generally plausible. Montgomery Clift and most of the other principles are at the very least competent. The photography, as is usual with Hitchcock, is evocative and the black-and-white disk that I saw was superb.But for a number of reasons this didn't get much in the way of positive reviews. It came near the end of a series of critical and popular flops from Hitchcock and I would guess that the critics enjoyed trashing this one. You know, "Lo, how the mighty have fallen." Or Schadenfreude, if you like.Clift, as a priest to whom the murderer has confessed, is himself accused of the crime but can't reveal the true killer's identity because of confessional privilege or whatever it's called. Hitchcock, the product of a stern Catholic upbringing, may have been attracted to the story because of this moral dilemma -- but in fact, the movie is neither that simple nor that simple-minded.Clift plays the kind of reticent guy who might not have squealed on the real killer -- Otto Hasse -- even if he had NOT been a priest. He seems instead almost prompted towards martyrdom. Possibly because he unwittingly boffed his ex-girlfriend who has at the time married to a prominent figure in Quebec's professional and social circles, he may think he has a lot to atone for. You don't HAVE to be Catholic or Jewish to feel guilt, although it probably helps.Okay. It's a good movie. Hitchcock's odd touches are noticeable, but subtle and appropriate. I will give just one example. Hasse's wife is discussing the murder (she knows all about it) with Clift's boss, while Clift is painting the walls in the same room. A dialog takes place between her and Clift's superior. It concerns Clift in some enormously important way, but he continues to paint the walls, saying nothing. Another director would show us a close up of Clift's agonized face, sweating maybe, bursting with a desire to tell all and clear his name. Hitchcock shows us nothing but Clift's back as he placidly applies paint, leaving Clift's reaction to the viewer's imagination.Weaknesses. Otto Hasse as Keller, a displaced German refugee who works for the church, kills a rich man for his money because he is shamed and brutalized by his wife's having to work her fingers to the bone. That would be Dolly Haas, a beautiful woman in middle years giving a sensitive performance. He's genuinely sincere and sobs while he tells her he loves her too much to see her work herself to death. And he's sincere in his remorse, his eagerness to confess to Clift. Then, in the blink of a eye -- almost literally -- he changes into a heavy with no conscience whatever. He actively goes about setting up Clift for a frame and at the end shoots and kills his own wife because he thinks she may squeal on him to the police. The best that can be said about this kind of character development is, "It shouldn't have happened." Anne Baxter is a pretty young woman, Clift's former love interest, and her character is written with sleek ambiguity. But Anne Baxter, a nice lady who made free public service announcements on TV, the granddaughter of Frank Loyd Wright, was never much of an actress with her emphatic and earnest whispery voice. (She was cute ten years earlier in "Crash Dive.") Most movies today don't need nine out of the ten sex bombs on display, but this one needed a little more feminine oomph.Next, I understand that Karl Malden as the detective in charge of the case is immediately suspicious of Clift, whom he's never met before and knows nothing about. But why? He rags him throughout, like Javert in "Les Miserables." What the hell is going on? It's as if there were something personal involved, but no explanation for Malden's zealotry is given or suggested.That gets the weak stuff out of the way. Hitchcock has said that he hated Dmitri Tiomkin's musical score, but the theme is a melancholy and elegiac love tune that brackets Clift's youthful romance with Baxter perfectly. At worst, there's a bit much of it. Should you see it? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Clift shows religion versus crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father Logan (Clift) listens to the confession of a murderer but soon he becomes the prime suspect.I confess is a riveting suspenseful crime drama owing to a tantalizing script, a bravado performance by its central star and some majestic craftsmanship by the master of suspense, who starts the film in a wonderful cameo, no one else does crime quite like Alfred Hitchcock.The opening sees the Brit walking silently through the streets as we flicker through the deserted streets and eventually see one man walking away, silently to the church where Father Logan is and this start sets the picture in motion.The man in question is Otto Keller, a man who confesses to murder and when the body is found and Logan knows the truth he is bound by the rules of the church and we see the police suspicions grow and the script and action getting edgier as the plot builds and builds on glorious suspense.Perhaps comparing this to The Da Vinci Code would do The Hitch an injustice, given the way the Ron Howard picture was rejected. However I enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou fighting religion against crime and this 1953 picture does well to balance it as well. The rules of the church and his belief allows Logan no freedom to express what he really knows but adds an extra dimension to the character's belief and faith, reflecting well the projecting of right and wrong.Montgomery Clift is finely shot as the Priest, giving this belief system a true working through hard expressions when his personal life coincides with the murder case. When things get too personal Logan is quick to step in and the strength of Clift's performance allows us to associate with his uncomfortable position and we are comfortable in routing for him. His rash thinking in the final few scenes is brilliant.I confess has only a few faults. Anne Baxter isn't the most memorable of the Hitchcock femme fatales. Whilst her character is a necessity to the picture her presence is not as strong and over powering as you would hope for. There are moments when the suspense wavers and there is too much drawing of conclusions.Nevertheless the thankful saviour of Hitchcock provides us with still hunger and drive to carry on watching with his truly brilliant eye for detail and momentum to keep things going. As mentioned the opening is well shot and the drastic final acts provide nervousness with a splash of adrenaline and drama to complete a very good picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would never have thought that Alfred Hitchcock had a strict Roman Catholic upbringing, including training with the Jesuits. It's one of the interesting things revealed in a special feature on the DVD release of "I Confess". The movie allows Hitch to explore the sanctity of the Catholic sacrament of Penance, and a priest's holy vow to maintain the confidentiality of the confessional. At times, the way Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) remains true to that vow seems awkward and hesitant, casting suspicion on himself as a murderer, especially when it's revealed that he had a personal relationship with one of the church's parishioners before he became a priest.There was one point when I thought Hitchcock was throwing the audience a curve when the real murderer Keller (O.E. Hasse) taunts Logan with - "You can't tell them as long as you are a priest, can you?" It struck me at that point that the look on Logan's face might have had him consider giving up the priesthood, adding even more torment to his dilemma. Of course that was not to be, and rightly, as it would have been a cheap way out. In fact the revelation of Keller's guilt could probably not have been handled in any other way than the manner in which it occurred. But if Keller's conscience couldn't convince him that he was doomed to hellfire for the initial murder, and then setting up a priest for it, how was he going to reconcile himself with the Lord for killing his own wife? Cleverly, Hitchcock keeps the viewer's attention shifting in different directions; when Ruth Grandfort states to Father Logan 'We're safe" after learning of Villete's murder, one imagines all kinds of clandestine intimacies between the two. The revelation of the back story clears Logan on that count, but he still remains on the hook for the crime as long as he maintains his priestly obligations.This would not be the only film in which director Hitchcock would explore Catholic themes, his 1956 film "The Wrong Man" would make use of overt religious symbolism in telling the true story of a man accused of a robbery and how his faith was a factor in exposing the real criminal. Both movies are among Hitch's less well known, and hence under-appreciated gems. Both capture a noirish feel that isn't generally a characteristic of his American films, with a sense of uncertainty and discomfort that pervades throughout. Both are recommended, Hitchcock fan or not.While watching, keep an eye out for the poster promoting Humphrey Bogart's "The Enforcer" at the movie house. It too happens to be a murder mystery where we know the identity of the killer up front, as the story's protagonist searches for a way to expose him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Confess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film listed in a television schedule, it was mentioned as being a "forgotten gem" from the Master of Suspense director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and being a big fan of his I was not going to miss it. Basically in Quebec City, late one night in a his local church devout Catholic priest Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) has a visit from exiled German Otto Keller (O.E. Hasse) who wants to confess a sin, and he confesses that he has murdered lawyer Monsieur Villette (Ovila Légaré). He was hired by the man as a gardener, and he killed him to steal $2,000, while dressed up, and arrogant Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden) is told by two youths that they witnessed a man dressed as a priest coming out of the victim's house. With this information Logan is wrongly accused of the crime, and he cannot tell the police what he was told in confession because it would break his confidentiality promise (before God I suppose), but Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter) wants to help him, knowing he is not capable of such act, and she gives him an alibi, including that Villette was blackmailing her. This cannot stop him from having to go to court and prove his innocence, while still not telling the truth to the authorities, he is not found guilty by the jury, and Keller returns and is on the run with a gun, of course he gets shot, but he is forgiven by Logan before dying. Also starring Brian Aherne as Willy Robertson, Dolly Haas as Alma Keller, Roger Dann as Pierre Grandfort and Charles Andre as Father Millars. The acting is fine, the innocent man accused format is common and works well for Hitchcock, I sort of understand why this film was not highly seen by audiences or praised by critics well, but it does have some interesting stuff, especially the last moments, and it's not a bad drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Locations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film - have seen it many times and have screened it for my friends. I live in Montreal, but am currently based in Québec City where the film was shot. Just the other day I finally located the church where the film was shot - it is a very small church actually and it is amazing how Hitchcock makes it seem so grand. I was shown the sacristy too, where another memorable shot of Montgomery Clift was taken. The church is the same but for some frescoes which were painted after the movie was made, with the movie money Hitchcock payed to the church according to the guide who showed me around.There is another memorable shot, of the Basilique Notre Dame in the old section of town - a beautiful shot of Clift seeking guidance.And of course the Château Frontenac - a magnificent hotel which plays an important part in the movie. Hitchock's movies are full of locations which figure prominently in his movies, and I Confess is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real let down compared to other Hitchcock films of the period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say this much ado about nothing, because murder is certainly not nothing. But compared to the pompous musical background, one would think this was the most significant story in the planet's history. If it was an actor going to such extremes, we would accuse him or her of overacting.That was the first hint to me that this was not going to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's great films. In fact, it may have been his worst film since the 1930s (until the cheap-thrill ecstasy of "Psycho" and "The Birds"). Of course, to a devout Catholic, the story may have been far more fascinating than it was to the rest of the viewing public. Here and there there is inane dialog that wasted my time. And some of the photography was downright lousy.That's not to say this is a bad film. It's actually fairly good...but if you didn't know it was a Hitchcock film, you wouldn't think it was. After all, we know who the murderer is from the beginning. So there's little suspense. It's just a question of how the priest will handle a murder confession...particularly when it indirectly involves him in a love triangle that makes him a suspect.Ironically, the best thing about the film is the acting by Montgomery Clift...and Hitchcock reportedly hated Clift's method acting style. The other performances are good, as well. Anne Baxter is good as the love interest. Karl Malden has a fair good role as a police inspector. Brian Aherne is excellent as the prosecutor, and it made me wonder why I am not more familiar with his acting. Roger Dann is fairly good as the husband of Bancroft. Dolly Haas is satisfactory as the wife of the murderer. I'm not so sure that O.E. Hasse's performance as the murderer is up to snuff. His character is such a coarse man, but I almost felt this was a case of overacting.I have watched this film twice now, and I doubt I'll watch it again. And that's a good example of why I believe this film is not up to Hitchcock's usual standards. I have quite a few Hitchcock films on my DVD shelf, and every once in a while I'll pull one down and enjoy watching it again. This one wouldn't lead me back again. It's a good, but average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated Hitchcock masterpiece that shouldn't be ignored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time Alfred Hitchcock shot this movie, he already had a really strong career, with lots of great and excellent films, but it was after this one that he made his best-known masterpieces that became all-time classics, with the exception of 'Rebecca' and 'Strangers On a Train', that came before.This movie begins with lots of shots of Quebec, the town where it's set. Then it shows a dead man inside a house. Right after it, we see another man going into a church and confessing the murder to a priest. But the plot really begins when the priest is considered the prime suspect of the murder, and he can't tell the police who did it because of the church's principles. The plot itself is already very interesting, ans it's so well-written that doesn't make the viewer bored at all, with great character development and a few clever twists, it's but Alfred Hitchcock's directing makes it even more interesting, with some clever shots at interesting angles, and a film-noir style to it.Montgomery Clift stars here as the priest. Even though he is, in my opinion, a too good-looking priest, and that feels weird, if you can get past that, you can see how powerful is his acting here. Karl Maden also gives a nice acting as the police inspector, but it's Anne Baxter that isn't good. Although her character is important to the story, she feels weird and out of place.This movie also suffers from the same problem as many movies of its time: because of the Hayes Code, they were forced to chance the movie's ending from the one featured on the original play in which the movie was based on. If it had stick to the original ending, it would be much better. The other problem I have with this picture is the two major flaws that bothered me. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but anyone can see it, and one of the then is the ending itself.Overral, this is a nice directed Hitchcock film, with a clever plot, but with a weird ending. It also features nice interpretations by Karl Maden and Montgomery Clift, but Anne Baxter screws it. In my opinion, it is much better than Hitchcock's so-called better 'Strangers On a Train'. I wouldn't put it on a list of my favorite movies of the master, but it's far from the worst ones.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seal of Confession of the Catholic Church</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Quebec, the exiled German Otto Keller (O.E. Hasse) confesses to the Catholic Priest Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) late night in the church that he has just killed the lawyer Villette that employed him as gardener to steal US$ 2,000.00 dressed like a priest. Meanwhile the arrogant Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden) that is in charge of the investigation discovers two teenagers that have witnessed the killer dressed like a priest sneaking out Villette's house and walking to the church. When Larrue sees Father Logan talking to Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter) nearby the crime scene, he summons them to a hearing in the precinct. Ruth provides an alibi to Father Logan telling that they met each other during the night. Further, she also tells that they had a past together before the war and also that Villette was blackmailing her due to a secret meeting she had with Father Logan, when they spent the night together. Father Logan keeps the secret of the confession, but Ruth unintentionally provides the motive for the murder and the prosecutor Willy Robertson (Brian Aherne) uses it in court. "I Confess" is a dramatic story based on the seal of confession of the Catholic Church, where the priests are not allowed to reveal what they have heard during confession as part of their vows. Father Logan knows who the killer is but he takes the blame for the murder based on this principle. The cast has excellent performances highlighting Montgomery Clift and Karl Malden. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the very beginning walking on the top of the staircase. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "A Tortura do Sil?ncio" ("The Torture of the Silence")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Logan's Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cahiers du Cinema crowd loved Alfred Hitchcock. Upon release, Eric Rohmer declared Hitchcock's "I Confess" a "modern masterpiece". Claude Chabrol proclaimed the film "majestic" and "a message to the soul". But there were detractors. To Francois Truffaut, Hitchcock himself would reveal that he found the film to be "a heavy handed failure". Godard thought likewise, and compared "I Confess" unfavourably to Hitchcock's "The Wrong Man". Decades later Godard would dismiss both films before renouncing Christ-Hitchcock altogether. George Tabori, the Hungarian born scriptwriter who worked extensively on the film's screenplay, was similarly underwhelmed. "I was never a particular fan of Hitchcock's work," he says, "and Hitch just wasn't interested in my ideas." Those ideas - "I Confess" was originally a socio-political parable for McCarthyite terror and state silencings ? bored Hitchcock, who "just wanted to entertain".Hitchcock was a Jesuit-educated Catholic. Some writers read his countless "wrong man" movies as being infused with Catholic guilt. Others are adamant that Hitch kept religion and personal beliefs outside his films. Regardless, along with "The Wrong Man", "I Confess" is Hitchcock's most overtly religious picture. Both films feature wrongfully persecuted Christ-men who stoically absorb the sins/persecutions of others and both are unconventionally pious/reverent in tone, despite being structured as noirish melodramas. Though many compare both to the works of Bresson and Dreyer, Hitchcock's duology manages the odd task of being both spiritual and kinetic. "I Confess" pops like popular entertainment and sizzles like a pulpy crime movie.The plot? Montgomery Cliff plays Father Logan, a stone-faced priest who hears a confession of murder. As Catholic customs prevent Logan from revealing to the authorities the identity of this confessor, Logan remains silent even when he himself becomes a chief murder suspect. Local authorities and an ex lover all believe Logan to be guilty, and even threaten the young priest with the death penalty, but Logan remains steadfast in his faith. He refuses to tarnish the sanctity of confession. He assumes the killer's guilt. "I Confess" is packed with criss-crossing confessions. Killers confess to priests, priests to the police, wives to ex lovers, women to husbands, husbands to women, couples to detectives etc etc. And sitting calmly in the middle of all this noise is Cliff. Hollywood's original method actor (before Marlon Brando), Cliff internalises his character almost completely. His Logan is a seething cauldron on the inside, but blank on the outside. Of course Hitchcock hated working with method actors. Squarely old school, he more or less viewed actors as but movable scenery. But Cliff was right for this part, even if he remains an anomaly in Hitchcock's filmography.Whilst Christian iconography is scattered about - Logan's given a narrative arc which mirrors Christ's, complete with public floggings, resurrections, redemptions, martyrdom, Roman courts and Pontius Pilates ? the film's subplots are largely psycho-sexual. Rather than divine intervention it is ordinary human conscience which saves Logan. Elsewhere Logan's ex-lover believes the priest's silence to be a gesture of sacrificial love directed toward her and her husband. This tortures her. Eventually she comes to the conclusion that Logan doesn't love her; he loves God. Other subplots plainly state that Logan becomes a priest after the guilt of an adulterous affair. Sexual anxiety thus essentially pushes him into celibacy, Logan taking on the killer's guilt as a kind of penance. The killer is himself mirrored to Logan, both men forsaking God for the love of a woman. The film then ends with the dying killer stretching his hand out to Logan and asking for forgiveness. But is he asking a fellow human to unburden his own conscience, or his priest for absolution?Though based on a play by Paul Anthelme, "I Confess" moves like the best of Hitchcock's films. Hitchcock's camera zips and glides, every shot extraordinary, immaculately framed and interesting. It was largely his experience directing silent thrillers which informed Hitchcock's later "talkies". They instilled in him a sense of visual economy and speed, which meant that Hitchcock was an expert at trimming films of fat long before synchronised sound became the norm. Unsurprisingly, much of the dialogue in "I Confess" screenplay was eventually jettisoned by Hitch. He loved momentum and tried to boil things down to the bare minimum wherever possible. This irked his screenwriters. He didn't care.Other interesting things are scattered about. Early scenes recall "The Third Man" and early expressionists, opening and closing scenes are reversed, implying a "drift" away from rather than toward Christ/church, and Hitchcock mockingly surrounds his silent priest with characters who each achieve relief upon a different confession. Elsewhere a priest's constantly collapsing bicycle speaks of Cliff's own anxieties, competing obligations and inability to maintain balance and of course there's the famous "conversation on the river ferry/boat sequence", which would become a cliché in later crime movies. On the downside, the film sports three or four BIG SILLY MOMENTS (crazy mobs, a killer who goes nuts etc) and begins to eventually succumb to thriller conventions.8/10 ? Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few words about Anne Baxter. Considering she stepped into the part at the last minute (replacing Swedish star Anita Bjork), Baxter gives a remarkably good performance. She doesn't seem ideally cast - especially opposite Clift. It's hard to say why. She seems somewhat old, for him - though she was in fact a few years younger. But it's a very fine job, nonetheless. Especially in her long monologue/flashback, in which we learn just how emotionally invested she is in the memory of a relationship that was basically flawed. She plays this perfectly. She's a person of high social standing who basically has to "undress in public" - make a rather lurid confession in a police station, about a premarital involvement with a man who has since become a priest. And her husband is an important public servant in a Catholic province, whose career may be shattered by her revelations. It's a many-layered scene, one of the best in the film. And very much a Hitchcock scene - for those who think this film is not typical Hitchcock. Remember how he enjoyed seeing the elegant Mrs. Paradine reduced to a prisoner of the police. Here we see something even more raw - much better done. It's rather sick how Hitchcock enjoyed depicting people shamed and humiliated, but he did such a great job of it! And he instinctively knew how gripped we would be by it. What's also very interesting is the way Hitchcock depicts human passion - Ruth Grandfort's , Keller's, even Inspector Larue's - as misguided, even distasteful. While the dispassionate nature of the priest, his asceticism, distance, spiritual approach to life - seems to be celebrated.But then Logan seems special, even for a priest - easygoing, kind, tolerant - from the start. This is set up in the first scenes at the rectory when we see his interactions with a rather waspish pastor and an absent-minded young priest. Clearly, all priests are not created equal. The film is not about what any priest would do, in Logan's situation, or all priests - just what Logan would do. Just because priests are not supposed to reveal the secrets of the confessional, doesn't mean none would, when pressed. It's Logan who wouldn't.Clift is perfect in this part. I can't imagine the film's premise succeeding with any other actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Under-appreciated Hitchcock Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I freely admit I am still learning about Hitchcock and his films. I am generally impressed, sometimes more than others. "I Confess" ranks high on my Hitchcock list, with the outstanding Montgomery Clift as Father Michael William Logan, and the under-utilized Anne Baxter as Ruth Grandfort. Even Karl Malden (whom I know best from "Cat O' Nine Tails") appears as Inspector Larrue.The directing is fantastic, with cinematography that puts some scenes at striking angles, and tends to put crosses in plain view even when that is not the focus of the scene. The idea of religion is constantly in the forefront. This, in turn, is the plot's genius: a priest becomes suspected of murder because he cannot say who the real killer is -- the killer has confessed, thus striking Logan to silence as part of his priestly duties.Clift is a great lead, with an imposing stature. He has something of a pretty-boy look, like a chiseled male model, not what we think of when we think of priests. But that is beside the point -- his acting and ability to lead carry the film flawlessly.</fullReview>

Although his character is rather reticent, Clift does a good job of conveying his thoughts through his facial expressions, particularly his penetrating gaze. Baxter is effective as the woman he loved before taking his vows. Rounding out the fine cast are Malden as a dogged police detective and Aherne as a prosecutor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Hitchcock Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's lesser known works, yet certainly a worthy piece is the 1953 mystery suspense "I Confess". Released just a year before the evergreen "Dial 'M' for Murder", and coming between Gregory Peck's strong roles in "Spellbound" and "The Paradine Case" (1945 and 1947), and Jimmy Stewart's stylish performances in "Rear Window", "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "Vertigo" (1954, 1956 and 1958), heart throb Montgomery Clift slides nicely into the lead role as a priest who hears the confession of a murderer who, though repentant, has no desire to pay for his crime. Unable to tell anyone of this in accordance with the Catholic priesthood, Father Michael is soon suspected of the very criminal act he must involuntarily conceal.If the intriguing storyline, based upon Paul Anthelme's play, isn't enough to satisfy you, the screenplay (from George Tabori and William Archibald) also contains a fascinating subplot involving an old flame of the padre's, and the plot thickens when the lady (Anne Baxter) is implicated in the murder.Hitchcock never milks the plot completely of the tension it holds, but still allows proceedings to develop smoothly, while never wasting the Canadian locale. Symbolic imagery is cleverly put to use also, with some telling shots of "One Way" signs at the beginning of the film indicating the inevitable course our murderer is fated to take.Montgomery Clift and the supporting cast, including Karl Malden, are strong, with Bruce Ahern deserving a special mention for his at times menacing performance. Rounded off by efficient editing (Rudi Fehr) and effective Art Direction (Edward S. Haworth).Sunday, November 13, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

The acting is of the highest order with Clift,Baxter,Haas,and Aherne with Malden making a superb cast coupled with an effort to bring realism by filming, albeit perhaps too staged on the streets of Quebec city. Maybe in those days the ability to do so was some what limited due to the interest of passers by who today would not be too concerned. A story with depth told in a solid fashion.

		<shortDescription>Monty gets a raw deal (with thanks to R.E.M.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As has been mentioned already by other "posters" "I Confess" remains a largely neglected work in Hitchcock's oeuvre. Filmed in 1953 before the explosion of colour movies Hitch commenced from 1954 - 1959 "Rear Window" - to "North by North-West" (bar "The Wrong Man" which shrewdly and aptly used B &amp; W to authenticate its documentary approach), it can seem stolid and dated. The religious symbolism is perhaps overplayed at times and one has to suspend belief at the massive coincidences which Hitch asks us to swallow (Keller kills Villette at exactly the time that Clift and Baxter's characters want him out of the way to stop his blackmailing) but there are some typical flourishes by the Master - particularly Baxter's slow motion descent to meet Clift in her flashback recollection and the half face close up of Karl Malden, here patrolling the Streets of Quebec as an inquisitive police detective, as he catches sight of Clift and Baxter meeting outside the murder scene. I also enjoyed the scene where Keller shoots his wife in the crowd outside the courtroom where Clift has just been acquitted - it was reminiscent of a similar scene in "Foreign Correspondent". The film moves slowly at times and does show its theatrical origins (like "Dial M for Murder" soon afterwards) but there's a good murder mystery here all the same and it reaches a satisfactory conclusion. The playing by the leads is uniformly good - occasionally you can see Clift acting as he over emotes his dilemma (Hitchcock was never comfortable with the Actors' Studio "Method-acting" of which Clift, and Malden come to that, were exponents), but he is believable in an unbelievable part (just what turned him to the church anyway?). Anne Baxter looks lovely throughout and acts her part with sympathy and a degree of realism in what is a stylised production. The location shots of Quebec are a treat too. I actually think the film would benefit from colourisation, presuming that the B &amp; W filming at the time was for cost reasons. Not quite a neglected gem then but an engrossing and rewarding watch nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Confession: This is actually quite a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'I Confess' hasn't been received very well critically over the years, but it's actually quite a good Hitchcock offering, and definitely worth your time. While not up there with his best efforts, this is an interesting little sleeper that was an unexpected treat for me to come across in my viewing of Hitchcock's works.The Master Of Suspense got to work here with two of the luminaries of Method Acting in the 50's, leading man Montgomery Clift and supporting actor Karl Malden. Clift turns in a very good performance as the priest, always convincing in the role. Hitch apparently was not a fan of 'The Method', but Clift's projected emotional torment conveyed through his wonderfully expressive eyes and face definitely benefits the film. Anne Baxter (with dyed blonde hair, a change from her 'All About Eve' role) is also good as the old flame of the priest, Ruth, who continues to love him even after he has taken his religious vows and she has married someone else.Interesting exploration of religious themes here by Hitch. It's a tasty little premise: The priest who hears a murder confession cannot tell the police what he has heard, thus he ends up a suspect in the case because he cannot provide an alibi. Nice camera-work in many scenes, with the dark photography employed in many scenes suiting this moody production. This is not a murder mystery of sorts, as we find out early on who is the actual killer. It is more of a psychological thriller, one in which we can view the actual killer, German refugee Keller start to crack under the strain of his guilt. Logan, the priest, also begins to have doubts over himself and his profession. This is an slightly unusual Hitchcock film, but it works very well.This was filmed in Quebec, and makes a fresh change from the usual American settings of Hitch's movies. In many ways, it has that feel and look of neo-realism to it. Hitch combines well with Clift to produce a very good work that is highly underrated.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Early(ish) Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great unexpected find discovered under a pile of rubbish films in the local shop.It seems the film has taken a bit of a kicking, apparently even from Hitch himself. However, I think this is unwarranted. I thought the central idea for the story was great - full of dilemmas and moral questions around which events were entwined, which we can now see as classic Hitchcock. Themes a plenty centred on devotion to duty (Logan was first a soldier then a priest) propel the story forward and the underlying question of "will he blab or not" hold the suspense.Then come the touches of the master. Although suffering from what appears to me a lack of confidence which was clearly not significant later on, leading to a lack of consistency in the directing, there are some cracking images. Favourite was Monty struggling up a hill in front of a church and an outline of Christ carrying the cross. Monty on his 40 days in the wilderness. Other instances have been mentioned elsewhere on the reviews for this film.However, I did have some difficulties. The film lacked pace in places giving the viewer time to focus on the improbability of the basic premise. And then we come to Monty. This was the first time I've seen him in a film and I thought he was too stilted, as wooded as a wooden table. Finally, Hitchcocks on screen walk on, which always keep me watching keenly (is that why the sly old dog does that) came much too early.Incidentally, other reviewers refer to Rope as "underrated". Puzzling. I always thought that has been rightly recognised as a landmark film and is high on most lists of Hitchcock's best</fullReview>

This was not the usual Clift vehicle, but he does bring that dark and troubled face to the role. Only Clift can make what he does haunting and eloquent. As a priest, well, I don't know. Supporting him in this interesting movie of murder and confession, are Anne Baxter, as a blonde (Hitch has to have his blonde leading lady), Karl Malden and Brian Aherne. Excellent in supporting roles, are Dolly Haas and O. E. Hasse. The photography deserves special mention, shot in Canada, with the dark shadows of the church and the cobblestone streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Brooding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mood of the film is best summed up in one word: troubled. And there has been no American actor to rival Montgomery Clift in that department, with the notable exception of James Dean. Clift is however a far more complex screen personality, and "I Confess", though generally termed as one of Hitchcock's "lesser" films (no bad thing that though)is one of Clift's best. It is sad that the two men only made the one film together. The darker side of Hitchcock would have found an excellent protagonist in Clift's anguishing persona had they dared to explore further those disturbing areas that Hitchcock mostly only suggests at. "I Confess" is a straight-forward dilemma between the vows of silence a priest must uphold, and the desire for truth. The dilemma of the film is also one between the veracity of Clift's faith and his experiences of secular life, and it is this particular aspect of the film's theme which is both interesting and unresolved. Though Clift's faith is unbending, and his integrity is unblemished through his determination not to reveal the identity of the murderer, it is of particular annoyance not to be given any insight into the background and process of his finding his calling. We merely learn, through a series of flashbacks, that he becomes ordained and is suddenly a practicing priest. The nature of the aspiring love affair is merely sketched, and never fully examined. Clift's character is throughout the film almost annoyingly emotionless -as if he has become a man who has either repressed his feelings, or made to fear them. This is another interesting facet of his personality that we would so much like to learn more of. The story itself may not be the most satisfying amongst Hitchcock's production, but the complexity and ambiguities of the central character make this film a rewarding experience. As in most Hitchcock films there are numerous delights in the supporting cast. Karl Malden is a case in point. His portrayal of a straight-forward police detective is in sharp contrast to Clift, and their scenes together have a streak of realism about them that is not often found in Hitchcock -knowing the starting point of each man we can sympathize with both. The music score of the film is somewhat special -it seems not to reflect or underscore many of the scenes, but lifts them up to a higher -though at times melodramatic- plane. It gives the film an ethereal or dreamlike quality that suggests the theme of yearning in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admit to Your Fault...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Drama is life with the dull bits left out" (Alfred Hitchcock) I admit to having selected I CONFESS as one of the first films by 'Master of Suspense' to comment on for several reasons. Apart from its unique atmosphere (which is a clear result of Hitchcock's experience at Ufa and his encounter with German Expressionism), I CONFESS is, perhaps, his most underrated movie. Although it offers engrossing cinematic merits along with the director's typical hallmarks, great character study, top notch performances, haunting art direction, unforgettable climax, and style resembling the director's visual mind, it has, for years, been profoundly marked by politically correct 'seal of negligence.' Nevertheless, the unforgettable moments of the movie highlight its subject matter created upon realistic details, little units that human perception relies on - thoughts built upon contrasts - best resembled in 'light vs. darkness' concept - something almost medieval. For can flowers being held in the hands of 'unworthy ones' carry certain power to result in bringing the truth out?Based on a 1902 play "Nos deux consciences" by Paul Anthelme, a clerical protagonist in his cassock Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) calls our attention to the Catholic context. Yes, the Catholic seal of confession seems to be at the core of both the title and the story. Though not a very popular context these days, the confessional is the spot where it all ends and begins. For can we find more absorbing secrets revealed within a face to face whisper elsewhere? A thrilling story, in such a context, develops in an overwhelming manner. The guilty one admits to his crime and all torments are put on the shoulders of an innocent priest (the famous 'transference of guilt' motif). That does not merely lead to the dilemma whether the priest breaks the seal of confession or remains loyal and rather sacrifices himself...but an in-depth insight into storytelling.Pay attention to details, single movements, spontaneous situations that reveal everything about the characters... Consider the striking shadows and human mortality (medieval 'Memento Mori') revealed in single images like leaves falling in wind behind the window. Moreover, the city of Quebec with its Château Frontenac hits the right note for suspense giving another medieval flair to a story set in North America. Along with haunting score by Dimitri Tiomkin which incorporates certain classical and choral tunes into the scenes, everything appears to be quite a complex entertainment and a milestone of Hitchcock's art of style. Breathtaking emotions go with radiant cinematography. The film's artistic merits truly hold the hypnotic power to make viewers hook on being absorbed in following the plot. But it is not only Hitchcock and his crew who deserve praise but "the whole thing scrupulously acted by a tightly professional cast," (Bosley Crowther).MONTGOMERY CLIFT embodies the movie's psychological vs. theological context. Father Logan is a very positive, a typical Hitchcock character of innocence who is sucked into a scheme he knows nothing of and finds himself on the verge of destruction. His enthusiasm directed towards being with people inevitably resorts to silent torments of soul. Actor Karl Malden memorably referred to his performance saying that "his ability to project mood and a held-back strength is quite extraordinary." That intriguing combination is clearer as the storyline develops, esp. after the flashback sequence (and the tantalizing dreams of youth) when we compare between what he used to be and what he is like. His torments, however, are not defeated by resignation but "his constant forward movement" (Ken Mogg) emphasizes the character's readiness to face the future. Montgomery Clift makes I CONFESS not merely a story of suspense but a complex human drama with the subject matter even more absorbing nowadays. Yes, in him 'drama is life...' life of contradictions where sweet illusion blends with trauma, tension with relief, courage with fear, fulfilling oneself with 'lost paradise.' Predominantly, sex would blend with violence...but not here. Sweet charm blends with childish woos. More serious stuff comes with later movies by Hitchcock.ANNE BAXTER cast by Master of Suspense as the last minute (the Swedish actress Anita Bjork was to take the part), she portrays a complex female character. In fact, as Ruth Grandfort, she combines suspicion elements with pure soap opera backbone. In the flashback sequence, she is supposed to be the textbook example of romantic love, a youthful doll who comes down the staircase accepting no efforts of life, who 'thinks primarily of herself, no war' no duty of her beloved one. She is, conclusively, egocentric. Later, she does not change much except the tension of situations makes her say 'WE are free' rather than 'I am free.' O. E. HASSE as a well known German actor (keeping in mind the film 1950s' background reality) makes an underlining reference to WWII. His guilt is confessed, and yet, the conscience sufferings, torments and dilemmas are transferred to the innocent character. In that way, the innocent suffer. We dislike Otto Keller, we like Father Logan (ambiguous pairing of two homosexuals). And yet, within Keller's relation to his wife Alma, we see him as a totally different person. This leads to a desperate search for ambiguity of guilt-atonement concept. What is his punishment in that relation? On the verge of despair near the finale, he highlights a powerful undertone of severe justice that wins over indulgent justifications. Mind you Hitchcock's wife's name was also Alma and she contributed to his movies. In relation to his wife, the director addresses yet another aspect: marriage and the bond that makes people keep together.Truffaut in his interview with Bert Cardullo said about the lesson he had learned from Hitchcock: "You work hard to create an emotion, and once the emotion is created, you should work even harder to maintain it." I CONFESS is one of his emotional films where the director builds an extraordinary relation with viewers, not necessarily with his fans who should admit to their fault of ignoring this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done Hitchcock mystery...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 12/2/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): **SPOILERS** Well-done Hitchcock mystery involving a priest hearing a secret confession of murder and the events that occur after this. At times, this is more of a moral drama than a murder mystery but finishes in true murder mystery fashion which in my opinion is the only real downfall to the movie. What I mean by this is that because the movie finishes to an actual good guy wins/ bad guy loses conclusion it becomes more of a typical whodunit than a unique moral drama. This is only a small misnomer in what is otherwise a twist-filled Hitchcock story that is well played by the stars but again the direction always seems to shine with Hitchcock. The wonderful combination of emotion, music, camerawork and dialogue makes this a somewhat lessor known masterpiece by the man Hitchcock who is seen in a cameo if you look really closely at a scene with people coming out of a church. The master of suspense spins another one with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite not being "Hitchcockian" enough for some, this is an excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For lovers of Hitchcock's usual types of movies, this might have been a bit of a disappointment, but I wasn't at all upset that the movie was so different--after all, it was still an excellent film. Instead of the usual murders and suspense, the focus of the film is on the priest who receives the confession of a murderer. The priest is in a bind because when he himself is charged with the killing, he cannot divulge what he heard in confession. The priest was played by Montgomery Clift and his performance was more restrained than usual--and this worked well for this role. In some ways, while the usual tension was not there, the film made up for it in the cinematography. The film looked a lot like a Film Noir movie in style and camera-work--Hitchcock set the mood beautifully. Also, having filmed this in Quebec, it looks very European--a nice touch.So, provided you don't start the film with expectations that it's like any of his other films (except for THE WRONG MAN, to which it has some similarity), you'll enjoy the film due to excellent writing, direction and acting. An excellent lesser-known Hitchcock film.FYI--For those who love to spot Hitchcock in his films, he appears at the beginning--walking past the stairs. Since he's so far away, it's VERY hard to spot him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly interesting, but strange...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see "I confess" until much later in life than I saw Hitchcock's other films, so I don't know what my earlier impressions would have been. (I think it would have been very confusing as a child). As it is, I was very surprised to see them go all the way to Quebec, for a lot of location footage, only to have a rather thin, strange tale based on certain Roman Catholic rituals &amp; beliefs.There is very little suspense, since we are shown right at the start, who the real killer is. The confession ends abruptly, so we don't know if he received absolution or not. The implication seems to be that he received absolution for his sin, but that would not have been proper without him having to turn himself into the police. As the story unfolds Father Logan seems to be a rather strange man who choose the priesthood, for some unknown reason. (I could speculate on why, but I'll be kind and refrain from any comments on that matter. Let's just say that there was a lot more similarity between the real life Montgomery Cliff, and the fictional Father Michael Logan than anybody realized at the time!)This film reminds me of the later "Vertigo". A thin, contrived story was drawn up, as an excuse to go on location; but in the end, all you are left with is some nice scenery &amp; music, and a few good performances. Hitchcock refuses to give little, if any, instant gratification, and the ending especially is too subtle, especially for non-Catholics. The audience simply "doesn't get it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely interesting Hitchcock crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The narrative may seem very obvious. Super-handsome Montgomery Clift playing the reverent priest, Anne Baxter playing the lady in a love story setting up the classically impossible relationship between a man of the clergy and a modern woman, and a bit of story to buckle it all up. But no.This is a genuinely compelling crime, that keeps the viewer constantly interested in what the movie-makers have in store for them as the plot keeps moving forward with new elements to a very tension-laded core, that just seems to be heading more and more towards a breach of the threshold. Clift is very plain in his acting and puts in just the right, convincing performance as the lead role, but yet the movie is not just only him. It is rich with characters, with their own intentions and interest in the case, each pulling in a certain direction. It makes for a smooth viewing, and never turns indulgent of the love affair that is, yet, at the very center of the case. Strongly written, well directed Hitchock with a good casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silent, powerful story about a man's struggling with personal growth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the top critic mentioning there is NOTHING WRONG with the movie to make it unpopular.I found there are very apparent, simple reasons WHY.First, this whole story is about silence. Silence of struggling inner voices, silence of powerful, self-devouring emotions. But it is all that silence that makes the MAIN THEME - CONFESSION of deep down personal hurts valuable. it's exactly this narration that helps to deliver the the best. But people don't like that. There is no twisting, dramatic big scenes. No drama, no conflicts spoken out = not appealing? But many important concepts portrayed through that slowly unraveling, distressing storyline.Looking forward to some excitement? That's why you don't UNDERSTAND it.Second, oh gosh, why do you expect to see the same plot line for EVERY movie just because it comes from THAT SAME producer? Why don't we look at movie by itself, not comparing with the other SAME STUFF? The WHOLE POINT OF THE MOVIE IS NOT SUSPENSE. The suspenseful tone is the narrative device that conveys the core of the story, but NOT THE END GOAL. If you were expecting a murder case suspense from this, then you are LOOKING AT THE WRONG THING from it. People just miss the central thing of it.The central message nourished by powerful dichotomies, the artistry of picture, the strong performances, are all components that make this movie great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>seal of confession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Confess" is a Hitchcock film from 1953 film starring Montgomery Clift, Anne Baxter, Brian Aherne, Karl Malden, and O.E. Hasse.The film is based on a French story, Nos Deux Consciences and takes place in Quebec City, Canada. It concerns a priest (Clift) honoring the seal of confession, even as he stands accused of murder.O.E. Hasse plays the church caretaker. He takes the priest's cassock and commits murder while wearing it. Then he goes to confession. The story is complicated by a past relationship the priest had with a woman (Anne Baxter) from his home town. This is a minor Hitchcock film, but still quite good, with excellent performances. Clift gives a very internalized performance, so that he doesn't give anything away to the detective (Malden).Hitchcock would tell Clift to look up or look to his right, and later insert what Clift was looking at. Of course, this wasn't enough for Clift, nor should it be for any actor. He wanted to know what he was supposed to see! It drove Hitchcock crazy.Everyone is excellent in the movie. The seal of confession has long been a bedrock of plotting since forever. The murderer knew what he was doing, as the church believes it is better for a killer to go free than break the seal. It's a sacred trust, and the murderer is all the more evil for realizing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Hitchcock drama with love, suspense and moral dilemmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the concept of this movie. That someone confesses to a priest (Michael Logan played by Montgomery Clift) about a murder and then the priest feels compelled to honour his vows and say nothing to the police. It creates a lot of tension. You can see it begin to weigh down on the priest. Surely he is becoming conflicted about what the right thing to do is.Logan ends up becoming a main suspect through some unfortunate details. A couple of girls saw a priest out at night. He happened to have a meeting with the victim and didn't want to reveal what its purpose was. His reluctance to answer questions makes him more suspicious in the eyes of the police. We learn about an interesting back-story involving a love triangle which Anne Baxter tells to the police in order to save Logan. She is upset to find that her words are being twisted to supply a motivation for Logan committing the murder. She reveals personal things and it all backfires.This was a movie where everyone's motivations made sense to me. I understood their choices. Nobody is flat-out stupid. Perhaps they are stubborn or short-sighted but that's an accurate insight into human nature. The villain becomes less sympathetic over time and yet Logan is so righteously unwilling to compromise his beliefs. It does remind me a bit of how Darth Vader gets a cute redemption in Return of the Jedi but none of the other henchmen or innocent victims get any such attention. Perhaps Logan realises he made a mistake by the end, it's up for debate.In any case, I greatly enjoyed the acting and the story of I Confess. I liked most of the characters and empathised with their situation. The ending is suspenseful and satisfying. It raises some moral questions like what rights should police have to pry into personal lives in order to solve a case and whether priests should divulge confessions in certain situations. There is one shot with Jesus on the cross looming above Logan as he again refuses to give any useful information. It's not distractingly obvious but it's a powerful image. I am consistently impressed and affected by Hitchcock's films in new and original ways and I Confess is no exception.</fullReview>

This is a dangerous man and yet Clift can do nothing or he is turning his back on his vow to God. Now comes blackmail and deceit and the problem of how a priest can deal with news that is so dangerous. Clift becomes a very heroic figure. He holds fast despite all the arrows that are shot at him. Involved are a young woman who is viewed as complicit in murder. Also, Keller is out there, having evaded the law. Sometimes, however, one needs to cover more tracks, even when it isn't necessary. Anyway, while this gets a little far fetched at times, it deals with one of the oldest difficulties that clergy must face. Lots of good Hithccock here as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the various films of Alfred Hitchcock's career are discussed, this particular one isn't discussed at length or even just mentioned all that often. It may be that the central plot - a priest hearing a murder confession but because of his vows is unable to tell the police - was old hat even back in 1953. It may be that the central character, played by Montgomery Clift, is kind of hard to get a handle on - I couldn't really understand what was going on in his head many times through the movie. Another possible reason for the somewhat obscurity of this movie may be because unlike a number of other Hitchcock movies, you don't really feel the screws tightening as the movie progresses - there isn't really much doubt as to whether Clift's character will be proved innocent or not. On the positive side, the movie is very well photographed on picturesque locations in Quebec. And I confess (ha!) that I wasn't bored at any time... though I usually knew what was going to happen some time before it happened. Despite a few good qualities as these, as I said in my summary line, this movie has to be considered lesser Hitchcock, and can only really be recommended for big fans of the director... and even they might have some issues with the movie.</fullReview>

Hasse (as Otto Keller) nervously praying in the darkness of his church. Taken to Mr. Clift's confessional, Mr. Hasse admits to the killing we saw. Soon, inspector Karl Malden (as Larrue) suspects Clift committed the crime. Clift is innocent, but can't tell anyone since Hasse admitted the sin during confession. Complicating matters is the appearance of mysterious blonde Anne Baxter (as Ruth Grandfort), who was to meet the victim on the day of the murder...Never finding a way to bring the viewer into the confession booth, "I Confess" gets too wrapped up in its itself to be indispensable Alfred Hitchcock, but it's certainly excellent Hitchcock. The director is in fine form, with outstanding assistance from black-and-white cinematographer Robert Burks. The cast and crew are obviously dedicated. The film's weakness is that potential points about religiosity fail to be made convincingly or constructively; the storyline tames and tidies everything up around the film's end. And, the non-event leading to a blackmail plan amounts to nothing the husband wouldn't have accepted; really, it was nothing.******* I Confess (1/12/53) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Montgomery Clift, Anne Baxter, Karl Malden, O.E.

		<fullReview>Starring Montgomery Clift with Anne Baxter, Karl Malden, &amp; O.H. Hasse.Unlike many Hitchcock films, this is not a thriller but there is suspense.Logan (Clift) and Ruth (Anne Baxter) grow up in the same Quebec city neighborhood and are longtime boyfriend &amp; girlfriend before WW-II. BUT, as a consequence of that war as a Canadian soldier, Logan decides to become a Catholic priest if he returns. Ruth, expecting to marry him after the war, is hurt, disappointed, at this decision but she goes on to marry a lawyer who becomes very prominent &amp; influential.After his seminary, (the now) Fr. Logan lives in the rectory next to a church with several fellow priests. An immigrant refugee couple also live &amp; work at the rectory--Otto (O.H. Hasse) provides rectory upkeep part-time while his wife Alma provides meals, housekeeping, etc., full-time for the resident clerics.Some years later, a local Quebec lawyer (Villette) who'd briefly seen Logan &amp; Ruth's last farewell meeting (before Logan's seminary years), decides to blackmail Ruth trying to use his distorted sexualized account of it as a means of pressuring her to influence her husband to the blackmailer's advantage. Ruth then contacts Fr. Logan and tells him what Villette is doing.Otto (of rectory maintenance), attempts to rob Villette of a money cache (he's also been V's part-time gardener) but, surprised by Villette in the act--kills him. He returns to the rectory and enters the church.Fr. Logan, seeing a person enter late at night, goes to offer support.He finds Otto who says he wants to confess and Fr. Logan hears Otto's confession of the murder of Villette. Fr. Logan is now bound by the rules of the confessional to say nothing about this (FYI: he'd be excommunicated if he did).Through the build-up of a series of clues and the unfolding of potential motives, Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden) increasingly believes Fr. Logan is guilty--helped by Fr. Logan's unwillingness to speak at all of his relationship with Ruth and of Otto's confession.Fr. Logan goes to court and trial.Will he speak the truth and save himself? -- or remain silent, faithful to his vows and beliefs but risking death if found guilty? Clift didn't have just a handsome face but a very expressive one as well. Malden, Baxter, and Hasse were also very good. The photography often had very dramatic shadows (IMO reminiscent of those in "The Third Man") and angled framing in some scenes which added to the tension.Hitchcock himself was Catholic and, in part, this film is very possibly his tribute to a clergy with whom he was very familiar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the 20th Hitchcock film I have seen and it never gets old. Even though most of his movies are dealing in the same genre and some have similar story lines Hitchcock steps beyond the status of a typical and formulaic director into his own level of storytelling. In this film Montgomery Cliff hears a confession by his servant that he has killed Vilette a lawyer who is substantially rich. The movies than centers around this confession and why Cliff cannot reveal the true murderer because of holy law. The film at times is a little slow especially when Ruth, Cliff's former lover, tells the story of how they met and fell in love. But although some things in the movie are a little slow Hitchcock still is able to bring the tension up at the end of the film. The ending maybe be a little surprising but I expected it. Overall Hitchcock did a wonderful job a telling the story of a priest unable to tell the truth. This film is by no means near Hitchcock's top level of films but it is still entertaining and has value in seeing it.Direction: 8/10 Acting: 8/10 Writing: 7/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Overall: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can One Exponge All Guilt By Transferring It To Another, Like Contraband?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Montgomery Clift stars as Father Logan, an orthodox Catholic priest in a Quebec City church. To take care of the church and the rectory, he employees a caretaker, Otto Keller and a housekeeper, Otto's wife Alma, who are German immigrants with hardly any money, though alas in their homeland they were better off. Otto also works part-time as a gardener for certain upper-class homes. One night Otto asks if Father Logan will hear his confession. He confesses that he attempted to steal money from a person for whom he gardens, an affluent lawyer named Villette, and what with one thing and another he killed him. Due to the obligatory ritual of the secrecy of the confessional, Father Logan cannot tell the police, led by a driven detective played by the late, great Karl Malden, anything he now knows about this crime.Can one expunge all guilt by transferring it to another, like contraband? Law and church burden each other. Which one is more socially helpful? These are the open implications of I Confess, Sir Alfred Hitchcock's fortieth movie, which opens on wonderfully dark compositions of cathedrals, juxtaposed with one-way signs. Only the most confident touch could wire a thriller to subject itself to partiality and present its themes of dogma and clear-cut moral codes. It is not one of Hitchcock's greatest films, but like many of them it demonstrates his supremacy over his era as a smuggler of themes, even a smuggler of socially shamed sexuality or, in many cases, psychotic violence.In an unusually romantic passage for the director, two of his characters end up stranded on an island during a storm, forced to shelter for the night in a gazebo. This will lead not only to blackmail, but to the undertaking of such binding natures that cause so much trouble in the film. There are several variations on which way to comprehend the situation on all of its levels. The dimensions of the power of silence, the motivations which paradoxically combine guilt and self-preservation, and Anne Baxter's intractable looking-on. I call her The Stare Master. The answers are there somewhere, as Hitchcock nudges us with a curious choice of mood and one of the very few instances of slow-motion before the 1960s. Two characters share a last dance, a beautifully intimate shot, right up to extreme soft-lens closeup. It is in this sequence where Hitchcock chooses to reveal to us who and what comprise the story's dilemma.When does the honor of dogma stop being honor and become a delusion of nobility? Really, it only hurts these characters. Part of Father Morgan's headstrong resolve to honor the confession is either the demonstration of an inordinately strong-minded individual, or the deeply buried reflection of the thoughts he has surely has about the murder victim himself. We decide. This is a protagonist who truly cannot function in a more conventional film, where the story necessitates good fighting evil, because the practices of his faith, however altruistic, are so dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catholic drama in Quebec City</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the often-forgotten gems from the mid-20th century. The b/w photography gives the movie a brooding atmosphere that may have not been apparent in 1953. The stony urban landscape of Quebec city with its churches and iconic photography make this movie a pleasure to watch.It is the perfect setting for Hitchcock to deal with the seal of the confessional, a concept that must have held some interest for a director raised in the Catholic faith. In the North American old world setting, Father William Logan (played by Montgomery Clift), hears a murder confession and never wavers from the seal of confession, even when he is charged with the crime and knows who the real criminal is.Father Logan is further tested by an old girlfriend, played by Anne Baxter, who still loves him. The mettle of this man again shines through as the cleric remains faithful to his vows. It is ironic and perhaps intentional that Hitchcock would cast the unlikely Clift in the role of a priest. Yet the handsome cleric cuts a fine figure walking through the streets of Quebec with his long black cassock, a lonely man who doesn't flinch. At one point he is vilified and becomes the modern-day equivalent of a martyr. It is interesting that Hitchcock combined his Catholicism with his strong suspicions of the police who in this film, victimize a man who is a model of good conduct, as a friend of the woman he once loved and as a Catholic priest. The view of the Catholic priesthood has changed significantly in the two or three generations since this movie was made but this is the sort of movie that 1950's Catholics would have paid tribute to. Father Logan was the sort of priest they expected because so much was expected of them in return for their fidelity to the faith. A high standard!No all of the acting is good but the actors in the main roles are outstanding, including Clift, Baxter, and Karl Malden, as the police detective. While not in the top tier of Hitchcock's work, I Confess is still a highly watchable film almost 60 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** The righteous and humble Father Michael Logan, Montgomery Cliff, literately gets his head in a noose when he keeps quite about a murder that he himself is the prime suspect of. This all happened when the church handyman German refugee Otto Keller, O.E Hasse, confessed to Father Michael in the church confession booth that he in fact killed Ottawa lawyer Villette, Ovila Legare, in a blotch robbery attempt.What makes Villette's murder even more shocking is that he-Villette-had been blackmailing Michael's former girlfriend, before he became a Catholic priest, Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter) for some five years knowing that she's married to Ottawa legislator Pierre Grandfort, Roger Dann. Knowing that he can't break the vows of the confession booth Father Michael is left out in the cold leaving it up to Keller to tell the truth about him killing Villette or else be forced to face the hangman's noose if convicted!Ruth risking disgrace and public humiliation breaks the ice by confessing to Ottawa police Inspector Larrue, Karl Malden, her secret relationship with the then just Michael Logan, and being with him at the time of Villette's murder, before the war, WWII, broke out back in 1939. While on the front lines Michael seeing man's inhumanity to man in both the North African and European theaters of war became very religious and decided to become a priest. Taking the vows of celibacy Michael broke off his engagement to Ruth who, without telling or writing him, already married Pierre Grardfort while he was serving his country.It was when Michael came back home to Canada in the summer of 1945 that he reunited with Ruth. Michael not knowing that Ruth's married spent a sunny summer afternoon with her in the country that was interrupted by a sudden summer downpour that had the two seek safety in a nearby gazebo. It was there that Villette spotted them and knowing that Ruth's married, which Michael didn't, later began to blackmail her. All this was done by Villette in order to get Ruth's husband Pierre to cut a deal, in the Ottawa legislator, to have the province drop a tax fraud charge against him.Getting back to the present, 1952, Otto Keller desperate for money who's doing gardening work for Villette attempted to rip him off of $2,000.00 by breaking into his safe only, by being surprised in Villette coming home early, ending up killing him and leaving empty handed. Now with Ruth's alibi for Father Michael, in that she was with him at the time of Villette's murder, falling apart he's being put on trial for murder with his fate lying in the hands of Keller and 12 strangers, the jury, with the entire province of Ottawa demanding his blood!Another top flight performance by Montgomery Cliff as the beleaguered Father Michael Logan who's not only in danger of being convicted of a crime that he didn't commit but of actually being in danger of committing a crime against God! This in allowing himself to be, if convicted, executed by the state that would amount to committing suicide! A mortal sin in the Catholic religion!***SPOILER ALERT*** Keller paying it cool and close to the vest depended on Father Michael's deep religious convictions in him not betraying or revealing his confession to him to the police. It was Keller's hard working and guilt ridden wife Alma, Dolly Haas, who seeing that Father Michael was being railroaded, by public opinion, who broke down and tried to tell the truth. Alma's attempt to exonerate Father Michael failed with her voice being silenced at the very last moment. But in the end it was Alma's husband Otto's guilty conscience, as well as him being tricked by a very clever Inspector Larrue, that finally did bring out the truth about who was Villette's killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing And Underrated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy... ( pardon the accidental joke ) I just watched "I Confess" for the first time. I've seen almost all of Hitchcock's films, from the silent era onward, and somehow missed this one. It's a film movie-buffs never bring up when speaking of Hitchcock.I can't believe this. I love his films, but few of his films truly speak from deep in the heart, beyond the terror factor. This one explores some very dark places, as most of his films do. But "I Confess" goes to places where most people's sense of "sacred" ( biblically or romantically ) are afraid to go or question.Like "Notorious", this film questions the idea of faith, love, devotion, hope, redemption, and forgiveness, on so many MANY levels, from almost every single character in this masterpiece. My intellectual and emotional mind were pounding a mile a minute as this story unfolded.The cinematography was...well, perfect. For the most part, it wasn't shot as a murder-mystery or terror-tale. Hitchcock, at least for me, had this filmed as a love story for most of its running length. Very sneaky. But the performances and editing were very much high intensity and believable. I thought, since Hitchcock ( wisely ) didn't want to have a priest playing "action-hero" in this story, directing and filming most of it that way, made total sense. This method under-scored the priest's dignity, the love between he and his former lover's character, and the love between he and his higher faith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great location work and acting lift this lesser Hitchcock work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock was for me, as for so many aspiring film buffs, one of the first directors I "got into"; 20 years or so ago I went through nearly all of his films from 1935-up, but there were a couple that fell through the cracks, and this was one.The French apparently fell in love with this when it came out; it seems to have been a favorite of many of the New Wave directors as their careers were just starting out. I'm not sure I have an answer as to why, as it seems 50 years on not to have worn as well as many of Hitch's subsequent 50s films; perhaps it has something to do with the religious aspects of the film, or the French-Canadian location shooting; or Montgomery Clift. At any rate, though the subject matter is certainly quite thought-provoking and there's a psychological character inherent in the character of a priest allowing himself to potentially face death rather than to betray the confidence of a confession, the film on the whole rang just a little hollow for me. The true murderer of the wealthy lawyer who (it will turn out) has been blackmailing the priest's former lover is known right away, and though that alone doesn't necessarily remove the suspense, the character of Otto Keller is a bit too broadly drawn and villainous....there's no doubt that he will do whatever it takes to protect himself, and thus all our focus on the moral issues lies with the priest Father Logan (Montgomery Clift). And Logan just isn't terribly interesting, isn't written in a way that really moved me; he's obstinate when questioned by the over-eager inspector in charge of the case (Karl Malden) but so vague and noncommittal that we aren't even sure (from the text of the film, anyway) that he's actually protecting the murderer out of his own fears, or because of his beliefs.My favorite scene in the film is one that seems to provoke an opposite reaction in many, and that is the flashback where the woman who has been blackmailed by the murdered lawyer, Mm Grandfort (Anne Baxter, quite solid) recalls her past love with the priest. It's atypical Hitchcock, romantic and gauzy, and a lot of people seem to hate it, but for me it was quite magical and really made me feel for these characters in a way that the rest of the film often failed to do.Nice photography and location shots in Quebec City, and I can't complain much about the acting; it was certainly very watchable and contained some reasonably suspenseful moments; a 7/10 would be respectable for most filmmakers, but it's lower-echelon for Hitchcock. DVD rental from the "Masterpiece Collection"; excellent transfer with a nice "making of" documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below-Par Hitchcock is still better than Below-Par almost everyone else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser known and least celebrated works,I CONFESS still has a great deal of merit,owing more to Hitchcock's peerless craftsmanship than for it's somewhat obvious plot and script.Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) hears a confession from a church worker he knows,Keller (OE Hasse) that he has just killed a man.The man in question was apparently blackmailing Logan over an affair he was having with a married woman (Anne Baxter) before he entered the clergy.After confessing the affair to the police and admitting she is still in love with him,the police now point to Logan as their main suspect,but the priest refuses to divulge details of Keller's confession as befits the rules of the Catholic Church,knowing all the time it would clear him on suspicion of murder.I CONFESS' main saving grace is it's unusual location (Quebec,Canada), and the stylish,noirish lighting used by Hitchcock and his regular photographer Robert Burks.Hitchcock was not always the greatest advocate of location filming,and although there's some obvious symbolism of the Catholic Church employed (Hitchcock himself was raised in the faith), the cobbled streets and old-world style charm of the city is atmospherically used and gives the film an extra added sheen and quality that is much needed related to it's other elements.The plot itself is a hoary old chestnut with expected complications and developments,with a predictable love story included.Told in flashback with slow motion and a heavenly choir for good measure,one isn't sure whether or not Hitchcock meant the sequence to be serious or a downright parody,falling in between two stools.The tone is very earnest and the pacing is rather over-methodical,with very little humour and an often stilted,lumbering script.Clift is rather stolidly over-earnest as the accused clergyman,and the unremarkable machinations of the story don't lead to much excitement or suspense.Miss Baxter and Hasse are merely adequate in their roles whereas Roger Dann and Dolly Haas are somewhat better as the respective spouses,and the best performance comes from the ever-reliable Karl Malden as the by-the-book Inspector Larrue,though as with virtually every other character,his part is somewhat under-developed.Hitchcock himself apparently had little time for I CONFESS, calling it 'heavy handed and lacking in humour'.That is mostly true,though there was only so much he could add to such an over-familiar storyline as this.But what he did manage still turns I CONFESS into a watchable if disappointing and minor work in his filmography,though with interesting enough touches and directorial style obtaining mileage out of a story and script that with most other directors would've been generic and very routine.RATING:6 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine thriller dealing with the pitfalls of presumption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classical Hitchcock thriller. The scenario is cunningly inside out: a priest, Fr Logan, hears the confession of a murderer, Keller, who panics when he suspects that Logan might violate the Seal of the Confessional and so tries to frame him. During the course of the film it becomes clear that Logan's situation is far from a straightforward stand off between him and Keller and that the burden of the priest's position is multifarious.This is a clever, well realised film in a number of ways. Whilst clearly a play-for-screen, with the set pieces of Ruth's statement-as-confession and the courtroom drama, Hitchcock manages to construct a parallel visual narrative that uses pursuit and flashback. It's not an exclusively discursive production. There's also considerable, unnerving complications as characters come forward with the truth only to discover that there revelations simply intensify the false assumptions made by others.Anne Baxter's proud Ruth Grandfort is the key to this central contradiction, a role taken in passionate earnest. Montgomery Clift, saddled with having to look concerned but retentive throughout is saved by his good looks. Everyone is acted into a corner when the wonderful Karl Malden as Inspector Larrue is on screen (particularly the uncredited judge who is dreadful!). The film has a super, thoughtful score from Dimitri Tiomkin who incorporates chant from the (Requiem) Mass and even references Mussorgsky in underscoring church bells. Hitchcock uses a variety of shots with total confidence but one particularly notes some dynamic tracking shots in the seminary and outside the courtrooms. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgotten masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt one of the most important directors in the history of cinema, with a career filled with many classic and influential films that have become icons of film-making. While his body of work is extensive and spans across 6 decades, his most famous works are definitely the films done in the years from 1954 to 1964, with movies like "Rear Window" and "Psycho" becoming huge box-office hits. The enormous popularity of this excellent movies is probably the reason behind the forgetfulness of many great films done before those years, some almost as excellent as the Master's best known movies. The 1953 movie, "I Confess", is one of those forgotten minor masterpieces that while not really "perfect", still delivers that great mix of suspense and entertainment that made Alfred Hitchcock's movies special.Otto Keller (O. E. Hasse), the caretaker of the Church of St. Marie, murders a rich lawyer while attempting to steal some money to help his wife. Feeling guilty about his crime, he confesses his crime to Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift), a young Catholic priest known for his willingness to help people. The next day, the police is making investigations about the crime, but Father Logan can't reveal what he knows because of the sanctity of the confessional, leaving the police without any clues. However, troubles begin for Father Logan when his religious conviction for the secrecy turns against him when he becomes the main suspect of the crime, and it gets even worse when a dark secret of his past returns to complicate his situation even more.Loosely based on a play by Paul Anthelme, "I Confess" is a brilliant study of guilt, secrecy and sacrifice, as the plot focuses entirely on Father Logan's ethical problems and the drama unleashed by his desire to remain silent. While this may sound like not too much of a story to built a feature-length film, the story is filled with unexpected twists and turns that delightfully complicate the plot and add a lot of emotion to the plot, specially when the Father's own secrets begin to come to light. Scriptwriters George Tabori and William Archibald made a good job at developing the story, giving enough space for the characters to develop and culminating in a final that, while probably not as powerful as the one from the play, gives a fitting closure to the dark story of a exchanged guilts and secrets.Probably another of the elements that prevent that "I Confess" becomes better known is the fact that the movie lacks what is commonly known as the typical Hitchcock touches in terms of style. Without too much comedy and a darker tone than his best known movies, "I Confess" is definitely Hitchcock playing by the rules of Film Noir (pretty much like he would do in another forgotten gem, "The Wrong Man", some years later). In many ways, "I Confess" is an extension of what Hitchcock accomplished in his previous masterpiece, "Strangers on a Train", although this time focused on the personal drama inside the Fathe Logan's mind. It's a very subtle film, although it showcases an excellent use of symbolism and the beautiful setting of the City of Québec, Canada.Montgomery Clift is definitely the highlight of the film, as the talented actor was in his prime when he landed the role of Father Logan. Some have criticized his monotone, almost wooden stance, but personally I think that his facial expression perfectly reflects what is going on inside his character's mind. Anne Baxter plays his female counterpart, Ruth Grandfort, a very interesting character that sadly never reaches her true potential due to Baxter's less impressive performance. She was not the first choice for the role, so that fact could have played against her in this film. Another of the film's remarkable performance is given by Karl Malden, as the Inspector in charge of the case. Malden takes the role and gives another larger than life performance, stealing every scene he is in, and almost giving Clift a run for his money.In the end, the element that most damage does to the film is the very fact that it's a Hitchcock film. What I mean is that "I Confess" is a technically proficient film noir that certainly delivers a huge amount of intrigue and entertainment, but when contrasted to other Hitchcock movies, it's easy to see why it's regarded as a minor masterpiece. Personally, the only real flaw I found in the film was that, while the Catholic theme is very well-represented, the whole affair about the secrecy of confession isn't really explained, so people unfamiliar with the Catholic system of beliefs will find the basis of the plot a bit hard to believe. While this is indeed a somewhat serious flaw, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment the movie provides as one of the best (and most original) films noir ever done.True, "I Confess" lacks the usual Hitchcock style that has made most of his movies famous icons of cinema, but it still is a terrific film that fans of the Master of Suspense or fans of films noir shouldn't dismiss. It's a real shame that this movie is almost in oblivion, as while flawed, it's one of the most interesting movies by the legendary director, if only because one can see the Master working under a different scheme than what we are used to see in his works. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main idea of this movie is interesting and encourage a big amount of suspense. Most of the movie one asks himself what will the priest do. Whether he will tell the secret and save himself or keep it for himself as his job demands. The audience are also exposed to the high values of the priest and the cruelty of the real murderer, with which the audience can easily identify. There is also the story of lost love and a good looking woman as we are used to in Hich's movies.So, what did I less like about it? It lacked humor as others Hitch movies. The characters are very sad. Everything seems dark and depressing. Its like in the middle of watching it you could say 'lets watch Scienfeld'... but I guess that this is how Hithcock wanted it to be, so my idea is subjective.I believe that the movie gets more interesting as the story progresses such that towards its end you feel big suspense. After completing watching it, you should get to appreciate the movie and classify it as a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Hitchcock at his best. This movie has a great story and it allows the audience to learn about a world that is mainly misrepresented in Hollywood. Hitchcock has made a great tribute to the vocation of the Priesthood. The fact that that a priest refuses to share the information that the killer confessed to him, helps us see what the sacrement is all about. Hollywood is often too chicken to show the real priest in its movies, but Hitchocock has allowed himself to honor this vocation. How many movies involving priests are not about monsters, demons or sexual scandals in Hollywood? "I Confess" is the reason I never consider Alfred Hitchcock a Hollywood director, he is too good for such a title.</fullReview>

However, this movie like a lot of his other minor movies has been re-evaluated and is considered to be a good movie. Montgomery Clift is okay as the priest but one can feel the tension that existed between him and Hitch. Anne Baxter--the less said about her, probably the better. It's the supporting cast led by Karl Malden that carries this film. The plot is pretty interesting but far-fetched. Although there is nothing far-fetched about a priest not revealing that he knows about a murder through confession, the fact that he becomes the chief suspect through extenuating circumstances is definitely far-fetched. After all, who would believe that a man of God would commit a crime or any crime like that? A movie that needs to be checked out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much to recommend it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most likely somebody has told you a secret on the condition that you promise to tell no-one. I think it is quite common that people have a hard time keeping such promises. But what if keeping the secret puts you in a difficult spot? That is the premise of this movie. Not only is Father Logan required to keep a secret in respect for the privacy of the confessional, but the secret he has to keep is one that would clear him of a murder charge. That kind of pushes the keeping a secret business to the limit.I think any Montgomery Clift performance is worth seeing, and this one is no exception. Clift is able to say a lot with facial expressions and Hitchcock gives him an opportunity to use that talent with many extreme close-ups. Clift's Logan can display a combative side at some points while evincing a disciplined, spiritual, rectitude at others.If you go into this expecting a Hitchcockian high-wire thriller, then you will most likely be disappointed. The script is more introspective than action packed.I don't associate Hitchcock with film noir, but I think that "I Confess" is a good example of that genre. The use of high contrast black and white lends a dark overtone to the proceedings, particularly in the use of shadows and dark cityscapes. I was impressed with the photography, perhaps the most artistic of any Hitchcock I have seen. The print on the DVD I watched was pristine, amazingly so for a movie that is over sixty years old.The original score by Dimitri Tiomkin is bombastic and intrusive--a big negative.It is interesting to compare this with the 2011 "The Confession" that has a similar initial premise but plays out in a much different way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is very little other than the basic premise that can be considered intelligent in I Confess.Let me start of with the basic plot - Montgomery Clift plays a young priest who here's a confession from a fellow priest - confessing to have murdered a man. Clift, being a priest cannot share his confession, so when the cops start to suspect him, he's in big trouble.Montgomery Clift isn't very good in this. His performance is dull - one feels as if he's staring at a brick lying on the ground. He plays a priest, not once does he pray, not once does I utter the word 'god'. He's certainly no Father Mulcahy! However Anne Baxter delivers an excellent performance as the woman who Clift is having an affair with, her performance takes the form of a tear instead of a brick.I Confess is fun for sure, but it's a form of basic entertainment, I'm sure in the 50s in pleased very many mainstream crowds, however now in the 2010s I Confess is one of the more predictable Hitchcock's.I give I Confess 7/10 for being dated, predictable but having one excellent performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a storm Montgomery Clift is caught up in this 1953 thriller. As a priest, his downfall began with a rainstorm confining him and his lover, the lovely "blonde" Anne Baxter. She didn't tell him that she had married during the war.On the night that the man who was blackmailing Baxter is killed, Clift was meeting with Baxter. Our killer confesses the killing to priest Clift, and the film becomes the story of the significance of the confession in the Catholic church. Is it really a priest-parishioner vow of silence?The ending is all too predictable even after a surprise verdict. Condemned by the mob after the verdict is read, we know that within the killer's orbit, someone will crack and the truth come out.Clift is terrific as the brooding priest and Baxter turns off the charm is a really excellent restrained performance. Karl Malden, as the police chief, has to ask the questions and Brian Aherne, the family friend and prosecuting attorney, must turn on Baxter to get to the truth.This picture is certainly an argument against the fact that a priest must not report what has been said in confession.</fullReview>

When Ruth goes to provide Larrue with an alibi for Logan, things don't work out as planned..........Clift is very good in the lead as a priest struggling to do the right thing (his face says everything) and it's a very well acted film by the rest of the cast as well, except for 2 young French girls who sound like they are affecting terribly false French accents. There are some very good scenes, eg, the way that Malden and Clift play each other when Clift is questioned about what he knows. The film keeps you watching with good drama and tension throughout.

		<shortDescription>A rarity, a Hitchcock with psychological depth and interesting just for that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a Hitchcock fan because I find his movies just too formulaic. Almost all I've seen have the same plot, where an innocent is persecuted for some crime and must spent their time running from the law while trying to find the culprit. Just too predictable, so I got to rather focus in their technical aspects: artistic virtuosity, cinematography, pacing, plot development; shot frame and composition, lightning, acting, while getting little in what is really important to me: overall substance, depth of ideas, originality, purpose; intellectual or philosophical reach or value. They are mostly for entertainment, as Hitchcock said himself, and that's not enough for me. If I review IC now is because this is the first one where I see something sorely lacking in the others: psychological depth.IC is about a Catholic priest who receives the confession of a murderer and who becomes himself the murder suspect later, but who can't reveal to police who the culprit is, because of his vows. His plight is further complicated by the fact that the victim was blackmailing the woman with whom he had a romantic relation before his ordainment. What's different in this Hitchcock is that characters aren't just playing parts here?the murderer, the suspect, the detective--but also showing the complexity of their dilemmas, the tangled web of their conflicting emotions--Pierre Grandfort, for ex., who must live with the knowledge that his wife doesn't love him, while having to help her saving the man she loves. Or Father Logan, who may be well be facing the death penalty, with the only escape possibility being in him violating the sanctity of the Confessional. Or Ruth, who sees herself in the heartbreaking dilemma of destroying her husband's promising political career, to save Father Logan, or leaving the priest to his fate.Now, this is not a great movie but one I found interesting for the intensity of the characters, as I said. The trademark Hitchcock camera is there, making the best of every tourist spot in Quebec City. The acting is appropriate, especially by the leads. Malden totally at home as a detective?the man was born to play the role?Hasse effective as the murderous weasel but Haas much overplaying her part--she's soo touching (considering what German women had to go through during the post-war, living in caves, clearing millions of tons of rubble with their bare hands, it's ridiculous that Otto would make such a fuss of Alma doing simple house chores.) About Baxter, I had the weird feeling her character had just been tacked there but she plays it decently anyway. About Monty, I don't know if that is intensity or simply that he can't act. In each scene I remember having seen him in others movies he looks and acts the same way, his eyes and eyebrows doing all the work--which is not strange anyway, considering he was always there doing the role of a victimized man. (Lack of acting opportunities or just a very limited dramatic range?).But the one thing I really hated in this flick is Keller. He is a coward hypocrite, a traitor; but even worse is that he was made a German, which suggests that good old Alfie was simply getting even for the V1s that may have landed on his roof a few years earlier. Being Germans, the Kellers had no business in Quebec City of the 50s. I wasn't here at the time but I know that the Canadian govt. has historically tried to settle refugees in places where already exists an established community to provide them with the appropriate cultural and social environment. B.C. does it for Orientals; Quebec for the French and Central Canada for Eastern Europeans. So, as soon as they had landed in Canada, real life Kellers would have taken a train to Winnipeg, to Saskatoon, where they would have met their kin in local German communities. They wouldn't have spent one day in Q.C. where even today you'll find precious few people speaking anything other than French. But good old Alf had to get that one off his chest.Now, what I find ironic about IC is that, while probably being the most interesting Hitchcock I've seen is also the one with the biggest plot holes. Just consider the big coincidence that Keller would have decided to rob Villette the same night when Villette's blackmailing affair had reached a boiling point. Also amazing that it should be Father Logan the priest to take his confession. There are also inconsistencies in his behavior. We come to know him as a rat, ready to lie, to betray, to frame with the murder the priest who helped him so much, to shoot his way out of trouble, yet he feels terrible because he has killed a man by accident; so bad, he has to tell someone, a priest. It doesn't make sense. Also that Larrue, being as acquainted at the uses of the Catholic Church as he says he is, would act in such ignorant and reckless way as to suspect Father Logan of involvement in the murder just because he was so reserved about the motive of his visit to the victim. Had he never noticed the great discretion with which priests usually treat matters concerning privacy of the faithful? Even weirder is that he would start suspecting Logan as soon as he sees him meeting a woman outside Villette's house. What that means as evidence? As the result he doesn't come out as if he was trying to solve the crime but rather as if trying to pin it on Logan. Why for ex. after hearing the girls' tale he doesn't even consider the possibility that the murderer could have been a man disguised as a priest, as it was the case?.In all, not a great film but one of the few Hitchcocks I have watched with real interest, along with Strangers On A Train and Vertigo. 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A One-Sided Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Otto Keller, the caretaker of a church, disguised as a priest, tries to steal money from a lawyer named Villette, gets caught in the act, and ends up killing Villette. He confesses to Father Logan. Ironically, Inspector Larrue comes to suspect Father Logan of the murder, but Logan cannot reveal what Keller admitted in the confessional. Larrue's suspicions are strengthened when he finds Villette was blackmailing Ruth Grandfort, a close friend of Logan. Eventually, Logan is put on trial for the murder.But it is only half a trial. We never see the defense attorney call witnesses to testify, cross examine the prosecution's witnesses, or present his closing argument to the jury. The only thing he does of any significance is object at one point, but the prosecutor continues with his line of questioning unabated. Speaking of which, the prosecutor often stops asking the witness questions so he can give his theory of what happened. We know that movies take liberties in their presentation of trials, but the absence of an objection from the defense at these points is irritating. In any event, when the jury comes back with a not-guilty verdict, it strikes us as arbitrary, for we never heard anything from the defense casting doubt on the accusation. In fact, for all practical purposes, Father Logan might just as well not have had a defense attorney.This reminded me of the movie "Helter Skelter" (1976). There too, we have a defense attorney that is practically nonexistent. The day before the closing arguments are to begin, the prosecuting attorney tells his wife how worried he is about the summation he will have to give, because so much depends on it. I remember thinking to myself, "Is he kidding? Everyone knew Charles Manson was going to be found guilty. No special skill was required from the prosecutor in giving his closing argument." In fact, I was wondering what closing argument would be heard from the defense. That was where the real challenge lay. So, in the next scene, we see the prosecutor give his all-important summation, while I waited patiently for him to finish so I could hear what the defense attorney would say. But we never got to hear from him, I suppose because there was nothing for him to say. And that is why "Helter Skelter" is not a very good movie. In general, when a trial takes place in a movie where we do not hear from the defense, it is not likely to be very interesting.Then, after Father Logan is found not guilty, the whole town seems to be against him. That is totally unrealistic. In real life, we would expect him to have some supporters who believed he was innocent. The unanimity of the townsfolk in this regard is as one-sided as the trial, and therefore just as boring.During the trial, the real murderer, Keller, testifies against Logan, giving false evidence that he hopes will incriminate Logan, the very priest he confessed to. In fact, Keller even planted the bloody cassock in Logan's room. This is too much. It would have been far more interesting if Keller had given evidence that would have helped Logan, short of admitting that he was the one who was guilty. He could have said Father Logan got back to the church too early to have committed the murder, for example. This perjured testimony from the killer in defense of Logan would have created an even greater degree of moral tension. Logan would not only have to keep it a secret that Keller killed Villette, but he would also have to accept that Keller's lies on the witness stand helped his own case, making him indebted to Keller. As it is, Keller is ridiculously evil, trying to help convict the very priest he confessed to.Another thing that makes this movie too one-sided is Father Logan's total innocence in every regard. In the movie, he returns from the war and meets Ruth, who he does not know is married. He is not a priest yet, and so he kisses her, as they were in love before the war. A storm comes up, and they are forced to spend the night in a gazebo. The next morning, Villette, who owns the place, discovers them and suspects them of having had sex, which they did not. This becomes the basis for the blackmail.Think how much better it would have been if Logan had been a priest at the time, knew that Ruth was married, and in a weak moment had sex with her that night in the gazebo. Allowing for Logan to have sinned in this way would have created some moral tension, and provided an even stronger motive for the murder of Villette. In fact, it is almost a cliché that when a man and woman take shelter in a storm, they have sex, so it is a little disappointing that they do not. Instead, Father Logan is presented as completely without sin, which is just as uninteresting as Keller's unqualified evil.In short, Father Logan is too one-sided (too innocent), Keller is too one-sided (too evil), the trial is too one-sided (the absence of a defense), and the attitude of the townsfolk is too one-sided (everyone hates Logan). The result, especially when compared to the movie that might have been, is disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slightly different Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Quebec City, Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) finds a guilt-ridden Otto Keller in his church. Otto confesses that he killed Villette at whom he works as a gardener. He was trying to steal money to start a new life with his wife Alma. Witnesses tell Inspector Larrue (Karl Malden) that a priest was seen at Villette's at the time based on the outfit. Logan is brought in but he refuses to cooperate. Larrue suspects Logan. Ruth Grandfort (Anne Baxter) overhears it and warns Logan. He was her great love back before the war and still is. Villette had seen the lovers stranded on an island and recently tried to blackmail Ruth. Villette needed Ruth's husband who is a leading political figure to get him out of tax problems. A case starts to be formed but the confessional keeps Logan from pointing a finger at the real killer.This is a slightly different Hitchcock movie. It's not a whodunnit. The movie shows you the killer right away. I do wish that Montgomery Clift could or be allowed to emote more. He is quietly suffering throughout. He gets to put his face in his hands to show even greater suffering. The Quebec City locations provide some good backdrop. It doesn't draw the same tension but it's still well made Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I watched a lot of films by Alfred Hitchcock I was unfamiliar with this hidden gem. Between his first golden period in Hollywood (Shadow Of A Doubt, Notorious, Spellbound) and his second (from Rear Window to Birds) Hitchcock experimented with scenery, story and cinematography in films like Rope, The Trouble With Harry, Dial M For Murder and I Confess. After seeing this movie I read the reviews here on IMDb and there is a lot of criticism because the film is too slow and there is less suspense. The only reason here fore I think is in the fact that people watch the movie expecting the typical stuff of the master of suspense. And I Confess is an atypical film by Hitchcock. In the cinematography you see a lot of influence by the expressionists directors and the struggle of Father Logan reminded me of films by Robert Bresson. It is no wonder that I Confess was admired by the directors of the Nouvelle Vague and was more appreciated in Europe than it was in the States. Hitchcock himself didn't like the final result very much. A fact that can be explained because his main aim was to entertain the public. And although he was a great inventor in cinema this film wasn't an easy one to watch as Strangers on the Train for example.The movie starts with shots of public signs mentioning "Direction" and the camera goes through an open window revealing a dead body. You see a person wearing a priest robe leaving the house. Next Father Michael Logan sees the handyman of his church, Otto Keller, who wants to confess. Within the first five minutes of the film you know that it was Keller who murdered lawyer Villette to steal his money and make life for him and his beloved wife Alma easier. Soon the suspicion of the police falls on Father Michael. There are witnesses who saw a man wearing a priest robe leaving the house of Villette and Michael had an appointment with the lawyer he is not willing to explain. Also he has no alibi for the moment of the murder.It turns out that on the evening of the murder he was with his former girlfriend with whom he should have married after the war. In flashbacks we see that Ruth Grandfort was unable to wait for Michael and married politician Pierre instead. The former lovers were caught by Villette near his summerhouse and after that they are blackmailed by the lawyer. In a brilliant twist of fate Ruth tries to give Michael an alibi to the police but instead gives them a motive for the murder.While there are some common themes by Hitchcock in the movie (the wrong man accused, the final shooting) there are also differences from his other films. There is a lot of talking and therefore the pace of the film is slow. The scene of the testimony by Ruth to the police takes up a lot of time but the acting in this scene is very good. Montgomery Clift is a totally different actor than the normal heroes in the films by Hitchcock (Carry Grant, James Stewart). It is mentioned that Hitchcock himself had difficulties with the way Clift portrayed Michael Logan but I found his acting very intense and subtle. Clift made it very believable that Logan was a man who fled to the church after he experienced the horrors of war only to find his beloved Ruth already married. You see a man fighting his inner demons and struggling to keep his oath to the Lord and not tell the confession Keller made to him to the police. Even if it means that he will take the conviction for the murder. There is not only a great role by Clift but all the supporting actors are great. Anne Baxter is convincing as the woman who knows she made a wrong decision as she didn't wait for the great love of her life. I was also impressed by Otto Hasse who plays Keller as a very creepy and schizophrenic murderer who constantly affects the guilt feelings of Michael Logan.So I Confess is a movie that would be a classic if it was directed by anyone but Hitchcock. As it was made by Hitchcock the expectations by the public are such that the film cannot respond. But if you merit the movie on its own you enjoy a real masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overwhelming story, with one of the most handsome actors ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I had seen everything by Hitchcock, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found this - for me - new title. First I thought it would be bad, as one never hears anything about it, but it turned out to be very good. It is a mystery why it isn't broadcast on television more, or showed at Hitchcock movie festivals..? The story was so touching! It was so easy to feel for Father Logan, and to suffer with him in his terrible dilemma. Montgomery Cliff was perfect in the role - he was so handsome, that even less good movies he partook in, became sublime just because of his looks..! I did not think Anne Baxter was the right choice for his love interest, though. She was too old - or rather: she looked much older than she actually was, and especially in the flashback to where she was supposed to be a young girl. She was also too fat and not beautiful or soulful enough.Finally, I am relieved over the happy ending! As the movie was labeled "film noir", I expected it to be a tragic ending, caused by some stupid, unnecessary mistake in the last minute. But I am so glad Father Logan survived, and could go out and continue his work as a priest. Now when he had proved that he was actually prepared to sacrifice even his life for a disgusting person's sake, rather than breaking the rules of his vocation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just gets worse and worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I heard this wasn't great Hitchcock, it begins quite nicely with a look that at times is reminiscent of German Expressionism and at other times of Neo-realism. The set up is nice and the murderer is squirmingly unlikable. Outside of Dimitri Tiomkin's horribly bombastic score, it seemed promising.I'd say for maybe a half hour it's a decent movie, as you see Montgomery Clift if conflict and see Karl Malden getting suspicious. Unfortunately the movie starts lagging, and then, when you think it won't be great but might be okay, it gets really, really bad. First off there's Anne Baxter's *endless* deposition, a dull mix of voice-over and bland snippets that should have taken about 2 minutes but instead goes on for what seemed to be 15. That was bad, as was the unrealistic gusto with which the police chased very slim evidence. But the movie achieved ultimate levels of absurdity in the last couple of scenes, in which a character's actions come out of nowhere, a plot thread just kind of peters out without resolution, and no one does anything that makes much sense at all, although it does wrap things up in a neat, though very ugly, bow.I find it incredible that people here are reviewing this favorably. I feel they all need to have seen the movie without knowing it was by Hitchcock, because I can't help but think that they are giving it a pass because of the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Least-Known Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have pointed out, "I Confess" is probably one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser-known films, certainly when compared to the likes of "Psycho", "North by North-West" or "Vertigo". And yet in terms of quality I would rank it alongside those films; it certainly does not deserve to be relegated to the ranks of "lesser Hitchcock" together with something like, say, "Stage Fright" or "Torn Curtain". Perhaps the reason is that it does not contain what have come to be thought of as typical Hitchcock touches; there is very little humour and no set-piece "suspense" sequences. There are no typical "Hitchcock stars"; I suspect that it might have become better-known had it starred, say, James Stewart and Ingrid Bergman, or Gregory Peck and Grace Kelly, rather than Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter, neither of whom made another film with Hitch. It has a "Hitchcock blonde" in the shape of Baxter, but her character is in many ways untypical of the director's female leads. One typically Hitchcock feature is its theme, that of a man wrongly accused of a crime, but there is an unusual twist. The hero is Father Michael Logan, a Catholic priest from Quebec. (Much of the filming was done on location in the city; in keeping with Hitchcock's fondness for landmark buildings the finale takes place in the famous Château Frontenac hotel). Father Logan finds himself coming under suspicion after a corrupt lawyer named Villette is found murdered. The link between them is that Villette was blackmailing Ruth, the wife of local politician Pierre Grandfort and an old girlfriend of Father Logan before he became a priest, and the police suspect that he killed Villette to protect his former lover. The twist is that Logan actually knows the identity of the killer. It was Otto Keller, a German immigrant and the husband of Logan's housekeeper Alma. (Is it coincidence that she has the same Christian name as Hitchcock's own wife?) The motive was robbery; it had nothing to do with Villette's blackmail of Ruth. Because Keller has formally confessed his guilt to Logan, however, the priest is bound by the "seal of the confessional" and cannot implicate Keller, even when he is himself arrested and charged with the crime, at that time a capital offence in Canada. The Hitchcock film with which "I Confess" has most in common is probably "The Wrong Man", which also showed how easily an innocent man could be suspected of a crime. Like that film it contains a court scene, something Hitchcock generally preferred to avoid. (It is said that he withdrew from directing "The Wreck of the Mary Deare" because he could see no way of making it except as a courtroom drama). There are also similarities with "Marnie", another film which relies more upon psychological drama than physical suspense. It is said that Hitchcock, who disliked "method" actors, did not enjoy working with Clift, and yet it is Clift's performance which is vital to the film's success. Logan is a man prepared to die rather than betray his religious beliefs and his priestly duties, something which in many people's eyes would make him a saint, and playing a character who is virtuous to the point of saintliness can often be a thankless task. With Clift, however, we are always aware that Logan is a flesh-and-blood human being, not a mere plaster saint. He combines well with O. E. Hasse as Logan's evil angel Keller, a man tormented by the fear that Logan will be unable to resist the temptation to betray him and who constantly goads the priest. Another good performance comes from Karl Malden as the investigating police officer Inspector Larrue, initially all too ready to believe Logan guilty on unsatisfactory evidence but belatedly converted to a belief in his innocence. As I said, Baxter is not a typical Hitchcock blonde. Ruth is a selfish and conniving woman quite unlike the innocent heroines played by Bergman, Kelly, Joan Fontaine and Eva Marie Saint. She remains obsessively in love with Logan even after he enters the priesthood. Some directors might have tried to win sympathy for her by making Pierre a bad husband, a bully or an adulterer or both, but in fact he is a decent man who loves his wife and his hurt by her failure to return that love. (Baxter was not Hitchcock's first choice for the role; he wanted the Swedish actress Anita Björk but Warner Bros vetoed her on the grounds that she was an unmarried mother). Hitchcock was himself a Catholic, and regarded this as his most "Catholic" film but felt that others might not understand it, saying "We Catholics know that a priest cannot disclose the secret of the confessional, but the Protestants, the atheists, and the agnostics all say, 'Ridiculous! No man would remain silent and sacrifice his life for such a thing!'" Well, I might be the director's namesake but am not his co-religionist, and yet even I had no difficulty in understanding how a man like Michael Logan might be prepared to sacrifice his life for his beliefs. The one weak point, I felt, was the handling of the trial scene, which concentrates too much on the prosecution evidence and not enough on the defence and then culminates in that unexpected "not guilty" verdict which allows much of the tension to dissipate. It would have been more effective, I felt, had the denouement come while Logan was still on trial or even after he had been convicted and was under sentence of death. With that exception, however, I would regard "I Confess" as one of its director's finest psychological dramas and a film that deserves to be better-known. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man who is a German Refugee in Canada confesses to murder to a priest. The man also works as a handyman for that church so he and his wife are well known to the priest. The rules of the priesthood mean that the priest cannot divulge the confession to the police even though the priest becomes a suspect and stands trial.Montgomery Clift is in a dilemma which has meant this film has been regarded as a classic. However looked closely there are many problems with the film as the screenplay has to overreach to make the priest a suspect, the murderer is a man who the audience has little sympathy for and you do not buy that the priest would himself go to jail to save the snivelling rat.Hitchcock does his best with the thriller genre but the story line hampers him, especially with the flashback scenes with Clift and Anne Baxter whose past relationship returns to haunt them both.Karl Malden is effective as a dogged detective but as a good catholic himself you would have thought that he might have sensed there were other reasons why the priest was not forthcoming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Confess (1953) ** (out of 4) A priest (Montgomery Cliff) hears a murderer's confession but soon a police detective (Karl Malden) begins to think the priest did the actual crime. The priest, due to his duties to the church, can't say who committed the crime even though he might be sent away for it. The actual premise is certainly very interesting but that's about it. That premise wears off after the thirty minute mark and there are so many unlogical things happening that the film grew tiresome very quickly. I'm a fan of Cliff but I found him rather boring here but Malden is good as usual. The ending is horrendously bad and humiliating. Another thing that really ate at me was the fact that the priest NEVER tells the police or the jury "why" he can't tell them anything. He keeps refusing to answer questions, which certainly makes him look guilty yet he never says he can't tell these things because he heard it while on the job so to speak. The girlfriend liked this one a lot more than I did and said there wouldn't have been a movie had the priest said that but it still bothered the hell out of me. This is certainly one of my least favorites from director Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

The twist here is that Clift, through a previous romantic connection to a woman (Baxter) who was being blackmailed by the victim, becomes a chief suspect.

		<fullReview>Upright Canadian Priest (Montgomery Clift) is suspected of murdering a lawyer with a `past' after hearing his presbytery's handyman confess to it, will he break the sanctity of the Confessional to save his own life?The whole thing doesn't work, because there is not much suspense in the machinations of plot and character, only because of Hitch's direction and camerawork. One problem is the confused behaviour undertaken by the stupid guy who committed the murder in the first place. He murders a man so he can support his wife, he shows remorse enough to confess to a priest, then threatens the priest continually throughout the movie so he won't blab, thinks he's about to be dobbed in by his wife when Clift is pardoned and facing an angry mob, so he tops off his wife, and actually tries to kill the priest and makes mass murder attempt on half of Quebec's police. And as if the priest would tell! He's a PRIEST, for God's sake! In a 1950s movie! A priest who not only refuses to commit adultery with his childhood sweetheart, but they also wrote the character as being some kind of war hero who helps needy refugees, assists childhood sweetheart in clearing her name and is apparently quite talented with a pail of paint and a brush. Not to mention the fact that he looks like Montgomery Clift, pained, prayerful and another-worldly (hopefully this expression was not alcohol induced). As if such a creature would break his vows for a piddly thing like acquittal of murder charge.From what I've heard about Montgomery Clift's working relationship with relationship with Hitch, it is a surprise and a good one at that that we do not see the drunken glaze on those baby blues quite as much as expected. He is mostly good, if a little wishy-washy, and looking pre-accident fabulous. Karl Malden, playing a detective, is Karl Malden. Ann Baxter is very poised and well attired, which is fortunate as her performance consists of her very worst Marilyn impression. Even worse is the virtual absence of chemistry between her and Clift, certainly none on the level he had with both Liz Taylor and Shelley Winters in A PLACE IN THE SUN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot in Quebec. Priest Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) has a man confess to him that he murdered another man. Under the laws of the church Logan can not tell the police what he knows. Eventually he is accused of the murder himself because he can't account for his whereabouts on the time of the killing. He was with a married woman (Anne Baxter) who is in love with him. He is going on trial for murder. Should he break his vows and reveal the killer? Not a bad idea but this movie is dull. It's shot in stark black and white (despite studio ads that saying it was shot in colorful Quebec), is VERY somber and slow-moving. There's almost non-stop music during the first half of the movie which doesn't match the material at all. Clift was a great actor but he's terrible here. His face never once changes expression so it's impossible to tell WHAT he's feeling! Costar Baxter said he was like that all during the film. At one point her character was talking to his during a tense moment...and he was blankly staring at her. She said she had to imagine a look on his face! Clift and Hitchcock did not get along at all during the filming (Hitch later on said that Clift was even more disturbed than he was) so that could account for the acting. Baxter is the only reason to see this film. She's great in her role giving this a better performance than it deserves. But, all in all, Hitch's heart wasn't into making this and it shows. Too bad--the material is promising. A 2 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Noticeably lacking the visual and narrative fluidity of the majority of his output, Hitchcock's tale of a priest implicated in a murder after hearing the confession of the real killer traffics in didactic visual metaphors (the Crucifixion statuette hovering over Clift as he testifies), and is marred by labored pacing and an atonal Dmitri Tiomkin score that overplays all dramatic cues. The uninspired result is vexing because the crackerjack premise seems right up the director's alley. I Confess certainly starts on the right foot: an economical opening montage establishes place and motivating incident, and the murderer's confession that dissolves mid-stream is a classic piece of audience manipulation. But stolidity forms in the handling of the police investigation and a long flashback sequence detailing Clift and Baxter's courtship is needlessly drawn out with superfluous uses of slow-motion and extreme angles. One can almost feel Hitchcock straining to transcend banality purely through technical virtuosity, a description that applies just as well to the climactic courtroom scenes. Best of all is the priest's characterization: Clift's silent resolve could either be honorable, foolish, or masochistic depending on the viewer. Had the direction been more focused and the production more understated, this could have been a dynamic character study; as is, the film simply lacks juice and momentum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although filmed in Quebec City with some nice atmospheric mood and given a cast that includes MONTGOMERY CLIFT, ANNE BAXTER and KARL MALDEN, I CONFESS turns out to be a mediocre Hitchcock film hurt by a script that lacks logic and a pace that is too slow for a story calculated to build suspense.MONTGOMERY CLIFT is unable to do much more than appear confused and hesitant in his role as a priest who is torn by the knowledge he has that a killer has confessed his guilt--but the rules of the confessional means he has to keep his lips sealed. In a very peripheral role which is underwritten, ANNE BAXTER is smooth as a woman still in love with the priest but this angle of the story is never really developed fully enough. And KARL MALDEN has one of his weaker roles as a detective keeping his eye on things.The killer is at first made to seem sympathetic but soon turns out to be intent on ridding himself of anyone who wants to reveal the truth to the authorities. The most suspenseful moments occur only toward the end of the story with the climax taking place in the church.Summing up: Weak Hitchcock is still better than a lot of other stories of this type.Trivia note: Alfred Hitchcock wanted OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND for the role that eventually went to Anne Baxter. But when the part was reduced in the script, it was decided that it was too minimal for an actress of de Havilland's stature and negotiations were stopped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Hitchcock can't be on ALL the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't bad -- it's just not really anything. It suffers badly as it is now completely outdated with its blackmail and adultery premise. Even Montgomery Clift as a stoic priest is outdated. In our age of "Law and Order" and "Matlock," we all know that priests can't talk. It seems that this fact escaped this films' detectives and it doesn't occur to the priest to explain this to them: "I'd like to help, but I am constrained by my vows." But no, he'd rather look as though he's hiding something (trust me -- I'm not giving anything away, here).Like I said, it ain't bad, but it's not good...and that it's Hitchcock makes it all the more sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Workable variant on a popular theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I CONFESS, a relatively low budget and low profile black and white thriller made by Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950s, is another variant on a well-worn theme: that of the wronged man, pursued by the law for a crime he didn't commit. I found that this film lacks the dazzle and sense of style from Hitch's better known movies, while at the same time lacking the compelling drama of Hitch's later THE WRONG MAN, but it is a workable film nonetheless.The plot is a good 'un: a man confesses to murder to a priest, but the rules of priesthood mean that the priest is unable to reveal details of the confession to the police. The priest subsequently becomes a suspect himself due to his involvement with the crime, and all the while he can say nothing to anybody even though he knows who the killer is.I CONFESS is a perfectly serviceable film for both its genre and era. Hitch elicits typically strong performances from his cast, particularly the young and handsome Montgomery Clift as the put-upon priest and a youthful Karl Malden as the dogged detective on his tail.Some of the situations do feel a little stretched - I mean, surely the priest would give up his career in the priesthood and tell the cops everything before he got to trial? Better that than face a possible death sentence for the crime! Either that, or go to his superiors earlier on and ask for their advice. Nonetheless, the competence and experience of the director mean that this is entirely watchable, with plenty of suspense and a rousing finish to close it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the plus side: The early black and white photography in the murder sequence is striking. Monty Clift never looked better. A chance to see a Hitchcock film set not in Europe or the States, but in Canada!On the minus side: A huge overwrought narrated flashback is as klunky and heavy-handed as anything the fifties had to offer. It's very hard to watch. There's so little drama built into this format that Hitch allows the score to beat you over the head for impact. This could not have been a worse movie told in chronological order.The coincidences are far-fetched. Karl Malden is terrible. There just isn't enough story to be this sleep-inducing length</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dullness .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty dull HITCHCOCK film ruined by the slow pace, dull and unnecessary flashbacks and way too much Christian righteousness. And i could see the ending coming from miles. There was no real twist in the end. Though i did wonder if the priest was up to something fishy and there would be some kind of revelation but it was all very predicable.ANNE BAXTER looked bloated and was pretty irritating. It was a bit hard to digest CLIFT as a pious priest but he does turn in a good performance. KARL MALDEN was pretty cool but he did not have a big role. Most of the characters were quite dull.(5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too constructed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the less known Hitchcock films and I think, the reason for this is that it lacks the suspense and dark humour of his successful films. Priests who are not allowed to break their seal of confession have often been used in thrillers that were made for television and not high quality at all. You can see this movie as an analysis of the Catholic church: Lots of people are making their confessions to each other during the story, even the priest himself. There are interesting constellations of characters and many symbols but in my opinion, that's not enough. The plot is too speculative, too constructed and that makes it not that interesting for me. It's worth watching, if you're interested in Hitchcock's works, but as a thriller it bored me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Than Meets The Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film for some years when I caught it on TV. My opinion(s) have changed since the first viewing and since I've seen or re-seen all of Hitch's films, a certain new perspectives came into play. Guilt and oppressive authority pop up so often in the director's films, some times directly but quite often by insinuation. In this film, these two topics take a major role. It has been written that Montgomery Clift was drinking while the filming took place although I couldn't see anything in the final draft. I know also that he was "method" while Hitch was definitely not, so that might have been a source of conflict. Again, nothing was apparent on screen. Actually, the role of a priest in this work would not have been happy hunting ground for any method actor. Clift was settled on after a number of extremely good actors turned the role down. I've always enjoyed the visual aspect of Hitchcock's cinema and his daring "behind" the camera but in this film there was no room for unusual angles, editing brilliance or anything like that. It turned out to be a film of ideas and conflicts within agreements and there is nothing "cinematic" about that. I am happy to have seen this film once again as I would be with just about any film directed by Hitchcock, particularly during the fifties and sixties, but this once takes back seat to almost all of the others around it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trouble w/ "I, Confess"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this film is not an "under-rated masterpiece." Fr. Michael Wm. Logan is a compelling character and the story does build tension, but after Ms. Baxter's interrogation scene wouldn't common sense suggest to the Malden, or the Aherne character, or Ms. Baxter's husband, or ANYONE belonging to the parish, or the other priests, or ANYONE in Quebec City figure out that this noble priest isn't capable of murder and, especially after Clift's court room scene, wouldn't SOMEONE suggest to the police that maybe the priest heard the killer's confession! That was a major, visible hole in the plot that wasn't overcome by ole Hitch's direction.However, the last ten minutes are exciting as the killer is FINALLY found out and goes on the lam w/ our noble Fr. Logan STILL remaining silent about what he knows! Truly a remarkable portrayal of an individual of total spiritual integrity who believes utterly in the essential worth of all human beings, regardless of their spiritual condition ? and, believe me, the killer is not in good condition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is now recognized as one of the best in the Hitchcock series of motion pictures. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates true art in films. All of the actors are excellent. I cannot find one single fault with it with the exception it was made in black and white. Other then that, it has it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilt-riddled melodrama with Hitchcock on good form, except for flashbacks and dud ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some fabulous sequences in this typically Hitch, guilt-riddled melodrama; so if you're a Hitchcock fan you won't be disappointed; there are classy chunks of cinematic storytelling (ie without dialogue). The cast, particularly Karl Malden and Dolly Haas are excellent, but I found Anne Baxter way too purple, and curiously unappealing with her hair over-blonded. Monty Clift veers very close to over-egging the method acting, but his disturbed intensity does have a kind of hypnotic quality (when he doesn't just look plain deranged, or drunk). It's a good yarn, given excellent treatment by great photography, direction, and music. Although it's let down by a soppy flashback sequence, and a lazy ending, it's way better than later Hitch works like 'Topaz' or 'Family Plot'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is so obviously a one-trick pony and the 'gimmick' - the priest who hears the confession of a murderer but is bound by the laws of the church and thus cannot reveal it to anyone at all, let alone the police, occurs so early (approx one reel in) that the only reason for watching is if you are a fan/completist of someone connected to the project, writer, actor, director. Clearly the director - who I have always found vastly overrated and said as much over and over - has an abundance of admirers, the majority unfamiliar with the concept of the 'king's new clothes' so the film was always going to be reasonably well attended. For my part I am a great admirer of Monty Clift and Karl Malden. I have also found Anne Baxter to be, on the whole, a competent actress who excels in the right role - Five Graves To Cairo, All About Eve - but here she is barely adequate and there is no chemistry between her and Clift, which is rather unfortunate given that they were once lovers and she is still in love with him. There are two more excellent performances on offer and for some reason best known to the director himself or the Casting Director, both are German. O.E. Hasse had already appeared with Clift in The Big Lift about three years earlier and makes an excellent heavy but he is eclipsed - as are most of the cast - by Dolly Haas as his wife. This could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie I Have Seen in the Past Ten Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that "I Confess" is the ONLY film to which i have given a rating of "1" in all the years i have been coming to IMDb and rating films. It is a ghastly, embarrassingly bad, over-acted, under-plotted, intensely smarmy and "reverential" social drama. I had high hopes for it because it was on an IMDb list of "100 best film noir movies." What a joke! It is not a film noir movie. It is not a police procedural. It is not a psychological thriller. It is not an action thriller. It was a downright waste of film stock when it was released -- and now it is a downright waste of electrons.The only, and i mean the only, only, only reason to watch this movie is to get a nice look at the architecture and clothing of the era. Hitchcock never disappoints as a film director when it comes to the long shot, the composition of black and white, the interplay of light and shadow. Okay. That's out of the way. Turn the damnable thing into still frames and have done with it.There is no way to write a "spoiler" for this mess because it doesn't have an actual plot. Well, actually, it has what i call a "buzz-buzz plot" -- that is, the whole thing hinges on the type of scene that marks a failed script, where one character turns to another and says, "Here's what i want you to do ... i want you to (sound drops) buzz buzz buzz (scene cut)." That is it. THAT, friends, is the plot.Mongomery Clift is completely unconvincing as anyone's former love-interest or as a World War Two veteran or as a priest. His idea of emoting is to clench his jaw a little.And as for the classic goof with Anne Baxter's costume (detailed here in the "goofs" section) it is more than a little "goof" -- it is a jaw-droppingly obvlivious loss of filmic continuity that will make your head spin.The jumbled use of about 16 different forms of post-War French and British and American and Mittel-European accents is just the kind of thing that makes me wish that i was watching "The Third Man" with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten instead of this waste of Brian Aherne's time.Oh, and "reverential." I did mention that above. Please, if you want "reverential," do yourself a favour and watch "Going My Way" with Bing Crosby." Great film.Okay, i am done. My one consolation is that i will never have to watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>poor priest wrongfully charged!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>one of the hugest hole in the screenplay is the mystery solved in the second scene and whats left for the audience is to wait through, because you know one of the 2 things would happen in the end and, watch the fate of the poor priest.the script is weak for a thriller, don't why he, Hitchcock, chose it, Montgomery Clift is stiff as a stick, he's always except for one or 2 films of his....he's good looking but, can't act, now the plot, a maintenance guy kills a certain Villette, who's his part time employer too besides the church, accidentally, apparently, and he leaves all the evidence behind, he went in to steal but, guess what, he leaves all the cash intact and takes only 2 thousand dollars to start a new in 1953, why did he wore that robe and the hat when he went to kill him?? Villette is on the heels of a Ruth Grandfort blackmailing her for her affair with now priest, former lover, Montgomery Clift....and about this confession sanctity do priests have to abide by the rules even if their lives are hanging in balance???the start is good up to the confession then the cat's out of the bag and nothing to discover eh!you know what should have happened?? he should have taken the audience on a roller-coaster ride with this film by not disclosing the murderer and should have created many suspects 2 and more and everybody is suspecting those suspects but, there's another twist in the end and murderer is a fourth guy or the the original murderer is killed by another murderer and the police is in search of the first murderer. and the end is too boring/clichéd, this film no patch to his other creations.Malden is good as police investigator.</fullReview>
