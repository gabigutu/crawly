		<shortDescription>Get's my vote (with some reservations)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst most men would agree that giving women the vote was a dreadful mistake (put that stone down ladies?. it's just a joke), the astonishing story behind the UK social upheaval that was the Suffragette movement is well overdue a serious cinematic treatment. And a serious treatment Sarah Gavron's new film most certainly is: you exit the cinema feeling about as wrung out as the linen in the heroine Maud's workhouse-style laundry.Carey Mulligan plays Maud Watts, an ordinary and anonymous working woman who progressively gets sucked into the anarchic rabble-rousing of an East-end branch of the Pankhurst's Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). With operations run out of a chemist's shop by Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter) and her sympathetic husband, Maud risks a criminal record and the shame associated with that to pursue her ideals. Police pressure is applied by special forces copper Arthur Steed (Harry Potter's Brendan Gleeson) and personal pressure is put on her by her husband (played by Ben Whishaw, soon to be seen again as 'Q') and her alleged fitness to be a mother to their young son George (Adam Michael Dodd). As politicians continue to ignore the issue, the actions build to one of the most historic events of the period.The struggle is seen very much through the limited prism of this select group of women. But where I really liked this film is in the slow awakening of Maud's character. In many ways it is like the germination of a seed that we are seeing on the screen. She starts without any interest in the movement and even mid-way through the film she is adamant that she is "not a suffragette", despite evidence to the contrary. Mulligan is, as always, completely brilliant in the role.The supporting cast are all strong with Gleeson being particularly watchable as the lawman with a grudging respect for Maud and her cause. Meryl Streep makes a powerful cameo as Emily Pankhurst: but it is a short and sweet performance. Maud's friend Violet (Anne-Marie Duff) is also outstanding, her gaunt face delivering a haunting performance.Whilst there are some highly emotionally charged scenes in the film, in a political sense the film has a curious lack of passion at times. A keynote speech to Lloyd George for example should have been electric - yet the Abi Morgan's script doesn't quite do the scene justice and if I was the MP I wouldn't have been impressed (which perhaps was the point).I also had issues with some of the cinematography. Carey Mulligan has such an expressive and photogenic face that extreme close ups should work brilliantly. And yet filming it with a hand-held camera produces a constantly shifting image which was extremely distracting. Elsewhere in the art department though 1912 London is beautifully recreated, through both special effects, costume and make-up.Alexandre Desplat delivers a touching score with a clever underlying drumbeat of change.Suffragette is a solid historical drama, that tells an important social tale? a tale that graphically illustrates how much the world has really changed, and changed for the better, in a mere hundred years. Above all, the film concludes with the astounding fact that Switzerland only gave women the vote in 1971 (and in fact with one canton holding out on local issues until 1991).

		<shortDescription>Informative history of women's suffrage movement but composite character protagonist is pure agitprop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who are unfamiliar with the history of the women's suffrage movement in Britain, director Sarah Gavron and screenwriter Abi Morgan have reminded us that the more radical participants did not follow the non-violent civil disobedience program as promoted by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during the 1960s Civil Rights movement here in America. Quite the contrary, the suffrage movement leader in Britain, Emmeline Parnkhurst (played by Meryl Streep in a brief cameo), called for violent protest. And as the film makes clear, the violent nature of the protests escalated from broken shop windows to bombs thrown into mailboxes, clashes with police and even the arson torching of Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George's summer home.Gavron and Morgan tell this historical story through the fictional lens of their protagonist, Maud Watts, a laundress from a working class background. I would say their character is atypical of a woman of 1912, the year in which the Suffragette narrative begins. It's a much safer bet to believe that the average woman of that time was sympathetic to the cause but disapproved of tactics involving any kinds of violent resistance.While Maud might be atypical, Gavron and Moran argue in substance that she represents the type of radical Suffragette that actually was the catalyst in upsetting the social order, eventually leading to the vote for women. This was essentially Pankhurst's view initially too?that violence was the only language the men of the time understood. But the film's scenarists go a step further, suggesting that Maud is a symbol of victimization at the hands of a nefarious paternalistic society.Maud is not only betrayed by the male establishment politically (note how her brave impromptu speech in front of Lloyd George falls on deaf ears), but she is subjugated by a coterie of evil sexist males at every turn. These males include her loathsome boss who apparently has been molesting his female employees for years (presumably even Maude) as well as her co-worker husband, Sonny, who locks her out of the house after she's arrested and then puts Maud's beloved son up for adoption. Then there's the matrons and prison officials who brutalize Maud and her colleagues, force feeding them against their will, not to mention the police, who club women in broad daylight, following peaceful demonstrations.It's not that these things didn't happen, but it just seems all of them happen to Maud, making her less of a fully realized character and more fodder for agitprop. She even is part of the plot to firebomb Lloyd George's summer cottage. Fortunately there is one semi-fleshed out character that keeps things moderately interesting: the antagonist of the drama, Inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson), who tails Maud and her confederates, taking surveillance photos with his technologically innovative, newfangled camera. Steed has the best scene with Maud during a prison interview ?he informs her that the firebombing of Lloyd George's cottage almost claimed a victim?a housekeeper, who returned to the house after forgetting something and just missed being killed. Maud is nonplussed at Steed's "means to an end" diatribe and gets in her jabs in by pointing to the government's hypocrisy, who deny women their basic rights.The weakest part of the script involves the climax. How does one tie up Maud's story? Well, just forget about her and focus on the plight of Emily Davison who became a martyr to the Suffragette cause in 1913. Ms. Davison had the unfortunate idea of making a statement at the Epsom Derby where King George V's horse was running in the annual race. In front of three separate Pathe newsreel cameras that were filming the event, she stepped under the railing and on to the racetrack while the race was in progress (amazingly, you can watch it all on Youtube!). Some believed she wanted to commit suicide but a modern day blowup of the footage reveals she was attempting to pin a banner on the horse as it raced by. Unfortunately the horse perceived Ms. Davison as an obstacle to jump over, but missed, bowling her over and crushing her skull (she died after four days in a coma).We never do find out what happens to Maud after the tragic event at the Epsom Derby but do see actual newsreel footage of the thousands of women who attended Emily Davison's funeral?the true-life quiet dignity of her supporters outshines the perhaps misguided over aggressive militancy of a fictional Maud.Suffragette features a number of both fictional and non-fictional supporting players that give one a flavor for whom was involved in the women's suffrage movement. Carey Mulligan does well as Maud Watts, adroitly capturing the intensity of the composite character Gavron and Morgan have served up here.In the end the women's suffrage movement was a bit more complicated than one character's struggle against a monolithic sexist society. Notably Emmeline Pankhurst supported the British government during World War I and became a strident anti-Communist up until her death in 1928. As a basic history lesson, Suffragette manages to get a few things right historically about the women's suffrage movement, but is less convincing in its melodramatic treatment of its strident heroine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy But Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solid performances, great period design, and a historical event worth telling. Unfortunately, the script is clichéd, giving us two stock characters -- the Radicalized Innocent and the Worldly Wise Secret Policeman -- who go through their expected paces. You could probably tell the same story today with a European Muslim in the Carey Mulligan role.Getting involved in Suffragette activism upends the life of Mulligan's character, Maud. It cuts her off from her work, her husband, her child and her community, but it introduces her to a wider world of ideas and of people of a higher social class who she would never otherwise have known. It would have been fascinating to learn what became of Maud in her new milieu, what kind of job she found, and what kind of new life she built with her old one in ruins. In particular, it would have been interesting to see how she dealt with the new opportunities for English women created by World War I. That would have been an empowerment story to get involved in. But the movie just drops Maud with a historical footnote about when women got the vote in the UK and various other countries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its limitations, this is a finely crafted British film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can be risky critiquing a film homage to heroines of feminism, especially one with a star cast that includes Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Ben Whishaw and a Meryl Streep cameo. Respect for the cause, however, does not guarantee respect for the film, and this one chooses a very limited lens with which to view this episode of history. It does have high production values, narrative authenticity and sensitivity for the feminist struggle in early 20th century Britain. But it gets lost in balancing the broader sweep of history that shapes gender relations and the impact of particular individuals.The story line is uni-linear, the atmosphere dark and claustrophobic, and much of the acting is melodramatic, with long close-ups of Mulligan's finely nuanced expressions recording her progress from an abused laundry worker to what today would be called a radicalised political terrorist. The historical lens is so myopic that you could walk away believing the vote was won by a few protesting women, the bombing of some public letterboxes and a suffragette who threw herself under the King's horse. No more struggle?job done! Of course, that is not true and the struggle continues.Despite these limitations, it's a finely crafted British film. The fictional heroine Maude Watts is an avatar for the British working class women who risked everything, including their lives, in fighting for the vote. Men of all classes are the demons of this tale, and one of its chilling insights is how the most dangerous enemies of suffragettes were husbands. Patriarchal governments left it to ordinary menfolk to sort out their unruly women in an era where wives were legally subordinate to husbands. Maude's contempt for her treatment at work and home propels her into the swirling orbit of violent protest where "war is the only language men listen to". Evicted by her husband for shaming him, she is left with nothing; by law, even her son was her husband's property. During the struggles, over one thousand British women were imprisoned and treated shamefully, a fact only acknowledged in the film's closing credits. Admittedly, historical judgement is difficult to translate into cinematic language, but many films have done it better. If you are interested in the history of feminist struggle from the viewpoint of the small people who made up the bigger story you will like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decidedly grim, sadly it never fully engages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Suffragette for the second time I had hoped to have formed a different opinion, initially I left the cinema feeling bored and underwhelmed. The problem I'd say I have with it is that I find it strangely vacuous, on no level can I connect with it, or any of its characters. That is not to say that I find the acting bad, indeed far from it, there are some cracking performances, Carey Mulligan, Anne Marie Duff and for the amount she's actually in it, Helena Bonham Carter. Mulligan delivers frustration and despair well, she loses her family, her job, dignity and lashes out on her pig of a boss.I found it a little like a grim version of Made in Dagenham with hats on. There are much better sources out there detailing the Suffragette movement, I know it's a film, but the core essence of what was being demanded, and exactly who was demanding it seemed to be lacking. Why wasn't there a single sympathetic man in the entire film, surely every single man at the time was the same? Even lovely Ben Whishaw was nasty.Meryl Streep's speech was the highlight of the film, she had presence and added a realism to the character, in her all to brief appearance.It's not the easiest film to get through, it leaves you feeling a little flat, with the cast and subject matter it could have been special, I wonder had it been made on the small screen as a series would it have worked better? A few lighter touches would have truly helped. I thought the credits at the end were a nice touch.Disappointing, 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy and accomplished but somehow lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of how in 1912 and 1913 British women fought for the right to vote is immensely worthy, technically accomplished and well-acted but, as cinema, it somehow fails to engage. At the conclusion of the movie, we are reminded that it was not until 1928 that full women's suffrage was achieved in the UK and even today women in a country like Saudi Arabia do not have the vote. The very act of creating this film is a contemporary testimony to female equality since, as well as all the lead acting roles, women fill the positions of writer (Abi Morgan) and director (Sarah Gavron) as well as producers (six out of the nine). The female domination of "Suffragette" serves to underline how few films ate directed and written by women and how underpaid female actors are compared to their male counterparts. The struggle for equality is not over.Although the leadership of the suffragette movement came from middle-class women, Morgan has chosen to tell the story through the eyes of a working class laundry worker Maud Watts, wonderfully portrayed by Carey Mulligan - whom I have admired since her performance in "An Education" (2009) - who is brought into the movement by fellow worker Violet (Anne-Marie Duff). Other suffragettes are played by Helena Bonham- Carter (actually a descendant of a Prime Minister who opposed votes for women), Romola Garai (whose career does not seem to have taken off as much as she deserves), and - in an all too tiny cameo - Meryle Streep as Emmeline Pankhurst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hard to watch this one without becoming angry...or incredibly sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a fictionalized story of a woman caught up in the suffrage movement in Britain in the early 20th century. Carry Mulligan plays Maud Watts...a woman who slowly comes into the movement and the sacrifices she personally made as a result.I noticed that a few of the reviews on IMDb hated the film and by the way they worded the reviews, they seemed upset that women earned the right to vote or thought women never had fight to achieve this!! Strange...very strange. Women DID have to fight and fight hard to earn their rights and the film does a very nice job of it. Why anyone would give the film a 1 or see it as some lie is just baffling...and ignorant of British history. The fictionalized life of Carry Mulligan's is essentially true of many women and the horrific event concerning Emily Davison DID occur in 1913....so why hate that the film dramatizes this?Overall, the film is extremely compelling and very emotional to watch. Seeing women abused and mistreated is tough....and should grab your heart. Well acted and worth seeing. My only complaint is ts are that the film, at times, is a bit sterile...which is odd considering the events. And, it uses a modern device I hate--the roving camera (hold that camera still #@&amp;@#%^...it's NOT arsty to have bad camera work--particularly on closeups). Still, well worth seeing-- particularly for teens to realize how bad things were and how far we've come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The high price of Votes For Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scripted by Abi Morgan, who gave us THE IRON LADY four years ago, this is a finely judged snapshot of a key year (1912-13) in the decades-long battle for women to get the vote in England. Meryl Streep has brief but commanding appearances as cranky old Mrs Pankhurst, imperiously redirecting her campaign from the ruling class to the working class. The key character here is the fictitious Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan), a young laundrywoman and mother who is drawn into the new campaign of 'civil disobedience', which will soon include blowing up post boxes and cutting telegraph wires. Of the male characters, only Helena Bonham Carter's husband (Finbar Lynch) is sympathetic to the Cause. Brendan Gleeson's police inspector is well-served by the writer: central to the brutally repressive treatment of the Suffragettes, he is allowed a moment of doubt towards the end. Ben Whishaw seems uncomfortable in the challenging role of Maud's husband, totally intolerant her involvement with the Movement.This is, in the fullest possible sense, a Women's Picture, written and directed (Sarah Gavron) by women, and it is the women who make it work and make it pull at your heartstrings. Bonham-Carter, Anne-Marie Duff and Romola Garai give telling performances. Carey Mulligan, who somehow didn't seem to get the period right in the remake of FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, is at her absolute best here, utterly convincing as an oppressed working mother reluctantly drawn into the campaign to give women fairer pay and a voice in the governance of the realm. The Dickensian factory-sized laundry (a museum piece or a reconstruction?) is magnificently awful, and the teeming crowd scenes outside Parliament and at the fateful Epsom Derby suggest the production must have had a good budget (or some crafty CGI). There are moments of humour in the grim struggle, but this movie brings to life vividly and touchingly the high price paid by some women to obtain the right to vote for all women.</fullReview>

Despite their best efforts with good performances, there's something lacking in this film, the emotion is just not there. Something doesn't work, maybe the script but I had high hopes and I couldn't wait to see this film and now I feel like I haven't missed out on anything special.The story also is a bit sketchy.It's a shame this was a great opportunity to show and probably educate many people about how hard it has been to make progress in certain aspects of history.

		<shortDescription>A Well Acted Farce of Reality and History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As expected from the famous, wealthy, and successful white female actresses in the movie, the acting was quite good. For those familiar with the infamous Patricia Arquette Oscar speech, you will notice that several of these exceedingly wealthy, famous, privileged, white women were the ones giving a standing ovation after that speech.The real damage and sickness of this movie is that its presents its self as a true, accurate, and real bit of history. Yet it is as close to an accurate portrayal of history as Star Wars. If the movie had been set in a farcical alternate reality it would have been mildly more palatable. The vastly inaccurate history mixed with the disgusting demonization of all things male puts this film firmly in the same category as the Nazi Films that demonized Jews. The feminist zealotry of the movie glosses over the real historical events. It fails to show the real work for equal voting rights that men worked every bit as hard at getting (In favor of sticking to a feminist; men are bad, women are good, ideology). That most people, men included, did not have the right to vote was all to conveniently left out. The suffragists, composed of men &amp; women, lobbied for 1 person = 1 vote. It was the Suffragettes who were openly racist and only wanted white, upper class women to have the vote, another reality conveniently missing from the movie. Another glaring omission was that the right to vote was to go hand in hand with the "Draft" or military service to ones country and the Suffragettes were completely against women having the same responsibilities as men. And women did get the Right to vote without the Obligation to serve...except in Israel, and most non Western countries. The open violence of the Suffragettes is accurate; they were very violent and relied on societies unwillingness to imprison women to get away with arson, bombings, beatings, and larceny. At the time they did vastly more harm to getting the vote than any good and today would be viewed as terrorists. If not for the actions of the Suffragettes the vote would have most likely occurred nearly a decade sooner!Do not waste your time, if your looking for man-hating misandry and feminist lies simply visit tumblr, Facebook, or any of the several feminist website rags that claim to be "magazines" and get your fill. Its cheaper and the lies are the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ideological Propaganda With Little Grounding In Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another user here put it best when saying it is "a fundamentalist feminist glossing over of a nuanced historical series of events, which fails to show the real work for equal voting rights (which most people, men included, did not have at this point in history) was done by the suffragISTS (not the suffragettes), composed of men &amp; women, who lobbied for 1 person = 1 vote...rather than the openly racist suffragettes who only wanted white, upper class women to have the vote. At this point in history, usually only white, upper class men holding large property holdings could vote (although some women holding equivalent property, for example widows running a business, with a number of employees could and DID vote.)"The Suffragettes were (rightly) seen at the time as violent and irrational terrorists, attacking people, blowing up buildings and making plans to assassinate the Prime Minister. The historical revisionism of this film and the present day feminist narrative of history in general does a great disservice to the reality of the time. Rather than win women the vote, it's very likely the suffragettes delayed it happening, because their violent actions made it impossible for the government of the day to address the issue and not be seen to be giving in to terrorists. At the time this film is set, the vast majority of men did not have the vote either, and it has been estimated that 9 out of 10 of the men who died in the trenches of the first world war did so without that privilege. Men as a class 'got' the vote the same year all women over 30 did: 1918. But of course, even though a matter of historical record, this is not something the film can address at all without discrediting both the suffragettes cause and its own reason for existing.The depiction of almost all the men, too, as an inhuman, monolithic class of brutal oppressors is also mean-spirited, ahistorical and unpleasantly manipulative, and it's hard to imagine such scapegoating being considered acceptable today if it were any other group of people being vilified in this manner.The film is very well-acted, particularly by Streep and Carey Mulligan, it's just a shame they worked so hard on such an ugly and dishonest piece of ideological propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid film, but does not fulfill its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suffragette" is a British 105-minute movie that was initially considered one of the big players during awards season, but came surprisingly short in pretty much all areas. And that includes Carey Mulligan playing the lead character, a young woman who gets sucked in by England's women's movement in the early 20th century. It is all about getting the right to vote. Helena Bonham Carter plays one of the major supporting players and Meryl Streep appears in one scene during which she gives a speech to the women listening to her. The director is Sarah Gavron and maybe she is not yet good enough to deal with such a star-studded cast as the outcome was a bit underwhelming given the material she had in terms of the cast.The script comes from Emmy winner Abi Morgan, who has also written "Shame" and "The Iron Lady" and here I see room for improvement as well. This is without a doubt a really important story, but somehow they did not really manage to bring true overwhelming emotion to the audience. Of course, the times were dark (World War 1) and most of the action takes place in British industrial cities, so I am not saying this should be an uplifting movie of any kind because it would not have worked as such. But it should have done a better job in letting us feel the injustice that the characters complain about. Brendan Gleeson has one or two good moments, but overall he cannot make this a great watch either. Quite a shame as I really like him and Mulligan, so I hoped this could have been better. Of course, I am not saying this is a weak film, not at all, but I personally believe there was potential in this story for a lot more than they actually delivered. Still I give it a cautious thumbs-up. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim but interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The suffragette movement isn't that often dramatized so this well intentioned if grim movie makes an interesting watch.The good points about this movie: it shows that it wasn't just about the right to vote, it was about getting better conditions for exploited women workers and rights for mother's rights. Also with all the terrorism these days it is quite a revelation to see how a hundred years ago these British women were carrying acts of rebellion and terror with their bombs and explosives (the difference is of course damaging property and not aiming to hurt innocent people).The cast performs well. As the main character, Carey Mulligan is always more than competent at acting sad even though she looks less down turned at the mouth than usual. Her character is a fictional composite and I think it doesn't ring true enough. Giving up her husband and child for the cause just seems too far fetched. Helena Bonham is less irritating than usual as a pharmacist/activist. Ben Whishaw (Q from the latest Bonds) is quite convincing here as a husband of Carey's character. He usually acts quirky roles and it's interesting to see him playing a conventional character for a change. Meryl makes only a brief appearance as a famous suffragette.Even for such a serious topic and subject matter there is something just too grim and depressing about this movie. The force feeding was quite shocking to see. There isn't an uplifting feel at the end because the progress was just described briefly in post scripts. Why show just the struggle but no progress? Also the suicidal woman Emily at the horse races seemed a bit inconsiderate about the jockey.It is an interesting if grim movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember that light-hearted song, Sister Suffragette? Its not the mood of this fine but somber film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the second decade of the 20th century, women in Britain are still fighting for the right to vote. Although the movement has been going on, with peaceful demonstrations for years, it hasn't brought the dream. Therefore, the new-fashioned Suffragettes are resorting to violence, in a manner of speaking. This involves setting mailboxes on fire with small explosives, etc. Maud (Carey Mulligan) is a laundress who has worked at the same place from childhood. She's seen the hardships of burns, scaldings, physical injuries and more. Now, on a way to delivery a package, she runs into a Suffragette in the act of breaking windows. Later, she learns there is a fellow worker, Violet (Anne Marie Duff) who is dedicated to the women's voting rights cause, too. Slowly, though Maud is married to Sonny (Ben Whishaw) and has a young son who is the light of her eyes, this laundress chooses to join the militant gals. A lady doctor, Edith (Helena Bonham Carter) also operates meetings in a back room at the pharmacy run by her sympathetic husband. At one demonstration, the ladies are beaten by the British bobbies. The gals even hear the great lady Suffragette, Mrs. Pankhurst (Meryl Streep) give a speech about keeping on, even though she may be under house arrest. But, as Maud gets in deeper, her employer finds out about her activities and, what else, fires her, just as her husband decides to lock her out of the house. With such extreme hardships, will it all be for naught or will women get the vote? This fine film has a somber, sad, bleak atmosphere from the get-go, with little levity. The subject matter is so serious that the writer and director obviously feel there can be no sweetness and light to get this history on celluloid. So, its not an easy watch. But, the excellent cast, from Mulligan to Duff, Bonham Carter, Whishaw, Streep, Romula Garai and the rest are to be commended for their great work. Then, too, the sets, costumes, and historical ambiance is quite wonderful. Most important, ladies the world over will never be able to pay the debt they owe to these brave, brave women. Yet, at least, by viewing this movie and its kin, all can make a vow never to forget the Suffragettes who gave their all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-Telling of a Seminal Moment in British Women's History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago the BBC did a series SHOULDER TO SHOULDER (1974) that told the story of the origins and development of the Women's Movement in Britain, with special attention paid to the WSPU (Women's Social and Political Union).Sarah Gavron's film revisits the same territory as it tells the story of the gradual awakening of Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) as she sets her marriage and family aside in favor of the Women's Movement. The crux of the action centers around the death of Emily Wilding Davison (Natalie Press) at the 1913 Derby, as she stepped out in front of the horses finishing the race and was crushed to death.In view of the film's earnestness of purpose, it seems a shame to criticize it. However there are certain jarring elements that do stand out. Abi Morgan's screenplay seems uncertain whether to focus on the political or the familial elements. Maud's husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw) is just too placid a personality to become truly angry about his wife's decision to embrace the Suffagette cause, and the emotional scene where he decides to let his son George (Adam Michael Dodd) to for adoption is straight out of KRAMER VS. KRAMER. Director Gavron seems too concerned with showing tight close-ups of Mulligan's face as she struggles her way through a dead-end job at the local laundry. Hence we get little sense of the slave-like existence pursued by most working-class women at that time. Meryl Streep, in the cameo of role of Emmeline Pankhurst, simply reprises her Margaret Thatcher turn in THE IRON LADY (2011).On the other hand, the film does have its moments, especially when Maud goes to the Houses of Parliament and ends up talking about her life in front of David Lloyd George (Adrian Schiller). We get the sense of how much courage it takes to speak up in front of a group of unsympathetic middle-aged men. Helena Bonham Carter is quite surprisingly good as Edith Ellyn, especially in a sequence where she and her co- conspirators plan to blow up a private property constructed for Lloyd George's personal pleasure. The way Edith grinds up the gunpowder reveals her inherent anger at the ways in which women are treated.The ending is also powerful, as Gavron fades out from the film into faded black-and-white films of Emily Davison's actual funeral taken in 1913. Through this technique we are made aware of the film's importance to an understanding of British social history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we struggle and grapple with contemporary inequality issues ? race, the economic divide, gay rights, etc ? it is well to see this film, reminding us that it has been less than a century since women's rights were recognized and women made equal to men in voting, parental rights (if not economic equality?.) and presence in politics and entertainment. Abi Morgan's script is excellent as is Sarah Gavron's direction, and with the superlative support of a cast of gifted actors this film breathes reality, memory, and reminders of a status struggle of the fairly recent past.SUFFRAGETTE tracks the story of the foot soldiers of the early feminist movement, women who were forced underground to pursue a dangerous game of cat and mouse with an increasingly brutal State in England. These women were not primarily from the genteel educated classes; they were working women who had seen peaceful protest achieve nothing. Radicalized and turning to violence as the only route to change, they were willing to lose everything in their fight for equality - their jobs, their homes, their children and their lives. Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) was one such foot soldier. The opposite side of the feminist movement is well presented by Maud's husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw (on of the more gifted actors on the screen today) who provides a degree of bilateral balance, a man who loves his wife and child and simply does not want to see his family endangered by Maud's growing involvement in the movement. Other brilliant performances are offered by Anne-Marie Duff, Romola Garai, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleason, Natalie Press and Meryl Streep as the queen of the movement Emmeline Pankhurst.The story of Maud's fight for dignity is as gripping and visceral as any thriller, it is also heart breaking and inspirational. An altogether brilliant film. Grady Harp, February 16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ticks some boxes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first feature film I can remember dealing with the fight for women's voting rights in the United Kingdom, puts its subject across respectfully, if carefully. Most of the major events I've read about historically on the movement's road to enfranchisement are covered in the film, like the letterbox campaign, attack on Lloyd George's house, their hunger strike and resultant force-feeding in prison and most famously the shocking martyrdom of Emily Davidson who ran onto Epsom racecourse on Derby Day in front of the King's horse, are all depicted, the latter very realistically. The device used by the writer and director to get the viewer close to the action is through the invented Carey Mulligan character Maud Watts, a young factory worker, docilely married to her husband and the doting mother of their infant son who develops an interest in the suffragette movement through a work colleague. Stepping in for the latter at an important consultation with a UK Government committee on votes for women, she finds herself, initially unwillingly, drawn into activism on behalf of the cause.I did feel the film somewhat overdid her travails and some of the coincidental events in her life. We learn indirectly that her male employer has abused her at work since she was a child and who is now doing so to another pre-teen girl at the factory. Her husband doesn't understand her new found politicism and in short order expels her from their house, denying her access to her son and eventually having him adopted without her knowledge. She too is the one accompanying Davidson at the Derby. While I laud the equally important political point of maternal rights to their children in the event of marital separation being argued along with voter's rights, I did feel that the world seemed to resolve too much around Mulligan's character. She thus comes across more as a cipher than a real person and the film might have played better if she had been based on a real person.I also felt the sub-plot about the child-molesting boss jarred somewhat and belonged in a different film entirely, the two main causes didn't need this extra justification, heinous as the crimes are. While I'm criticising, I also felt the cliff-hanging direction style employed (especially in the build-up to the Derby climax) was overdone with looming orchestral swells in the background and a virtual countdown to the incident itself, to be somewhat inconsistent with the seriousness of the subject matter.The acting is good by most of the leads, Mulligan in particular. Quite why they rolled out the barrel to find a place in the cast for Meryl Streep to deliver a brief but showy cameo as the cause's figurehead Emmeline Pankhurst, I don't know. Nevertheless in its gritty depiction of the privations and struggles of the brave women who challenged the male-dominated political landscape of the day, this film deserves admiration and recognition for its subject matter if not quite for its execution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's more inspiring than a film about half the population, fighting back against the corrupt system, which oppresses it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'SUFFRAGETTE': Four Stars (Out of Five)Historical drama flick; about the beginning of the first feminist movement, in early 1900's Britain. It was directed by Sarah Gavron and written by Abi Morgan. It stars Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleeson, Ben Whishaw, Anne-Marie Duff, Natalie Press and Meryl Streep (in a cameo appearance). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it could possibly become an upcoming awards contender. I found the movie to be educational, somewhat emotional (at times) and inspiring.The film tells the story of a 24-year-old young woman, named Maud Watts (Mulligan). Maud was a wife, mother and laundress; in the UK, during the early 1900's. One day, while trying to deliver a package, she recognizes a co-worker, named Violet (Duff), who's involved in a suffragette riot (destroying windows). Maud is later asked to testify, for the right to vote, in place of Violet; due to the fact that Violet's husband severely beat her. After that, Maud gets extremely caught up in the movement; much to the disappointment of her husband, Sonny (Whishaw), who kicks her out of their house, because of it. Maud continues to sacrifice more and more, for the fight, including losing contact with her young son, George (Adam Michael Dodd).I really like movies about rebellion; and what's more inspiring than a film about half the population, fighting back against the corrupt system, which oppresses it? In that way, the movie can't miss. It's well directed, decently written and powerfully acted (Mulligan is especially impressive in the lead). Streep is only in one scene of the film; and it's extremely manipulative, for the advertisers to have used her so much to sell the movie (that's not the filmmakers' fault though). I only wish the film would have been a little more emotional; it's very dramatic at times, but it seems like it could have done a little more.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/CoUgbXLzKSQ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not relate to the protagonist enough, as she offended me a bit. Yes, I support all people to have equal rights regardless if I witness people complain instead of doing things to prove their worthiness. Also, I see some historical incorrectness in this film that made me DVD-eject prone. The only person on this film that satisfied me was Helena Bonham Carter. She may have taken this as a cash grab to support her family, herself, and/or to keep the acting skills refined. Otherwise, the directing was okay coming from a female director. The female director is not scorned for me, it is the script writer. Actresses and actors that played on this were only doing their job. I hope Suffragette is a lesson never to be remade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Ensemble Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the bonus features on the DVD of "Suffragette," it was clear that the film was an enterprise filmed almost exclusively with women performers and film artists. Led by director Sarah Gavron, the film successfully told the story of the women's suffrage movement in England in the early twentieth century.The screenwriters conceived a fictionalized protagonist named Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan), who was a composite of various women fighting in the England for the right to vote. Maud has been exploited in her work in the Glasshouse Laundry in Bethnal Green. She testifies in Parliament about the horrible working conditions for women, then joins the suffragettes led by the iconic figure of Emmeline Pankurst (Meryl Streep).Maud's family life is explored in the relationship with her husband who controls all aspects of her life. He eventually evicts Maud for her activism, and he places their child up for adoption, to the horror of the mother.The film relates the how the police used state-of-the art cameras to photograph the women in their meetings, as well as the horrid conditions in prison, including the force-feeding of women who went on a hunger strike. The tragic story of Emily Wilding Davison, who threw herself under the King's horse during the derby in 1913 is reenacted in great detail.In the production values of the film, the VFX computer technology allowed the film artists to recreate crowd scenes and to convey the architectural style of East London in the early twentieth century. The crew of this film was the first to be allowed to film inside the hallowed walls of Parliament. The only downside of the production values was the extremely dark cinematography throughout the film.The film's action begins in 1912, and the end crawl informs the viewer that by 1918, a breakthrough in women's suffrage had started in England in the immediate aftermath of World War I. Maud Watts was convincingly portrayed by Carey Mulligan, who brings an earnest and moving interpretation of her character. The film was exceptionally well cast with memorable performances.As opposed to making an historical film, the director wanted to transcend the period of the suffrage movement to speak to us today about women's right across the world. The film was successful in depicting how the women's suffrage movement knew no class boundaries either in 1912 or today.</fullReview>

Vote For Women. The film, of course, the task is not an abstract in the tale underline the organization, but an inspiration to defenders of freedoms and rights that the road is still long and that they were only the first step.

		<fullReview>I watched this film somewhat guardedly, as I was not looking forward to the inevitably graphic depictions of forced feeding. When they finally arrived they were as expected, fairly grim. Suffragettes was a little understated for me. A bit like a stew with some vital ingredient missing, but it was hard to say exactly what. I found it difficult to connect with many of the characters, though this was not for want of trying.The costumes and scenery were wonderful, and I enjoyed much of the camera work. A couple of reviewers on here hint at historical inaccuracies, but they are mistaken. Working class women (and yes, men too!) really were instrumental in gaining women the vote. The clichéd idea that it was all about shouty white middle class females with bricks is just that. Or, at best, it is a partial truth - which is little better than a lie in my estimationIn fact, Asian women, some of whom faced destitution at the time, also took part, involving themselves in a broader union movement. The fact that history is often inaccurately taught in schools, and that some people cannot be bothered to research what actually happened, is probably to blame here.I tend to agree that this was a worthy, rather than a brilliant, effort. Perhaps one day, a better film will be made about the uphill struggle women faced to enfranchise themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffragette</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many other "based on a true story" films, Suffragette takes wide liberties with the historical facts in order to refine the narrative and simplify the complex factors which influenced the socio- political movement to allow female vote in the UK; however, screenwriter Abi Morgan made the good decision not to focus on historical celebrities, but on an ordinary woman, who was away from politics, whose indifference became activism when she could recognize the importance of a government chosen by the whole population, and not only the male half. Carey Mulligan brings another one of her emotive performances, full of details and dramatic resonance, without losing any spontaneity. The rest of the cast also makes a perfect work, highlighting Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff. On the negative side, I think director Sarah Gavron kinda abused of close-ups and hand-held camera during some dramatic moments. I understand the fact that she attempted to highlight the characters' emotions, but at the same time, I think it decreased the clarity of those scenes a bit. Nevertheless, I think Suffragette is quite a good film, not only due to its noble intentions, but also because of its artistic and technical attributes. Its critical principle transcends the characters in order to clear out the fact that even though one battle was won, the war for the rights of women is still in force. The story Suffragette tells us reached its ending, but the fight still remains nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oppression and rebellion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1912. Peaceful demonstrations have achieved little for suffrage in Britain. Suffragettes are resorting to vandalism. Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) is a young mother working in a laundry for most of her life. She suffered under her lascivious boss Mr. Taylor. Co-worker Violet Miller recruits her into the movement. After testifying to Minister Lloyd George, the government still refuses to give the vote. Maud is beaten and arrested along with MP wife Alice Haughton (Romola Garai), Violet and Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter). Police inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson) leads the effort to suppress the rebels. Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep) urges the women to fight. After another arrest, Maud is thrown out by her husband Sonny Watts (Ben Whishaw) and by law, loses her rights to her own son.One would expect an uplifting feel-good inspirational movie from the subject matter. The fact is that this is a dour, depressed telling of the struggle that is not simply marching and sit-ins. The violence is brutal but it's the overwhelming oppression that is even more brutal. The downtrodden acting by Carey Mulligan is superb. It is a movie of suffering and women with no choice but to rebel.</fullReview>

Both the stories take place 50 years apart, but this one was the beginning of a new era for women, not without sacrifices and sufferings.Great actors, great actings, awesome storytelling, cinematography at its best, direction was amazing and the music was so pleasant, but the method of dealing was a bit gruesome, and sometimes brutal. I thought the terrorism is a new word, but this movie gives a different perspective and meaning to that.You would definitely love this film if you respect women. All women cast movie, including the director, but for everyone. It might have begun in the UK, but the entire planet saw a drastic change and still taking place in some places.

For all the men critics who have reviewed this movie and gave it a bad review for whatever reason. Enough. You really have no right to judge.

		<fullReview>Western movies of the 1930-50ies related to an actual historical period, vaguely had something to do with actual historical events, and they sure were entertaining. I had the same feeling when I was watching Suffragette. It's well acted and filmed, and relatively entertaining (of course, defending a fort against the Indians has more oomph to it than standing up against the evil manager of a washhouse).The film sets out to portray how women finally got the right to vote, but in my opinion it manages to get it pretty wrong. The narration goes "women don't have the vote, then Meryl Streep, erm, Emmeline Pankhurst shows up, throws a few publicity stunts, and walla!". That's scriptwriting 101. More interesting questions would have been: * Why was Pankhurst (and her organisation) so aggressive against Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson, of all people? * Did her terrorism really help to further her cause, and how so? * What other advocates of women's suffrage were there? What were the dynamics between them? * What was the state of men's suffrage at the time? * What happened in the fifteen years between culmination of the film, the Epsom derby suicide stunt, and the eventual granting of the right to vote to women in the UK in 1928? It's not as if the one smoothly led to the other.By the way, why is Emmeline Pankhurst shown as a privileged woman? From the movie I'd have thought that she was nobility. But in reality, she wasn't, she came from a middle class background.</fullReview>

The director should also have taken much closer control of the cinematography, which was truly awful. Deliberate hand-held jerkiness, lots of "soft" focus shots, meaningless cutaways and a generally poor quality were very surprising.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) is a young mother and family woman who works in a factory, in a time when women are not allowed to vote and paid significantly less than men. She is dramatically introduced to the Suffragette movement, lead by Emily Pankhurst (Meryl Streep) one evening whilst returning from work, and quickly becomes a solid fixture. However, her actions drive a rift between her and her husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw) and cause her to become separated from her beloved son George (Adam Michael Dodd), as well as pressure from dogged Inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson) to inform on them. But she presses on with her comrades, into a journey of dedication, loyalty and sacrifice.In the modern world, it's all too easy to imagine that every freedom and liberty that everyone has has always been there, and that there was never any great struggle or sacrifice to make it so. Yet, less than a hundred years ago, it had still not come into law for women to express their voice in a democracy. The Suffragette movement is a tale that's long been crying out for a dramatization on the big screen, and has been referenced in films before, most notably Mary Poppins, and here Sarah Gavron delivers a brilliantly made and acted production that does the movement justice.Carrying the film as she is, a lot of weight rests on Mulligan's shoulders, and it's wonderful that her performance is so excellent, emerging like a blossoming flower as a timid, mild mannered girl who becomes wrapped up in something bigger than her and gradually adapts to becoming more militant and determined. She's complimented by quite a striking support cast, including Whishaw, Gleeson and Helena Bonham Carter. That Meryl Streep was willing to accept such a small, walk on role is testament either to the producers money, or a genuine affection she may have developed for these sort of English historical dramas, after her renowned turn in The Iron Lady.Gavron has certainly delivered something special, a long overdue drama that highlights the hardship, injustice, indignity and inhumanity that had to be endured in order to make something right, with a nice touch ending highlighting how it changed all over the world, as well as being fairly short and sweet by the standards of these types of productions. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The women become terrorists in early 20th century England. To get the right to vote.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Suffrage' is a curious word, it simply means having the right to vote in elections. Thus a 'suffragette' is a woman who is working towards getting that right for women.My wife and I saw this movie at home, on DVD from our public library. There are a couple of interesting extras on making the movie.The suffragette movement in the early 1900s England has great historical significance. Starting with an act in the early 1800s women were forbidden from voting, a move by the male ruling class to keep them underfoot. Not only did they not have a right to vote, they often worked longer and harder than men but got paid less. They were even subject to arrest and jail time just for meeting and discussing the suffrage movement.While the movement and most facts in the timeline here are accurate, Carey Mulligan, about 30 during filming, plays a fictional but composite character, 24-yr-old Maud Watts. She works in the local laundry, the place she was born. She never knew a father and her mother died young. When one of her co-workers invited her to attend a meeting she said she wasn't interested. She didn't want to make waves, the attitude a large portion of women at that time took.But after she saw some of the atrocities towards women, and witnessed her own husband's disapproval, she soon became an active member.The movement was not without great controversy, as the women resorted to what might be considered terrorist tactics. Throwing rocks through windows of businesses, exploding homemade bombs in mail receptacles, cutting communications wires, even burning down the almost complete home of a politician. Finally after WW1 women began to get rights and by 1928 were given full rights. Some argue that the terrorism actually delayed their getting voting rights, but we can never know because what happened happened.Good movie and Mulligan is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what happened here? A decently sized budget, with a cast that have proved themselves various times before with a pretty decent soundtrack (although very copied from other soundtracks from other, better films) sounds like a formula for a 10/10 film right? Well that's not exactly it. For a few hours after my viewing I couldn't decide weather this film was articulate or terribly made, and I'm afraid to say it's just terribly made.Let's begin with the acting: No real complaints there, no one was exactly bad but no one shined at all, and I can't blame the actors because the script really lacked in ability to help them. The child actor was terrible. In a specific scene which I shall not spoil but I will say it's supposed to be very emotional, there was no expression in the kid's face whatsoever; at one point you could see tears from his cheeks but it was so obvious that they interrupted the scene just so they could add fake tears because he can't act. Another complaint about the acting is that there was little to no Meryl Streap... 0/1000000 for that I'm afraid.Now given the whole film and it's political message, I bared in mind just how that message would be portrayed; Would I be beat over the head with it, will it tell me to hate men, will it make stand at the corner of streets with signs telling me to vote women, or will it subtly cue me in, will it let me form my own opinion? No. It beat me more than the men in this film beat the woman. Every single time we are shown a male every aspect of the film begins screaming at us "Hate this man, hate him now or you are a horrible human specimen". We get this right from get go, with narration from equal rights protests and t... okay hang on... t... text... as if it weren't black and white enough already. Text at the beginning of a film that does nothing other than explain the world the film has set up for us, is a pet peeve of mine, because everything is later explained anyway, sometimes in great ways which let us to absorb the information rather than be spoon fed it.The character logic was also pretty horrendous. I get it, the director really wanted us to be angry at what we're being shown by having the women just walk away from a conflict even though there were literally so many things they could have said to end the argument, and if that's what they're going for then it could have been coordinated a little better, because instead of being annoyed at the conflict and message, I was annoyed at the script for its terrible understanding of human psychology.The cinematography also was hand-held... there you go, need I say more? Horrible fast cuts, not sure what's going on... and so on.The sound design also really bugged me. Our protagonists work environment is a loud steam... place... thing, you get the point, very loud, and yet characters would almost whisper things to each other and it was just as audible to us as any other dialogue scene in quieter settings? And last but not least, the film not only rushed the ending, but ended it so very awkwardly. (no spoilers, see it for yourself)Despite this film not being as pretentious as I first thought it might be, I can safely say that it is not worthy of any Oscar nomination that it received. Check it out for yourself and see how you feel, you may love it who knows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disclosure: No, I am not a Feminist. Moving on..This was just dull and I found myself looking away and checking my phone. There are no real characters in the film just a bunch of actresses there to move the story. They are nothing more than props in that regard. The film is kinda like an essay. It tries to give context of the time it took place and that is good but the downside is there is no focus and lacks energy. On top of that it doesn't really go into much depth anyway and portrays men as just kinda like pricks, even though there were male supporters and the movement got more funded than the Labour party. So it fails in all ways. Its not entertaining and it isn't that factual, for instance not all men had the vote at that time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What impressed me the most was the blending in of the real footage plus the list showing the years when equal women right was introduced in countries all over the world at the end of the film. It was both shocking and sad.That this is a problem now as much as it was 100 years ago (maybe not quite that much), shows the IMDb rating, it just confirms my suspect that every comic book movie will get into the all-time-top-50 list, while amazing movies with difficult subjects (like this one) will likely be ignored. Also note the percentage of male raters in the IMDb statistics.To put it blunt, if this movie would be renamed Star Wars it would easily end up with a rating above 9. That would be a more accurate rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You want me to respect the law? Then make the law respectable." Maud (Mulligan) is a woman living in England in the early 1900's. She is living her life peacefully and trying not to make waves. Little by little she gets caught up in the suffrage movement and becomes a major player in trying to get women the vote. The movement she is in decides that peace is not the way to get things done, but this violence leads to even more hardship. This is a movie that is very good and important, but hard to watch in some parts. It may be because I was born after women had the right to vote but I found no real reason why they shouldn't in this movie and it really led to me feeling angry. The resolve of these women in the face of total opposition from nearly the entire country only serves to show how important getting the vote really was. A movie that is very important historically and inspiring to any one that is involved in any type of ideological fight. Overall, I really enjoyed this but it is very emotional and one you have to be in the mood for. I give this a B.</fullReview>

The actors did a good job but whats not in the script is not in the script. Meaning I feel they did their best but where not able to overcome the dullness of the script and the characters in it. The characters felt very self righteous to me, I did not feel heart. I did not feel they had real passion for the cause.The subject you'd think is an engaging one and has potential but it did not deliver. I kept waiting for the movie to grab me somehow, it never did.I also thought the scenery was lacking. I understand it was meant to look depressing but I felt it was more then depressing. It lacked, just like the characters did, a certain depth, a certain soul.I don't think its a bad movie. I have certainly seen worse. But I do not recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate act of misdirection and emotional manipulation for a story that really deserves attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Suffragette" is the kind of film that races past many other probable Oscar contenders to get in theaters, giving you the impression of its esteemed quality, until you sit down and watch it to realize it's a mediocre representation of an important part of history in an already crowded sea of adult drama. Overlong, underwritten, and messily shot throughout, this is a film more concerned with tugging the heartstrings of the viewers than attempting to detail the scope and impact of a significant movement in the long, arduous pursuit of gender equality.What better way to detail the Suffragette movement by way of a fictional character, Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) in particular. She's a twenty-four year old laundress, working tireless hours in sweatshop conditions in order to provide for her husband and young boy. She witnesses the riots of the Suffragettes in the crowded streets of London as she works, one of whom is Violet Miller (Anne-Marie Duff), one of her coworkers who believes that peaceful protest will no longer work in attempting to get the voices of women recognized.The film follows Maud as she works to support her family and becomes close with Emily Davison (Natalie Press) - one of the few people to have actually existed during this time - a woman who encourages Maud to fight for her equal rights in voting and pay. Along the way, because she is jailed numerous times for speaking out against the corrupt Parliament, Maud is jailed and eventually loses custody of her child, in addition to losing her job. As her life spirals out of control, tensions between men and women heat up tremendously, with Inspector Steed (Brendan Gleeson) being called in to try and simmer the pot that is boiling underneath frustrated women all over London.Maud is a bland character, to say the least, though the filmmakers' focus on her is well-intentioned. While Maud may not have been a real character in the Suffragette movement, her commonality is intended to show the everyday women behind this movement. This wouldn't be so bad if Maud was (a) defined by her ideas and her own feelings rather than feeling like a scrapbook, with her ideology cut and pasted from the likes of others around her upon meeting them and (b) didn't spend so much time focused on her needy, absent-minded husband. This is another perfect example of a female-centric film that gets too involved with a male love-interest and falls prey to an underdeveloped female character and an unremarkable, archetypal male character.With that, the focus on fictional characters only makes it easier for director Sarah Gavron and screenwriter Abi Morgan to go for cheaper, emotionally manipulative ploys. Every time we see the Suffragettes beaten in public protests or cruelly mistreated in prisons, we hear accompanying orchestration so unsubtle and bombastic to fit the mood we should be feeling it would make Hans Zimmer blush. This is an element made to distract from the struggles of these brave women, and the focus on Maud's family in addition to this only makes it more of a misdirection. The brutality here is less for a depiction of authenticity and more a cheap, emotional ploy.Then there's Gavron's directing, which leaves a lot to be desired. Aside from capturing the entire event with an ugly, ungainly visual palette that emphasizes murky browns, grays, and greens, the manner in which Gavron chooses to direct a number of these scenes is questionable. Anytime a protest occurs in the streets, consider a very early scene when Violet smashes storefront windows by throwing rocks, Gavron goes for a closeups and unruly shakiness in her videography, allowing no elaboration on any kind of environmental sense of placement. This sort of tactic is used throughout the film, making for a film that's as nauseating as it is boring, anchored in mediocrity thanks to a longer runtime for a story that lacks almost any kind of development what so even."Suffragette"'s poorness as a film is only more disappointing, considering this is a project almost entirely helmed by women (even down to the film's two financial backers, Alison Owen and Faye Ward). The stunning mediocrity of this film is attributable to numerous different angles, but the ultimate sin is this is a film with an important message, a significant movement, and a chance to voice its ideas at a critical time where the gender gap plays a huge role in every day society - and it chooses to milk it for cheap pathos rather than tell a compelling, factual story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Emmeline Pankhurst was a courageous and principled woman, who suffered unimaginable indignity and scorn, at the hands of many; great and small, male and female.She fought tirelessly for "universal suffrage" and the rights of women to be treated as equals in society, and under the law. Mrs Pankhurst understood, in the way that only a true warrior does, when to take up the sword and when to lay it down; the very men for whom she fought bravely, and alas some of the women, treated her appallingly, even to the point of stoning her in the street. Unfortunately, the film Suffragette, has wasted its opportunity to tribute this magnificent woman from the past, and all who strove to assist with, and eventually realise many of her dreams, and those of the WSPU.For some reason best known to her, the director has taken a clichéd view of the struggle, through modern "feminist" eyes wearing rose tinted lenses. The period setting and the overall view of society in the time is captured reasonably well, but the heart beat and the soul of the magnificent yet ordinary women of the WSPU has been missed almost entirely.The movement, and its central players, have been lampooned, degraded and exaggerated for years; Emmeline Pankhurst's wonderful auto biography In My Own Words, was both banned and ridiculed.Suffragette should have been an opportunity to create a clean and truthful view of Mrs Pankhurst, her husband Richard, her daughters, and all the courageous women who stood by her, marched, fought for, and even died for, the great cause. Sadly, it misses the mark, for the want of a beating heart and a soul, so essential to the historical tapestry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2015 film about women fighting for the right to vote in England tackles an almost forgotten but nevertheless compelling struggle for women and men alike. Don't take that right for granted. The suffragette movement in England has received less cinematic attention than in the US [2004 film "Iron Jawed Angels" about the American suffragette Alice Paul] until now, with the release of Suffragette". "Suffragette" is an eye-opening film with political relevance for today. It is a reminder that not so long ago half of America was disenfranchised. It speaks for the suppressed and silenced, not exclusively to the women's rights movement but to all human rights battlegrounds. The sacrifice women made in England for the right to vote? including force feeding suggestive of water-boarding?reminds of us what is at stake.

		<shortDescription>Inspiring true story! 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I quite enjoyed this educational, emotional movie, which is based on a laundry worker, Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan), who starts out to be a happily married woman with a young boy. She works with a radical Suffragette member, Violet Miller (Anne-Marie Duff), who talks Maud into speaking out to parliament, as she is too unwell to do it herself. Against her husbands wishes, she goes to a couple more of the Suffragettes protest marches and she ends up imprisoned with other members. They then go to extreme measures to fight for women rights to vote but the law is totally against them and they try to blackmail Maud, to go against her fellow members. Her husband also turns against her and she is sacked from her job because she takes matters into her own hands when her boss makes uncomfortable sexual movements towards her. So basically, Mauds world is falling apart around her but the determination from the Suffragettes, give her the strength to fight for her rights. I was definitely impressed with the ladies, who were treated terribly by men during that period, and when I saw the end credits, which showed other countries who also had women fighting for there rights, it did touch an emotional chord. From an entertainment point of view, it's not the type of film that I can watch time and time again but I still enjoyed this emotional, true story, which did shock me in parts. I did find Carey Mulligans acting style a bit dry and the director didn't take full advantage of Meryl Streep but it's still a watchable movie which I found entertaining throughout. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I'm not really a big fan of Carey Mulligan, 30, because she hasn't got a wide range and her acting seems the same in all of her movies but she does have an innocent, sweet demeanour, which was needed in films like Pride &amp; Prejudice, the Greatest, Public Enemies, Brothers, An Education, Wall Street II, Drive and the Great Gatsby. Her next film is another period drama called Far From The Madding Crowd, alongside Matthias Schoenaerts and Michael Sheen, so I doubt that it will be the movie to make her a box office star but she has proved that she is someone to be taken seriously. Anyway, this movie was directed by Sarah Gavron, who also brought you Brick Lane in 2007 and Village at the End of the World in 2012. I was impressed with the whole look and feel of the movie and the fact that she actually shot some of the film in the Houses of Parliament, which has never been done before, was also very impressive. Its definitely a story that needs to be told but I personally would have put Meryl Streep in the leading role.Budget: $14million Worldwide Gross: $30millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas starring Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Meryl Streep, Brendan Gleeson, Anne-Marie Duff, Grace Stotter, Ben Whishaw and Geoff Bell. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SuffragetteBefore women got the right to vote no one cared about how the candidates' hair looked.Thankfully, the agitator in this drama is more concerned with working conditions.When Maud (Carey Mulligan) innocently steps in for a friend (Anne-Marie Duff) who is to speak before parliament on women's suffrage, she finds herself at the forefront of the matriarchal movement.Inspired by an MP's wife (Helena Bonham Carter) and two eminent activists Emily Davison (Natalie Press) and Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep), Maud commits acts of civil disobedience resulting in the loss of her husband (Ben Whishaw), son and her own freedom.Mixing real life characters with fictional ones, Suffragette's fact-based narrative may be slightly romanticized in its interpretation. However, the liberties taken are justifiable in their portrayal of the actual hardships that came along with the struggle.Incidentally, the first law that women voted to repeal was that of Sunday shopping.

		<fullReview>Gavron and Cinematographer Eduard Grau leave distinct aesthetic fingerprints. The duo plays in close-ups to an opposing duality?both intimately conveying the heartbreak and aggression amidst Mulligan's feminine facial features, and frantically throwing us into the middle of hectic riot brutality. More over, the wearisome browns and grays that infected most of the first act are consciously done away with thanks to repeated visits to pond-side greenery in addition to hints of cobalt dusk against tangerine candle light.Still, no amount of carefully constructed frames can fix a string of loose plot consistencies. In addition to a supportive character nonsensically locking a suffragette in a closet "for her own good" when the situation wouldn't have directly put her in danger and the absence of the parliament's argument for the vote following Maud's optimistic speech, most unfortunate comes in the form of Gleeson's Inspector Arthur Steed, as alluded to above. Throughout the plot, Steed, constantly hounding Maud's suffragette identity, grows more sympathetic to the movement over time. However, we are deprived of not only the balance of a supportive male character but also the completion of a slowly developing arc as Morgan's script abruptly cuts his epiphany.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/11/10/suffragette-2015-review-indie-adam/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SuffragetteThis film was an eye-opener in so many respects.I am eternally grateful that I speak English and that some 'English' customs are a part of the way in which I savour my life. I think most of us try not to be caricatures of the surviving arrogant, racist herrenvolk who still try to behave as if they occupy the moral high ground, as if they are 'superior' to the rest of us and think that only their way of doing things is the 'correct' way.Understandably, the British have tried to hide much of their history from the gaze of their own people as well as those whom they had conquered. They still influence, and to an extent control, via our esteemed senior pedagogues, the kind of curricula that our children study and that which appears in our newspapers and on TV.Some of us exist in a cloud of mendacity: we have erroneous notions about the British, the 'Free West' and especially about ourselves, our conquered selves.In 1912 the British were beating up a great many people in various parts of their empire (where they had imposed their laws which enabled, among other things, the extraction of the wealth of the conquered territories) as far afield as Iraq, Egypt and India and as close as Ireland.What many of us did not know was that some of the British also 'officially' beat up some of their own women folk when these valiant citizens rallied to get the right to vote.The film is set in 1912 when the upright British kept all their women folk (Even though they had a Queen as their sovereign for most of the 19th century) legally disenfranchised. They imposed this restriction upon some of their males as well. I think that it is wrong to give away the plot of a film - I will only give you impressions. I think that this film is well worth seeing. Most of the subject matter would not have been covered in the 12 years of schooling of even our post Apartheid institutions.We see this era through the eyes of a naive, ignorant, young washer- woman who, (in a manner which was similar to the way in which we were conscientised by Apartheid) is gradually made aware that much of the way in which females were being treated was utterly immoral, unethical and wrong.In the manner of Orwell's '1984', the movie is done in dark and sombre colours which depict a dank and shabby working-class England at a time when the British were the wealthiest people in the world. However the British empire had many unethical laws which violated the human rights of their own ladies.I was amazed to see, in the heart of the British empire, shop windows being deliberately broken by the Suffragettes, post boxes being blown up, telegraph cables being cut and Lloyd George's summer mansion being destroyed. George was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the British government at the time. He became Prime Minister in 1916.The police and their spy agencies were shown doing everything in their power to break the movement. These clever fiends tried to find weak links in the Suffragette movement and recruit them as informers. The government also tried to get the newspapers not to publicise the struggle. Up to a point, they were successful.The 'total onslaught' response of the authorities to the civil resistance had a terrible effect on families, especially the innocent children. Many of the women lost their jobs, the males were coaxed to 'rein in' their women - and, if the women were not compliant, sometimes families broke up. Back then, the men often got custody of the children. One man actually gave away his child for adoption once he was separated from his wife. Women who rose up against disenfranchisement were thought by many to be 'not right in the head'.The very harsh working conditions of that time, the endemic sexual harassment and the discriminatory salaries which were the norm, are all in your face in this stark story about the war against state terror; a war against one of the strongest empires in the world. In some ways, the resistance of the women reminded me of the heroic, diminutive, delicate, Vietnamese and their valiant resistance against the American invaders.During the tortuous era of resistance against the vicious Apartheid decrees, some of our lawyers played a crucial role. In this film, not a single lawyer is seen helping the resistors.A Suffragette was shown at the Epsom Derby being knocked down by the King's horse, Anmer. She was Emily Wilding Davison. The Empire could no longer conceal its sinful laws from the world. Perhaps the film should have interwoven a tale of an enfranchised jockey who had his life in front of him, and a troubled, angry, young woman who chose to put her life in the way of the imperial juggernaut.The work concludes with a historical note about when the women were legally able to vote in various countries. New Zealand led the world in 1893. All German males were enfranchised when they marched to war in 1914. Universal British male suffrage was a reality only after World War I. British women were able to vote in 1928. In 1944 the French females followed. I could not help thinking of the lady who holds up the flame of freedom: the statue of liberty which was sent to New York by the French!The credits state that Indian women were enfranchised in 1947. But that important advance was not contextualised. That is upsetting. Indian women could vote only once their country was liberated from the British and India became a democratic republic.</fullReview>

In fact all of the actors in this film were exceptional.I walked out of the movie theater feeling immensely grateful to be a woman brought up in the 21st century. Rather than lament the things I don't have, I will now be thankful to have the many blessings and privileges that women in previous centuries (and even in some parts of the world today) could only dream about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's undeniable that the struggle for women's suffrage in England has been woefully neglected and would certainly support a good half dozen films without exhausting its importance and fascination. It's equally undeniable that screenwriter Abi Morgan has failed to deliver the standard of screenplay the subject demands; it's as if someone had indicated to Morgan that a given area of land was sitting on top of a rich seam of coal and Morgan was free to mine it to the full but instead of penetrating sufficiently deep to mine the coal she has been content to bring up the anthracite located at a shallower level. On the other hand there are some fine performances to savour, none more so than the lead - a fictional character - played by Carey Mulligan and the equally fine Ann-Marie Duff, who is responsible for raising the consciousness of Mulligan, who begins the film as a wife and mother content to work long hours in a laundry for thirteen shillings a week and winds up sans husband and child and with a prison record. THE film of the Suffragette movement is still to be made but this is a half-decent pilot fish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting Triumphs over Occasionally Formulaic Plot - Alas, Still Relevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema's efforts to dramatize major social upheavals are always somewhat problematic, either focusing too wide, so that the viewer doesn't adequately relate to individual participants' challenges, or too narrowly, pulling their struggle out of the necessary context. Despite the predictability of some elements in its story, Suffragette achieves a pretty good balance between background and foreground. The movie was directed by Sarah Gavron, with a screenplay by Abi Morgan. By 1912, many decades of asking politely for the vote and expanded rights has achieved nothing for British women. Finally, their leader Emmeline Pankhurst declares, "deeds not words," ushering in a new era of militancy, including bombs in post boxes. In part this new tactic is necessary because government and media collude to keep the suffragette's demands quiet. No one knows the extent of the movement or public sympathy for it, and government wants to keep it that way. We see male officials fretting about the situation, but the film mostly shows "ordinary women" whose lives have become unbearably suffocating. Some of them are torn by the choices they have to make, while others have moved beyond doubt and are determined to grab the government's attention, no matter the consequences. The movie is fortunate in the actors selected for these foreground roles. Carey Mulligan is, as ever, perfect as Maud Watts, a young mother who's worked in a Dickensian laundry since childhood and becomes involved with the movement by chance; Anne-Marie Duff is a true believer who has to reconsider; Helena Bonham Carter and Natalie Press have left doubt in the dust. (Bonham Carter is the great-granddaughter of H.H. Asquith, Prime Minister of Britain during the height of the suffragette movement, which he opposed.) The government brings in a Special Branch investigator, played by Brendan Gleeson, to track the women's movements, and he zeroes in on Watts, thinking she may crack. Meryl Streep makes a cameo appearance as Pankhurst, and of course it would have been great to see more of her, but that would have drawn light away from the everyday women who ultimately had to say to themselves, enough. British women received partial suffrage in 1918 and full suffrage a decade later. "While nobody?least of all Maud?supposes that the vote will solve everything, it will at least be a start," said A.O. Smith in the New York Times. As a scroll at the end of the movie attests, worldwide acceptance of women's suffrage is still incomplete and, for many, the start hasn't yet started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be honest with you, Suffragette is not a great movie, not funny like made in Dagenham, probably not a good one as well and the accent of these ladies is pretty tough, but it is still a great testimony of a really important part of our History! We should keep that in our minds when we watch our mothers, our sisters, our friends and our lovers. We should keep in mind that this fight is not over yet, that there are many things to come and we should work together to create and maintain a fair society for everybody. However, let's be truly honest with ourselves! Where are the feminists nowadays? Who has the courage to declare her/himself a feminist? And for what? Do we really need that? Just for few countries in the world that you probably never visit in your life? If you ever thought these questions without catching what is wrong now in our global society, I will give you just one reason, because you ought to yourself as a human being. Enlightening is the end of the movie with the precise dates when women gain the right to vote in each country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The foot soldiers of the early feminist movement, women who were forced underground to pursue a dangerous game of cat and mouse with an increasingly brutal State. The period drama is a rarity for major studios because it is often directed, written and produced by women. Though, this combo gained importance these years; due to renewed scrutinizing of the industry's gender imbalance. Director Sarah Gavron said it has taken 100 years for the story to reach the screen and she'd been wanting to do it for over a decade now. And she created a somehow formally conservative account of a revolutionary moment in history. Intertwined socioeconomic details with domestic melodrama. Nowadays, calling a woman a "militant feminist" is an insult in order to belittle a woman's anger, Suffragette does serve as an eye-opening reminder of what the term itself actually means. This movie isn't just about one woman's awakening to the cause, it's so much more. This film has two major assets in its awards push: Carey Mulligan and plenty of goodwill. In fact, Carey Mulligan gives a nuanced central performance supported by strong performances from both Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff. The choice to focus on a fictional character who never feels like more than a symbol for a whole generation is pretty clever. That's what Maud Watts feels like: a shorthand for an idea that Suffragette offers up but doesn't really engage. Indeed the working class women who joined the movement had more to lose, fewer protections and were sometimes cannon fodder. Nonetheless, Mulligan holds the film together. She is in nearly every scene, clearly conveying the character's growing convictions. However, Meryl Streep provides a fleetingly aloof cameo, rallying the troops from a balcony before disappearing into the night. Here, the real firebrand is Helena Bonham Carter's character; who provides the movement's combustible spark. This film has other strengths, including the production design by Alice Normington, costume design by Jane Petrie and score by Alexandre Desplat. This is a genuinely important story and Suffragette tells it without stylistic fuss. In fact, this altogether more polemical work provides a solidly researched and at time surprisingly grim film. Finally, exiting the screening, I thought every woman - and men - needed to see this movie. Overall some people will love this film but even those who won't, couldn't help rooting for it; given the subject matter and the filmmaking team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five-Word Review: Solid, Finely-acted Drama; Nothing Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suffragette, directed by Sarah Gavron (Brick Lane), stars Carey Mulligan (Oscar nominated for An Education) as the fictional Maude Watts who joins The King's Speech actor Helena Bonham Carter in the fight for women's suffrage in pre-war 1912, with a cast that includes Ben Whishaw (Skyfall), Brendan Gleeson (Calvary), Anne- Marie Duff (Nowhere Boy) and Meryl Streep in a cameo as the famous Emmeline Pankhurst. As Maude becomes embroiled in the fight for equality in an unfair world, she discovers the effects of stepping out of her place as a woman in Edwardian Britain. There isn't too much for me to say about Suffragette. It's in effect the same as most biopics/period pieces of its type. The best way to describe it is 'fine' - with a strong central performance from Mulligan, who has proved from Drive to Shame how good an actor she is, portraying the emotional struggle of her character's conflict as she tries to choose between her duty as a mother and wife and her moral values and duty as a woman. She's joined by a generally decently- acted ensemble, and the drama is perfectly serviceable, with a time period and social rights' struggle rarely shown in cinema, and the suffrage issue is played out here as well as it would ever be played in today's cinematic landscape. And that's basically what Suffragette is. The trouble with it is only what plagues any film of its type. There are just so few memorable period dramas and biopics. They're all perfectly fine, and good to watch once, but no one will ever want to watch Suffragette a second time. It's all quite overblown, bordering on historical inaccuracy and devoid of subtlety. Mediocre might be too harsh a word, but the unoriginal filmmaking and generally forgettable execution results in a good-looking piece of historical drama that is oftentimes educating and frequent interesting to watch, with characters that are for the most part above being cardboard cut-outs (even if development is something afforded to only a few). But overall I'll be hard-pressed to recall anything particularly affecting or memorable that Suffragette has to offer as a film within a week. A perfectly alright 67/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The struggle for the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a film about the passage of the Voting Rights was made the Martin Luther King character said that even with the Civil Rights act of 1964 was passed, black people needed this lest elected officials with a vested interest in the segregation system water down and neutered the equality promised in the civil rights act. I think possibly the women realized that because the focus of their struggle was first and foremost on the voting franchise.Suffragette takes a serious look at the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom which was progressing parallel with the movement in the USA. The times of Great Britain just prior to her entrance into World War I are accurately portrayed. Several historical figures are in this drama including Emmeline Pankhurst the Susan B. Anthony of Great Britain played by American Meryl Streep.But the story of the movement is encapsulated in an Oscar worthy performance by Carey Mulligan. She plays a lower class laundry worker who gets dragged into the movement and gets an awakening that she should not accept her inferior status in society. Her husband Ben Whishaw is your ordinary working class man of the time who simply accepts male superiority in society as his due. She gets sexually molested by her supervisor at the laundry and Whishaw is mad at her for not just sucking it up. Her suffrage activities get her arrested and Whishaw feels he has to separate from her and he takes custody of their child. He has the right and she has none in that society. This fact in life in those times and this incident illustrates in Suffragette why the women in the movement worked as hard as they did.The film climaxes with the famous death of Emily Davison at the English Derby at Epsom Downs. That incident was recorded in the silent newsreels of the day, the newsreel in fact was created at that time. Ms.Davison played by Natalie Press threw herself in front of the oncoming horses and was killed. It was her way of making the statement. Knowing that was to happen in watching the film I was still jolted by the way it was done and how gallantly Davison sacrifices herself. She gives her last words to the fictional character Mulligan plays.Better than any other film and there are few enough film portrayals of the Suffrage movement I hope that Suffragette gets due recognition by the Academy in giving out Oscars. This film should be mandatory viewing in schools for anyone to understand the women's movement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Partly I'm writing this review because of the rather negative summation by the review showing on the main page. The purpose of art is greater than titillation and amusement. Art has many functions one of which is to reflect ourselves to ourselves.In Suffragette, a competently made film in which the acting is worth praise and the setting convincing for 1912 London an extraordinary piece of our social and political history is told. Certainly I have always been proud that my native country, New Zealand was the first nation to give women the vote (1893, well before even its neighbour Australia which followed in 1902 a year after Federation).Social change never comes easily and replacing entrenched patterns, prejudices and fears takes time and courage. This is what this film depicts, the sacrifice required of so many women to achieve fundamental social justice in a society dominated by prejudice and physical force. I didn't find watching this film easy and it was not intended to be easy viewing for its heart is changing the dominant paradigm. I find its message very relevant to today's politics and Corporate behaviour wherein we, the people,are treated as mere consumers and every day our rights shrink under the claim of fighting terrorism. the answer then for the suffragettes as it is today is awareness and this film raises awareness in style. For this reason alone I score it 10 our of 10 and urge you not to miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carey Mulligan delivers her finest work to date in Suffragette. The film itself is very good, even great at times, and the lack of attention and the tepid reception it has gotten is such a shame. Mulligan is just phenomenal here, and I also don't think that many actresses around her age would have been able to do what she did. It's just such searing, powerful work that I refuse to believe hasn't gotten more traction or awards. The fact that she will most likely get snubbed for an Oscar nomination is already something I will not let go lightly, especially when Carol is more likely vying for two spots in the category despite having two vastly inferior performances (sorry Carol fans!). As far as I'm concerned, Mulligan is right up there with Ronan and Larson, and all three should be in a battle for the Lead Actress Oscar. Such a shameful snub it will be indeed. It hurts. Bonham Carter also does some lovely work here though</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film 'Suffragette' tells a fictionalized story that covers the main British events that occurred a century ago. Uk-born Writer Abi Morgan, has penned a work that introduces us at the start of the film to the fictional Maud Watts, a young working-class married woman living in east London. This is cleverly done. Young Maud works hard in a laundry and by a quirk of fate she encounters the suffragettes who are involved in a militant campaign for votes for women. Thus in this film Maud is our POV. As she encounters the issues, so do we in the audience.The film is directed by Sarah Gavron and is mostly set in London and it's period detail is spot on. The real-life events cover the period of 1910-1914, in a fictionalized form. The philosopher John Stuart Mill, as early as 1865, had spoken out in favour of womens suffrage. In reality in those days the state could not really be described as democratic. The great Reform Act of 1832, and other changes, had gradually increased the suffrage. More and more men were getting the vote, but women were not. In 1897 the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was set up and under it's leader Millicent Fawcett engaged in traditional methods of political campaigning. However, Emmeline Pankhurst believed a more militant and radical campaign was required and in 1903 set up the Women's Social and Political Union. Chaining themselves to railings for publicity, they also engaged in acts of violence against property, though not against people.The response of the state was heavy-handed. Some of the actions of the state may appear exaggerated in this film, rated 12A in the UK. Viewers however, should be aware that in real-life women died in some of the events portrayed in the film. Law enforcement is seen through the eyes too of Inspector Arthur Steed. An Irishman enforcing the law, he sees parallels with Ireland. His exchanges with Maud Watts are rich with philosophical points. They both argue well and with some right on both their sides. Though with the policeman it is unclear if his positions are sincerely held, or merely made to serve his purpose. Whatever. These exchanges are intellectually interesting. However, this film is not about a debating society, but rather about the state suppressing law-breakers. How far the state can, or should, enforce it's will, is of course a matter of debate, and one that continues today. In the early 1980s, Bobby Sands was the first of a number of IRA prisoners, who died on hunger-strike, as part of a struggle for political prisoner status. A direct echo, of the same issue of the suffragettes.The film shows clearly the lack of rights of women in that era. No votes for women, no equal pay too. The film shows the drudgery of working women, not just the lack of votes. At home and at work, they were ruled by men, and used by men. The film shows women's lack of rights within the family as well as their vulnerability to sexual exploitation and violence.The acting of the cast is uniformly excellent. Young Maud is played by Carey Milligan. She is joined by Helena Bonham Carter (the great- granddaughter of Prime Minister Herbert Asquith) playing a middle-class role, and Anne-Marie Duff playing a working-class role. These three are the mainstay of the film, reflecting the issues and tensions well. The other central character of Inspector Steed is played by Brendan Gleeson, and as said earlier, he too is used to explore the complexities.Smaller parts are also acted well by the supporting cast. There were good debut performances from Alan Michael Dodd and Grace Stotter. The famous Emmeline Pankhurst is played by the famous Meryl Streep. Characters who also contribute to the story are played by Annabelle Dowler, Finbar Lynch, Natalie Press, Adrian Schiller, and Ben Whishaw.Whilst the suffragette story is told through the eyes of the fictional Maud, this does not detract from the story. As Maud encounters the suffragettes, then so do we. This fictional narrative device, is a very useful tool, for taking us on a journey through the story, that covers the main historical events. Thus whilst Maud and some of the other characters are fictional, in essence, the historical characters are true, and their story is true. As such therefore, this film is a worthy tribute to those who dedicated their lives to this struggle. Some also gave their lives for the struggle. The film would have been better, and the film-makers would have been braver, and more honest, if Prime Minister Herbert Asquith had featured in the film rather than David Lloyd George. That aside, this film seems a genuine attempt to portray the story in all of it's complexities, and exploring all of the issues, in an even-handed way.An educational film that informs us of what now seems like a completely different world. Not an easy view, but one that deserved to be made, and to be viewed.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Suffragette to be an unexpectedly moving film given the power and conviction of its highly relevant story and the emotional attachment I felt towards its central character. Although it is about the women of England who demanded the right to vote, it is foremost historical fiction that uses make-believe characters to unveil a portion of history. While I was unaware that much of the film was fiction, the actors and the situations were thoroughly convincing to me. Films such as this are caught in an unfair, irresolvable critical bind, lamented for historical inaccuracies when using a real life subject but equally crucified for also taking liberties. Suffragette resolves the creative dilemma simply by developing a believable character, one encompassing a pastiche of experiences of the women of the period and detailing her as an outsider and then an active political figure so that we understand her evolution inside the movement. The leader of the Suffragettes, Emmeline Pankhurst, is kept at arm's length, which typifies the outside viewpoint but consequently shields the film from accusations of misrepresenting an enormous political figure and allows for a sharp focus point, where one character can become our emotional vessel throughout the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sufragette" entertains, educates and impresses!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We might as well start by getting a couple things straight. Suffrage simply means "the right to vote". It has nothing to do with suffering (unless you want to count? well, we'll get to that later). One of the words has an "e" in the middle of it and the other refers to voting rights. A woman who fought for the right to vote when suffrage was the purview of men was referred to as a "suffragette" (a derisive term that would never fly in today's society). Now you might be asking, "what's the big deal?" (no, not about my little English lesson, but about the issue of suffrage). "Votes for Women" wasn't just about allowing all responsible adults to have an equal voice in choosing their next councilman, judge or even their next national leader (as important as those things are). There was much more at stake than being allowed to pull a lever in a voting booth. The right to vote meant choosing leaders who would have to pay attention to the needs of all citizens, regardless of gender, and to enact laws that would protect and improve the lives of women in the home, in the workplace and across the broad spectrum of social activity and interaction. It also meant respect, which women only enjoyed to the extent that they minded their own business. Most governments around the world didn't grant female suffrage until well into the 20th century. The historical drama "Suffragette" (PG-13, 1:46) is about the struggle for women suffrage in Great Britain in 1912, shortly before the beginning of World War I.Although it took many "suffragettes" to force changes in voting laws, you may have noticed that the use of the word in this movie's title is singular. The story of the fight for women suffrage in early 20th century Britain is told through the eyes and the experiences of a young laundress named Maud Watts (previous Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan). Maud obviously has strong, barely-concealed feelings about the way women are treated in her society, the working conditions under which many of them toil and their lack of rights, but she's no activist. At first victimized when caught in the middle of a suffragette rock-throwing incident, she is gradually and almost accidentally drawn into the movement by her co-worker, Violet Miller (Anne-Marie Duff), and a local pharmacist named Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter). When Maud is present for a stinging political defeat and soon after witnesses an inspiring secret appearance by the movement's real-life godmother, Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep), Maud's all in.The conflicts in the streets and in the halls of government quickly start to become very personal for Maud, just as they did for many real-life suffragettes. Attending secret meetings of the suffragettes, she finds herself in the middle of arguments over tactics and strategies, as well as under the threat of arrest, as the group becomes more militant. She's also caught between the group and the authorities who (in the person of Brendan Gleeson's character) think her to be a weak link in the suffragette chain and try to force her to turn informant. As with the other suffragettes, Maud's commitment to the cause also has implications on the job ? and in her home, where Maud's husband, Sonny (Ben Whishaw), finds himself torn between his love for his wife and overwhelming social pressures to "deal with" her as she aligns herself with the suffragettes. Even Maud's relationship with her young son is threatened by her role in the movement. This story benefits from Abi Morgan's excellent script, Sarah Gavron's sure-handed direction and the outstanding performances of all the main characters, particularly Mulligan's, which makes us see, understand and feel how much suffragettes suffered for their cause."Suffragette" does for the women suffrage movement what 2014's "Selma" did for the American civil rights movement ? brings it to life, by way of quality cinematic entertainment. Much like the earlier fight to abolish slavery, the later struggle for civil rights or the more recent issue of LGBT rights, taking a look back at what it took to get women the right to vote reminds us that attaining social justice for all members of society takes time, effort, patience and sacrifice and it's rarely pretty, but a fight on the side of right eventually triumphs. "Suffragette" communicates that principle very clearly and in very entertaining fashion ? both in the context of this story's specific issues shown and in the broader context of the ongoing struggle for equal rights by different groups of people in different countries all around the world. This film isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it's a very well-made and worthwhile look at a very important time in world history, and with important implications for the world as we know it.

		<fullReview>The incredible true story of the feminist movement has never been tackled properly on the big-screen, aside from Winifred Banks' support for the cause in the beloved musical Mary Poppins (1964).But director Sarah Gavron's take on that dark period in human history is far from joyful as the film presents a gritty picture of just how difficult it was for women in that era. This is captured shockingly in various scenes involving them being punched, kicked, molested and tortured as they struggle in a male-dominated world. If you're expecting a heartwarming British biopic like The King's Speech or Pride, then this probably isn't for you.All this is in aid of teaching audiences, particularly the younger generation, about the lengths these women went into fighting for what they believed in which is great testament to both Gavron and her screenwriter Abi Morgan. The pair also make the bold decision to create a fictional heroine in Maud who is present at key events in that era but goes through a terrible ordeal that barely gives her any respite.Through all this, the film's stellar cast give phenomenal performances with the wonderful Carey Mulligan leading from the front. Despite Maud's non-existence in real-life, Mulligan produces a devastating turn as a woman who finds her voice and ultimately ends up suffering for it at the hands of both the authorities and her own family.Helena Bonham Carter (Edith), Anne Marie-Duff (Violet) and Natalie Press (Emily Wilding Davison) lend effective support as the other key suffragettes with the latter dominating the film's closing act which takes place at the 1913 Epsom Derby, a fateful day that would have a positive effect on the movement.The male characters don't quite fare well when it comes to the way they are presented on screen though Brendan Gleeson and Ben Whishaw give understated performances while Geoff Bell plays Maud's barbaric boss to perfection.Special mention must also go to the production team particularly costume and production designers Jane Petrie and Alice Normington whose work deserves some awards attention when capturing the 1910s era.Admittedly some parts of the film's production aren't quite as effective with the editing being a bit too swift while the camera angles can be too in-your-face and not allow audiences to breath. It's also disappointing that the great Meryl Streep is reduced to one brief scene as the iconic Emmeline Pankhurst though she does take advantage delivering a critical speech.Suffragette is bound to be a brutal watch for many but the combined work from Gavron and her magnificent cast ensure that this film is a powerful lesson on a bleak period in human history that has thankfully resulted in change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVED this movie! It is the gripping story of the suffragette movement in England, with brilliant performances by Kerry Mulligan and Helena Bonham-Carter. It portrays in stunning reality how vastly different women were treated a mere 100 years ago. During the movie, I kept thinking about how young women today would find it astonishing that women had no rights whatsoever back then. On the other hand, the movie shows that many of the issues faced by working women then are the same issues women deal with now: inequality of pay, sexual harassment, child care, lack of education. Fortunately, the movement for women's rights corresponded with labor movements in general that spawned legislation prohibiting child labor, improvements in workplace safety, and other issues.Watching this movie should be an extra-credit assignment for all high school history students so they truly understand how brave the women were who fought the war for their rights. I applaud the producers and cast for making this marvelous movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . that it got bombed a lot during two world wars, losing millions of people overall, followed more recently by its Falklands debacle, "People's Princess" crack-up, and subway explosions, one need look no further than SUFFRAGETTE. This movie faithfully recreates a Sick Society in which the "Upper Class" treats the working people like their sex toys and expendable tools. Laundry foreman "Mr. Taylor" is apparently Carey Mulligan's unacknowledged "missing" father, and most likely the biological dad to her son "George," as well (which is why Carey's legal spouse, "Sonny," is so eager to give George away to the first passers-by coming along). Many English tell-all books were written during this 1890-1914 era which painstakingly detail the ins and outs of how this Multi-Generational Institutionalized Rape\Incest System actually worked. Though SUFFRAGETTE fleshes out the manner in which some of the worst exploitation was curtailed, it will take many many more generations to purge the widespread signs of these centuries of inbreeding (still easily seen today) from England's gene pool. So before you start feeling sorry for England when it suffers its next "unlucky" break, watch SUFFRAGETTE to learn how this Doomed Isle deserves whatever it's got coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was stressful to see the conditions of women in pre-World-War-I England in this movie. Working conditions slightly better than in Dickens' day. No legal rights. Chattel. To be owned by fathers and husbands with no rights to their own children. And no political power to make changes to these conditions. "Suffragette" captures these issues well in it's first half and shows the result: desperate women willing to do what's needed to change the situation. The reason for my middle grading of this movie is its unrelenting eye and incompleteness. The movie ends in 1913, five years before some of the UK's women get the vote. So although we know it happened, this movie stops short of telling us how it happened. Nevertheless, a powerful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Most "issues" movies go big in their approach to society-changing events and those that led the charge. Director Sarah Gavron (Brick Lane, 2007) and writer Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady, 2011) instead show us one little corner, a building block if you will, of the larger movement towards gaining women the right to vote in the UK. By focusing on the efforts of a small group of working class women in 1912, the struggle becomes one of flesh and blood, rather than granite statues.Carey Mulligan stars as Maud Watts, a manual laborer at a commercial launderer. Her character is a composite of working class women of the time, and we come to appreciate her strength and the incredible sacrifices she makes for the greater cause. Maud seems to be a simple woman. She works hard, loves her son and is loyal to her husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw). When first exposed to the civil disobedience of the suffragettes, Maud is caught in the crossfire of a rock-throwing frenzy. She recognizes faces and becomes intrigued with the mission. At first, Sonny tries to be supportive, but soon enough, he is confused, embarrassed and finally forced to take extreme measures. After all, no self-respecting man of the time could allow his wife to sneak about town throwing rocks, setting off bombs, and attending secretive meetings ? all for the sake of some ridiculous notion of equality for women!Helena Bonham Carter appears as the neighborhood pharmacist who is a key cog in the local movement ? a movement that had been ongoing peacefully for decades. What's interesting about her appearance is that Ms. Bonham-Carter is the great-granddaughter of H.H. Asquith, the Prime Minister of UK from 1908-1916. He was an outspoken opponent of the suffragette movement during its most critical time. Her appearance and role in the film is a bit of redemption for the actress and her family. Deeds not Words. This became the rallying cry for these women thanks to their leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Meryl Streep makes an all-too-brief appearance as Ms. Pankhurst, but it's a key moment in the film as it solidifies the cause for this group of women who needed to believe that they could make a difference.Gender inequality seems such an insufficient term for what these women endured. Sexual abuse, domestic violence, unequal pay, hazardous work environments, and almost no child custody rights in disputes with men ? these were all commonplace at the time, and the film does a terrific job of making the points without distracting from its central message. Director Gavron's subtle use of differing color palettes is effective in distinguishing the man's world from that of the women.It's clearly a snapshot of a society on the brink of a revolution, and a grounded yet emotional glimpse at those foot soldiers in the war on injustice. Though this story focuses on the UK, the end credits remind us that in the U.S., it took until 1920 to ratify the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote; and even more startling, Switzerland took until 1971 and the women of Saudi Arabia only this year obtained voting rights. The movie is a powerful personal story, and an effective history lesson on the irrationality involved in bringing about humanistic change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, powerful and completely relevant to our times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer for this film, I posted a comment on the YouTube video about how women were still today fighting to be recognized as equals in certain sectors of society. I was subsequently ridiculed, laughed at, insulted and even received death threats. This is why we still need feminism today. The film itself was beautiful, engaging and wonderfully acted. It focuses mainly on Maud Watts (played to perfection by Carey Mulligan), a British working class girl who becomes more and more engaged in the suffrage movement. She and the other suffragettes are beaten, shunned out, put in prison, tortured and have their loved ones snatched away from them, in pursuing their rightful cause for the vote. My only complaint with the film is that despite Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep) being the the heart, soul and leader of the suffragette movement, she was only present in one scene. I would have liked the film to focus equally on her as well as Maud Watts. As a feminist living in Switzerland, I'm still completely appalled that women only got the vote in 1971. Despite times not being as horrible as in 1912, there is still a long way to go. But there is definitely hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see (but underrated) movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suffragette (2015) is an English film directed by Sarah Gavron, It stars Carey Mulligan as Maud Watts, a working-class woman who is recruited into the Suffragette movement by her friend Violet (Anne-Marie Duff). Maud Watts has worked hard and long in a laundry, and she is so accustomed to the heavy work and abuse that she accepts it as the normal way of life. She gradually sees that women are unfairly treated, and that there is little hope for improvement until women obtain the vote.Maud starts attending clandestine suffragette meetings, where she meets Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter), who is (I believe) a pharmacist, although she was trained as a doctor. Maud joins the suffragette cause, and this causes enormous disruptions of her home, family, and work. She eventually meets--and is inspired by--Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep in a cameo role).Brendan Gleeson plays Inspector Arthur Steed, a tough policeman, who is experienced in battling guerrilla warfare in urban situations. Steed clearly respects Maud, but he has an "orders are orders" mentality. I think he would actually like to support the suffragettes, but he'll never do it.The plot of the movie is the transition of Maud from someone who accepts the unjust social order to someone who will do almost anything to change the social order. Carey Mulligan is superb as Maud. You can accept her as a working-class woman, but you can also accept her as a intensely committed foot-soldier in Emmeline Pankhurst's army.I can't imagine success for this film without a believable Maud. Carey Mulligan is a believable Maud. She deserves an Oscar for her portrayal of Maud Watts' transition. We saw this film on the large screen at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work almost as well on the small screen.Note: Suffragette is carrying a dismal 6.8 IMDb rating, but I don't know why. It's a much better film than that. My suggestion is to see it despite the rating. It's a truly great, important, movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lukewarm drama that doesn't live up to the incredible true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the Suffragette movement in Britain is a legendary one, and one of such historical importance about the brutality of traditional oppression even in developed countries, and the innovative aggression taken up by the women to have their voices heard.However, this film unfortunately fails to live up to that legacy. This should have been a powerfully emotionally and politically charged drama, with a dark, brutal atmosphere to highlight the terrible oppression these women faced, but all it actually is is a disappointingly dry history lesson that lacks the passion of the story it's trying to tell.For starters, this isn't an awful film. The plot in itself is interesting, in a historical manner, and some of the performances are decent, but nothing spectacular, and definitely not Oscar- worthy, so if you're not really into the history of the Suffragettes, this isn't the film to learn from, because there's nothing truly outstanding to grab you and give you a convincing lesson about the incredible true story.On occasion, the film does manage to give some emotional angst to Carey Mulligan's main character and her relationship with her son, and in those few scenes, it is quite something, but on the whole, there's next to no powerful emotion throughout here, and you just don't really feel the brutal oppression that would make you care for these women.Yes, the oppression and the brutality is clearly presented on screen, but the reason that you don't feel it is because this film as a whole really lacks the passion to give a convincing representation of the history. If you think about the Suffragette movement, it's one of the most aggressive and powerful movements of all time, fuelled by the incredible passion that the people behind it felt as they sought to break free from their oppressed lifestyles.So you would think that the film telling that story would try to evoke that in some way, and although you can see the odd spirited attempt by lead actresses Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff to do so, you get next to no real feeling of that political passion at any point in the film, which is a real disappointment.Overall, Suffragette was not a particularly impressive film, because despite telling what is a historically interesting story, it fails to deliver the passionate and captivating details of what is a genuinely incredible true story.http://madmovieman.com/1117-suffragette-2015/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, with an excellent Carey Mulligan performance at the center</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This historical drama about the suffragette movement in 1910s England may be by-the-numbers, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I went in with low expectations, given the reviews, mostly looking forward to a good Carey Mulligan performance. I got that (in fact, it's a very good performance) and more. It was an involving story, very respectably made. Mulligan is the political naif drawn into the movement after she becomes friends with a politically active co-worker. She's not too interested at first, but, after witnessing the unfairness of her life, she joins up. This throws her entire life into disarray. Helena Bonham Carter, Anne-Marie Duff, Romola Garai, and Natalie Press are all very good as the women in supporting rolls. The men are, as you might expect, less complex, but Ben Whishaw and Brednan Gleeson are reliably fine as Mulligan's husband and a detective investigating the movement respectively. I think this film was largely dismissed because it was long seen as Meryl Streep's 2015 Oscar performance, but the truth is she has a mere cameo as Emmeline Pankhurst, who was the leader of the suffragette movement in Britain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British Women's Fight for Right To Vote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The struggle for the right of women to vote is an international one and the bruising fight continues to this day. The 19th Amendment to the US Constitution: Women's Right To Vote was ratified in August 18, 1920 after decades of civil disobedience, strife, marching, humiliation, hunger strikes and incarceration - a battle with simple but enormously important consequences - the necessity for women to have a voice in who represents them in making the laws of the land and how those laws which often affects a woman's life are interpreted. Without the vote, we are ignored, invisible and betrayed. Here is a link to a Library of Congress' paper Why Women Should Vote written sometime after 1896 by Alice Stone Blackwell giving 16 compelling and poignant reasons why women should vote - as relevant today as ever:http://tinyurl.com/l3hbvf4SUFFRAGETTE directed by Sarah Gavron focuses on a group of both working class and wealthy British women in 1912 whose ideologies and wretched situations at home propel them to risk jobs and marriages in order to crack the male shell of resistance to the idea of women's equality. Led by Emmeline Pankhurst, (a cameo performance by Meryl Streep) who in 1903 founded the more militant Women's Social And Political Union (WSPU) - participating in demonstrations and hunger strikes where she herself was violently force-fed - acts that contributed to her mystique and the adoration of her followers. The bleak ambiance of SUFFRAGETTES characterizes with historical accuracy the streets of London, the wardrobes, and homes of women in different socio-economic groups, just before the advent of World War I - a time when women were more expendable and vulnerable to their male bosses; wages were a mere pittance and escape, a mirage. Husbands had absolute control over wives and children - both through physical abuse and the power of the British legal system. Films distort by the very nature of their structural limitations which are usually 2 hours. In that compressed amount of time and a director's subjective view of history, we follow the political radicalization of a laundress who labors under deplorable conditions (having begun as a mere child) named Maud Watts (an actual composite of a suffragette named Hannah Mitchell - http://www.biography.com/news/suffragette-movie-history) beautifully played by Carey Mulligan, coming to the realization that she has no legal recourse over her detestable working environment, and in her personal world no claim over the welfare and future of her child. Maud comes to the conclusion, along with a group of fellow activists after hearing Mrs. Pankhurst speak, that years of peaceful protests had not altered their situations; shocks of violence were the only means of getting the attention of the government controlled Press and Parliament. The consequences of these menacing actions are woven into the film's drama. The wonderful actor Brendon Gleeson plays an Inspector Jarvert-type police official who is relentless in the prosecution and strategy of dealing with political "agitators" personifying the authority of the British legal system which enveloped ALL women who were subjugated to the daily slog of male dominance vitiating their every breath.SUFFRAGETTE is not a great film, but the inequities that befall the heroine and her "co- conspirators" made me fiercely conscious of society's injustice to those who are seen as defenseless. I was overcome by the overwhelming powerless of an individual to enact change without organizational support. Transformationis possible where there is courage and the remaining choices have been eliminated - when one is caged there are few alternatives other than shattering the bars.At the very end of the movie there is a timeline listing when women got the right to vote and the list was astonishing. There are many country's that in 2015 still do not grant women that right such as Saudi Arabia where it is still pending!!!!Timeline of Women's Suffrage Granted, by Country 1893 New Zealand 1902 Australia1 1906 Finland 1913 Norway 1915 Denmark 1917 Canada2 1918 Austria, Germany, Poland, Russia 1919 Netherlands 1920 United States 1921 Sweden 1928 Britain, Ireland 1931 Spain 1934 Turkey 1944 France 1945 Italy 1947 Argentina, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan 1949 China 1950 India 1954 Colombia 1957 Malaysia, Zimbabwe 1962 Algeria 1963 Iran, Morocco 1964 Libya 1967 Ecuador 1971 Switzerland 1972 Bangladesh 1974 Jordan 1976 Portugal 1989 Namibia 1990 Western Samoa 1993 Kazakhstan, Moldova 1994 South Africa 2005 Kuwait 2006 United Arab Emirates 2011 Saudi Arabia3 NOTE: One country does not allow their people, male or female, to vote: Brunei. 1.

		<shortDescription>A must see, if you equal rights are important to you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An important film that should be seen by all, but especially by young women who are complacent about the rights that they freely exercise in today's society. Moreover, I recommend to anyone with young women under 30 in their entourage, to encourage them to see this movie.The long march for equality of women in the World has only recently come to fruition and still, is not over. For example here in Québec, it was only in 1940, by taking advantage of a 4-year break in the stifling reign of Maurice Duplessis, that Godbout liberals granted the right to vote to women. That was only 75 years ago. In fact Québec was last Canadian province to do so. The movement of the Suffragettes began barely a century ago. That's like yesterday. To put this in perspective, this year I lost a dear aunt of mine, a remarkable and independent woman who lived all this evolution very personally. She was 104 years old.Coming back to the film, it is an intimate story, somewhat romanticized, but makes us feel the pain and suffering experienced by these women determined to carry out this quest for equality, in a very personal way. The Eastend of 1910 London is depicted with great realism. This poverty and vulnerability are quite poignant.Suffragette reminds us that hard-won rights remain, O so fragile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved Carey Mulligan here, she played her character deftly, maintained her humanity while developing a sense of herself as a woman, and then as a suffragette. She brought to life the trials and tribulations of women generally, from all walks of life and social statuses, in their long struggle to gain the vote. This was a good overview, provided some concrete background for just how long it took. We women of today have no idea what it took, how brutal the push-back became, how many decades passed from beginning to end. And that was just in Britain! Meryl Streep was eloquent, enthralling in identifying why they struggled, what was at stake, and how "going back to the old ways" was simply out of the question. Even for those women who seemed content to maintain what little they had, unwilling to fight because of the great potential costs to them personally. Generations came before those depicted in this movie, and still the struggle continued after the credits rolled here. Great cast all the way around, a joy to watch, thank you one and all, ladies and gentlemen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that many stand up and cheer and clap for the way it showcased the battles for early women's voting rights and equality!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw "Suffragette" the early 1900's drama film of the fight for women's equality and fights for their homes, and their jobs and children. All of this would lead up to the voting rights act to be passed for women gradually all around the globe country by country. This picture showcases the struggle and journey of hardship of women living at the time of the early 1900's in England as a group of them would become soldiers of the feminist movement. Yet during the process the country was a brutal state towards all females which involved things from beatings to being locked up and even being given old style prison type punishment in prison. Many scenes were tough to watch, thru it all the standout and fighter for freedom is a young lady named Maud Watts(a tough performance from Carey Mulligan)and she's married with a child and she's a slave at a local dry cleaning laundry shop. This doesn't silence her voice or other's mouths as it's a fight for justice, equal pay and voting rights equality even if it takes death and punishment a victory does come. Overall well done film about standing up for your rights of equality, freedom and equal status as most will clap and cheer at the pictures end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhat heavy handed telling of the suffragette movement in England. The women are gallant, the men mostly stereotype jerks. Carey Mulligan is excellent as always. The supporting cast is convincing. There's even a tea bag drop in by Meryl Streep.Costumes, especially hats are the real stars of the movie. Women who lost everything still managed to have great hats. You would think everyone in London would have access to an umbrella but not when suffering in the rain improves the drama.There's a powerful scene when the Mulligan character finds out she is loosing her son, that feels too written and conveniently placed for her character to appear in the right place at the right moment.While it's a "true" story it would have been more dramatic if the Mulligan character, the lead, met with the horse. Perhaps they were telling the wrong persons story.The movie uses a huge wide aspect ratio. On the theater screen some close up scenes have sixty foot across eyeballs. The movie is in limited release. Don't worry if you can't see it in a theater, it will play as well or better on a home platform.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought provoking movie. I note some are discounting it for 'not being historically accurate'. It's always good to note this sort of thing if it's the case, and good on them for drawing our attention to that point to explore, however I think that whether it is, or isn't, completely accurate, the movie still actually gets a message across and sets one to contemplating the lives and times of our own Mother, Grandmother, and Great-Grandmother and what the political climate was in each of their own lifetimes. It's quite amazing how we, as 'modern' women, pretty much take for granted the freedom we have, when it really wasn't all that long ago that they didn't have them or at best were limited. Yet there are still some today who won't vote, even though they have the right. Seeing the list of nations at the end showing the year in which they obtained the right to vote, was eye opening! In my view, if it at least serves as a stepping stone or starting point for some women (and/or men) to discover more on the subject of suffrage and/or women's studies then it has achieved something valuable. I enjoyed the character of Maud greatly and that the focus of the story remained on her for the most part. Overall, an enjoyable movie, which I think is worthy of the time spent viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'History' with a powerful emotional punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hats off to Abi Morgan and all the actors for avoiding the common fate of 'Big Issue' films - producing something honest and worthy but lacking in engagement. This is a big (by Brit standards!) movie, but it manages to avoid 'worthy' distance and reverence, taking you instead on a very human journey full of shadows and half-truths and moral and personal ambiguities. The central performances are flawless. Unusually for a British film, even the boy is brilliant (British child actors all too often being stage-schooled past believability or spontaneity). The scenes of violence perpetrated against these women - whether the police with their truncheons or the prison doctors with their force-feeding equipment - viscerally convey the loathing felt by many for these uppity 'unwomanly' women. The tragic frustration of women both ashamed and ashamed of their very shame was superbly conveyed. Perhaps above all, it stopped you in your tracks time and again by an awareness of just what was at issue. The fact that a man had sole 'ownership' of any children, and could do whatever he chose with them, regardless of their mother's views, just seems incredible, a century hence - yet it comes from an age where brides were required to promise 'obedience' to their husbands - and that was no mere form of words. And as others have said, the 'roll of shame' in the final credits brought audible gasps from around the auditorium, along with a timely reminder that these 'historical' struggles are far from altogether historical. This battle may have been won; the 'war' continues.Oh, and the evocation of the era - physically - is superbly done. You feel immersed in Edwardian London, from start to finish. At the end, you come out feeling more than a bit stunned. And so you should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Give Up the Fight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always important to have films like this come out every once in awhile. Not only does it give more roles to women, but it showcases where we came from as a society and as a part of the human race. Obviously, this film focuses on woman's suffrage in London, but the story is relatively the same across the globe. It's hard to believe that it was merely one hundred years ago that women finally gained the right to vote. I think Suffragette did this story justice and is beautifully performed all around.Carey Mulligan leads the group of women who joined forces and became known as suffragettes in the early 1900's. She plays Maud Watts, a fictionalized person but inspired by many suffragettes at that time. In fact, only a few of the lead characters are actually real people, but the message of the film does the job. Because Mulligan is at the center of the story, the movie relies upon her giving a great performance, and boy does she ever. Although the poster makes it seem like Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter are co-leads, they are both very much supporting roles. In fact, Meryl is only in one scene, but they are both extremely effective. The entire cast really nails their performances, much thanks to an impeccable and tight script that doesn't waste any screen time. Brendan Gleeson also gives an Oscar worthy performance as Steed, who constantly tries to prevent the women from supporting women's rights.The scary thing about this film's subject matter is that, for the most part, women's rights are still very much at the heart of a lot of political discussions. Instead of the right to vote, it's more about the right to equal pay (a huge problem in Hollywood). Suffragette doesn't pull any punches in tackling these issues, it's tough to watch at times, but the performances and directing are so good it's hard to take your eyes away. The only real issue I had was the shaky cam style of shooting some of the riot sequences. At times it can be nauseating, but other than that, this film should most definitely be considered for numerous academy awards come voting season.+Mulligan's best performance+Gleeson+Powerful drama that doesn't pull back+Tight script-Shaky cam9.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you read some of these reviews before going to the movies you may notice that almost all the reviewers gave this a score between 7 and 10. Why then was the average only 6.6 (at the time of this review)? Simply because on reviewer who thinks he knows British History gave it one star for its inaccuracies. According to him, only men with property could vote in the UK of 1912. He should read the Wikipedia Article about the Reform Act of 1867 which tells us that by 1868 ALL male heads of households were entitled to vote. It IS true that most of those who fought in WWI were not allowed to vote, as they were too young.Perhaps I have already spent too much time rebutting the claims of another reviewer. The fact is: this is a good movie. It is well written, well acted, well cast, and well filmed. Even if one disagrees with it's historical accuracy, with those qualities, a one is clearly unjustified. Were you to give a one to all movies based only on historical accuracy you would shudder at the thought what most of the films about Roman times would get.(Think Burton and Taylor for example.) I highly recommend you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>History doesn't repeat itself. At least not for women's rights. It'll never happen again. A group of women in London known as the suffragettes fight for women's rights in every way they can. This film, starring Carey Mulligan, follows a select few. Maud (Mulligan) is the new recruit, dragged in fighting the cause due to principles alone. She's treated like a piece of dirt at work and at home, just for standing up for what she believes in. This was the norm back in the 20's and 30's, but devastating to watch now. Along with Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff, Mulligan stands strong, exceeding the men around her. Director Sarah Gavron and writer Abi Morgan haven't made this a tale of equal opportunity. Some men help the cause (Bonham Carter's on screen husband), whilst others are truly despicable in nature (Mulligan's boss) and see woman as 2nd class citizens. Suffragette, although focusing on women, sits comfortably on the fence. Because not everyone feels the same way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recreation of women's fight for the vote in Britain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Maud Watts, barred from her husband's rooms, charges in to bring her little son a birthday present, her gift is a silly little toy elephant. The gift is a cheap trinket, pathetically wrapped. As it's all she can afford, it expresses not just her love but how her circumstances have so direly restricted her emotional and material life. The mingy elephant resonates further. It's exotic, from another world, scarcely more remote than the posh family life of the department store mannequins that captivated her before the suffragettes smashed the windows. The context discovers a further irony. Maud finds that her husband has given their son away to adoption. His new parents are there, promising their version of the mannequins' life. Maud's last words to her son are her name. She begs him to remember it and that he will someday come to find her. The elephant embodies her appeal to his memory. This unwitting aptness of the gift attests to the power of her intuition, as she gradually engages with the movement and resists the temptation to turn narc. This recreation of the early days of Britain's suffragette movement abounds in scenes of such misery, pathos, and thwarted but resilient spirit. It's a very touching film with a lasting political pertinence.The film's subject is not just the early days of the women's movement but the harshness of the patriarchal establishment that refused to cede away any of its power. In that way it speaks for the suppressed and silenced of any kind, in any culture. The harsh laundry manager who sexually abuses one girl ? and by implication similarly violated Maud when she came to work there as a child ? is on the same continuum as the dogged police inspector determined to make the women respect the unrespectable law. As Maud brands the former with her iron, she seems to arouse an unarticulated respect in the copper.Like any serious historical film, this is about the time it was made as well as the period in which it is set. Why else tell that story now? We're in the third wave of feminism in the West, but the battle is far from won. Women have the vote but they are still far from equal. Glass ceiling and walls persist. Hence too the horrible stories of women harassed and violated by their colleagues in the fire department and the army and even by the famed RCMP. Canada's new prime minister Justin Trudeau is still asked to explain why he appointed a cabinet with half its members women. Even such a customarily wise columnist as Andrew Coyne trotted out in advance the old concern that women could only be appointed with a compromise in merit. He was suitably impressed by the appointments once made, but he remains diminished by that initial knee-jerk concern. An Alberta MLA finds there is no provision for her unprecedented situation, her imminent maternity leave. So you've come a long way baby. But frankly we ? men and our systemic authority ? have a lot further yet to go.The film is current in an additional sense. End titles record when various countries gave their women the vote. Qatar has just done that and Saudi Arabia has promised it. But much of the world does not extend even our inadequate recognition of women's due equality. London's brutal attack on women demonstrators here recall the scenes from the Arab Spring Egypt and Iran. Around the world rape is a military strategy.In the current cultural war between radical Islam and Western civilization, women's rights are a crucial battleground. The abuse of women in Muslim countries seems like a time machine flashback to our earlier, shameful days. But with time machines it's sometimes hard to know if the gear is forward or reverse. The London violence and repressive patriarchal laws here could be a flash forward to Europe under the threatened Caliphate. Time, as usual, will tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be extremely moving; it just pulled on my heart strings the way the main character Maud was portrayed.The movie does not manage to cover all aspects of suffrage and feminism because the scope of the subject matter is so wide, but I don't think this detracts from the movie itself, because this is mainly a story about the personal growth of Maud: a young working class woman who becomes a suffragette. I think the director chose the right path to focus on the experiences Maud goes through as a person (family breaks ups, harassments at work, meetings with fellow suffragettes, planning for attacks, captured and imprisoned, etc.), and I think Maud's story is told with great depth and attention to detail.All in all, I would not just recommend this story to people who want to know more about suffrage and feminist history, but also to audiences who just want to see the satisfaction of a downtrodden main character doing her utmost to take back control of her own life, even to the point of radicalization and engaging in violent acts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolution not Gandhi style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I feel like I am the only one supporting important movies in my town. When I entered the theater to watch Suffragette, I was the only one. Only shortly before the movie started not even a dozen more people showed up. All women. This is a movie which should be seen by young people instead of all these car chasing and blow up movies. Not that there were no blow ups in this movie. The Suffragettes were quite violent and bombed mailboxes and houses. there was also plenty of violence against women and I would prefer that young people see this realistic violence instead of the video game-like violence, they consume in the blockbusters. This is a great movie, well acted, moving and with historical interest. I did not quite understand what Merryl Streep was doing in this movie beside providing a big American name, but the rest of the cast was well chosen. Not that Merryl was not great, she always is. The movie moves you to run to the next voting booth and cast your vote. It seems that the suffering from these ground-breaking women is not really valued by the women who came after them, if you look at voter participation. The end of the movie was not really the end win of the Suffragettes , that came only after WWI. But before the finale credits run, we see a list of when women (and sometimes all men) got their voting rights in different countries. It was fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffragette</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have first found out about the women's rights movement, and what a suffragette was, from Mary Poppins, so I was most interested to find out more with a film based on the subject, written by Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady, Shame) and directed by Sarah Gavron (Brick Lane). Basically set in early 20th century London, England, working wife and mother Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan), following mistreatment from her employers, police and political lies, along with hundreds of other women, is secretly recruited to join the Women's Social and Political Union. The aim of the WSPU is to gain equal rights for women, specifically their right to vote, Maud becomes a suffragette activist for the movement, alongside many women from different backgrounds. Other members include Maud's fellow laundry worker Violet Miller (Anne-Marie Duff), shopkeeper Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter), gentry Alice Haughton (Romola Garai), and the WSPU's founder is outlaw fugitive Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep). The women's radicalisation turns from peaceful protests to law breaking, aggressive police action forces them to meet and plan underground, to make an impact and gain attention the women carry out arson, including damage to Oxford Street windows, postboxes, churches and politicians homes. Leading the investigations to find and capture specific women identified by witnesses is Inspector Arthur Steed (Brendan Gleeson), but those women arrested and imprisoned only create more attention by going on hunger strikes, Maud herself is recognised as a law-breaker, which causes her husband Sonny (Skyfall's Ben Whishaw) to stop her seeing her child. After many illegal acts in public places, the women know that they must make a great protest that will gain the attention of the world, so they attend the Epsom Derby where King George V is riding, and cameras will be rolling, but knowing that they are outnumbered by authorities it looks hopeless to try. However, in the end, it is suffragette Emily Davison (Natalie Press) that creates the great shock that changes the law, she runs out onto the track as the horse race is commencing, and is trampled and killed by the King's horse, a funeral is held and she in history has created a legacy, some months or years later votes for women is granted, and over time other countries have followed in the change to the law. Also starring Samuel West as Benedict Haughton, Geoff Bell as Norman Taylor and Adrian Schiller as David Lloyd George. Mulligan gives a very emotional performance, Carter gets her moments, and although Streep is only for merely minutes she does do her usual great act. The story is of course based on true events, the film is full of turbulent and emotional scenes as the women will do almost anything to make a point and get the same rights as the opposite gender, the revolutionary and political stuff is very realistic, and the action is moving in many moments, it is a very satisfactory historical drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carey Mulligan is excellent, her story is harrowing, and it's all quite shocking for a cinema-goer who didn't know the history of the circumstances of working women suffragettes in early 20th century London at all.The art direction is fastidious in re-creating the setting and moment in history, and the cast - both the women and men playing characters from all across the class divides - all work very hard.I found it hard to fathom that a domestic terror campaign was required in order for women to receive the right to vote in London. Really. If the same actions were to be taken today - for any cause whatsoever - it would be marked down in the annals of history and be remembered on yearly anniversaries for decades. Yet the memory of London suffragettes was clearly drowned by the forthcoming world wars.How times change. How easily we forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffragete - is it really the best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the privilege to attend an early screening of this film. I live in London, so it is heavily commercialized, with adverts on buses with The Suffragete posters on them, saying it's the best film of the year. Going in, my expectations were already high and with the cast that it has, I assumed it was going to be a decent picture. The film certainly lived up to my expectations. Carey Mulligan gave an astonishing performance, carrying the entire picture on her back. The relationship she has with her son is so touching and, in my opinion it is the most beautiful part of the movie. The boy who plays her son is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. The interesting fact about this story is that it is not so much focused on the Suffragetes as it is on this woman's journey. We see everything through her eyes and it is almost like we can feel the pain she is feeling. It is so easy to relate to the story, even though it is set in the late 19th century. What women had to go through back then is not so different from what some go through in certain countries today. This film reminds us how strong women are and how people shouldn't be judged or treated differently based on their gender. The only thing I didn't like is how much Meryl Streep is mentioned int the adverts and how she is in the poster, and in fact she only has one scene with a couple of lines. A powerful scene, but still. If you are a Meryl Streep fan, going into this movie, don't expect to see that much of her. There are many close ups, which helps you bond with the lead character in a way. Everything is shot in a grayish tone, like most movies set in historical periods are. One of my favorite scenes shows how London looked like during those times. They actually closed the Oxford Street for a day. We had the honor to ask one of the producers couple of questions after the screening. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. The suffrage of the Suffragetes and their dedication and sacrifices will never be forgotten. The bus was right, it is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We all need to experience this beautiful struggle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I would rather be a rebel than a slave." Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep) In 1912 England, women, by contemporary standards, were no better than slaves. Ruled by husbands, who had complete decision-making power, even over children, women inevitably would fight to the death for equal rights. Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan), a composite suffragette in the film of the same name, combines a sweet motherhood with an escalating militancy. As in the recent Far From the Madding Crowd, Mulligan is a powerful underplayer of powerful women.Director Sara Gavron recreates gloomy early-20th century East London, with its Gray skies, dirty streets, and horses co-existing with the growing automobile. Both the aggressive women and can't-be-denied autos crowd the streets announcing their inevitable dominance in a culture just awakening to their potency. But the fight is a tough one: Maud's husband Sonny (Ben Whishaw) proclaims his authority about their son: "The law says he is mine." Although we know that by 1925 British women will gain the vote, the film masterfully immerses us in the daily struggle of the suffragettes to make the government aware of the inequality. Representing the letter of the law, Inspector Arthur Steed (Brendan Gleeson) pursues the foot-soldier feminists with a hint of frustration at increasingly barbaric treatment, but he never flinches from his duty: "Don't bother arresting them. Let their husbands deal with them." Although the film depicts London as subdued dark, a spirit of can-do lies underneath that depression, vigor best expressed by the fearless leader, Mrs. Pankhurst: "Deeds not words." Even as we know the feminist victory is inevitable, the filmmakers so well craft the struggle that we pull for the suffragettes as if the outcome were not certain. Such is the genius of period pieces like Suffragette: We live the pain with the protagonists.That's rewarding cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>English director Sarah Gavron's second feature film which was written by Welsh playwright and screenwriter Abi Morgan, is inspired by real events which took place in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801-1922) in the early 20th century. It premiered in the United States, was shot on locations in England and is a UK production which was produced by producers Alison Owen and Faye Ward. It tells the story about an ordinary English daughter named Maud Watts who works at a glasshouse laundry in Bethnal Green, London, England.Distinctly and precisely directed by English filmmaker Sarah Gavron, this quietly paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated by and mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws a generational portrayal of a former head washer whom after acquainting a co-worker named Violet and an organizer named Edith gradually starts to recognize her self-respect. While notable for its distinctly atmospheric and realistic milieu depictions, reverent cinematography by cinematographer Edu Grau, production design by production designer Alice Normington and costume design by costume designer Jane Petrie, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about equal worth and something an English journalist termed as ... ..., was made more than four centuries after women from a Radical Protestant movement which was initiated in Zurich, Switzerland in the 16th century who called themselves Levellers were contemptuously dismissed as ..., ..., ... ... and ... ... when they petitioned for peace and the completion of a 17th century painting called "Venus at Her Mirror", more than three centuries after the first Unitarian Church was founded in England, more than a century after an English advocate for mothers' rights named Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Sheridan Norton (1808-1877) wrote in a letter to the Queen: "I believe in my obscurer position that I am permitted to be the example on which a particular law shall be reformed." the passing of The Custody of Infants Acts (1839), a book regarding a wife called "Angel in the House" (1854) was published, the Marriage and Divorce Bill (1855), the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act (1857), the Elementary Education Act (1870), an English attorney named Richard Pankhurst (1835/36-1898) drafted a bill which resulted in the first Married Women's Property Act (1870), an English master of words with a male pseudonym wrote: "? Never to be fully possessed by what we behold, never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought ? always to be scholarly and uninspired ?"

Made more than a century after an Irish poet named Eva Selina Laura Gore-Booth (1870-1926) assembled signatures, an English advocate for moral equality named Teresa Bilington-Greig (1877-1964) who thought that the adoption of violence would condemn many women to personal sacrifice that in some cases amounts to suicide, and in all cases to suffering of terrible strain and much possible abuse said: "I do not believe that the best avenue for the enfranchisement of women is through ? personal tyranny and fanaticism." an English composer and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire wrote a unison song called "The March of the Women", an Austrian-born English militant known by the pseudonym Jane Warton was force-fed whilst on hunger strike, someone wrote the lyrics: "March, women, march!

This apparently noble and virtuous self-renunciation in practice usually involves a most criminal self-extinction." where a laundress joins an international women's movement whom is struggling for Suffragium, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, rhythmic continuity, comment by Maud: "?Yours sincerely." and the persevering acting performance by English actress Carey Mulligan.

		<shortDescription>A Truly Important History Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review for IMDb, and for good reason. I experience movies viscerally, which does not lend itself to critical analysis. Nevertheless I feel compelled to offer an opinion here. This is a VERY IMPORTANT MOVIE! Like others, my knowledge of suffragettes was limited to the genteel, unoffensive, upper class militancy of Mrs. Banks played by Glynis Johns in Mary Poppins. The reality of the suffragette movement was really a lot more like the American civil rights movement of the 60's. Think more of Martin Luther King Jr. and Selma, than of Mrs. Banks and flying nannies. People were beaten, people died, and families were torn apart. It was not a pretty sight. That was the reality of the suffragette movement, and we all know that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. In recent years it has become uncool for women to identify as feminists. For the life of me I cannot understand why anyone would not want to be identified with wanting equal pay for equal work, and equal opportunity in all endeavours of life. As a male I have identified as a feminist for as long as I have understood what it meant. Anyway this movie is a graphic portrayal of the suffering and sacrifices these early feminists had to to endure. In my very humble opinion the acting, the script, and the production values were all first class. This movie should be mandatory viewing for anyone studying history or anyone interested in human rights, or for that matter anyone who is a mother, wife, or daughter, or anyone who has a mother, wife, or daughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was It In Vain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film left me with many emotions such as: anger, pity, cynicism. My frustration turned to anger as I noted that it was a woman cleaning the cinema, and wondered what had changed. Have women gained true equality? Was the 'right to vote' just 'lip service' to the women's cause? The film got me wondering about my grandmothers, and the exciting period they witnessed, and yet my grandmothers still struggled as a woman. My grandmothers were always scrubbing floors, washing clothes, cooking whilst still going out to work in some menial, low paid job. This despite gaining the right to vote!The film is set in London's East End, and looks at the life of one woman in particular. This woman might represent all of our grandmothers, and great grandmothers; the typical lives they lead and the low expectations of a working class woman at that time. This part was delivered competently by actor Carey Mulligan as Maud the laundry worker, who was swept up into the movement by default.Her plight was a daily grind of hard, physical labour in a low paid job, daily sexual harassment from her boss, and obedience to her Edwardian husband. Therefore, not much different from the lives of many working class women today.To that end, this film was not essentially one about the first wave women's movement, but about working class women's lives. These women were at the bottom of the social pile, and subject to exploitation by their employers, their men folk, and by middle class women and their causes! You might say, as suggested in the film, fodder of the cause!As for the acting, the part of Maud was played well by Mulligan; she and other actor, Anne-Marie Duff, who played Violet, were the epitome of careworn working class women, who were vitamin deficient and malnourished and plainly worn out. However, superstars such as Meryl Streep just re-acted the part she played as Mrs. Thatcher in The Iron Lady (2011). Accordingly, she just didn't convince me that she was the great Emmeline Pankhurst of the women's moment. I expected more acting ability from Streep gven her world class record. As for Helena Bonham-Carter, she just playis the same part in every role. She never changes her style of acting. She is also typecast as an Edwardian woman in most films.And while this film is set in an Edwardian period of British history, it has many anachronisms, such as when the suffragettes chained themselves to the railings of the period were wrongly situated. But, I won't nitpick, as the main point was made! That point was to protest in a radical way.This radical method of protest was met with the ultimate sacrifice to the cause, by Emily Davidson, who died in the name of the cause at the feet of the King's house at the Epsom Derby. The film portrayed her as an almost innocent protester, who thought that the horse would stop and acknowledge her protest. But the most telling aspect of this ultimate sacrifice was, as the the film points out, that the derby officials, medics and spectators rushed to tend to the jockey and the horse as opposed to Emily Davidson.At this juncture in the film, it morphs into the actual black and white film reel of the real suffragettes, who marched, agitated and died for women all over the world. This was illustrated beautifully with a roll call of countries where women gained the right to vote, and the one that has yet to give women the vote.All in all, a great film, directed by Sarah Gavron in tribute to these brave women. The question is, was their bravery all in vain? Moreover, where are the feminists to the cause those days?</fullReview>

Suffragette is a well made movie about women's fight for equality in the UK 100 years ago.A women's got to do what a women's got to do, as the the film shows just how truly dedicated these women were to the cause, and how that dedication lead to violence on both sides.The movie is filled with those dramatically enlightening speeches, about why women should vote that leave any sensible minded person to say duh, yeah you're right. What I really love was that these speeches were backed up by the visual story of what these women went though when somehow their intelligent words went on death's ears (this is my intelligent way of saying, I like it when the women tried to do it peacefully, hit a brick wall with the stubborn old white dudes, so took a brick to hit a wall, which got their attention).It was harsh for me to watch women get beaten up for a human right everyone (at least in The US and UK) have had for so long. Suffragette is an important film that proves the point of those who do not know history are doom to repeat it.Not nearly as difficult to watch as Twelve Years a Slave, or anything like that, but I feel the point getting made and it's important to feel those points in this time in age were women are still fighting for equality.An important must see worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Docu-drama Depicting A Pivotal Moment in Women's History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suffragette is a phenomenal movie directed by Sarah Gavron. I love this movie because it ties real historical events into a realistic story about the hardships women dealt with just a century ago. This historical drama incorporates realistic period costumes and accurately spot-on settings to depict how women were considered less competent and less deserving of rights than men. Suffragette is about a feminist movement consisting of powerful women dedicating their lives to attaining the right to vote. Set in London 1912, Maud Watts (Carey Mulligan) is a wife and mother on the verge of becoming a suffragette. After attending one of the suffragette meetings, she learns how much of a commitment it is to participate and what the risks are. She makes many friends from the suffragettes such as Violet Miller (Anne-Marie Duff) who is there with Maud every step of the way. Violet is a true believer for women's rights and makes an immense effort to be heard. My favorite scene is when the women are fighting for their rights and are arrested. After they get out of jail, the women are handed flowers and a medal. They are congratulated for their first incarceration. As one of the suffragettes said, "We don't want to be lawbreakers, we want to be lawmakers". This really shows that the women are not trying to be rough, it was a desperate plea to get the attention they rightfully deserve. My favorite character is definitely Maud Watts. She is a powerful woman and she shows that women can do anything they put their mind to. She is so determined to get her rights that she sacrifices her family, her job and her house to stand up for what she believes in. Another stand out performance is Helena Bonham Carter who plays Edith Ellyn. She really inspired me as she encouraged the others to stand up and never give up even when it seems impossible.I recommend Suffragette for ages 13 to 18 because it is a little bloody when the women are getting beaten. I do believe that if you are 13 or older, you should definitely see this movie because it educates viewers regarding a significant part of history. I give this movie five out of five stars because overall this is an outstanding movie. You may see Suffragette in theatres now! Reviewed by Lainey A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suffragette (2015) is a Directoral collaboration between Sarah Gavron (Brick Lane) and writer Abi Morgan (Iron Lady), funded by the British Film Institute. Carey Mulligan is compelling as Maud watts, the Laundry worker who discovers the WSPU through Violet Miller (Ann Marie Duff) and Shopkeeper Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter). Their WSPU cohorts are Mrs Withers, Emily Davison, Mrs Haughton (Romola Garai)and WSPU founder Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep)who is only in the film for a few minutes. The film is an Historical drama, not biopic set in London that follows the early members of the Women's Social and Political Union and their radicalisation from peaceful protesters to law breakers. The film documents WSPU's secret meetings to discuss tactics when protests and parliamentary evidence fail to win women the vote. After further mistreatment by employers, police and political lies by Lloyd George the suffragettes decide to increase their activism through civil disobedience causing damage to Oxford Street windows, postboxes, churches and politicians homes. Police surveillance and arrests lead to the suffragette's imprisonment and hunger strikes. The script and acting is powerful and emotional and the film is a well directed attempt by Gavron to tell the Suffragettes story with compassion covering the impact on working class women, middle class educated women and the Gentry. The Director further develops socio-economic divisions by including the suffragettes husbands struggle to support their wives activism through Mr Watts, Mr Ellyn and Mr Haughton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Need Move Films about Womens Rights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I woman, I think about how each choice affects women's power. I have grown up in a culture of strong women who work hard but still in Ireland women are fighting to be 30% of the government.This film is about how one working woman came to be involved in women's suffrage in England. We see how little power she had at work - she was one of generations of women who worked in a laundry and anticipated an early work related death.Most working class families were eeking out a living and in times when birth control was illegal, women were weaken by constant pregnancies. There was huge cultural pressure on everybody to maintain the status quo. Not to join unions, to accept that the aristocracy knew what was best and that a man was the leader of the family. Following WW1 working people who died in the trenches were weary of blindly following social strata.Women were powerless on all fronts and, like in Saudi Arabia, there was no legal means of protest.The acting is stellar, the script is good (although I hate the part when Ms Streep quotes Buzz Lightyear) and its an era that deserves far more screen time.Issues like equal pay and sexual harassment have yet to be dealt with and we are a long way from equal power.Lots done - More to Do !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just 'essential viewing,' Suffragette manages to be both educational and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suffragette packs a punch. It's a soldiering tribute to the women who fought for the right to vote and paved the way for the feminist movement in the UK. While the script might be a little too biopic friendly, it's still a rousing film full of outstanding performances. Director Sarah Gavron wisely frames the conflict through the eyes of Maud (Carey Mulligan), and she keeps the drama at an intimate level, all while hinting at the larger scope of the movement nationwide.Instead of going big, Suffragette puts us in the shoes of Maud Watts, an outsider to the movement, who works as a launderer. What I really liked about the film is that you hear murmurs about this group led by the charismatic Emmeline Pankhurst (Meryl Streep) and their activities throughout the first half of the film. They are sort of portrayed as a small-scale movement that won't cause much damage, but when Maud decides to get involved and get active, we see firsthand how powerful the group is. Obviously with a film like this many know the story already, yet Gavron and writer Abi Morgan literally put you in Maud's shoes as she gets deeper into the action, with protests and bombings aplenty.Carey Mulligan is a revelation as Maud. Her best performance since An Education, Mulligan is pitch perfect for the role. She's such a natural actor that practically everything she feels, you feel alongside her. Gavron favors close-ups of the women in these harsh work conditions, and it works at getting underneath their skin and bringing the raw emotion to life. Other suffragettes Edith Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter), Violet (Anne-Marie Duff), and Emily (Natalie Press) make quite an impact too. It isn't exactly an ensemble cast - Mulligan carries most of the film's weight - but it's nice having supporting characters that make a lot of background noise and are actually memorable characters rather than props. Unfortunately Meryl Streep doesn't have that same luxury. Her character is portrayed as a god-like being, and while this might have been true for the suffragettes, she is only present in the film for less than five minutes and doesn't make a lasting impression on the audience.The script is marvelous at bringing to life early 20th century London, and the production design is gorgeous. The murky city breathes deep, as the dark alleys where these women plot their attacks is paralleled with the brighter scenes of the lawmakers in Parliament. The film on the whole has a feeling of a pot on a burner, ready to boil over any minute. It's a testament to the writing and direction that can convey a sense of natural urgency driven by history. Additionally a beautiful score from Alexandre Desplat (my favorite composer) accompanies the action and keeps the lows low and the highs high.The brilliant script works at showing how Maud and the activists practiced civil disobedience and "unladylike" tactics while facing oppression from both home and the government. It does grow a bit tiresome towards the end, however, and the finale doesn't quite have the impact that it might have expected. There are many moments that could be considered climactic, and the one chosen is brilliant, but the falling action leads to a poor final few minutes. Of course it ends with typical true story text and a list of countries when women gained the right to vote (which is genius), but the ending could've been a little more out-of-the-box than what we got. Another coat of polish could've elevated Suffragette from a striking biopic to something in a league of its own. Regardless, Suffragette falls under the category of "essential viewing," and it manages to be both entertaining and important. Nailing that balance for films like this is key, and Suffragette brings a wallop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historicallly inaccurate, but ideologically pure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fundamentalist feminist glossing over of a nuanced historical series of events, which fails to show the real work for equal voting rights (which most people, men included, did not have at this point in history) was done by the suffragists, composed of men &amp; women, who lobbied for 1 person = 1 vote...rather than the openly racist suffragettes who only wanted white, upper class women to have the vote. At this point in history, usually only white, upper class men holding large property holdings could vote (although some women holding equivalent property ex. Widows running a business, with a number of employees could and DID vote. )Remember, almost all of the men &amp; women who died on the fields (&amp; hospitals) in World War One did NOT have the right to vote...and even today, voting in most countries is intrinsically tied to military service (i.e. The draft), an obligation that almost always only applies to men. So for the most part,women get the Right to vote without the Obligation to serve...except in Israel, and most non Western countries. Avoid this movie, and do yourself a favour by doing a little reading of non-feminist studies peer reviewed historical papers...truth is stranger (&amp; more enlightening) than fiction</fullReview>
