		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie Named Kings Of Egypt In Arabian Countries.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt is a 2016 fantasy film featuring ancient Egyptian deities. The United States-Australia production is directed by Alex Proyas and stars Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Chadwick Boseman, Elodie Yung, Courtney Eaton, Rufus Sewell, with Gerard Butler and Geoffrey Rush. Butler plays the god of darkness Set who takes over the Egyptian empire, and Thwaites plays the mortal hero Bek who partners with the god Horus, played by Coaster-Waldau, to save the world and rescue his love.Filming took place in Australia under the American studio Summit Entertainment. While the film's production budget was $140 million, the parent company Lionsgate's financial exposure was less than $10 million due to tax incentives and pre-sales. The Australian government provided a tax credit for 46% of the film's budget. When Lionsgate began promoting the film in November 2015, it received backlash for its predominantly white cast playing Egyptian characters. In response, Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas apologized for the lack of casting diversity.Lionsgate released Gods of Egypt in theaters globally starting on February 25, 2016 in 2D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D. It released the film in the United States, Canada, and 68 other markets on February 26, 2016 and will release it in the United Kingdom on April 8, 2016.The survival of mankind hangs in the balance when Set (Gerard Butler), the merciless god of darkness, usurps Egypt's throne and plunges the prosperous empire into chaos and conflict. Hoping to save the world and rescue his true love, a defiant mortal named Bek (Brenton Thwaites) forms an unlikely alliance with the powerful god Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Their battle against Set and his henchmen takes them into the afterlife and across the heavens for an epic confrontation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just liked it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing some of the reviews online, I wonder if people just watch a movie while relaxing anymore. I thought this movie had great effects, a pretty good story line, and very likable characters. I even liked the bad guys. I see many people commented that the cast was too 'white'. Do they bitch about Star Wars people being too 'human'? Come on people, this is fantasy. It is OK to have 13 foot tall 'gods' walking around as long as they are ethnically correct??? Do you think Egypt really looked like that in those days? This is a fairy tale. Not real life. Just like the tales of the bible. Sit down and enjoy a movie once in a while. Don't try to nit-pick through the whole movie! And for Christ's sake, RELAX once in a while!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a documentary, it's a fantasy/action entertainer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, yes, the actors playing Gods of Egypt are white! Guess what, they're not speaking Coptic either! Gasp! (yes, I had to google what the closest live language to ancient Egyptian was &gt;_&lt;).I do believe it is understood that this story is an adaptation of ancient Egyptian beliefs and characters (gods and goddesses, afterlife, etc). So yes, they pick and choose what parts they want in a (very) westernized tale... And I did think that they did a good job. For the ancient Egyptians, the gods did walk amongst the living. The king was supposed to be the living embodiment of the god Horus. So the storyline is not really that far-fetched. As for the acting, most of the cast is pretty good. Horus was a slight let down. It's as if they wanted Aaron Eckhart, but had to make do with this guy. (Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart are in London Has Fallen). And the girl playing Zaya. I guess that was her character? to be "sweet" and steadfast in loyalty, both to her husband and to her God. Still, every time she came on screen, I thought the ancient Egyptians had great push-up technology. Seth and Hathor were great (Gerard Butler and Elodie Yung). Geoffrey Rush does justice to his role (as always). Brenton Thwaite (the mortal/the thief) wasn't so bad either.It's a sweet story overall. And entertaining! Lovely CGI on top of it. I enjoyed it :). I wouldn't recommend it to scholars of ancient Egypt. But even they would appreciate the nod to mythological characters in this fiction piece :D.Disclaimer: I left pretty much the exact same review on rottentomatoes. I don't normally leave reviews, but this movie is getting a bad rep, and unfairly! It happens to be one of the better movies out there right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SURPRISE: Actually quite good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not trust "movie professionals" who know nothing about the Kemet - the original ancient Egyptian religion. Yes, this is an action movie. Yes, it diverges a lot from canonical ancient Egyptian religion. Yes, it is "too white" for ancient Egypt. Yes, there is a mixture of Hellenic interpretation which kinda does not fit in. Building an "Super Seth"? A pure nonsense.But you know what? It does not matter as it captures the spirit of Kemet pretty well. Seth versus Horus? Oh yes. Flat Earth with day side and night side and never ending fight of Ra with Apopis? Yes. Debates between the humans and gods leading to sort of understanding and sort of tolerance? Yes. Nepthys, the wife of Seth, "excellent goddess",protective goddess, feeling sadness for people dying? Yes. Multiple Thowt servants, mapping the knowledge? Yes! (Please do complain, black racist people here: Black Thowt is displayed respectfully here!) Hathor, "cursed by love"? Yes! Isis, the super model of double betraying women that will betray her son to betray his enemy to allow her son win? The nasty manipulating goddess that is so sensitive to people in love? Oh yes! Anubis, the inert god that feels nothing towards gods of men yet fights for the order of the underworld? Yes! Lots of action in between Egyptian gods? Oh hell yes! Actually I do appreciate the effort to capture the feeling of Kemet. Yes, this is not the Kemet. But considering all the alternatives I have ever seen, this is the very best. Actually, the Christian overtones of God understanding the nature of suffering the mortals are not damaging, they are helping! Dear "professional" reviewers! Any single of you who reviewed this movie less than 40% - please ask me for a diploma that certifies you have sh*t for brains, you know sh*t of history, culture and you should focus on movies like The Independence Day. In such movies your cultural ignorance has no distortive value.For all others: This is a fairy tale. An American fairy tale. But the American fairy tale that has *the feel* for the dynamic of ancient Egyptian religion. It is an excellent movie, it is fun, full of action and actually does not insult ancient Egyptian religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are the reviews so low?? Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a actually a pretty epic movie. Probably more like an 8 or 9 out of 10, but i have to level out some of the reviews that really dogged this movie. You have to go into this knowing it is a fantasy movie. And it's pretty darn good. Great story, and satisfying ending. Do yourself a favor and don't pay attention to the overall score, just go and see it.There were some unexpected twist and turns. The Director definitely didn't cut any corners. There was some pretty good CGI, as well as some OK CGI. Overall though it was good. Hopefully there will be a sequel.Costumes and acting were good, I know people complained about whitewashing, but really who cares. I know i don't make enough money to care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Gods of Egypt with my 5th and 7th grade boys on 3D Imax, and we loved it! An original movie for a change, not a sequel, or prequel, or reboot, or franchise, or comic book adaptation, or spin-off film. This movie had very striking visuals, sweeping music, fun acting and action sequences, and engaging characters. It moved along very briskly, despite its slightly long run time. We had no difficulty following the plot (which is certainly no less plausible or linear than Episode VII!) or understanding who the somewhat unfamiliar Egyptian mythological characters were as some reviews suggested we might. There was a nice character arc for Horus, and even a thoughtful message from the gods to humankind at the end. Ethnically inaccurate casting choices--yeah, it would have been nice to see a more authentic cast, but these actors got the job done, and that is no reason to skip the movie if you like this sort of film, in my opinion. Give this film a chance, you may enjoy it much more than you expect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Vain Do You Think I Am?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, before I begin my philosophical review, which may bore you to tears if you are disinclined to abstract bloviating, this movie works as pure spectacle. The CGI is well done and the parallel intertwined stories of Bek, the lowly thief, seeking his dead beloved's return from the afterlife and Horus's battle against Set work well as a fast moving action movie. For me, the attraction was such a rare thing to be found here in pagan land. The learning to trust the gods, there is a parallel between transcending selfish quests for vengeance as Horus learns to see his Kingdom and its people. The zenith of the morality is reached when the victorious Horus announces that deeds not wealth lead to the reward in the afterlife. He rescinds Set's demand for treasure to buy yourself immortality, this is not an anomaly. The movie follows the existential development of both lead protagonists: Horus and Bek. Both begin the movie oblivious to their responsibilities, even Osiris looks a bit dubious in presenting his son with the crown. As Bek learns to trust Horus, and Horus learns to care for these smaller, relatively insignificant creatures, the characters deepen and grow as the movie plays. The restoration of the moral order with rectitude set above profit evinces the reflective allegorical disenchantment of Americans' with their oligarchs and their dwindling spending power will open up to you.The movie is an extremely fast paced action movie that will never bore you. Butler's Set has no problem cheating constantly to obtain and maintain power. It is a rare villain role for Butler, I thought he rendered it well. The parallel development of the two main characters learning to work together against Set is the center of the movie. It comes with a rather miraculous happy ending that I won't spoil for you. The effects are uniformly well done but there are many bad movies this is true of also. Why I liked the movie, is Bek's love that simply knows no boundaries for returning to his lost Zaya. The story of the wounded Horus who learns his strength comes from inside, not from his eyes, parallel's the human Bek's story. This weaving together of the two, with good banter between them, is the surprise of the movie. The narrative core of the movie is these two stories of the leads: Horus and Bek. I liked the movie as pure spectacle yet it is not vapid and brainless. There is a moral depth to it that gives it greater meaning than most current action movies. Movies are always reflections of their zeitgeist, as a philosopher I found it reassuring: this rejection of wealth as a sign of ontological value; believe me, this is not a commonality in modern American cinema. One can but hope it is a harbinger of a coming rejection of the Global Oligarch's god: Money. Bek's love that is an unstoppable force wins even the admiration of the gods around him. True, his proclivity for survival irritates the arrogant god of knowledge who speaks the above funniest line in the entire movie. Horus is best viewed in contrast from the lazy sybarite we meet at the beginning and the one, at the very end, who departs imitating Bek in returning to the Underworld to find his lost love. This is the hidden treasure, my friends: love, duty, honor and goodness really aren't punchlines but they are the beauty of life. As I look about me, how much happier my fellow denizens would be if they shed this decadent need to crap upon all that is beautiful in this life. Yes, action fans, the movie won't let you down, I wasn't bored for one minute. My elder brother sat upon the edge of his seat most of the movie. Yes, fly through the Fires Of Hell to find that Love you lost. A Good Movie. Q.E.D. "We Travel The World Over To Find Beauty, Unless We Carry It With Us We Find It Not."

		<shortDescription>Underrated Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the ancient Egypt, the god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) has split Egypt in two: the fertile part with the Nile would be ruled by his son Osiris (Bryan Brown) and the desert by his son Set (Gerard Butler). During the coronation of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) by his father Osiris, Set betrays his brother and kills him. Then he withdraws the eyes of Horus that are his source of power and exiles him in the desert. The mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his beloved wife Zaya (Courtney Eaton) that worships Horus become slaves of Set. Zaya, who is working for Set's architect Urshu (Rufus Sewell), convinces Bek to steal the eyes of Horus from a well-protected pyramid designed by Urshu to give them back to Horus, the only one capable to defeat Set. Bek succeeds but retrieves only one of the eyes; however Urshu discovers the theft and Bek and Zaya need to flee. Urshu kills Zaya with an arrow and when Bek reaches Horus' shelter, he proposes to help the god to retrieve his other eye. In return, he demands that Horus bring his beloved Zaya back from the underworld. They team up and soon Horus' lover Hathor (Elodie Yung), the goddess of love, leaves Set and joins them in their quest to defeat the evil Set. "Gods of Egypt" is an underrated adventure. The story is highly entertaining but the great cast is overshadowed by the special effects. The plot is funny and is a delightful joke regarding the mythology. It recalls the naive and silly adventures that older viewers used to see in the matinees, and therefore highly recommended. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Deuses do Egito" ("Gods of the Egypt")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 out of ten for creativity, 8 out of ten for action, 6.9 out of ten for acting, and an 10 out of ten for being a cheesy but fun ride. This ins't an art film, this isn't like a film you win Oscars for. Its for a fun ride and it delivered in an epic way. This film is better than a 5.3 and a 25 Metascore. If i could rate this film with decimal points i would give it a 6.3 if i was going to judge it on them movie itself. But an 7.9 to an 8 on its genre It fits into the blockbuster film genre. To be honest its not film its just a movie. So stop treating it like its trying to be a good film and more like its trying to entertain and make money as a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several reviews regarding Gods of Egypt, i resigned myself to have a look at the film. I first saw it at the sundance film festival in Honolulu, Where i was cavorting with my pregnant secretary Imelda, this is of course without my wifes knowledge, Anyway back to the film, the Gods of Egypt is a film on par with such other films about Gods and God like things, Charlie Chaplin has a Cameo role playing Charlie Chaplin, the most impressive quality i found in this movie was the lighting set up, which i thought was a unique way to use a torch on a stick, the sound quality was miserable, so was the acting and the dialogue was less engrossing as hearing a potato being peeled. Above all i would recommend this film if you like God and God like things 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Remarkable Attempt at Original Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why this movie got panned, I don't know. I expect some sort of CGI- fantasy fatigue might have happened, as I expect happened with X-Men Apocalypse. That or hopefully not, a peer-related opinion defining phenomenon among critics (and their lesser bloggers). Oh well, great movies both; don't believe the hate. Short opinion on Gods of Egypt; a wonderfully rich attempt at creating a fairy tale based on Egyptian legend, with fantastic dialogue (though some might, sarcastically, not be able to let it sink in), strong characters, interesting plot and fulfilled story line. Technically it is not flawless, but pretty close.Rid yourself of your sarcasmosuit, and you will enjoy this sweet, sweet piece of blockbuster awesomeness. Proyas; you're okay in my book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pretty much what you get when Alexander Proyas saw Clash of the Titans (2010) and Wrath of the Titans (2012), and says to himself "What the hell is this? This isn't Harryhausen!" ... and then he goes off an makes a pitch-perfect film that pays homage to the classics - Clash of the Titans, Jason and The Argonauts, etcetera.It's awesomely done, with fight scenes reminiscent of Wuxia films from the 1980s, a color palette that's sublime, and a sense of humor that shines through.Ignore the critics. Just enjoy a damn fine movie that hits all the right spots to enjoy with a bucket of popcorn.Bonus: It has zero product placement - which makes up for I, Robot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie I was really looking forward to as i love Egyptian mythology, the effects are awesome, acting is good, Nikolaj Costar-Waldau and Gerard Butler make exciting opponents, good fighting scenes, fair amount of appearance by many different Egyptian gods. Overall greatly entertaining for anyone who is interested in lore, myths, legends and fantasy movies. Just ignore the negative reviews, sit back and enjoy the show :) Indeed, it may even be one of the best movies which has a plot in ancient Egypt in the last few years. Geoffrey Rush as Ra is the cherry on top. Runtime is over two hours which passes away in a jinx since the action is non stop and there are always new extraordinary god characters on screen with different skill sets, good and evil characters with lots of variety. Have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know much about Egypt's ancient myths, so I was a bit concerned that I want be able to understand much of what is going on in the movie. All that I knew about Ancient Egypt and its gods was from a TV animated series called "Adventures of Papyrus". I loved that show as a kid and that's why I decided to give this take on Egyptian mythology a go.I'm glad I did.As mention earlier, I was concerned that I want get much of why this guy looks like that or who is this god again? But the movie, being targeted at the general public that has no idea who these guys are, and knowing it, took it's time to introduce as to the workings of that universe and all the characters and did it flawlessly without taking us away from the story.The things I liked- the visuals and landscapes. Some people here say the cgi sucks. Don't listen to them! It's done right. The acting was superb, especially Gerald Buttler's performance as the movie's baddie. The other actors did not disappoint as well. The story itself was pretty decent, too. Going in to watch a fantasy movie/hero's quest is what I can describe it as.What I sort of disliked- as I point out in the title- it started off slow. You really need to be patient with this movie. The first half an hour or so, as not as strong as the rest of the movie. I was really doubting if I will like it at all, but I decided to continue watching. Well, it kept getting better and better as time went by.So to recap, if you like fairy tales, fantasy movies with sword fights, heroes on a quest/journey to fulfill their destiny and these kind of stories- you will enjoy this movie no doubt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>22 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight. - Gods of Egypt. What an awesome film. This is one of the good ones. It's a story of Gods fighting Gods, the role of mortals in the grand scheme of the Lands of Egypt and ultimately a love story. The screenplay is gargantuan in its delivery, the soundtrack is almost overwhelming, This is the tale of a family of Gods, Set (Gerard Butler) kills his brother and steals the eyes of Horus forcing him to live in the desert sightless and without power. Set plans to become King and rule the lands with misplaced power and fear. However we are introduced to Bek, a mortal who does not take no for an answer and will go to the ends of this world and into the next to save the girl he loves. In the days before CGI this film would still be awesome, right up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus and all those other biblical epics told over the years with a cast of thousands and stars aplenty. However we can now go further, bigger, badder, louder, and much more grand and the cast of thousands is created with a screen and a mouse. It does not lessen the impact of this film in any way and I enjoyed the delivery from start to finish. It gives the viewer a glimpse into the opulence of ancient Egypt and the costume designer must have been given a complete free rein with absolutely stunning results. A feast for the eyes and the ears. If you like an adventure you'll love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie, I thought according to ratings and reviews that I saw this will be some kind of boring soap opera, or shallow action movie in style of Michael Bay ! Thank God, I am not a sheep, meaning I do take into consideration reviews from some critics, IMDb and Rotten T., but still I do take my own decision always regarding movies or TV Series I am about to watch, or I watched. That means that I consider my own rating as alpha and omega. After all it is my personal taste and not of some critic or casual viewer. Enough of philosophy, this movie attracted me no matter low reviews and ratings. So I started to watch and instantly magic happened. I was simply drawn into this world of ancient magic of gods and mortals and right from first minute of movie I was totally immersed into this masterpiece (my humble opinion). I watched movie online so I well used advantage of being able to watch scenes again and again ! This is no soap opera, everything what happens is both ordinary and very deep (depend on how subtle is your perception), action is nothing shallow but merged with strong emotions, powerful energy, very good fighting skills and good effects. Yes effects are really good in this movie and it simply got hold of your attention as everything look so real and authentic that you feel being part of it. Story is very good and not even one second boring, there is no wasting of time here, each and every second of movie is used 100% and truly there is no dull moment, absolutely no soap opera-things are very serious here, no shallow emotions life and death are constantly present like shadow and light, darkness and sun. Yes we even get chance to see personal boat and fighting skills of Sun God Ra Himself ! And that part as all other parts of movie are, is simply magnificent ! I don't know whether I will fire up someone attention to see this movie and hopefully watch it with open mind and not damaged by bad reviews and ratings,thus allow himself to fully experience beauty and greatness of this movie. I am very glad that I did, and I have to tell you that now several days already I am watching again and again scenes from this movie and feel powerful emotions and awe again and again. Allow yourself to watch this movie and forget ratings, if you do it and watch it with your 100% attention I guarantee to you that you will enjoy at least some parts of this movie very much even if is not movie merged with your personal taste. You will still enjoy some parts cause movie is truly well made from beginning till end. PS What is really amazing is that I really wanted to know which animal did represent Seth's main god warrior. I thought it was bull, but after watching one fighting scene he was involved I realized that he was goat ! Quite huge goat but still goat :-) Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I am obviously not UK or USA native, but still - I tried ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film a lot and i think it is different from other similar themes and productions about ancient mythology.Four things attracted my attention and impressed me..1. the body size of gods compared to mortals..they are bigger but not gigantic..this was planned to emphasize the superiority of these beings to humans..the only thing is not explained, is where they came from.2. the flat earth disk as is shown for some seconds and the way the sun behaves(very interesting).3. the after life world, Anubis and the price for immortality until then.4. the Horus message at the end, which is very important and explains a lot.As for the rest of the film.. the story was well placed , the effects were very nice, the filming good, the photography impressing and the character depth satisfying..As for the actors, the main characters here were three..Set, Horus and Bek...the most important in my opinion was Bek, because Bek was there to show , that even a God -power being without the humans, is helpless ...Set' s performance although a little overacting from Butler, was better than Horus ..the rest actors were convincing ...the whole film is in general very original and worths its money... i admire the previous works of Proyas and respect him for his advanced ideas in screen..As a conclusion, i say this film is very entertaining</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having heard the tremendous amount of negative reviews I was somewhat hesitant to see the movie. I'm glad to have watched it. It's not likely to win any Oscars, but for once it's not a reboot or a sequel.This is pure escapism with good CGI, an enjoyable story and some decent acting. True, the story isn't very complicated, but it depicts a hero's journey very well. Two heroes, a sceptical thief and a defeated god. The fact that they made Gods as separate race of beings, easily over 10 feet tall with golden blood was an added bonus to emphasise that despite their human features, they are anything but. Elodie Young as Hathor was probably one of my favourites. The story resisted the trope portraying her as Egyptian Venus, instead using another one of her roles as the "Mistress of the West", welcoming people into the next life. Another very pleasant surprise was the architect played by Rufus Sewell. A minor role, but performed extremely well.I do wish they spent more time explaining about the afterlife and the role of Apophis. All in all, good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people, including myself saw the trailer for Gods of Egypt and automatically concluded that this film would be not so good. It had a negative controversy/reaction due to the casting choices. Especially since it takes place in Egypt. The CGI didn't look all that impressive, and overall I believe it didn't receive a fair chance. I decided to give it a fair chance, and I wasn't all that impressed.Obviously, this isn't a representation of the real Egypt. This story is pure fantasy. What you have here are The Gods of Egypt getting together. Things don't go according to plan, that a$$hole Set, played by Gerard Butler (300, Olympus Has Fallen) has to have complete control over Egypt, and take over everything. Set kills, and even takes out his own nephew Horus. If Set weren't bad enough, he has to dig into Horus' face and pull out his eyeballs too. One day Horus meets Bek, played by Brenton Thwaites (Maleficent, The Giver). Bek and Horus work together to stop Set. Will Horus overcome Set's cruel rule over Egypt? Will the land of the pharaohs regain peace once again? Only time will tell.No out of all the controversy this film has gotten, Hollywood can keep this silly ass Egypt for all I care, because I sure as Hell don't want it. This movie is not good; it's Egypt on acid. The plot is loose, the history is to fantasized, and the characters are just white yogurt and plain as you can get. Call me crazy, but I think Jupiter Ascending is more scientifically correct and accurate than Gods of Egypt. They emphasis the CGI over story, which I will never understand why they do this. CGI should be used to enhance the story. The actors really do try, but the source material isn't there for them to work to the best of their abilities. Also, why is Gerard Butler the only man in Ancient Egypt with a mixture of a British and Scottish accent? (TONIGHT WE DINE IN KEMET!)I know it sounds like I'm over writing about the CGI, but I've seen video games that look more realistic than this. I've read children's books with more character development than this. 140 million dollars went into this film, and I've seen movies that go straight to the Chiller and Sci-fi channel that look far superior than this. This film is directed by Alex Proyas (director of The Crow and I 'Robot). I personally enjoy those films, and yes they are also visually stunning. But they had a compelling story around it unlike this film.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the movie Gods of Egypt. I know it sounds like I'm ranting, but if you haven't seen this film, you can skip it. It's way too much CGI, the Gods are weak, it's sexist, characters are boring, the story is loose, the characters are paper thin. The actors do try; sadly they are the only ones I believe put some effort into this project. I believe it's bland, and made for a quick dollar. I found it to be funny, even though that is not the tone. It's some bland B.S. I believe that Gods of Egypt earns a?3/10.This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you have an amazing day as always. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vibrant fantasy movie with a bold style that was misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, I heard about the negative reviews about it. I read that the CGI was awful and that acting was terrible.I must say people are too quick to criticize. This movie has a unique style and that is what made a lot of people to judge very quickly.This movie is not a realistic or historical representation of Egypt and it never tries to be. It is more of a picture of how gods would look like and with a taste of magic and dream. The fact that gods are portrayed twice the size of humans should be the first sign of this style.The color palette chosen for the movie is beautiful focusing on yellow of gold and brown of sand. This coupled with the vibrant and warm colors of the environments and set pieces create a delightful picture to watch.The story is interesting to follow as it unfolds right from the beginning of the movie with a clash between two brothers. As it is common in these kind of stories, the bad and the good characters are easy to see from the beginning.The CGI is mostly good and not as bad as it is called out by some people. The creatures are nicely created and the effects are mostly good with the exception of fire/explosion effects. There were times they felt a bit cheap considering the big budget of 140 million dollars of the movie.I really like the humorous conversations between Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and Horus(Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the god of sky. Brenton's character really added a much appreciated tone of fun to the movie and made me feel that familiar sense of feeling of similar movies like Prince of Persia(2010). Actually this movie has some resemblance even to the video game of Prince of Persia for example with the design of creature/guardians. Anyway Brenton Thwaites really puts a good performance and I am curious to see what he will be able to do in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.Gerard Butler fulfills his familiar role of war leader very well as expected, of course he is no stranger to these roles. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau does a great job portraying his character Horus as well. Although it would be nicer to see a bit more of his character's background.Overall this movie offers a fun, humorous, entertaining story in a fantasy world filled with magical powers of gods and hatred and love. This movie is bold, vibrant and fast, it's a shame some people couldn't see beyond the distinct choice of style, which I personally found interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only assume the critics saw a different movie to me, because I thought it was excellent!! It's visually stunning and very well made for 3D viewing.The costume design is gorgeous, and the special effects are spectacular. Also, the fight scenes are well choreographed. I am not a fan of what I refer to as 'shaky cam'; the fast moving erratic camera motion which seems to be used more frequently for fight scenes or running these days. I'm pleased to say you can see exactly what is happening during the action scenes. I was in awe from the opening scene, and my interest didn't waver. More importantly there is a good story line, and it is unexpectedly funny in places. Bravo to an excellent cast! Please do not be put off by the critics and deprive yourself of the delight, this is a 'must see' movie!! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CGI extravaganza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a terrible movie like some critics claim it to be. But maybe that is because I have seen a lot of really bad movies. What this is, is a high budget CGI extravaganza, where the CGI is good, to okay to just bad. This would have worked fine as a video game, but as a movie where the narrative is very important...The movie just falters. I could tell there was quite a bit of effort that went into this movie. But it just seemed so darn impetuous when it comes to the narrative. Where characters just keep going from one point to another with the whole thing feeling detached. Despite the budget everything felt cheap because the movie just didn't have any heart to it. Despite the shortcomings, it's at least somewhat watchable and that is because of the budget. Now I am not saying every high budget movie is watchable, but in this case it's at least watchable. It's not a movie I would watch again but it's a okay popcorn flick when it's on Netflix.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK this is the first time I am leaving a review and I just couldn't stand these bad reviews that are like for nothing. The movie is ABSOLUTELY great and you will not lose interest not even for 2 minutes since it's a major action-adventure movie with great actors and cast choice, following very awesome and interesting story line that will make you wonder throughout the movie how will things turn out to be. It wasn't very predictable even tho it wasn't complex AT ALL. Some of these reviews make me wonder if people enjoy any movie without finding or creating the slightest reason to be dramatic and annoying, just like the reason most reviews I read here saying the actor choice is TOO white? Are you kidding me this is a Hollywood made, fiction movie about the Egypt and gods and powers and that's what bothered them really? Anyways the movie is awesome and like I said don't bother reading reviews. thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt takes place at a time when gods lived on earth among humans. Ra lives on a boat in the sky and has to battle Chaos ever day. His son Osiris rules over the fertile lands of Egypt while his other son Set rules over the desert. It's time for Osiris to cede the throne to his son Horus. During the ceremony, Set shows up, kills Osiris, blinds Horus, takes his girl Hathor--the goddess of love, kills some other gods and takes their power and names himself king of all Egypt. Why gods need to be kings as well, I don't know.Now Horus is banished somewhere while Set is busy building a giant Obelisk to honor Ra. He also plans on obtaining more power by killing more gods and eventually letting Chaos rule. The story is told through the eyes of two humans, some young hustler named Bek and his gorgeous girlfriend Zaya. Bek doesn't have faith in the gods, Zaya believes that Horus will return and re-take the throne and make everything right again. Set's first decision was to institute payment for those who die and want to enter the afterlife. Those who can't afford it end up in some dark hellish cloud, not sure if they die completely or what. Zaya works for Set's architect who is building the obelisk. Zaya suggests Bek steal Horus's eyes which Set is keeping in one of his buildings since she has access to all the plans. Bek succeeds in recovering one eye but during some battles Zaya is killed. She embarks on her long journey to the afterlife but has nothing to offer once she arrives at the place where "justice" is meted out.Bek now searches for and finds Horus and gives him the eye and tries to convince him to retake his rightful place. Hathor also joins them, she feels for Bek who is in love. They offer Bek that they'll bring Zaya back knowing full well it's impossible.What follows then is a series of adventures as these guys try to make it back to the city to confront Set. Ra will also play a role as does Toth, the god of wisdom. It will all resolve in some battles between the gods.Gods of Egypt delivers some fantastic sights. Some of the CGI doesn't convince but a lot looks really great. While most movies like to emphasize darkness and film as much as possible at night, Gods of Egypt thankfully focuses on brightness and daylight. The mythology is fascinating but unfortunately not really the focus of this movie. The humans of course aren't all that interesting. Courtney Eaton though is absolutely stunning. While the cast is strong, acting isn't up to par. Even though we're dealing here with grandiose events, acting is subdued and we get a wide range from the good to the terrible, as in the case of the individual playing the God of Wisdom.Gods of Egypt while not quite as spectacular as it could have been is a good-looking movie with an interesting and unique mythology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt is simply a 'popcorn flick', and a very good one. Don't let the title make you feel it has a similar mood to 'Clash of the Titans'. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet it manages to provide some kind of 'wow' factor.The story is pretty straightforward: a god is jealous of king brother and decides to end matters when the king doesn't consider him to be the next heir. Things never get too complicated, but it is interesting to see a 'new' take on such characters. This is probably where the movie is so good. The fascination of how things are shown gives one even more to look forward to as the movie goes on. The CGI looks great most of the times, but sometimes it just looks OK.Where the movie does lack is the acting department: the characters don't show enough emotion when they're supposed to, and the jokes aren't too original. Gerard Butler does great job and overshadows the rest in my opinion.All in all, a great movie to watch in the theaters and to have a good time.</fullReview>

If you rated a movie a 1 you probably shouldn't have gone to see it because that style of movie is not for you. This is FICTION its just something somebody thought up.lol Its not even close to how Egypt was so step back and take it for what it is. ENTERTAINMENT I found this movie very entertaining and thats what we are going for here. I think the story line pulled you in. Great special effects. I think the cast was right on. They really pulled it off. Some new faces i have never seen but they nailed it. I normally come to IMDb to see how a movie rated just to save myself the trouble of going to see it if it rates below a 7. But I really think im missing out.

		<fullReview>The film is a good Fantasy that has a decent story and allot of action. Effects are pretty good and suited the Egyptian vibe.There was a bit of cheese here and there and it is not a film with great depth, but the acting was pretty good.Not sure why it got such bad reviews, I can only suspect it was the political correct media who did not like the fact it had white actors playing all the main Gods (which some believe the ancient Egyptian elites were in fact Caucasian anyway, which is a debate) And also it may not pamper to the growing and irritating Femiwood thing, as it was strong men leading the roles, and with effeminate women, a little traditional in that sense. So it would not surprise me if all this was the true motivation behind its poor media reaction, which is a shame. It was not the greatest fantasy there is, But its a decent film that had a bit of originality to it and if they done a squeal I would be happy to go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always have had a liking for fantasy/sci-fi pictures. But as I've gotten older I get really tired with the ones that just cater to tweens. Or the sci-fi pictures that make absolutely no sense or make you follow their fight scenes in the dark. I'm happy to say this movie is not one of those. I occasionally read reviews before I see or rent a movie. I'm glad I didn't here. I would've missed out on a truly fun picture. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has heart. Which is not easy to do in an action, fantasy film. I totally enjoyed the two plots, love interests and the actors that played them. All of the actors seem to take their roles seriously and that does help. Its hard to watch a movie when an actor does a bad job and just doesn't seem interested. I totally recommend this movie, even for the finicky moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really fun and positive movie! Gods Of Egypt has very hot guys and gals so no matter what your sexual preference is there's somebody who will get you excited. The acting is excellent. There is real chemistry between the actors. I identified with many of the story's characters. That made me feel good. You don't need to know anything about the Egyptian Gods to understand what is going on. The story is well balanced, it has a solid beginning, middle and end. The Gods of Egypt keeps your interest from beginning to end. There's a lot of variety. So much is going on and that's one of the reasons I love adventure movies. The cinematography and the CGI are fantastic. You really enter another world without hesitation. This Is Pagan Friendly Film About the Egyptian Gods! There's no camp here. The Egyptian Gods are respected and feel quite real. This is a story about love, hormones, real courage and dare I SAY SELF-SACRIFICE! Yes! There is a really positive spiritual message in the Gods of Egypt.Wow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.. I won't go through technical evaluation but what really struck me with that movie is the Ironic resemblance to reality ... the dialogue between Raah and Horus when he was debating that Set was a bad ruler for Egypt and his answer that Apophis (god of chaos) is the worst fate that can strike Egypt and that he is worse than Set !! As an Egyptian I can say that this is so true even now .. chaos is the worst fate that already struck the middle east and we managed to escape it so far .. well I won't dwell on other aspects of resemblance ..The movie is worth seeing and is inspiring ..acting of Gerard Butler is as usual great although he offered nothing new in this role . Graphics are amazing and in general this movie is quite entertaining and greatly underrated .

		<fullReview>You would think it is going to be a great movie with that cast and director Proyas but you will be disappointed. All you can see in the movie is young love couple and a couple of Gods that depend on them. Movie focuses on fight between good and bad and that's it. Characters are simply there just to create some effect what is good and what is bad. They are so badly developed and without Gerard and Nikolaj movie would be so lame that it never was supposed to be made. What is to be said about giant two snakes, Sphinx and Apophis, they are just bad very bad. Two snakes created some action but Nikolaj is way too good for them. Was Sphinx supposed to be scary or? Apophis is something that we all wondered about but he just keeps his job as devastator of everything and is stopped within blink of an eye, while two Gods are trying to prove which one needs to be a leader. When you put all that together you get a big blockbuster disaster. 2.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun movie and the actors obviously loved making it. Humour and good acting. Lots of CGI which could have been better but it doesn't matter because the action and story keep you entertained. Preferred this to any of those super hero blockbusters because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Some of these reviewers just didn't get it and were expecting another USA fan boy comic movie. It works on the comic level too though just made in Sydney Australia with Canadian backing and lacks the USA flag waving. Another of those films that did a lot better internationally than in the US market. Australia's Brenton Thwaites was great as the young mortal and Game of Throne's Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Horus was as good as always. It also included Scotland's Gerard Butler and Australia's Geoffrey Rush, Brian Brown and others. This is nothing like the Exodus of last year even though it seems to be similar in theme. A great movie for all ages that just rolls along with plenty to entertain and amuse you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the tradition of The Mummy and Van Helsing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt was widely reviled for its casting choices before and after its release, and I think at least half of all bad reviews stem from that controversy. Most other negative reviews point out the rampant CGI and "silly" story.For my own part, yes, I do think more authentic casting would have benefited the movie. I am not politically upset by whitewashing. I just think it damages the quality of the film. Even though the setting is heavily stylized and barely historical, the single element of the movie not reliant upon Egyptian motifs is the ethnicity of the leads, and it just feels like a cynical movie executive choice that is difficult to ignore. Just imagine a movie about Norse mythology where almost all of the actors are black or Asian. It wouldn't be politically significant. It just wouldn't feel right, and that's the weird out-of-place feeling we get while watching Gods of Egypt. As for the CGI and story, I thought both were perfectly adequate. The movie reminds me of Stephen Sommers' Mummy and Van Helsing series, and it's just the kind of fantasy/sci-fi movie we haven't seen very often since Marvel and DC have pretty much taken over that niche with comic movies. Gods of Egypt is old fashioned adventure movie, and that simply does not appeal to everyone these days. I gave it a 7 because I found it to be entertaining and interesting (I love mythology), but I deducted 1.5 points for the inauthentic casting, and I deducted another 1.5 points because I prefer my historical / fantasy media to be R-rated in the tradition of 300 and Spartacus, and Gods of Egypt definitely plays it too safe in the sex and violence department.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Fantasy/epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews around Gods of Egypt are outstandingly negative, however I myself viewed this movie prior to reading any reviews and actually quite enjoyed it. As one who knows and has studied Egyptian mythology I could not resist nitpicking some minor issues but these are simple ones at best. Simple issue I took was the use of the swords, as in Egypt the weapons were designed for slicing, not stabbing and thus the khopeshes were used wrongly, however the mere fact that they were featured was appreciated. Another nitpick I had was the failure that the actors had in pronouncing the name of my personal favourite goddess, Nephthys (pronounced Nef-tease), and her being depicted as the Goddess of Protection with wings when that was her sister Isis (the Goddess of kindness and healing). However, the portrayal of Nephthys as the former wife of Set was appreciated. Speaking of Isis, it would have been better if the filmmakers had taken the chance offered to them to reclaim the name of the Goddess of Kindness and Healing and named Isis by name as the wife to the god Osiris and sister to Nephthys. They're hesitation is understandable but still lamentable. Lastly, casting could have been done better with Egyptian actors in the mix. Understandably that is a short list, and so I feel the filmmakers could have mixed races somewhat better. I won't nitpick to extreme amounts and call white actors as bad as technically one could also say there were no blacks in Egypt as those were Nubians, however in this modern world a more mixed race of actors from various ethnicities such as white, black, and Mediterranean would have been appreciated. Yet, Lionsgate did own to this shortcoming and for that I score them points.I was most impressed with the portrayal of Anubis as a benevolent God of Death, something Hollywood is almost scared of doing. The relationship of the Gods to the mortals was also done accurately to that of the original mythologies, as Gods that walked with humans and ruled over them kindly. However, I digress. This move is not intended to be a history lesson, and it never pretends to be. I wanted to see the mythology I love to much that is so regularly ignored and replaced by watered down Greek mythologies portrayed on the big screen, and that is what I got. The story was well paced and brought some interesting questions on what death is and how it affects one as a transition from one life to the next. The epic elements needed in a fantasy of fast paced action, magic, were all present along with the clear person vs. deity aspect. Egypt, while clearly a CGI creation, was depicted very beautifully with stunning colours at the beginning and end, along with stunning displays of the God brilliance as they would transform to do epic battle with one another.In terms of story, as a character Bek did not evolve too much beyond "I hate the Gods" to "I tolerate the Gods" to "I trust the Gods". Perhaps this was a subtle spiritual journey for the viewer to attend to a question of what it means to find a personal faith than a grander faith. Bek and Zaya's relationship was standard, but it was not the primary focus of the film and seemed more obligatory. The relationship to focus on was not even that of Hathor (which considering she was actually Horus' adoptive mother this came off as creepy, not cute) and Horus, but actually Horus and Bek. Their journey progresses from that of a disinterested lord and lad to that of a journey of friends. Although the friends are not equal, they each have a piece to contribute to the overall whole, making Bek not the useless tag along for the movie, but an actual part of the plot. Actually, none of the characters appeared to serve no purpose. Even characters who had little screen time, such as Nephthys, advanced the plot in some way, which is something that many modern movies tend to forget. A rule of if a character does not continue story in some way, they are useless.Some aspects of the movie contradicted itself. Such were Hathor claiming she could control Gods, but not trying to control Set. Or Ra claiming to be unable to control death but resurrecting the mortals at the end without explanation. However, these errors were not worthy of calling the movie a failure. Clearly the writers were building for a sequel. Sadly critics have panned it, and it seems this is a movie to have a critical failure but a love of average audience ignoring internet websites that claim to speak for others. While a profit margin of only $5 million is unlikely to warrant a sequel, if Lionsgate were to create a second movie, and I imagine if they did they would strive to fix any errors from this film, I would be willing to pay the money to view it. I advise not reading mythology before watching this movie, but I would recommend it as a watch to scratch a need for an epic fantasy mired in the great Egyptian mythological story of the battle against Set. The story is a story loosely pulled from Egyptian belief where Set kills Osiris for the crown, and thus I would recommend exploring that story after watching this movie (as a mythological story can't possibly fully cross into a film, changes of course are necessary). Hopefully this movie, in some way starts a want in the world to learn more about this fascinating culture and seek to further explore stories around Egyptian beliefs, if not from the same series maybe another depiction using new viewpoints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why ruin a great story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie of ancient gods, their flaws, greed and motives. A story for the ages where Egyptian gods, flawed by their humane desires, walk side by side with native mortals. A true Cinderella story where all is normal, then turned into chaos, climaxing with dreadful end of the world type happenings summoning unlikely heroes and ending in a rather ceremonious great resurrection of life and peace. Even with all of the supernatural beings and gods ruling over humans, or mortals as this film says, the story remained within the humane lines of moral dilemmas and relations between admiration and resent, love and hate, greed and generosity and trusting or doubting others. Really, this motion picture is a visually beautiful, often quite remarkable, piece of cinema, sadly, eternally ruined by poorly edited and rushed content. This potential diamond was honestly neglected enough so that it was reprocessed into mere coal. This was noticeable from pretty much the first scenes already. The actors dialogues felt very forced up to the point where I could imagine the director, Alex Proyas, shouting for actors to be quicker and less savoring with their lines. The scenes were too hastily run through and as this progressed throughout the film, the quality of a golden story was turned into a, at most, B-class film. I expected more and thought it could've been a bit slower with the progression of things, instead of rushing into events and lines like some kind of a speed trial. If I could I would choose not to watch it, just to save the thought of a great, action filled, story with gods and mortals. I'm sorry for the actors and the teams behind this movie. For they most certainly did not deserve this kind of a result.</fullReview>

The movie is a spectacular display of visual effects, both in CGI and props. And these dazzling effects do carry the movie a great long way, I will say that much. And the story, while it is simplistic, actually did turn out to be entertaining. Sure, it wasn't a brain challenger, not by a long shot, but you know what you are getting into with "Gods of Egypt".While we are on the CGI and special effects, then I must admit that it was the selling point for me, because I was blown away how they had managed to bring ancient Egypt and their ancient Pantheon to life with today's CGI and special effects.As for the cast, well, they could have opted for someone a bit more thespian, considering the talents of both Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that they did it poorly. Actually far from it, but they are more of a physical kind of acting in terms of action, more than they are set in ways of deeper character portraying through acting.There is a lot of action throughout the entire movie, and you are constantly being bombarded with visual effects, to the point where it brims on being over-used. But it worked for me.If you enjoy a good fantasy movie with roots in actual ancient history, then "Gods of Egypt" is definitely worth your time and money. I do think, however, that "Gods of Egypt" is the type of movie that you can watch every now and again with some years in between each watching.I am rating "Gods of Egypt" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars. This was good, wholesome entertainment wrapped up in a visually impressive package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying fantasy adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's adventurous and very entertaining. Seeing the low rating I thought the movie was bad and hadn't watched it for so long. Today I simply gave a try. And wow! It's kinda underrated. The CGI is good, story is average. But the adventure is really cool. It entertained the kid in me. I din't even feel disappointed. It's a pretty cool movie. Who wouldn't love a good fantasy action adventure flick? It turned out much better than I expected. Those few good movies which are underrated but are pretty good. This is one of them. It's very satisfying!Sometimes you've to ignore the rating and just watch the movie so that you'd know you'd like it or not. Not every movie has to be incredible. Not every time the rating is gonna help you out with picking a satisfying flick. That's what I learn every now and then. Watch and enjoy. Cheerio!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic failure in promoting a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing I can figure is that this really epic film is that it was not promoted ahead of its premiere. There could have been some underhanded jealousy in politics that is such an entrenched part of the Hollywood scene. I just can't understand how a film where all the critical elements are steadfastly present, could not be appreciated for its elegant design in all aspects of filmography. This film should have had Oscar written all over it, yet there was no breath of life put into getting the film born appropriately. I'm not going to repeat what all the reviewers who appreciate the movie have said because it's just not necessary. I recommend the film to anyone with an eye for magnificence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this director, but this is not his best work. I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.At least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.I had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.Well composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did. So you could try it if you want in your free time, because it is not worth to spend your valuable time.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas first feature since Knowing seven years ago, which is a long time for most directors, especially having a relative small catalogue since his first main feature of The Crow back in '94. We see him tackle the conflicting Egyptian mythology of warring God/Kings Set and Horus, whilst mortals suffer the consequences. Game of Thrones Jaime Lannister, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau plays Horus, the 'good' God or the better choice out of the two, who has his new crown and eyes stripped from him by his oppressing Uncle, Set, played by Gerald Butler. Tyranny befalls upon the Egyptian people whilst under new management with Set literally Hellbent on taking over everything, including the underworld, killing all those who stand against him, including his God siblings, acquiring their abilities along the way. Fate would have it, a young, cunning thief by the name of Bek, who doesn't have faith in the Gods unlike his beautiful love Zaya, embarks on freeing her from slavery, which isn't exactly the slavery you might expect, but she's practical a clerk for the Master Builder of the new Egypt. The Giver and Maleficent star Brenton Thwaites plays Bek who reminds me of a live action Aladdin. Sarcastic, slightly arrogant but charming and sly with it. Things go from bad to worse, and slightly complicated leading to Bek inadvertently restore balance to the world and it's all because of a girl. It's always about the girl, right? By seeking the help of the blind God they make a deal and form an unlikely partnership to both get what they want ensuring adventures. So much happens, with plot twists, it is refreshingly unpredictable with a dot to dot storyline. I didn't find it boring however it does feel a lot longer than 126 minutes and towards the end you feel like it's be going for hours. It's CGI heavy with some very imaginative imagery going on. Ra, Geoffrey Rush's stellar sail barge for example and Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman, Thoth are quite impressive to look at however spectacularly so, it loses credibility. Ra's looks like he's constantly night fishing and the dead King from Lord Of The Rings seems to make an appearance, played by Mad Max's Bruce Spence. In fact, there's quite a few heads from Mad Max. Zaya's Countney Eaton being one of Immortal Joe's Virgins. It actually loses its Egyptian flavour along the way and starts to feel more like a fighting fantasy film, even with Marco Beltrami's Aladdin strong score. Quite like the recent Clash of Titans movies only more colourful and shiny. Some of the sets remind me of earlier Star Trek stages, the fight scenes are quite good and there's plenty of bosom to look at but majority of the cast speaking with some form of British accent is actually quite off putting. It has quite a cast and on top of who I have already mentioned, TV Dare Devil's Elodie Yung plays Hathor, goddess of love, superbly well and will definitely keeping an eye out for her (pun intended) regular bad guy Rufus Sewell (A Knight's Tale) plays the Master Builder and Bryan Brown (Cocktail, F/X) briefly plays Osiris. It's actually brainless entertainment with a clichéd but witty script. Going in with low expectations actually resulted in me enjoying this more than expected. It's not amazing, nor ground breaking in any way but entertaining nonetheless. Coaster/ Waldau and Butler play their parts well enough and having watched this, I reckon Nikolaj would make a great Solid Snake.

		<shortDescription>Utter nonsense but a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangely, I enjoyed this movie. The film itself lacks any real plot line, the script is awful and at times you wonder where the $140 million budget was spent. However, I found myself waiting for the next scene. Butler is by far the stand out performance in this tale of Gods, Mortals and Chaos. He is his charismatic self and although it feels as though the rest of the cast struggle in delivering the lines, Butler adds some 'Earth' to the film. There is not a lot to say about the film itself. Very predictable, yet entertaining. Would I advise anyone to see it, yes I would. If nothing else, the script will make you feel better about yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it with low expectations after watching the general score, but after reading the user reviews, I decided to give it a try, unfortunately.The plot was very expected, and there really wasn't much to it:- SPOILER: - Good guy is becoming the king, bad guy prevents this and becomes the king instead. Defeated good guy mourns in self-pity, until an unexpected nobody comes cheering the defeated good guy back on his feet. Together they fight against the bad king and defeat him, and everyone lives happily ever after. It just couldn't be no more a typical bedtime story, with no whatsoever plot twists. - /SPOILER -The acting was mediocre, if not pretty bad. There were many new and unfamiliar faces, and I understand why (they were not remarkable). Some of the better ones (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) and Gerard Butler (300, P.s. I love you)) were average, but otherwise, meh. Okay, if you get past this, you could expect at least a decent and fun action, right?Well, that didn't go so good either, as the fights were in fact most cases fun to watch, if it wasn't for the, occasionally even horrible, CGI. Most of the movie and fight scenes looked more like a video game, than a movie. Although the choreography could have included some surprises, it'll pass.Okay, it wasn't probably as bad as I made it sound there, but overall is was okay, and watchable - have seen worse movies. However, there really was nothing new for a fantasy, or an adventure or for an action movie.It's okay movie for a random movie to watch from Netflix when you are having a hard time making up something else to do. But I wouldn't recommend to pay for it.</fullReview>

CGI fight scenes aplenty, adventures to exotic places, hero in distress, woman who dress in as little as possible to excite the 12 year old boys in the crowd.And if you were a twelve year old you would be entertained and look past the strange ways the somehow superhuman Gods seems to be so dim witted and trusting all the time (so as to get themselves killed by being stabbed in the back), the cheesy dialogue, how the characters travel from one place to the next in a couple of scenes.Ultimately leave your brain at home and kick back and enjoy the CGI popcorn crapfest that is Gods of Egypt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really pleasant to watch with some interesting original ideas - no shock film for people with a short attention span</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't enjoyed a film that much in a while. The first thing that struck me is what the film isn't - a shocker or high art. This is "just" a good story with likable characters, a sense of humour and action - and this is exactly why it works so wonderfully. "Gods of Egypt" refrains form emotionally draining us with larger- than-life excess, deep soul-searching or complex art and gives us a human-sized good time to lean back and enjoy. "Gods of Egypt" seems to be made with lots of love for detail. I'm not someone who enjoys violence, and I was pleased that someone had the idea of making scenes of violence aesthetic by making gods bleed liquid gold - so brilliant! I liked the dialogues as well, while some of the jokes were simply pleasantly predictable I thought that many were really witty. There were quite a lot of surprises and original ideas about how to represent the characters and ancient Egypt. The goddess of love is a good benchmark - it's so easy to make this character primitive and predictable, and she turned out to be completely different than I expected. While the overarching main plot was relatively predictable - particularly if you already know ancient Egyptian stories of course - there were quite a lot of intermediate plot twists that I didn't see coming. And for once, the all-important scene where a hero learns an important lesson actually includes a serious dilemma.Don't be influenced by the trailer - I nearly didn't watch the film because I thought the trailer was so dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the jaws of death itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Australian cinema turned out a real gem of a fantasy film with Gods Of Egypt. Other than references in a lot of Mummy films Gods Of Egypt is the first I know to incorporate the ancient Egyptian religion and mythology in the plot itself.We're going way back here even before the time Charlton Heston liberated the Hebrew children to a time when Egypt was ruled by their deities who walked among them and took human form. They also could take the shape of some ferocious creatures if need be.Set and Osiris divided up Egypt back in the day, both sons of the sun God Ra. But Set who only had the desert while Osiris had the good real estate of the Nile and it's cities got tired of this arrangement and slew brother Osiris. He also fought and gouged the eyes out of Osiris's son Horus leaving him a blind and pitiable figure and a living reminder of what it means to cross Set who is played by Gerard Butler with Bryan Brown playing Osiris.While the Deities are in their turf war mortal Brenton Thwaites gets caught up in it and his girlfriend Courtney Eaton is killed. He wants to get back at Set and would like to team up with Horus if Horus dare permit himself an alliance with a mere human. But Thwaites has some moves and proves to be an unusual and resourceful ally.If you recognize it the elements from Alexander Korda's Thief of Bagdad loom large and clear here. The chemistry and scenes between Nicholas Coaster-Waldau as Horus and Thwaites is very good and the parallel of the two films is unmistakable. Korda only wished he had the computer graphic technology available when he did his spectacle masterpiece.Korda's film was shot in Arizona both for the vast scenery and for the fact that Great Britain was at war. The great vast interior of Australia has and will be a choice location shooting spot for a lot of films as travel is now easier to that still remote part of the world.I liked Brenton Thwaites character very much. In a cynical age where romance is not usually portrayed his was one of the best romantic characters I've seen on the big screen in years.In fact the very romance of the film made it a winner with me. See this one by all means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome Egyptian fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this is an awesome fantasy film of the year. In fact it's the only film of 2016 I had reviewed so far. Also another reason why I love this mythological references in it as a connoisseur on folklore and myth.Set in a time in ancient Egypt where the gods live among the humans, vengeful Set killed his brother King Osiris, usurp the throne on Prince Horus on his coronation and pluck his mystical eyes as well. With that, all of Egypt is enslaved and conquered. Two youngsters Bek and his sweetheart Zaya had managed to steal back one of Horus' eyes. But during their escape, Zaya was shot by an arrow and died. At the tomb where Horus had hid all those years (or months), Bek strikes a bargain with the despondent god: Resurrect Zaya in exchange for the other eye and help to stop Set. That's all I am telling. You folks will have see it for yourself.Overall, this is an awesome movie. It is very well written and is really cool! The story was perfect, full of suspense and really worth the PG-13 rating. I don't have a favorite scene (I know I had said that many times), because I love the whole film - from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw all the negative review this movie got, I decided to give it a chance anyway. After watching it and expecting it to be horrible, I was surprised to find it was way better then all the people complaining about it claimed. The story did not follow the Egyptian mythology completely and you could see many changes in the movie. Despite all of that it still made for very good entertainment. This is a movie I can enjoy watching multiple times. I loved the CGI and the way the actors portrayed their characters. I hope they make other movies like this in the future because I will definitely watch. I have come to the conclusion that I should watch more movies that get negative reviews because it seems more often then not, most of these reviewers get it wrong and the movies turn out way better than they say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just viewed this yesterday. An excellent underrated film by Alex Proyas, director of DARK CITY. The film is a visual feast for the eyes, but the acting is top notch as well, this is not a bimboheaded Marvel or Superhero film. Even though the actors are portrayed as being mostly Caucasian, I do not see that as a detraction as there were different dynasties in Egypt and there have even been found mummies portrayed with blue eyes, so no, Egyptian royalty was never exclusively black, those were the Nubians who were south of Egypt. Anyhow, don't let 'HIStory' get in the way of a great entertaining film. One extra star for the depiction of the flat earth (the probable TRUE NATURE of our world).</fullReview>

There are really touching and funny bits here and there in fact the thing about this movie as opposed to let's say Wrath of the Titans no one ever over acts and Alex Proyas maneuvers through this visually beautiful film with the same ease as smoothness of a knife cutting butter gently thoughtfully and it works. You will grow to love Beck, to admire Hathor, without warning you'll find yourself cheering on the hero and it all happens so subtly. A fresh in film in a time of Bombastic loud Super hero movies Alex Proyas there is a third Act to his Directing career and abilities adding a new layer to his talent we have all come to love. No its not Dark City or I Robot but it is bathed in light, love, beauty something unexpected from what he's done Before I like it a lot.

		<fullReview>What "aubuchon" said...but to add to it: I also had reservations and only watched because I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan and figured if Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was in it, then chances were, it would be good. Then you have Gerard Butler so I knew it wouldn't be a waste of my time. The film was even better than I could have hoped. I think it's more to do with the times we're living in whereby film makers can no longer get away with having two dimensional characters (and still expect a high IMDb rating) or women who just stand there looking pretty, or have an all-white cast with a few token darker-skinned people who get thrown one or two lines...erm...well, there's always going to be 'some' of that (society hasn't progressed that much) but this film at least 'tries' to avoid those clichés. The two main women have real personalities and Hathor, a.k.a. the Goddess of Love (Elodie Yung), portrays her sexuality in a refreshingly modern way (no crying about feeling taken advantage of for her own decisions etc.) The action is spectacular, there's a lot of originality in most of the fight scenes, and I liked the storyline. It was predictable but again, they at least explored other possibilities before returning to the road more travelled.Gods of Egypt was a very nice surprise and it deserves a much higher IMDb rating. I'd have given it a 10 if they had stuck to one of the possible less-predictable endings but 9/10 it is.</fullReview>

The flat earth part in the movie, is indeed very accurate and true. Also the ''Gods'' or aliens at the time, might have been white. Either way, there were multiple races in that period, and this movie portrays them very well. The battles and costumes are not exaggerated, many legends speak of several battles between alien races, their outfit and armament fit the description as well. Overall, the story is beautiful, filled with many trials, adventures and even love. I do recommend this movie to be watched with an open mind, as well as with an open heart. I was certainly not disappointed.</fullReview>

Since forsaking its Original Deities, it's been all downhill for the Land of Pyramids. The adherents of various Johnny-come-lately cults have perpetrated Egyptian Civil Wars for thousands of years. Who can quibble with the powerful and sexy set of Gods delineated in this flick, especially with Horus' pledged New Deal featuring the requirement for Good Deeds, Compassion, and Generosity on the part of Egyptians to please THE GODS OF EGYP+? This movie also highlights the pressing need to MOVE the Temples of Luxor, the Great Pyramids, the Lesser Pyramids, all the Tombs of the Pharoahs, and of course the Sphinx to America IMMEDIATELY to save these World Heritage Treasures. London Bridge already was shipped to the USA, and there's plenty of room for more Old Stuff. Luxor was cut up and relocated when they built that Egyptian dam in the 1900s. Terrorist thugs already have destroyed most Middle Eastern antiquities. But vandals have never touched a major U.S. Religious Monument (such as Mount Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty, or the Washington Monument).

		<fullReview>First of all, ignore all the bad reviews from the "professional" critics. Rotten Tomatoes has a ...12% rating (mainly because of white cast playing Egyptian deities) but user reviews are far more favorable. I assure you this is a movie that you want to see.It is about ancient Egyptian deities and it might spawn a new generation of films after the extreme overuse of Greek Mythology in numerous feature films, TV series and animations.It is a real adventure movie. There is a Quest, a purpose, a goal. Somehow it reminded me movies of the 60s and 70s about Sinbad the Sailor. A rare feeling with today's movies.At some point it becomes a "buddy" movie between the god Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and the mortal thief Bek (played by Brenton Thwaites). Their chemistry is a big plus. The rest of the cast is a little bit uneven though. I wouldn't cast the otherwise great Geoffrey Rush to play the god Ra (Sun) or Bryan Brown to play Osiris.The script is very entertaining. There is some humor in the dialogues and in the last part of the movie it gets really emotional.The Visual Effects might be unconvincing (too over-saturated computer imagery, and green screens all over the place) but here and there you are rewarded with some really good and artistic graphics.Marco Beltrami did a good job with the music too. It has a couple of light-motives that serve the scenes well and overall is more emotional than your average blockbuster soundtrack.Overall: I had low expectations not only because of the bad reviews but because of the theme of the movie. It is far better than you might expect and it gets better as it progresses. Alex Proyas, the director of great movies like Dark City and Knowing did an excellent job. In someone else's hands a movie with such premise might ended-up a disaster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw GODS OF Egypt and have no idea what movie the critics saw. They are savagely mauling this movie but it is better than both of the recent Clash of the Titans movies combined. They have forgotten what it is like to have fun at the movies. There is utterly astonishing world building here. Rich elegant costumes and set designs that remind me of Liz Taylor's Cleopatra. Breathtaking stunts. The unknown cast contains Marvel's Black Panther Chadwick Boseman and Daredevil's Elektra Elodie Young. Both of these two rising stars give great performances and each of their roles seems to be a preview of what they will bring the MCU. The script is flawed but the style and lavish design overcomes the basic redemption movie storyline. It's lots of fun. (3.5 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Roller Coaster Ride, don't go with the ratings its an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with a lot of reservations - Europeans and American Actors portraying Egyptian God &amp; Goddess? The mediocre CGI transformations. However the setting of the movie is beautiful and visually impressive. The story is very straight forward Good Vs Evil which is throwback to years when movie plots were less complicated. The movie held my undivided attention throughout the run time and the acting was surprisingly well done. All in all I absolutely love this movie. The movie won't get an Oscar for this but for a fun filled evening this is a perfect choice. Watch it and give your own rating, don't listen to cynical movie critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the movie and would recommend it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always loved the symbols and imagery of Egyptian mythology. I read a lot about it growing up and even took a course to learn how to write in hieroglyphics. I knew that it would be great on the big screen and regardless what the "professional critics" said, I could not wait to see it. I agree that it won't win best picture of the year but if you are open to seeing an amazing cinematic imagery then you will love it. The base story has it's positive and negative but it made sense. Yes there was lots of CGI but it was perfect if you compare it to the 'Mummy' series of movies with Brendan Fraser. I can't wait to what it when it comes out on Blue-ray. Are there holes or Hmmm in the story yes but for me it was totally worth seeing it on the big screen. Hope that you can make your own decision and ignore critics....I always have and always will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get swayed by what critics and biased reviewers are saying. If you have no hang ups and not concerned about societal issues, go watch this film. It is a visual spectacle that would grab your interest. It has some original stories, good acting, great stunts and fight scenes but most of all great visuals and costumes. This movie is good for the ordinary person who would like to relax and escape into a fantasy world. Do you like a movie with a grand depiction of ancient Egypt? Go watch this movie. Do you like to see good looking actors in an opulent Egyptian setting? Go watch this movie. Do you like mythical stories of gods, monsters and sorcery? Go watch this movie. Do you want to spite the critics who wants to shove gloomy movies of societal issues down our throats and don't like us getting entertained? Go watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun fantasy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with low expectation due to all the negative reviews but found it a fun romp.There is one scene which is important to the understanding to the approach. The earth is shown flat as a pancake - Ra goes over the edge to go the "flip side". Thus this is not the Egypt we know in real life, but a fantasy one. Therefore all the hubbub about incorrect ethnic casting can be ignored.This fantasy world is consistently imagined. Sure the plots are nothing special and some of the action seemed to have been lifted from other films or even video games. And the CGI was glitchy sometimes (edge of wings). But it is overall visually satisfying and I found myself caring for some of the characters (e.g. Hathor).But I wished that they had shown that the body parts of the other gods survived the death of Set, and that the Architect found that his jewels were for nothing at the final gate since Horus changed the rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After reading the reviews, I thought I was going to waste my time, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations were clouded by other reviews because there were so much downsizing this movie, I even postpone my trip to the theater to see if this was a razor's edge or if it was dull as a old beat up sword. Long story short, I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The storyline was very well put together. A lot of thought went into this movie and that includes the 3D and special effects. I remember reading about the Gods when I was very young. My parents brought home books that told stories of Gods and Goddesses. So naturally, I was all hyped up about this movie. I can say with this is one of those guilty pleasures of a movie and I plan on watching again and again. I really enjoyed this movie. I am in hopes that this movie will have a sequel with the same level of intelligence, stamina, 3D and special effects to bring the characters to life on the big screen. I gave it an 8 because there were a few places where the story sort of got off track, but not a deal breaker in my book. If you enjoy fantasy and have a thing for Egypt, then this movie may be right up your alley. Just one question, when is the blu-ray going to be released. Sign me up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie; the cast, dialog and effects. I didn't go see the Gods of Egypt for a lesson in Egyptian history (it's science fiction), I went to be entertained...which in my opinion this move does quite well. When reading some of the negative or poor reviews, it bring me to the truth that I know that there are some people that are just too up tight, or just like to put other people's work down. To each their own.If you enjoy a good, clean (I don't recall any bad language in this move), action and adventure move, go see this movie on the big screen and enjoy it. If you are looking for an accurate account of ancient Egyptian history, find a documentary on the History channel to watch.</fullReview>

Stop reading any reviews. See the trailer and go see the movie so you can judge it for yourself. For me this one was very entertaining because I treat it exactly for what it is supposed to be - a fiction fun movie destined to ENTERTAIN ; I should be CRAZY to start an analysis of every minute of it trying to influence others for some stupid reason just to show how many things I know about an imaginary history</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this over the top extravagant adventure set in Ancient Egypt. The script cleverly uses the legends of the Egyptian gods. It's fun to see the god brought to life and transform into various birds and beasts. Now everyone can visualize the gods instead of imagining them from a 2 dimensional painting on a wall. The tale of Horus avenging the murder of his father Osiris by fighting Set is brought to life. The visuals are spectacular dizzying and fantastical. You get some pretty impressive cities temples caves tombs pyramids and the underworld. This movie was so far the best action this year. I don't know why people are hating. This movie was fun, entertaining, funny, loved the action scenes. Loved how the movie was viewed just like the stories we all loved in school. You won't be disappointed. Got to see this movie at a prescreening. Loved it. Would watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie was fun! Isn't that what going to the movies is all about with this genre of film?I did not expect a documentary, or academic deep dive into who, what and why ancient Egyptians (whoever they were, Nubian, black, white, rainbow) believe in their gods. I did however enjoy myself and had a laugh, and squirm on the way.Effects are pretty spectacular to say the least, and the story is told in a way that that mandates you chill and switch off from the everyday. After reading some of the trash reports, I suspect people are too full-on about everything these days, too ego centric... Lighten up people, it's a blockbuster, it's a bit of this and a bit of that, and a bit of something new and old.Damn fun if you can unplug from the politically correct madness of Hollywoood at the moment. We're all people, we're all equal, and fantasy is fantasy. Loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The visual effects alone are way worth the cost of admission. They blew me away. I went to the 3d version and I HIGHLY recommend you do the same, it is fantastic. The girls were knockouts too, Helen of Troy would turn green with envy if she had to stand next to Zaya...whoa!!! What can I say, forget about Lenin's useful morons and their thought police whining about the cast. Nobody freaking cares, besides real Egyptians have way more to worry about lately than getting their movie careers off the ground. The plot takes a bit of a back seat to the incredible effects and visual treats but its pretty decent. At least the characters aren't running around chasing some idiot ring that only destroys them...This actually is a film about mythology with plenty of dazzling action and the good old tried and true absolute evil vs the power of love. In a weird kind of way it reminded me a bit of The Risen (another great film by the way) There are similar themes woven through both movies surprisingly.The movie is rated low here cause Bernie's politically correct wanna be tyrants come on here in hordes and slam films that don't have a communist slant. Ignore that bs and go see this amazing cinematic miracle.</fullReview>

I can see some scenes at time being unrealistic, yes, but this is mythology! If you want a down to earth movie, then this is not for you. As for the actual characters, I was surprised at how some gods were so weak. The actors matched the characters they portrayed aside from the fact that some looked so old when as a god, I don't think they needed to look that way. Battle music could have been an addition they could have done. The transformations were super cool. I would highly recommend this movie.

		<fullReview>Have seen it twice now and it is a lot of fun. People need to relax and not look at movies so seriously. It is after all fiction. This is a fictional look at mythology so it doesn't have to follow rules like skin colour of characters or that the pyramids aren't that close to the Nile. I mean come on, it shows the world as flat. People complain just to complain.I really hope there is a sequel to this as we need movies that aren't reboots and aren't books made into movies.It was an easy to follow storyline and I didn't spot any major plot holes which is nice. Helps that the actors were cute but they played their roles well. I don't think you need to know Egyptian Mythology to follow it. Had one of two scenes I wouldn't want kids seeing but that's normal for a modern movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felt like I was swimming in gold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the mixed reviews on this board and came close to not seeing this one. I checked all my expectations at the door and just decided to allow my brain to soak it in with a blank slate and pretended that I hadn't read any reviews. One of the opening scenes has the camera sweeping in from a distance to a bustling and thriving Egypt during the early times of the Pyramids. I thought okay, that was cool but I purposefully kept my expectations low for the time being. To my surprise the visually stunning cinematography didn't stop there. The movie presents each and every scene up on a golden platter with an eye for opulence and bejeweled detail. The storyline, while not bad takes a back seat to the non-stop sensory overload of what you're seeing. It imagines the unimaginable and takes you there in a good way. The unearthly spectral realm is treated with due respect and given a realistic authenticity. This movie dresses you up in gold from head to toe then dangles you out over a ledge. The story and acting didn't really affect my opinion either way. This movie is an experience to be enjoyed like a roller coaster ride. If you try to reason with any aspect of it then you'll probably miss the boat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egyption Mythlogical tale with humor, emotion &amp; solid effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we go to the movies, we are expecting to be entertained, based on the expectations we go into it with based on movie type, actors , TV spots and our overall love of certain genres.Ancient Egypt is a fascination for a lot of people , not only its spectacular architecture, but because of the tales of the same sorts of things we go through in this modern era, spun from the point of view of Gods intermingling with humans.Betrayal sets the scene for the story of fathers and sons, friends and lovers and the often hardships they go through amidst in this case, a towering city of Gold where Gods govern among their human counterparts.A solid musical score sets the tone for very decent effects, supporting a tale of love surrounding jealousy, immortal battles , teamwork &amp; a clash of good vs hatred.A world not unlike what we sometimes find ourselves in, will whisk you into a fantasy world , drop you into a bittersweet tale , and leave you with a few questions.Egypt whether ancient or current era is a fascinating topic, and this move portrays a tale from a ancient past in a positive light with a fantastical twist that most users will enjoy.There are a few scenes that parents ( some adults) will want to be cautious about , so ratings apply as always, but overall they found a decent balance between the depiction of graphic violence ( not gratuitous )and telling a story of love , jealousy and ultimate triumph, all through the lens of a place in time we've all come, rightfully so, fascinated by.Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a watch for real fans of action fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there were apparently a ton of critics looking for a home-run in terms of plot and character development. That's a lot to expect from a 2 hour action movie seeking to tell an entire story. Though I sound like I'm saying it's bad in these aspects, I thought they did a great job of explaining the characters and creating a clearly understandable story. It's not as there is a narrator walking you through the events. If you pay attention to the actual depiction of the story rather than something ridiculous such as an actor's accent in a story where gods roam the Earth, all the events will be clear to you. Somehow, critics have the magical power to ignore what an author portrays by trying to nit-pick all the clichés and tiny inconsistencies. If you become immersed within this movie and accept what might be normally odd in the modern world, the story will transcend being simply a cgi thriller. The cgi is in fact extraordinarily well-done, but the purpose is to make this impossible world come to life. The characters portrayed their roles excellently. There were only 2 parts which were rather silly, but after each of these events was a scene that was rather reconciling. The fight scenes also don't look like mindless exchanges of punches, stabs, and pointless movement, but was rather well choreographed and you could trace each action. Both the beginning and ending were great, and I left feeling thoroughly satisfied. Even my mother who normally despises action movies felt that it was terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world where the evening news breaks your heart or makes you angry every single night, we turn to movies for entertainment...we look to them to escape reality for a couple hours. Even with drama, when we're watching it, we forget our own problems and worries. Gods of Egypt is a movie that does what movies are supposed to do. Gerard Butler has always said how much he loves telling stories, and this is absolutely a story. It's a whole other world. It's the definition of imagination. Yes, it may be silly to some. Sure, it may not be as accurate as some people would like it to be. But it's fun and thought-provoking and intense and beautiful and dream-like and diverse. Really, though, it's the type of movie where you really do need to see it for yourself. Go ahead and see it. Let yourself be immersed in this fantasy world for a couple hours. Be entertained.

Yes, it is a typical movie of its genre, but what is so wrong with that. Not all movies made are Oscar worthy, but they are still filling the category of "Made for enjoyment".

		<fullReview>Before I start this review I want to get out of the way the white washing in this movie, it's impossible to finance 140 million dollar epic movie without casting a main Caucasian cast, the predominating blockbuster actors are mainly white people with big names that the everyone would recognize. We have to remember in the end it's an American film, such was the case in Memoirs of a geisha were they used Chinese actresses to portrait Japanese ,would we call that " yellow washing". When you see other countries make remakes of American properties no one cares( the Turkish knockoffs mostly) or when there are remakes of foreign cinema made in the U.S. and it take place in the states with American characters cast in the roles, no one cares. My theory is that this movie looked so silly and rushed that the casting got under the skin of the viewers as soon as the trailer was out. Now that's that out of the way here is what I thought of the film. It was a very generic action adventure film, this could work in the early 2000 like in the case of the mummy and the mummy returns but now we look for more complex and story telling in a movie rather than a joyride, the acting was OK the effects were very painful, Alex Proyas is a great director but he was out of his element, he did the crow, dark city, I robot and you combine that with the writer of Dracula untold and you have a genuine flop, Proyas works with dark and dystonia settings not a happy go lucky action film. Give it a watch out of curiosity. But be aware it's 2 hours long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie full of action set pieces with a threadbare plot to hold it all together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Egyptian themed movies, done right, they have plenty of history to draw upon.The likes of Stargate, The Mummy and its immediate sequel, Young Sherlock Holmes, all good stuff.So its with some dismay that Gods of Egypt is so hum drum. Visually it ranges from the fantastic to the.... "oh dear". The giant sand snakes looked great, some of the set pieces looked great, but, the major VFX problem is to do with the Gods themselves, namely the two main characters when they transform into their golden God forms.Its a style that was used back in the 80's and 90's with its highly reflective style, its what rendering software on the Amiga and early Silicon Graphics machines did........ but stylistically, its an 80's and 90's 'thing' so it looks out of place in this movie in 2016.Don't get me wrong, the VFX for the Gods are not terrible, just incredibly dated.The storyline is frankly perfunctory...... Nicolaj Coaster Waldau appears to be phoning in his performance, and no wonder, the plot just kind of easily moves on, each character knowing exactly what to do for no other reason than they just 'know'.Gerard Butler puts in a bit more effort, but his retorts are more a case of repeating what someone has said to him back to them.I don't much care about 'whitewashing', but clearly, in the case of a movie that surrounds itself with characters in ancient Egypt, detractors have a point. Zaya and Hathor are probably the closest to looking vaguely Egyptian, but in reality, they are nothing of the sort, they are simply closer than anyone else in the movie.Music was forgettable, and it really shouldn't be. This was a $140million movie, how did they get it all so wrong, and how did it cost so much?I don't like to beat down on a movie like this, I have a soft spot for the under dog, but this movie is simply a distraction on an afternoon, and to be honest, half way through, I did consider mowing the lawn instead, so not much of a distraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about African Gods, but where few of the Gods looked African</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain some spoilers... but the movie was so so enough , that it wouldn't have kept anything, let alone itself, without spoiling ones evening. So here I am again, remarking upon yet another subject I already had pegged, fore I fooled myself into watching, hoping for the best. Apparently, de-nile really ain't just a river in Egypt, also evident by the ratings and fanfare over this pile when it released.The funniest thing about this film was the correlation between Game of Thrones and the Wrath of The Titans film.There was an impetuous prince whom liked to be a libertine; He got it on when he wanted, even with his sister a lot.(Since they are gods of the same pantheon, their lineage can be traced back to the very same progenitor, in this case, RA is the head Lannister, too busy even to shame his kids for incest. In fact most sounded too colonial for my liking.) The prince is occasionally advised by a smart mouthed, though highly knowledgeable British sounding person (ANOTHER ONE?!). Oh but don't worry because he is more vain than even the bad guy, so its okay...=_=. The prince had lost a part of his body that made him feel sorry for himself and utterly useless to everyone whom still had the ability to see. So he traveled around with a normy to try and pick himself up, whilst being told what an turd he is. Still only one black god in Egypt of note so far, while the princes sister is with the new king . ENTER the WoTTs film stuff: There is an obviously more nefarious than the average gods...god, and he is not pleased being anything but numero uno. Like the titan Prometheus , there is a plot device in the form of an obscenely large space ringworm, that would make H.P. Lovecraft blush. So there is a race to get back some other plot device so as not the make viewers remember themselves by having too much to recall, by making way to a large edifice with many moving parts, just like in WoTTs, that shifts and turns, like a shifty turney thing. Thus the normy just runs up to it and pew, pew pew takes it down in a heartbeat. There's giant animals that hunt the heroes, a few scenes obviously meant to be seen only in 3-D, and nonstop MELODRAMA. When suddenly, DEMONS, from out of nowhere, then POOF! gone with the bloody wind of the desert.Enter my wish for alcohol. Like Set and his thirst for power, I had to imagine I was intoxicated to enjoy this movie ( its hardly a film ). And even when I thought I had found praiseworthy content , a diamond in the roughness of it all, up pops a scene where a blow from Set does not even connect with his foe. WHERE WAS THE CG THEN? After all the rest?!Set storms the gates all by himself, taking his ex wife's palace, though there are what seem like mortal soldiers behind him that are called HOUNDS ( Game of Thrones reference again? Meh, too easy but I had to).A recognizable actor here, still too few black people in ancient Africa there, and all the while ONE SINGLE GOD is taking over from a vast amount of others, fore the Egyptians pantheon was fairly impressive, yet he was unstoppable.The only thing I was shocked not to see was if Set's power came from the desert, which was purported to once be lush, the quenching of the flames from which Set's power derived would have explained the barren wasteland that covers much of Africa today. BUT NEIN! DUKE IT OUT INSTEAD! ACTION ACTION VIOLENCE lol...ffs.HOWEVER! A trap is sprung, and this time its the sad prince god whom is ensnared, but the normy human thief, whom could have probably escaped anyways, because he just can, no formal training in acrobatics needed apparently, just does whatever. If the thief had been the same size as the pathetic gods in the movie, he would have had about the same amount of muscle as Horus's actor from Lame of Thrones. Go back and look at the kids biceps and then look at Prince Lannister's, there's some funny casting there, hiding the lads biceps under leather upper arm straps to make him seem meek. YET ALL THE NONSTOP THIEVERY AND danger DODGING!The film was not a total loss. Ahem: It at least KINDA tries to enlighten the miseries overflowing our world today to be aware of something older than the last piece of cellular nonsense or whose breasts and butt are ample enough to actually be worthy of being called a Love Goddess in the media, as opposed to the thin woman playing the veritable Venus in this movies plot. IF you have nothing better to do, watch it while multitasking or imbibing, though truly would have been grand if I had slammed a can, or two or more of something mind bending before the all too obvious ending, ending that was pretending, pretending to be so much much more. Quoth the flying golden Lannister: " NEVERMORE". So shall more stringently I screen such errors, of Hollywood bingingly, making me cringingly suffer to stories based on myths of days of yore. I shall be surprised never...more. R.I.P. Ancient Egyptian Culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A gift from someone with great assets, and someone with very few. But when both die and are at the Final Gate... What is its value? I say we are equal."I thought this would be something similar like "Exodus: Gods and Kings". A historical story set in Egypt with immense scenery's and an abundance of special effects. Well, it certainly is situated in Egypt. And the bag of tricks, full of kitsch and console-game-like special effects were exploited to the utmost. Only, now it's not about a biblical figure but the mythological world of Egypt. Ancient Egypt where people and gods live alongside each other. It sometimes resembled "Gulliver's Travels" since all those gods of Egypt have an imposing figure compared to the ordinary mortals. Ultimately, it's a kind of historical "Transformers". So, full of exaggerated action and impressive transformations into imaginative creatures.From the opening shot, it's clear where the biggest amount of money was spent on. A gliding flight over the Egyptian landscape and arriving in a busy shopping street of Egypt. I thought this was already a delight to watch. We get to know Bek (Brenton "The Giver" Thwaites), a kind of Aladdin and a petty thief who succeeds in stealing a (probably in those days) fashionable gown for his beloved Zaya (Courtney "Mad Max: Fury Road" Eaton). And this leads us to the second, unavoidable story : the idyllic love affair. An Egyptian couple with a bright future in front of them and who'll ultimately be victims of the core story. Eternal love, divine adoration for each other and languorous glances, are the obnoxious symptoms we are witnessing. Granted, it wasn't overly annoying. And also this story introduces the most eye-catching prop of the entire movie. That heaving bosom of Eaton. I am almost sure that it does not comply with the usual proportions of that era, but it was the only thing that could distract me from all the other epic violence.Obviously you should watch this spectacle movie without thinking and let yourself be overwhelmed by the lavish fantasy world. The only thing that bothered me was that they tried to cram the entire Egyptian mythological world in this film. As a result, the pacing is scorching high. You've only just put yourself down in your cozy chair and two over-sized gods are already rolling all over the city center. A sort of re-introduction of "King Kong vs. Godzilla". And so one action-packed scene after the other passes by. The fascinating situation about Anubis and the Underworld, two giant snakes writhing over a huge maze or some "Tomb Raider" platform stunt-work in the temple of Set (Gerald Butler). You won't get bored. The most fascinating and crazy part was reserved for Geoffrey "Barbossa" Rush as the god Ra who's pulling the sun with his floating spacecraft around a disc-shaped earth. I instantly wanted to reread books by Terry Pratchett.Concerning content you shouldn't expect too much. And sometimes it's quite illogical. Of course those gods always tend to have an easy solution when a problem occurs, which is an advantage for the subsequent course of the story. You can predict the outcome already from an Egyptian mile away. That's no surprise either. And also the CGI wasn't top notch sometimes in this sword-and-sandal. But this film is mainly judged based on the trailer (which I obviously haven't seen because I try to avoid them studiously) and therefor is ripped to pieces by critics. Yet I find this somewhat exaggerated.Well it's true. At all levels it doesn't contain any profundity. But what do you expect of this type of movie? Highly intellectual conversations and thoughtful screenplay? You also don't expect in a movie such as "Schindler's List" diabolical fright moments or exciting car chases with stirring music? "God of Egypt" showed what I was expecting. Over the top spectacle and action which is digitally displayed in a partially successful way. It effortlessly transcends the level of any Asylum movie. Thank God.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than people say--almost perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My actual grade for Gods of Egypt is a 9.9, which is very high for me. My grading system may definitely be according to what I prefer in a movie, but it's my grading system and not someone else's. Gods of Egypt was a pleasant movie to watch. Fast-paced, good character development, and a few surprises along the way. I was very happy with it. Score: 9.9/10 Stars: 4/5 Grade: A+Plot: 10/10 Overall, the story for Gods of Egypt was good, if basic, but at least they didn't try to do more with it than they did. Sometimes, simple is far better than complex (glaring at you, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). Horus is made the new ruler of Egypt but Set wants the job, so he steals Horus' eyes and story ensues. Straight, simple, to the point, and it works on all levels. Of course, there's more to the story than just that, involving a thief and his dead girlfriend, but it all comes together nicely in the end.Character Development: 10/10 Having such a simple story, character development can sometimes get lost, but in Gods of Egypt, everyone was given enough screen time, enough motivation, and everything you were hoping for in the beginning payed off in dividends in the end (unlike some movies (again, glaring at you, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice)). I was just waiting to be disappointed by the ending, but I wasn't, and that more than anything made me happy and glad I watched this movie.Directing: 10/10 Alex Proyas may not be the world's greatest director, but he doesn't try to give his audience more than he's capable of. For this type of movie, he's a perfect director. That doesn't mean I'd like to see him take on something like Shawshank Redemption, however. But for Gods of Egypt, he directed brilliantly.Casting: 10/10 Again, for this type of movie, I thought the casting was perfect. You needed good looking men, hot looking women, and their acting didn't really matter for the most part. Again, I would not want to see any of these people take on an Oscar-worth film, but for Gods of Egypt, they did what they needed to do and pulled it off well.Acting: 10/10 For Gods of Egypt, the actors pulled off their parts well, giving the audience what they needed to make the movie good. Again, none of them are going for Oscars here, but that's fine because this isn't an Oscar-winning movie.Cinematography: 10/10 I love movies that look good, and everything about this movie was GORGEOUS. From the look of the main city to the various sets and places all the characters went, everything looked great. Yes, it was all CGI, but at least it gave the movie the proper feel. And the way the gods looked in their non-mortal forms was brilliant.Music: 10/10 No, it's not as great as John Williams in Star Wars or Indiana Jones; it's not as good as Howard Shore in the Middle Earth movies; but for this type of movie, at least it wasn't pop culture music set in ancient times. The composer did a great job, giving the proper ambiance to the movie.Pacing: 10/10 The movie didn't have any part to it that dragged. Even the one part that I thought would drag (when Horus talked to Ra) was saved by a rather cool fight scene that showed how awesome Geoffrey Rush is as an actor. From start to finish, the movie barely stopped to let the audience catch their breath.Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Again, gorgeous. The costumer knew how to clothe the actors for best effect, making the women beautiful and the men tough. Good job all around.Re-Watchability: 9/10 I consider this movie an excellent watch, but it's not perfect. I will want to watch it again soon, but it's not really something I think I could watch over and over. I may change my mind after another viewing, however. We'll see.Gods of Egypt. If you haven't seen it, give the movie a shot. You might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing that makes this movie watchable is CGI, it is a good quality CGI, and if you ignore all its drawbacks like bad directing, and dialogues that I guess were written by a 12 year old then you might actually like the movie. Just don't be too judgemental and enjoy it as is. I can definitely watch it once a year. Now if CGI were of poor quality like in The Asylum movies e.g. Transmorphers, Mega Shark etc then forget it, this movie would've been one of the worst I've ever seen.A good CGI is saving this movie From being the worst I've seen Poor directing, conversations are goofy Critics will flash their grins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put Aside the Racism Claims, This Movie is Still Really Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amount of controversy surrounding Gods of Egypt overshadowed the release of the movie to the point where no one seemed to care if the movie was any good or not. The buzz around the movie was centred on the "white-washing" of the cast. This essentially means that for a movie set in Egypt, the biggest parts were all given to white actors as opposed to promoting a more diverse cast. After having watched the movie, those claims are probably true but I honestly want to set aside that issue and judge it separately. The title of this review sums up largely what I have to say, racism aside, this is still a lacklustre movie.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We largely follow 2 characters throughout Gods of Egypt, I'll start by introducing the mortal one. Bek (Brenton Thwaites) is living in the city with his girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton). He promised her a lavish life but they struggle to make ends meet. She works as a servant for a famous Egyptian builder Urshu (Rufus Sewell) while Bek is a petty thief. They may be poor but they seem happy enough, especially Zaya who is happy to go witness the crowning of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau).Horus is the other main character. When the movie begins we get an introduction through narration how the god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) has two sons Osiris and Set (Gerard Butler). Osiris was given the city as his kingdom while Set had to "settle" for the desert. Osiris has decided to pass down his his crown to Horus who despite being more laid-back has been deemed ready for the honour. We see him getting ready and he's joined by the goddess Hathor (Elodie Yung). They are together and Horus even hints at them getting married in the future. The ceremony begins and it's going well. Osiris gives a speech about how he loves his people and that they should all be entitled to the afterlife. Set arrives and embraces his brother but then his army marches on the stage and he stabs his brother. Horus tries to avenge his father but he's defeated by Set. Set rips out Horus' eyes and declares himself king. Horus has to flee the city leaving the people to suffer under the rule of the tyrannical Set.I think the biggest surprise I had with this movie is seeing how big the budget was and how bad the CGI looked. To be clear, there's nothing wrong with being reliant on green screen and computer generated effects. I'm not criticizing it on that basis, it's just they spent so much money and it still didn't look up to par. I was kind of in disbelief about it, there were times when it looked okay but considering the budget ($140 million) it should have been a lot better.Sometimes when the material isn't the best, the actors and actresses can find away to elevate it, this wasn't one of those cases. The material largely dragged the cast down. I wouldn't say anyone looked bored or uninterested, it seemed like everyone was trying, it's just the material was so corny, they couldn't salvage it. This movie took good actors like Chadwick Boseman, Geoffrey Rush and even Gerard Butler and just made them look awful. How they decided to deal with the actors' accents I didn't understand at all. Why is Gerard Butler still speaking with a Scottish accent? I don't like to single people out for criticism but I thought Brenton Thwaites was really flat. His character isn't interesting so he has to overcome that baggage but instead of shining besides that, he didn't help things at all.The other disappointment is the material itself. Something cool could have been done with this story. Most of the small things I liked in this movie were things like the character designs, the setup of the environments, how the gods would transform and fight each other and how they mixed in the lore surrounding the gods in Egypt and worked it in to the story. But instead of capitalizing on that, the dialogue was pretty terrible (the jokes are groan worthy) and parts of the story didn't make sense (When Osiris is murdered, the rest of the gods are present, why not just team up and attack? Also why is it when Horus is at full strength earlier does he lose to Set and then when he's still recovering and Set has gathered the skills from some of the other gods does he win?). It just didn't come together and I think if they had spent a little more time ironing out the kinks, they might have had a better finished product.I was warned ahead of time that this movie was bad. A friend of mine had seen it and warned me it wasn't worth it. I decided to see it anyway and I wish I hadn't. I've seen worse but this movie was a mess. I'm glad it's found an audience as the Blu-Ray sales have been big but I won't be picking up a copy. If you read about the behind-the-scenes when it comes to Gods of Egypt, you understand why it was so polarizing and why it ended up a mess. I would like to point out what I said in the summary one more time, I'm not against this movie because it may or may not be racist, I'm against it because it sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So far from the Stories of the Egyptian Gods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had such high hopes at the beginning even when I watched the trailer, and yet I quickly became disappointed. It strayed so far from the actual stories of the Egptian Gods that I couldn't enjoy the movie. You can't kill a God so the entire idea of half of the movie makes no sense. It felt like they were taking the titles of the Gods and just making a whole new story line out of it. The CGI was good, and some of the humor, but I just found myself getting mad at the story and feeling exasperated all the way to the end. There are many loopholes in my opinion. And merging the parts of Gods together? Really? The architecture wasn't Egyptian, the clothing wasn't Egyptian, Ra looks nothing like the paintings. The Mythology was just absolutely destroyed in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, first let me start off by saying this is one of the greatest movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I watched this on a pirated 480p dvdrip on my iphone 4s. The CGI was stunning! The scenery was so authentic I really felt i was in the ancient Egypt. (by the way, did you know Egypt is located in Asia?) The main role is played by the handsome Jaime Lannister, and King Leonidas. (How did he get all the way from Sparta to Asia?) I personally believe the actors used method acting, because you could really see the raw emotions portrayed in this masterpiece of a movie. TMZ also reported that Jaime Lannister walked around with a blindfold for a whole year preparing for this movie. Thats what I call dedication! This movie made Egypt great again. This movie brings forth so many emotions, and i can personally promise you that when Bek smiles, you will smile too. 10/10 will watch again, instant classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy at its finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt is one of the movies that are true to their name. Its one sole purpose... is to show Egyptian myths and gods in as much fantasy detail as possible. This is one of the movies I'd call "honest". It's not an over-hyped blockbuster trying to milk its fans, it's just a piece of art.Unfortunately, despite all the shining gold, it's...too dull. Almost everything you see - you have seen before. From Thor to Superman to Clash of Titans to even Asura's Wrath - the "inspirations" are obvious. And the whole "love story" is just a few steps away from Transformers.When actors are silly, racks are on display and the plot makes little sense - how could a movie possibly have 6\10?Because I saw what I came to see. Gods of Egypt. As many of them as an average movie could get in. I saw mythical detail, I saw things I'd care for as a fan of the subject since Age of Mythologies. Even if it was a bit Thor\Asura's Wrath-ized. That's also a minus, though an arguable one.If you are a fan of the subject, then this movie will not impress you, but it at least will be a fair enough watch, things can be worse. But if you aren't, I'll be straight and say that this movie will feel pretty stupid and pointless. But nowadays the definitions of "stupid" are judged by the franchise, marketing and critics' salary.That's why, surprisingly, this movie is not as stupid as it gets. So, to summarize.Pros: honest mythology, some semblance of moral, decent acting. Matter of taste: racks, transforming metal suits. Cons: weak plot, weak action scenes, lack of credibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I mean, what do you expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Temper expectations, understand the numerous obvious problems, sit backs and enjoy.Leonidas err, Set (Gerard Butler) takes over Egypt, kills many of the gods and almost kills Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Horus must then get revenge with the help of some mere humans. This is a world with huge gods, magic at every turn and giant monsters. Fine, I accept the world. Now, if you cannot accept the world, if you say, "hey, Egyptian gods were not like ____, and Horus was ____." Then this movie is not for you.What this movie is about is beautiful women, fun fight scenes and lots of action/humour. Think Indian Jones meets Egypt.One thing this movie did get flack for was that none of the cast was Egyptian - and this is a very fair criticism, but one for which many more movies than this should feel the heat for. Countless movies with Greek/Middle Eastern cast almost entirely British cast for some reason, yet escape. Why is Butler an Egyptian god? Well, why is he a Greek king? If this movie is taken at all seriously then it falls apart. Sit back, turn the brain off and enjoy a family friendly action adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the trailer, I didn't have any good expectations for this movie. I watched it more for a morbid curiosity to see how bad it really was. And I must say, I was thoroughly entertained. The story flows from setting the stakes at the beginning, through many battles and twists it reaches a moving conclusion. And the imaginative way of presenting Egypt's mythology was very refreshing. Watching the trailer I thought they had only used the original mythology as a design guide, but they really use much of the myths accurately or well justified.Much better than Clash of the Titans, or Percy Jackson in my opinion.The obvious problem are the visuals, which vary from bad to mediocre, but many scenes were very nice indeed (like the Sphynx, I loved that one).Overall I would recommend it to any fan of Egyptian Mythology and popcorn movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-executed dumb movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one should come to this film expecting an accurate representation of ancient Egypt or Egyptian mythology. It's completely not that. In all ways, this is a remarkably well-executed 'dumb' movie, in that it's a simple fantasy action epic that focuses on fun and escapism as its core. The critique of whitewashing would be a good critique of the film if it weren't so obviously a fantasy that has no concern with mimesis. Scottish accents? Fine, I don't care. Does he glower and seem like a bad guy in the classic bad guy sense? Sure does, so it works.Judging this film to see if it's historically or mythologically accurate is the wrong way to go about it because that's not what the film is trying to do. It's trying to be fun, give you a classic Hollywood fantasy story arc, and give you reasonably good effects and performances and let you just enjoy something for two hours. On that level, it works.Moreover, what it's really trying to is represent not Egypt as it was, but a version of how Egypt understood itself: not as a country on a globe or continent, but a narrow stripe of the 'world' with the life-giving Nile at core and the endless desert around it. Although this isn't true (the Egyptians clearly know about Greece and other areas), it's somewhat close to the vision they had (just as the Greeks thought they were the center of the world). If you approach the film generous to that idea, then you'll enjoy it as long as you enjoy the spectacle of the thing. If you approach it wanting reality and social justice in casting, you're critiquing via the wrong criteria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY KIDS LOVE IT AND SO WILL YOURS!!! Magnificent (visually)!!! Why, because it's truly better than "Clash of the Titans" through the kids eyes!!! Gosh, adults are so spoiled today!!! Remember the kind of movies you used to see when you were a KID??? I wished there were movies like this in my childhood that are so visually stunning, plus thrilling with all those amazing unique characters!!! Didn't you loathe watching the same old movies on TV or in the theater as a kid and you had no choice? I grew up watching over and over, every single year, movies like "The Thief of Bagdad", "Clash of the Titans", "Sinbad of the Seven Seas", "Moses", "Spartacus", and various versions of Gladiator movies, too. I LOVE TO TAKE MY KIDS TO THE MOVIES ALL THE TIME, AND THEY HAVE SEEN LOTS OF SUMMER MOVIES EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SHOCKING TO ME AS A MOTHER, THAT MY 16 YEARS OLD, 12 YEARS OLD, AND 9 YEARS OLD SONS CLAPPED LOUDLY AT THE END OF THE MOVIE AND SAID THEY LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT. WHY, BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY WERE THE INDIANA JONES IN AN Egypt STORY, A THRILLING JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY ALL THROUGH THIS MOVIE, PLUS FIGHTING UNIQUE VILLAINS, CREATURES, AND GODS, AND THEY LOVED IT MORE THAN THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIE. I love Star Wars, but I grew up with it as a child, while my kids watch too much Star Wars cartoons on cable and seen all the past Star Wars movie. THIS IS AN ULTRA FANTASY MOVIE, SO DIFFERENT FOR MY KIDS EYES THAN TYPICAL STAR TREK, STAR WARS, AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS. MY KIDS GOT TO BECOME VARIOUS DIFFERENT AND THRILLING CHARACTERS ALL THROUGH THIS MOVIE, SO WILL YOURS TOO. I enjoyed this so much more than Clash of the Titans. In this movie, there's hot muscular men for the ladies and drop dead gorgeous model-like ladies for the men. So everybody wins!!! LOL! The only reason it didn't do well is that it should have come out in the summer, NOT after Deadpool, which ROCKS or after Valentine's Day. It's worth the RPX expensive tickets I spent. We had a blast!!! Hope for more positive reviews!!! Definitely, worth watching in the theater, NOT in a few month on your TV. I have a 80" TV and the theater is still fantastic for these types of action pack movies!!!</fullReview>

To have a good time and leave the world behind for a few hours.That being said this film while not perfect moved along at a steady pace that few films of this type do nowadays, there is hardly a dull moment here as Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau battle each other as good and bad gods Set and Horus and take us the audience along with them.The 3D could have been a bit better all around but some of the set pieces and action scenes made me turn to my movie companion and say that was pretty cool.

		<shortDescription>Lavish Visual Effects Salvage this Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Alex Proyas fantasy film 'Gods of Egypt', which for the first time in a while vilifies the Award-winning actor Gerard Butler as the Egyptian god of War, Set, also elevates seasoned actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (you may recognize him for his role as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones).Set in the mythological world of a bountiful Egypt, a place christened as 'heaven on Earth' where the gods have decided to settle among the human race and rule over it, Osiris is handing over his crown and throne to his son Horus (played by Nikolaj), at a profligate ceremony that sees Egyptians from all over the realm come to pay homage and celebrate the millennium of peace they have graciously enjoyed under the incumbent.The god of War, Set, who happens to be Osiris' brother, comes to spoil the party for his nephew however, as he forcefully takes over the reigns in what would soon prove to become a blood-thirsty selfish onslaught for power and dominance. We swiftly discover that while the gods may live far longer than humans, there is some mortality to their existence, as they bleed gold amidst their shape- shifting capabilities. Known as 'beast mode', Set and Horus transform in a cataclysmic duel that leaves Set victorious and Horus banished sightless.The true champions of the epic fantasy however, amidst all the majesty of a surfeit of powerful beings, happen to be the couple Bek and Zaya (played by Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton respectively). Their love, which literally knows no boundaries, pushes men and gods alike to jettison all fear and restraint, in a battle to save the realms of both beings from total chaos.An unlikely pair of Horus (light) and Bek end up journeying through the fantastic world of Egypt, and the realm of the 'creator', the god Ra, as they seek to get back Horus' abilities, as well as his self-worth and belief, in order to mount up a challenge against the increasingly insurmountable Set, who usurps the powers of other gods in his quest for supremacy.While the film may have, and continue to, receive a lot of flak for its lack of casting diversity, which pundits have declared is partly the source of its globally lackluster performance at the Box Office, one cannot take away from it the epic yet sternly successful proportions to which the producers and directors have gone to further the obsession with Egypt and its archaeological and mythological history to produce a stunning film.'Gods of Egypt' may be laden with a weak script, but it will take you on a pleasurable journey into the majesty envisioned of Egyptian deities, breathtaking landscapes and a plunge into how high (Set's tower not withstanding) the stakes are in the age-old battle of light versus darkness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a throwback to Jason and the Argonauts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting anything but special effects and was delightfully surprised that it had a storyline. If you want to see something deep and meaningful, this is not the movie. But if you want to see a mindless romp into fantasy with lavish costumes, fantasy worlds and breathtaking visual effects, this fills the bill. It's very much like Jason and the Argonauts. A lot of the effects were very obviously CGI but it didn't distract from my enjoyment of them. The main characters weren't bad to look at either. I liked the way they handled the violence. It was more like a video game for kids. It could have been really graphic with eyes being ripped out and put back, (still didn't watch that) but I could tell it was more cartoony than gory, which I appreciated. I liked the fact that the gods had gold blood that made the violence more palatable. Which is probably why people aren't liking this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no longer surprised by the extremely weak note from "the new generation of reviewers" for this movie. Is not a masterpiece, but it deserve at least a 7 note. A film about imagination, a complete fantasy...The story is commercial but fitted together with good actors, what I can't say for the public's favorite "the Force Awakens" And because I am here, " the Force Awakens", a idiot movie, has 8.4 for they, and "The Revenant", a stupid languorously movie, is a "new standard in cinema"..."The Rome" by Federico Fellini has just 7.5...A new era of idiocracy.. I'm glad that i'm too old to catch this new era of stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly enjoyable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the ratings, I was a bit nervous about spending money on the movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot gives the viewer the gist of the Horus vs. Set myth, while still differing enough to offer surprises to people who are familiar with Egyptian mythology. To some degree, the path that one of the main characters follows (to avoid spoilers the character will remain nameless) is a bit predictable, but that doesn't make it bad!Now, of course, we come to the racial controversy. I need to take a point off for some questionable casting roles. The reasons I don't take off more points are a) we don't know what color Ancient Egyptians were, and b) there was diversity, even if there should have been more. Ancient Egyptian art depicts people with varying skin tones, some light, so it would be difficult to narrow down one particular skin tone and say that this is what the actors should be. The main cast is composed of Scottish, Danish, Australian, Cambodian/French, and African American actors. Overall, there should have been more diversity though, because the bulk of actors are Australian. Which, in no way is bad, it's just that Australians tend to have light skin and, while some Ancient Egyptians may have had lighter skin than people think, the hieroglyphics depict it darker than most of the actors. Even though we can't be sure what skin tone Ancient Egyptians had, the cast should have at least included more people with African descent, given that Egypt is in Africa. If we can't narrow down a skin tone, we can at least be sure of country of origin.All of the actors did a decent job playing his/her respective character, but I have to say that some choices seemed odd. Geoffery Rush is an amazing actor and he will forever be the one of the best pirates I've ever seen on screen. He wasn't as memorable as the sun god, though. For Ra (and maybe I'm a bit biased, being a fan of classic lit.), I'd expect someone to ooze majesticness. Rush's performance seems a bit more surly. I mean, hey given what he has to do every day, I could see a bit battle-worn. But I never get the feeling of awe I'd expect from the head honcho of the gods. Gerard Butler makes a very attractive and powerful Set and I feel bad about discounting him on something he can't control. However, his Scottishness made the choice of him as Set seem a bit odd. Hearing a Scottish accent in the voice of an Egyptian god causes a bit of confusion. Honestly, I would have chosen different actors to play them. I can't narrow down one for Ra, but Peter Mensah would have made a great Set. Anyway, I loved the movie and was extremely entertained even if I disagreed with some of the casting choices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was creative with an actual story and plot that was easy to follow. The graphics were good. And the best part, it was clean like the old Hollywood movies that required wit, true acting, and not just zeroing in on the eyes and expressions for fake dramatics. If you don't like mythology or science fiction, then no you probably won't like it, but if you like mythology, then it's good. It adds a twist to that old traditional take on mythology. Just need an open mind.It was weird seeing Gerard Butler as the antagonist, but he did a good job of playing the part. It was a nice change to see real acting for a change instead of the played up camera zooming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good time at the movies.... just don't expect Shawshank Redemption-quality filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't too fond of the commercials or the trailer for Gods Of Egypt, I just thought it looked like a B-movie from Netflix. I was bored and decided to give this a chance, even with all the negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. I actually had a pretty good time with this movie, despite the lack of appreciation from the other filmgoers in the theater. All of the action scenes will satisfy the 11 year-old audience because of the ridiculousness, and the adults will be instantly entertained. As for the CGI, it's not too bad actually, most of it looks really cool, but the green-screen is used way too much, which is my one downside that I had while watching it. The Sun God and the villain stole the show for me, they were just too awesome in those epic action sequences. Before you watch this movie, which you should, it's a really good time, see the 3D version, this is the only movie released so far this year that uses it correctly, and it helps the action look slicker and shinier and makes the green-screen look better and make the actors standing in front of it pop out more fluidly. Don't listen to the harsh people- just watch it and enjoy the fresh, crisp action and observe the cool visuals(like I said, see the 3D screening, it adds something to the superb special effects).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a mythological movie, always liked mythological movies, and this one was no exception. I went into the movie not having read any of the critics reviews, and when I came home afterwards, I was surprised to see so many critics have bashed the movie. The only problem that they can cite is that this movie had too many white actors in it! This was never a problem in the past, The Clash of the Titans and the Immortals were similar mythological movies from just a few years ago, also with a mainly white cast and it was never even mentioned for them. Since this movie came out so soon after the 2016 Oscar awards ceremony, which was criticized heavily for not having any black actors or black-based films nominated, maybe this movie got unfairly caught up in the fad of the times? Anyways, there's a lot to love about this film. Watch the depiction of the flat Earth, with a Sun being dragged around by Ra's chariot. They could've gone with a modern scientific depiction of the round Earth and the Sun, but this is mythology, they wanted to stay true to the mythological depiction, and so they did depict it like mythology has it. But their depiction is a lot of fun, it is sort of a retro-modern depiction.I never felt the movie dragged at any point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods Gone Wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Proyas' "Gods of Egypt" is a film that is boldly and unabashedly silly and preposterous. Few other words can describe it. It has the pratfalls that beset typical Hollywood fare. It is already the subject of controversy due to its preeminently Caucasian cast. It has both critics and audiences sharpening their knives, a film supposedly destined for failure.Oh, but it works because the film truly bonkers. Truly insane. Truly out of its mind.Proyas, a gifted and visionary filmmaker, is renowned for having thought-provoking and striking imagery in all of his films, and this film is without exception. Where in any other film do you get to see goddesses horse-riding giant fire-breathing serpents? Or wagons carrying infinite amounts of gold dumping their load in a funnel-like tube ala dump trucks? Or for that matter, gods bleeding gold? Or Gerard butler riding gold- chromed giant beetles into battle? Or gods that have body parts that, when disfigured, instantly become detachable jewelry? Or...Admittedlly the plot is indeed silly even by blockbuster Hollywood standards, however a lesser Proyas film is still more visually inventive than the usual Hollywood movie factory output, and that is always a plus. Whereas a film like "Pan" bludgeons us over the head with its disgusting cynicism and disrespect for the source material by portraying its titular hero as a clichéd messiah figure, Proyas directs with the exuberance of a kid in Disneyland - with Disneyland replaced with an Egyptian museum exhibit ? eager at the chance to create his own action packed tale while still respecting the gods as, well, gods.What is there to say about the plot, except that it has gods and it has Egypt? You get exactly what's on the tin. You get a chiseled hero in the form of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), his athletic and quippy comic sidekick (Brenton Thwaites) and beautiful love (Courtney Eaton), who set out to defeat Horus' evil uncle Set (Gerard Butler, simultaneously parodying his "300" persona while being supremely sinister).The whole thing sounds very Greek. But rather than eschewing the silly tone and making it "Gladiator"-style dark and dreary ala the recent "Clash of the Titans" movies, Proyas and the actors let loose and have a ball with the material, never being too self aware while being silly enough to make for compelling viewing. Even rising star Chadwick Boseman (terrific in both "42" and "Get on Up"), as Thoth the god of knowledge, relishes in chewing the scenery with every moment, never afraid of being campy. Not bad.Look, it's clear that the film is a B-grade Saturday night matinée film straight from the 1950s. Ever heard your grandparents told you about those? The ones where there's usually a double feature showcasing silly low budget sci-fi/horror/fantasy plots with handsome men and gorgeous gals, supremely cheesy one liners and having no purpose other than to put a goofy smile on your face from start to finish, almost guaranteeing a good time out? Well, this is one such movie, but with a blockbuster budget and the added pleasure of having Proyas wrapping the fun around with his wonderful thought-provoking visuals and production design, and going wild with this thing. Two set pieces involving a gigantic worm-like demon and the Egyptian afterlife are visual marvels, triumphs of set design and visual effects, evoking senses of awe and wonder like films from yesteryear and other gifted visionaries. For mainstream filmmakers, CGI is the cheat sheet. For Proyas, it's his toy box. This is eye candy on a spectacular scale, and audiences won't get short-changed.Bear with me here, but if you were to replace the cast with genuine Egyptian actors, I think the film would be mired in even bigger controversies because it will definitely look more inaccurate and seemingly insulting than it supposedly already is. It's stupid, yes, but it's gloriously stupid and never succumbs to taking itself ever so seriously. Proyas sort of knew what he was doing here, and he didn't give a damn about what others thought. And that's the kind of filmmaker I admire the most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to not watch it, not her kind of movie.I pretty much watch everything my public library buys, and the synopsis of this one seemed very interesting. In fact it is. But overall I found it to be a so-so movie. Of necessity lots of CGI and motion-capture with blue screen had to be used.The feature conflict is between Horus, who wants to be a kind and gentle god for the people, and his uncle Set who is mean, harsh, and wants peasants to gain eternal life by how much riches they can bring forward.There is also a love story between two mortals, when she is shot and killed with an arrow as they escape, and sent off to the afterlife he desperately wants a god to intervene to bring her back to his life.The best thing I enjoyed about it is the sound track, with all the effects and battles they use lots of super-deep bass, some of it in the subsonic range, but you can truly feel it. My powered subwoofer had a good workout!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egypt Has Fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry it took me so long to write this review. I was whitewashing my laundry.I've seen many sword &amp; sandal &amp; the gods movies, from Prince of Persia to Gladiator to Pompeii to Clash of the Titans 1,1,2 and even though the genre is not one I care for, this one probably ranks in the lower half of most of them. It's really just too long, the CGI is eh and the heart of the characters plus the dialogue spoken from them was elementary.But, was it a terrible movie? Not really. I've seen a lot worse. It's a live-action cartoon/video game and probably will appeal to those who like one or both of those. The movie has way too many subplots, plot holes and direction to really narrow our focus and by the movie's merciful end, it's easily forgettable. It doesn't help that we care so little for any of the characters. Even the stolen Aladdin thief was meh.To narrow it down, he who was to be king is of course dethroned before he even gets the throne by, I guess, Uncle Scar and it's up to a god, a thief, an ego and some lovely chick to follow-the-clues and take back the kingdom.Nothing is noteworthy here, but I did laugh out loud at the god's spaceship. Never did I imagine one of the ancient gods having space ships. It's both whaaaat? and WTF at the same time.But, other than that, it's kind of a waste of time. Not the worst, again and if you do like those sword &amp; sandal &amp; the gods movies, you might be a bit interested. But, put it off since there are so many better ones to see first.***Final thoughts: Poor Gerard Butler. Not only is he handsome as hell, but he's not a terrible actor. He just can't get a break with a really good movie. Last one I recall was the super-fun, 24/Die Hard-rip-off: Olympus Has Fallen. He had some good ones before that, but looks like he's not being as trusted these days with good scripts. Just past the half-way point of 2016 and he's already led two huge bombs (including this one.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set aside the "whitewashed" cast, and you still have an underwhelming film. I've always been a fan of Egyptian mythology, so I was excited when I saw the trailer for this film. After watching it, I was disappointed.Something that bothered me throughout "Gods of Egypt" was the fact that Set was the only one with a Scottish accent. (I know Gerard Butler is Scottish, okay?) The characters are obviously not supposed to have a Scottish accent. Though it's a minor detail, it's inconsistent, and just plain dumb.There were multiple cheesy scenes within the film--Bek and Zaya kissing whilst Bek holds up one of Horus' eyes when escaping the master builder and his guards, and Ra fighting off the "space worms" or what have you--to name a few. Even the slow motion during certain fight scenes was more so mediocre rather than impressive.Not to mention, the movie seemed to be very fast paced with a lot of skipping ahead. It was as if everyone in the film would come up with a plan, and in a mere matter of minutes, they would follow through with it. There was no thinking it over, or arguing-- everyone was so easily persuaded. It felt like everyone working on the film had a million of ideas and liked the sound of all of them, so decided to incorporate everything.Ultimately, I think the film had a lot of potential, but fell short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This looks like one of those old Cecille B. DeMille biblical epics of the 1960s with much better special effects, due to modern CGI techniques. Instead of Old Testament rivals, we get Horus and Get battling for the soul of Egypt. Get is a god of darkness and Horus is the good guy; or god of light. The opening features a fight between the two, which results in the bad guy plucking out the good guys eyeballs. The obligatory mortal hero comes along to assist Horus in regaining Egypt while also attempting to reunite with his one true love. The only recognizable actor is Gerard Butler as Get; in a similar role he did in "300." The script is rather silly but the CGI is spectacular. Gods of Egypt needs to be seen on a big screen. I do not know why the budget was $140 million, as this is, at best, a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review of Gods of Egypt (spoiler free) * (1/5) Cast: Brenton Thwaites, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Gerard Butler, Courtney Easton, Geoffrey Rush.Plot: Mortal hero Bek (Thwaites) teams with the god Horus (Coaster-Waldau) in an alliance against Set (Butler), the merciless god of darkness, who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict.I just want to start off by saying this film is abysmal in fact it is worse than abysmal. As far as summer blockbusters go this is by far the worst. Gods of Egypt is one of those rare films were the mortal is the hero. Director Alex Proyas concentrates on making this film action packed and look really pretty rather than focusing on an actual plot. This film is completely packed with CGI and it does look astonishing it's that that the story makes it a worthless experience.This film packs in a lot of action mainly caused by Set (Butler) whose character looks very bad-ass but that is all that is working for him. This movie could have been a lot better if not for the idiotic story kind of like Clash of the Titans. This is probably going to be the biggest flop this year which is a shame because the hype was so high, and made on a budget of $140 million that money just made the movie look pretty and the actors in this were just cannon fodder.Another thing is that this movie contains some of the biggest stars in Hollywood for example Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau whose known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Although Gerard Butler hasn't done anything good since 300 (2006) just a matter of an opinion. The one person that has gone down in standards is Australian actress Courtney Eaton previously known from last years action masterpiece Mad Max: Fury Road.Here are some points as to why this is the worst summer blockbuster:Plot: As said before the plot is just non existent see normally films that have the main character as a mortal and he becomes a hero are well paced and a delight, but this is far from that with this your brain will just melt because of the stupidity. Essentially the plot of this movie should say witness my action and my pretty because that's all it's good for, just a poignant mess.Acting: Now the acting is very complex sometimes it's good and sometimes it is not but most of the time it is just, just an added feature. While choosing the casting they just picked who thought would make this movie good they were picked at random, sometimes a good thing but in this case it is to be avoided. Some of the actors in this film are prestigious legends like Geoffrey Rush who is known for The Kings Speech (2010), the Australian actor made that film good and watchable, but for this even with his performance I was begging for it to end.Other than that this film is exceptionally gorgeous but this summer could been without it.Verdict: Very good looking, stupid and quite frankly doesn't even feel like it should even fall into the so bad it's good. It is eternally bad and should be forgotten.2/10 dreadful and an absolute mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie kinda of sucked. I would have given it two stars, were it not for the visuals and the actors Butler and Waldau. Forget about the whole mostly-white-actors-in-a-movie-set-in-Egypt, forget about that. Something that irked me, almost more than what I am to talk about later, were the lame, "witty" jokes- the comments down the road, the whole trying to take a break from action by pausing a few seconds just to say something "funny", even though it was in the midst of the heat of all of it. And the thing is, it was darn corny and stupid! I couldn't even laugh, it was just really distracting!Now for the main part, I HATED how they progressed so easily, so quickly- NO effort. The problem solving was so straight forward, no struggle at all. This took away the excitement, the thrill- no blood pumping here, just my neck aching from having to drag myself through this movie. The lines the poor actors had to say in this movie, I mean- who wrote this? Seriously? I cringed whenever something dramatic was happening, I would rather hear them do the boring "journey talk" they did during some points in the movie. Actually, I cringed over how casually they said anything in the movie, except for epic Gerard Butler, as he was mostly like he was in all his badass movies.And bad fights, like wow, bad. Only visuals saved them from me just shutting off.Enough ranting now, for short:Good:- Great visuals- Great actors (Fan of Gerard Butler, hehe)BAD:- Witty, not-so-witty comments throughout- Cringy manuscript, couldn't even move the most sensitive person in the whole world. (Bad acting, seemed like the actors struggled to make it flow because of how the lines were set up)- Boring problem solving all the way, it was made too easily, too sudden and with no struggle at all (plus the annoying "jokes" [?] in the midst of it.)- Bad fights, and they were the best part because of the visuals.By the way, I kind of don't like how people give more stars to off- set the bad reviews from other reviewers, JUST because they want to defend it from critique with mostly white actors for characters from Egypt. People can say it had a bad impact on their experience of the movie, since after all- the setting was Egypt and Egyptian gods, hence they can rate it from that point on. But to give it MORE stars to off-set the bad reviews on the non-logical casting of the movie is plain moronic, you ruin the whole rating system because you do not review based on the movie, but on what others have rated it as- and no, I do not care about the white actors at all. Actors are actors, as long as they do great, I don't care!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I'm beginning to see movie-making Hollywood in a new light. I had been thinking that they exploit/take the hard-earned money of people who don't know what good grammar is, or remember what good acting should look like, or history. But now I believe those people are the people making today's movies. I don't expect much anymore, not after "Noah" or "Exodus: Gods and Kings", which were ludicrous, but this movie? I've actually read all of these stories, and they are beautiful. What? The antithesis of what Hollywood is cranking out. I'm sure the cast had a roaring good time making this tripe, so good for them! Beaucoup bucks too, awesome! However, as I became almost instantly bored by the bad script, then the laughable representation of Horus, I knew I had a choice to make: 1) Continue watching and laugh my way through (like I did with the above mentioned movies, or; 2) turn it off lest watching more make my I.Q. drop 50 points, which no one can afford. Since I was watching it alone, I knew the latter would be my fate. The other two movies I saw with friends so they turned into raucously good times. But when Butler walked into the room like he was walking into a Hollywood party, I turned it off. Obviously, something is happening in film that I no longer wish to be party to. Because I use sentences like "no longer wish to be party to". I want my dollar back for the Redbox rental.</fullReview>

So yes, it doesn't accurately portray Egypt and takes a massive dump on fact and history but it was enjoyable, plot straight forward, characters likable and some i hated, plenty of action and overall a watchable movie.

		<shortDescription>White Egyptians and perfect annunciation ruin the illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was quite a good movie in the end, however, there were certain things which you had to get past and, for many, that was probably impossible. Firstly and most ludicrously, 99% of the cast is white and just didn't work, on any level, for a movie set in Egypt. Secondly, everyone has a ridiculously overdone generic English accent. What Americans don't seem to grasp is that (a) less than 0.1% of English folks just don't talk like that (b) English is not about pronouncing every single letter in every single word, perfectly. Even the poshest of folks don't speak like that - I think THAT is the movies biggest problem. The actors seem so preoccupied about perfect annunciation that they forget to act naturally. The black fella, Chadwick Boseman, who played 'Thoth', is especially guilty of this and his dreadful attempt at being English ruins his character's credibility; if he'd spoken with an American accent, no one would have noticed as much. The CGI is fabulous and the story isn't a bad one. The casting was a bit off and it did come across a bit like they'd spent so much on cgi that there wasn't enough for some more proper actors. I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong at first and then it dawned on me. It was as ludicrous as casting white folks in 'Roots' and asking them to do African accents. Once I forgave the actors for this I really started to enjoy the movie. Please, please, whoever made this movie; if you are thinking of doing a sequel, fix these major issues! Because there were no indigenous Egyptians and no attempt was made to even disguise the actors to look like any, you just never buy into the movie 100%. It doesn't feel like ancient Egypt and you have to work really hard to get your head around that. We have among others, Danish, American and Australian actors - who's idea was it to make them all speak in this ridiculous fashion?? Anyway - try to ignore this and it's quite a good film.</fullReview>

This is a rather decent entertainment movie, not much more, but also not less.After I am growing somewhat tired of endless sequel/prequel Starwars, X-men and all the Marvel-stuff (...-men and alike), the turn to Egypt and it's mythology provides quite some freshness, some humour included, and surely a setting we did not see that often in recent years. So, if I may advise: general rating on IMDb are often rather misleading and you should give this movie sooner or later a chance - it is clearly nice to look at... ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot better than the reviews had me believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this movie and thought "Oh that looks good" then I read a few reviews and comments on various web sites and a lot of people were bad mouthing it so I was feeling a little reluctant to watch it. But I also knew from past experience not to trust some reviews.The movie was a lot of fun with action all the way. The effects were excellent and the story was compelling and made me want to watch until the end to see the outcome. I find in a movie if I am either rooting for a good guy or against a bad guy then the movie is doing something right and in this I was certainly doing the latter.I think maybe to improve the movie I would have started and finished in modern day Egypt with some reference to past legends or something - maybe finding some ancient artefact or similar.But on the whole a good fun movie that is worth watching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Entertainment for the Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally while I feel there were a great many flaws in the movie. I still found much enjoyment in watching it. Yes the CGI was fairly poor. But it was not so horrendous as to render it unwatchable. I also like Gerald Butler and the guy who played Horus. I would like to see a sequel where Horus goes after the Goddess of Love Hathor. It is in my opinion a worthy buy when it comes out on Blu-Ray. I hope that if they do ever get a green light they fix a few things but in general keep the same flow as they had in this film. I wouldn't mind seeing some of those characters return. Anyways I love Egyptian Mythology and even though this was not something you'd want to base your term paper on. It was still something to eat some popcorn invite a chick over and have a nice evening while watching a action/love story. I may seem to be all over the place but that is because I just finished watching it myself. I wasn't disappointed in the film. Nor did I care that most of the main actors were "White". Personally if you look back in the history of acting it really didn't matter the color or sex as most actors who even played women were men dressed up. So I don't hop on this senseless PC race train. I just watch for the story or the plain entertainment of the film. So I say bring on another one. Or write some cheap novels based off the screen play I'd read it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Light but Epic Fantasy Adventure Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will never see this movie as an Oscar good movie, but this is not a bad movie either. The acting is mediocre. It is a heavy CG movie, not spectacular, but not bad either. The script also mediocre.But Surprisingly, the whole movie is epic, the view is beautiful. The myth is fantastic. I enjoyed the whole adventure from beginning to the end, without any boredom. The movie's plot and story is light, but Fun, like watching a Disney's fairy tale cartoon. It is a family friendly fairy tale (mythology) movie. Far more better than CLash of Titans or any Hercules or Gods movie out there.If you like fantasy and mythology (and comics and games), this is a must watch movie. If you like adventure movie like The 5th Elements or Star Gate, you can say this is a movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly fun movie, although not better than average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't expect to like the film, but I did, sort of. The actors are decent, the story a bit silly, but fun, the CGI is way over the top, but sometimes in a good way, sometimes it feels like watching a game cinematic from the early 2000's.In this story where someone needs to tell Set this is definitely not Sparta, Horus not to loose any more body parts and Osiris that sadism is not everything in life, a young guy that looks and acts like Aladin, but is not, uses the power of love to rival the gods themselves - making the goddess of love kind of superfluous there. And since that was the only female actress that is worth mentioning, this is movie about guys with naked chests and big swords that has received positive reviews mainly from the female audience, but keeps some dazzling CGI fights and use of technical know how to keep guys interested.One can go past the bad CGI easily - I mean, who has seen a god recently? it's not like you can say "heeey, gods don't actually look like that!" One can ignore the ridiculous cardboard motivations of the characters - they're from Egypt, how smart can they be, even if they are all mostly white? One can also go past the story, because face it: it's a fairy tale and that's how they are. However, once you have finished the getting past part, you realize the movie is over and not much else has happened except bits that you purposely ignored. Fun though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Gods of Egypt is a 2016 fantasy film featuring ancient Egyptian deities. The United States-Australia production is directed by Alex Proyas and stars Brenton Thwaites, Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Chadwick Boseman, Élodie Yung, Courtney Eaton, Rufus Sewell, and Geoffrey Rush. Butler plays the god of darkness Set who takes over the Egyptian empire, and Thwaites plays the mortal hero Bek who partners with the god Horus, played by Coaster-Waldau, to save the world and rescue his love.-When Lionsgate began promoting the film in November 2015, it received backlash for its predominantly white cast playing Egyptian deities. In response, Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas apologized for the lack of casting diversity.-Lionsgate released Gods of Egypt in theaters globally starting on February 25, 2016 in 2D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D. It released the film in the United States, Canada, and 68 other markets on February 26, 2016. It received negative reviews from film critics.--Critical reception: -On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 13%, based on 110 reviews, with an average rating of 3.4/10. Metacritic gives the film a score of 23 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".-Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote, "A mishmash of unconvincing visual effects and clumsy writing ? not to mention another depiction of ancient Egypt in which the lead roles are almost all played by white folks ? Gods of Egypt might have merited a so-bad-it's-good schadenfreude fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes. Instead, it skids into dullness, thus negating the camp classic that it so often verges on becoming." Joycelyn Noveck of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a half star out of four, writing, "It's obvious the filmmakers were gunning for a sequel here. But this bloated enterprise is so tiresome by the end, it seems more likely headed for a long rest somewhere in the cinematic afterlife." Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club called Gods of Egypt "overlong and very silly," and said: "A treasure trove of gilded fantasy bric-a-brac and clashing accents, Proyas' sword-and-sandals space opera is a head above the likes of Wrath of the Titans, but it rapidly devolves into a tedious and repetitive succession of monster chases, booby traps, and temples that start to crumble at the last minute." -Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian was less negative on the film: "This is ridiculous. This is offensive. This shouldn't be, and I'm not going to say otherwise if you can't bring yourself to buy a ticket for this movie. But if you are on the fence you can always offset your karmic footprint with a donation to a charity, because this movie is a tremendous amount of fun." -In response to the reviews, director Alex Proyas attacked critics in a Facebook post, calling them "diseased vultures pecking at the bones of a dying carcass", who were "trying to peck to the rhythm of the consensus. I applaud any film-goer who values their own opinion enough to not base it on what the pack-mentality says is good or bad." --Cultural commentary: -Molly Driscoll, writing for The Christian Science Monitor, said Gods of Egypt was part of popular culture's "fascination with Egypt", last visited with the 1999 film The Mummy and its sequels and spin-offs. Driscoll also identified Gods of Egypt as part of a trend of film adaptations of mythology such as the 2010 film Clash of the Titans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>with this movie its a good and bad news situation for me. After seeing the Trailer and reading some critics, I expected a very bad movie.Good News: its not very badBad News: its not really goodThis movie strongly reminded me of the days of the Sindbad Movies. Those were movies that, when they came on TV, one would always watch and strangely enjoy despite all the cheesiness, the sometimes hilariously bad (sometimes however great) effects and of course completely predictable and flat stories. This is such kind of movie.Its no Epic like Ben Hur but it does not really try to be (if it tries it fails very hard). Its more like a Disney Movie where the enjoyment does not come from a deep, thoughtful plot but from the fantastic setting and lighthearted (and mostly family friendly) action.The effects are mediocre on the good side, while they do show their CGI roots, they do the job well enough. Some of them are bordering on great while none of them really disturb the movie. Effects are mostly on the plus side.Acting is also mediocre. Nothing to criticize but also nothing to praise.The story is typical good vs. bad. Again mediocre at best.With everything being mediocre, a rating of 5 would seem fitting but I added 2 points extra because the sum of all this "mediocracy" did make for very enjoyable two hours and I appreciate that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very fun ride if you're a fan of fantasy and flashy epics. If you liked movies like 300, The scorpion King and to a certain extent the first Mummy Movies, You will certainly enjoy Gods of Egypt. The plot is certainly nothing to write home about, but then again that is not the meat of the movie, it brings together a more than competent cast, that put in just the right amount of overacting ( Hey we're talking about Gods aren't we ? )I will not even address the elephant in the room : the so called whitewashing, stemming myself from a middle eastern country, (born and raised), I did find nothing offensive with the cast nor did any of the 200+ people at the theater with me in Dubai, the allegations of bad CG are just that Allegations, people who compare this to a video game are right in doing so but that's not a bad thing, as the visuals are rich and go very well with the grandiose themes. All in all a solid epic movie that deserves to be given a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I go to the theatre watch a fantasy or sci-fi movie I am hoping to be swept away to another place and time.I think ancient Egypt had a great many thing going for it I mean it had the pyramids the sphinx but it had countless temples and stories that a lot of people have never heard of am i saying that its accurate of course not. It is however a good back drop to tell tales and spin stories about a time and place that people know little about.This movie had a good special effects not only in the amazing sets and visual effects in general but I also found that the background sounds as well that really helped to sell the story line.Speaking of the story line I thought they did well with how it unfolded and how it showed the growth of the characters both mortal and immortal alike. I found all and all it was a well done movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt wasn't the movie I set out to watch, last Saturday, but, boy, am I glad that my first choice was unavailable. Otherwise, I would have missed this striking, action-packed, energetic and flashy movie. I had a blast, and plan to see it again. There was something for everyone; great special effects, romance, action, danger and humor.While it did not adhere particularly closely to Egyptian mythology, that's probably for the best. Some of those myths can get pretty disturbing. What it did do was deliver lots of fun and eye-candy. I did not leave my seat, glance at my phone messages or remember my popcorn, once the movie began. When you stop chewing and forget where you are, you know you're having fun at the movies.The characters were enjoyable (especially Horus, who came across as grumpy and hung-over, at first, but eventually got himself sorted). Set was genuinely villainous, and Ra's flat Earth, Sun-towing scene a real treat. I found myself really liking Hathor, as well. The two kids, Bek and Zaya, were cute, reminding me just a little of Aladin and Jasmine. Yu genuinely cared about Zaya, on her journey through the frighteningly bleak Egyptian underworld. About Hathor, too, actually, but I won't spoil things and say why.Personally, I rate this movie on par with Avengers: Age of Ultron, and above the last Star Wars movie, which I saw just once. Go see Gods of Egypt. You'll be glad that you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular visuals and a clever story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this over the top extravagant adventure set in Ancient Egypt.Good points: The script cleverly uses the legends of the Egyptian gods. It's fun to see the god brought to life and transform into various birds and beasts. Now everyone can visualize the gods instead of imagining them from a 2 dimensional painting on a wall. The tale of Horus avenging the murder of his father Osiris by fighting Set is brought to life. There is quite a lot of dialog and humor for a movie of this type. The visuals are spectacular dizzying and fantastical. You get some pretty impressive cities temples caves tombs pyramids and the underworld. It's true they have gone a bit overboard with the sets and scenery that border on gaudy and crowded to be distracting. Egypt is just made to look too colorful, and there are too many massive heights to plunge down cliffs and waterfalls. Egypt is a pretty flat country and it just seemed a bit too much. But in the end even if it was too over the top at least it felt grand.Weak points: The cast was hit and miss. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Hathor looks more like a bad guy than a good guy - he should have been the villain Set instead. As Set, Gerard Butler's Scottish accent was jarring. Australians Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton make the cute young mortal couple. Again their clipped British accents were out of place. It would have been better if they spoke with more neutral slightly Middle Eastern accents so as not to be so incongruous. This is tied in with the controversy that the cast was not ethnically correct. This is partly right with the very blonde actresses in various supporting roles and Geoffrey Rush as Ra is out of place. Chadwick Boseman is the only actor of African descent in a major speaking role. But this mistake in casting isn't a fatal flaw. At least Elodie Yung as love interest Hathor looks a bit more ethnically suitable and she is quite beguiling. Some of the fighting was a bit dizzying and formulaic. A bit headache inducing.Bottom line - this is a grand blockbuster with it's clever story using Egyptian legends. Worth a watch on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think there is an unfair ethnocentrism being exhibited by critics of this film's casting. I never heard people complaining that movies about Christian mythology, Greek mythology, or Roman mythology lacked the ethnic casting of their respective regions. Did Wrath of the Titans get demeaned because there weren't enough Greeks cast as Greek gods or demigods? Or how about not enough Italians cast in the Thor movies? There are actually a substantial number of Arab and African actors cast in Gods of Egypt, not to mention the scores of extras about. The two young actors playing mortal characters ran away together, from where we know not. And of course the gods are from wherever and are not even as homogeneous as the critics are claiming. The principal leads are either from Europe or Australia, because the director is English-speaking and is from Australia. Me thinks perhaps some of the protests are feigned outrage over this film's diversity so as to prevent people from watching it and having anything to with their region's pagan past. After all, there has been one particular religion's more literal followers' 1400 years of ethnic cleansing and attempts to erase it. This is humanity's myths and you do not own them. Get over yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the reviews I was quite skeptical spending money and wasting some valuable time to go watch in the theaters instead of waiting for it to come on DVD yet a friend insisted we give it a go despite the critics negative reviews and boy I was entertained!! A solid spectacular adventure roller coaster from start to finish set in an extremely stylish ancient Egyptian atmosphere with a great cast is what we got!! I really don't get the cynics any more they seem to expect an Oscar winner even in the fun adventure Genre!! Was Indiana Jones ever going to win an Oscar?!! I expect these movies to be reviewed fairly in comparison with others in the same genre and in that regards this movie scores a straight 9/10 for a solid engaging story telling well acted and directed with excellent visual effects and some great costumes that glorifies this period and does justice!! Personally I am an avid move watcher and take great pride in my movie opinion and analysis and this one is certainly a must watch adventure movie if you ask my humble opinion and one of the very best adventure movies ever made about ancient Egypt it is surely miles better than the Mummy series!!The movie does a great job bringing the fantasy to life in style and sequence of events that surely will captivate the audience attention throughout. My honest opinion and advise don't listen to critics on this one actually don't listen to them when it comes to these type of movies period as they seem to have a thing or two against them for some strange reason and for that they seem to turn a blind eye towards all the glamour, style and story telling. Go watch it folks and see for yourselves one of the best blockbusters in the last couple of years an extremely amazing and memorable saga that surely will watch it over many times to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, I knew people would dislike the movie, ever since the first trailer popped in, and it got all the negative comments. First of all, about this "white washing": ancient Egyptians were not black. Not white either, but not black. And does it really a problem? Did the performance of Laurence Olivier as Othello (a character who IS black) bothers anyone? No. The director of Gods of Egypt is Alex Proyas, who was born in Egypt. I guess he was well aware of his country's history when he made the casting choices. And he has the right to choose anyone he wants. He is the director. Not the director of a documentary or a drama that's based on a true story. He is the director of a fantasy movie. Yes, the mythology has been around for thousands of years, but it's still a fantasy movie where Horus and other gods exist. None of this happened, so no one should look for historic accuracy. Let's move on. I felt this movie is like Clash of Titans or Prince of Persia. It's not flawless. It's absolutely forgettable. It's 15 minutes longer than it should be. The CGI (when Horus and Seth transformed) is cartoonish. BUT: It's entertaining! The production design and the cinematography is great! I've always loved the Egyptian myth, and I was glad to see this movie's world was creative and visually great to look at. The music is solid. I liked the actors and their characters. For me, Chadwick Boseman had the best part in the movie. Minor role, but I loved every second of it. And I liked that neither of the main heroes is a comic relief. Yes, the script was not the best, but I've seen some blockbusters in the past one year (like Mad Max: Fury Road, Furious 7, etc.) that were loved by critics and viewers but had no superior script.Once again, GODS OF Egypt is not for everyone, but it is for some. I didn't regret I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than you have been told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, this is a big budget action and special effects movie about Egyptian gods battling each other to rule the world, right? When you go to a movie like this, you have certain expectations--its not likely to be on the Best Picture short list next Oscar season, and everyone involved with making this movie knew this. But from the very first breathtaking camera shot, you can tell The Gods of Egypt was crafted with enthusiasm and a spirit of fun and unrelenting inhibition. For what this movie was striving for, it is absolutely on target. I saw it on IMax 3-D with my 5th and 7th grade sons, and we loved every minute! Visually dazzling, a soaring musical score, satisfying play-to-the-back-row acting, interesting and somewhat unfamiliar mythological characters, amazing costumes and set pieces--I think this film delivered on all fronts. In a way, Gods of Egypt is more original than many similar films of this genre in that it is not a prequel or sequel or reboot of a franchise, or a comic book adaptation. For instance, while it shares its episodic and implausible plot and style, it is a far more original film than the beloved Episode VII (but without decades of nostalgia and anticipation to paper over its weaknesses). It introduces and creates characters completely new to us in a fascinating and beautiful imaginary world. You will not forget the striking image of the stern but grandfatherly sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush plays it large here!) circling the disk of the world with his space craft/chariot, sun in tow, as he daily battles a hideous chaos monster in defense of all humanity! The judgment of souls in the underworld is another well-presented scene. Horus has a nice character arc. It ends with a worthwhile message from the gods to humanity. More importantly, it literally offers a thrill or two every 5 minutes for its entire duration. And unexpectedly, this film has no mummies whatsoever! I feel the culturally inaccurate casting issue, while perhaps regrettable, brought an undeserved sense of negativity about this film. In any event, these actors appeared to be 100% invested in making this film work, and they got the job done, in my opinion. We recommend that you set this concern aside and enjoy the many pleasures The Gods of Egypt offers--a no-expenses-spared B movie that presents striking and immersive visuals, appealing characters, and a clear understanding of its limitations and aspirations. I seriously don't understand the horrible reviews, and suppose that people who hated this film probably brought a preconceived negative expectation in with their popcorn. Give it a chance, there is much to enjoy in The Gods of Egypt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods of Egypt is so laughably bad that it's for sure entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt is definitely an entertaining movie, but in all the wrong ways. Almost everything about it is hysterically awful. You will laugh your ass off throughout the movie, not because of the "jokes" in the film, but because of the dialogue, the CGI, the acting, etc.The setting for the movie was to be it's strongest asset. When was the last time we got to see a movie set in Egyptian mythology? However, the movie does not do it's setting justice and people who like the mythology would be ashamed by how the movie interprets it.The dialogue for the movie is horrendous. Every single line is either an exposition line or a horribly unnatural and forced line. The characters are are all so one-dimensional, each seemingly having only one personality trait, and only a very small amount of characters undergo the tiniest bit of development. Because of this, we're given no reason to care about anyone. A good portion of the lines are so hilarious, not because they were funny, but because they're entertaining in the sense that people actually came up with this dialogue and others approved of it.Being a huge, high-budget, blockbuster action movie, you would think that it would be at least cool to look at. To be honest, the CGI and special effects are a mixed bag. Most of the time, everything looks awful. There is not a single shot in the movie which looks real and everything is so obviously green-screen. However, there are still a few CGI moments that don't look terrible. However, it doesn't make a movie good, it just means that there are some decent-looking effects in an otherwise garbage movie.I can't believe the talent behind the movie created such a piece of garbage. I would give it a 1, but the movie is so entertaining because of how bad it is, it gets a 3 purely because it's entertaining. Watch the movie if you're drunk at a party with friends but don't watch the movie because you want to watch an awesome, action-packed movie.</fullReview>

But watch able The landscape (both real and GCI) are beautiful and the gold is done very well. The characters could have done with a little fleshing out but not that bad. The writing does fall down flat mind - Isis committing suicide off screen is a bit much. It just smacks of lazy writing ( that no one has read about Isis and that no one had any idea of how she could be used) As well as missing out the Egyptian war gods (ok goddess : Neith and Menhit) yes Set does fall under that title but still it is a film about gods at war.On the positive this is one the best interpretation of Anubis and the afterlife ever done in film.Enjoy it for what it is Finally if you have any knowledge of the Egyptian myth then please try to leave it outside</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a waste of talent and time and extravagant dollars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt is meant to sell itself primarily on the visual effects spectacle - not unlike, going back some generations, to those dopey but entertaining special effects extravaganzas with work by Ray Harryhausen and featuring a stock of memorable creations amid a sea of lame-to-competent acting and direction. But now it's 2016 and with this movie, not even the CGI on 1990's XENA TV series (if you've ever seen that and know what I mean) was this cartoonishly awful. If it had been a SyFy channel movie I might accept it. As a 100+ million dollar extravaganza, it's almost a nightmare - too long (at 127 minutes it feels like 187), and it's got story turns and characters that... wait, what characters? This is the kind of movie that gives a major talent like Geoffrey Rush little to do but spout platitudes and be set on fire shooting at things.Some of this is so stupid I found myself laughing - a lot - but not in the places I'd think Proyas half expected people to do so. And no one, not even poor Gerard Butler, can get enough energy to possibly ham or camp it up, but the serious delivery doesn't allow for many rewards for the viewer looking for good OR bad movie fun. Most motivations are weak and things involving how this world works can sometimes turn on a dime and not make sense anymore (it'd take too long to go into some of the things that are not nitpicks but glaring, holy-s***-how-did-anyone-let-this-pass flaws), and despite a consistency to the look of the world and the characters, perhaps the director's only strong suit in coralling so many elements together, it's all for a story and heroes/villains/Gods/side Gods/hot-Goddesses that is dead on arrival.What have you lizard people done with Alex Proyas?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing CG Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, that is why I felt empathy for him being associated with such a bad film. The amount of CG used in the movie was staggering, even taking into consideration that the world was mostly make believe. No effort was taken to use any tangible locations. I do have to give a little credit to all the actors, considering they most likely spent day after day filming in front of a green screen. The amount of CG was one thing and the poor CG quality was another. Coaster-Waldau, although solid, could not carry the entire film. The rest of the actors were indistinguishable and generally poor. The plot was uncomplicated, predictable, and bland. The premise of the movie was sound, it just wasn't executed competently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a bit more effort it could have been decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the opening scenes began, I could not help but sneer at the prospect of the calamity I assumed this film would be from what the trailer left to interpretation. And indeed with the musical score, I could not help but wonder if Gods of Egypt was meant to be an epic disaster of biblical proportions meant to amuse the greats of cinema in the afterlife...But at the end of it, I could not help pondering if this could have not been done better with a bit more effort. No, not money - enough was thrown at it - probably a lot to have Gerald Butler to do his usual business of grunting and flexing his biceps and swinging some weapon, no doubt; certainly a substantial part of the budget must have gone to Victoria's Secret to scantily, but tastefully, clad the goddesses on the screen and of course the most impressive chunk (and here we can see a job well done) on the beautification and the glitz that at the end of the movie is meant to seductively lure us under the impression that it was worth spending our budget on the movie ticket rather than on a bigger flower bouquet for mum. Certainly, a humble amount of the film's budget must have been handed over to a poor conservatory student, probably in a back alley transaction, who at the last minute presumably copy-pasted together music from proper epics. Honestly, the score was so severely mismatched at times with the events going on, one had to be left wondering if this film was not meant as a parody. And no expense must have been spared for the poor script.Alas, the only impressive element of the film remain its visuals. Every single scene, the viewers can expect to feast their eyes on the glittering images of a mythical Egypt, they can maybe feel themselves transposed to those beautifully rendered astral plains and to the vast bleakness of the underworld. The visuals helped convey the mood of a place or of a scene far better than the clearly placid effort of all the eye candy on set. Not meant to be disrespectful, but either for lack of better judgment, or sheer laziness, none of the actors seemed to do more than recite their lines as if in a school play written by the 2nd graders. Maybe they were hoping the CGI would mask their shortcomings? No, the greatest problem was not the acting - nobody would expect Shakespeare to pour into our ear from such a film, but the dialogue was simply atrociously puerile - hence my comparison to a school play. There were clear attempts at humor and grandeur alike - none of which can impress the adult audience Gods of Egypt was meant for. I mean, a few more polysyllabic words could not have hurt.It was somewhat captivating, but this was not owed to good storytelling, as much as to seductive visuals. With a proper script, I am certain it would not have been slashed by critics. Had it been made into an animation and intended for a young audience, the producers could have even gotten away with the dialogue and the dull tale. The premise of the film was intriguing enough and there was obviously some didactic purpose to it, but there was not much to go on and the execution was lacking in several aspects. As an animation, it might have even been good and very welcome. But since this is not the case, this film has succeeded only in following along the line of numerous other blockbusters which give the critics pen fodder, which entertain us and remove us for their two hours from our dreary existence and once the experience is over, it's time to move on with business as usual. Gods of Egypt will leave no durable impression on viewers or on cinema in general and it will be forgotten along with all films of its kind.All in all, it took itself too seriously when it was supposed to laugh at itself and was too self- deprecating when it should have been serious. Not recommended for cinephiles, for those looking for depth in films or simply for fans of good acting. But if you enjoy escapism or just take a kick out of seeing Gerard Butler grunt and flex, go ahead, you will not be (that) sorry. Oh, and there was a love story in there somewhere... it probably meant to be a star-crossed lovers type of deal, but it was just as uninspired as the rest. Have a nice viewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In truth, I was expecting a horrible movie. And in that way the movie definitely did no disappoint. But to be honest I kind of didn't even expect it to be this awful. The acting is just....oh my god. I just felt awkward. Direction was complete horror. Story was not at all interesting, and the CGI was just so bad it's ridiculous. But if you want a movie to make fun of and cry your eyes out of pure stupidity, than you should definitely watch it. Otherwise, just... Don't. If you have any kind of a good opinion on Nikolaj and Gerard. And Geoffrey Rush. Any of the actors in it. Just avoid it. For the love of god, run away from it. Many people were trying to defend it in a way that it's a ''fantasy movie is supposed to be that way''. OH MY GOD THAT IS NOT TRUE. Cause that just says that every fantasy movie is supposed to be bad?! Come on people..... Wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods of EgyptThe upside to a bird-headed god is they're easily appeased with a bucket of mice guts.Mind you, the falcon-faced deity in this action-fantasy movie would rather devour his nemesis.When the immortal Set (Gerard Butler) assassinates Osiris (Bryan Brown), the King of Egypt, and declares a new tax on all souls passing over into the afterlife, the avian lord Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) partners with a street urchin, Bek (Brenton Thwaites), who has intimate knowledge of his enemy's booby-trapped compound.But, in exchange, for helping him, Bek needs Horus' aid in retrieving his love (Courtney Eaton) from the afterworld. Inlaid with overblown special effects and abysmal performances from a fair-skinned cast, this whitewashed construct of an alternative Egypt is grossly inaccurate, insulting and inane all at the same time.Furthermore, with all of their internal organs removed, Egyptians had plenty of room to store spare change for any afterlife tolls.

Some of the acting and script wasn't the greatest. But on a basic level it was fine. Geoffrey Rush has made a couple of poor choices in movies recently but I think he may be beginning to suffer the Hollywood lack for any decent older characters. Honestly I got the feeling he hated doing this movie. The battle with the beast of the darkness was the worst. Clearly the stole a sandworm from Dune. Could have been much more inventive. Lastly the special effects were poor. The oh so obvious CGI looked about 3 generations old. But did I basically enjoy the ride. Yes!. All one can ask.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am a big Gerard butler fan I am not however a fan of this film. One the story was too convoluted to be desired, and the fact that Geoffrey rush was playing rah himself offered no comfort to his character. All I could see was a pirate from his last movie. Brendan Thwaites was not in my vocabulary a very good actor. His talent lies in watching others, to how they react rather than immersing himself into the character role. It was almost as if he was being cued to speak for his part. Gods of Egypt in my view is not the best filler for any kind of weather or season it just isn't a believable film. Alex too needed to go over most if not all of the films content. The choppy reactionary framing, and some abstract takes made it very confusing in some ways. All in all... just one among many from summit that has to clean out their closets.</fullReview>

After a while, we got pulled in the movie somehow and enjoyed watching it except some cliché love dialogues here and there.It's got what it takes for a movie, good acting, coherent scenario, no surprises with a good guys win ending.I am sure action lovers will definitely love this movie and others would enjoy it.

		<fullReview>The movie tells a meaningful story while showing the beauty of Ancient Egypt and the richness of its culture. You get to meet great characters with amazing personalities and gods that change the way they think, because of their "mortal slaves". The setting of the film is created to take your breath and take you on a journey across the desolated deserts, going into the deepest jungles and then through the most populated parts of ancient towns. The beautiful relationship between Bek and Zaya will make you rethink what you know about the limits of love. Set's desire for power and his attitude towards his own nephew Horus will show you that times change as well as people's standards. The movie is definitely a must-watch even for viewers that are not into action or fantasy, because they will be left speechless by the personalities that they would meet during their 3D visit to Egypt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have to say that when I first saw the trailer I thought that this movie would be a pile of sh**. But I went to see it on a whim and I'm actually really happy that I did. The movie is a kind of fun adventure- it's not perfect, and its very stereotypical in terms of story and character development, but the visuals, the character looks and costumes are actually pretty cool and leave you wanting more.I'm actually really tempted to see this movie again.While the 'white casting' at times was ridiculous- the acting is pretty good and helps you get over that fact. (for instance Geoffry rush looks more like he's dressing up as a Chinese person with a long kong fu braid than an Egyptian- but he does a really good job, so you kind of chuckle/ roll your eyes the first second you see him, but 2 seconds later his acting kicks in and you like him.)So to sum it all- if you're looking for a cute light film with great effects- go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas's return to directing following a 7 year hiatus couldn't have come at a worse time. Just as the film industry was up in arms about the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Gods of Egypt arrived in cinemas boasting a near-all Caucasian cast despite being set in Africa. The demand for diversity in Hollywood duly followed, and rightly so, but the questionable casting isn't even the worst thing about the film. Gods of Egypt is a bloated, garish and nonsensical piece of trash, the cinematic equivalent of Raheem Sterling's bathroom. Is this really the same visionary who brought us The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998)?Sadly it is, and it completes a steady quality decline in Proyas's output which began in 2004 with his middle-finger to Isaac Asimov, I, Robot. On paper, the big-budget tale of Gods living amongst humans battling it out for the throne may seem like the perfect the opportunity for some campy, brain-on-auto-pilot fun. However, it fails to even offer any sort of camp appeal due to a cast either gobbled up by the video-game cutaway special effects or so utterly devoid of charisma. The main offender is Brenton Thwaites, a young actor who looks like he's been custom-built to appeal to any teenage girls in the crowd. He plays Bek, a human living in a thriving Egypt governed by ten-foot Gods, and sadly he is our protagonist.Bek, along with his pretty girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton), witnesses the handing-over of the crown from the abdicating Osiris (Bryan Brown) to his dashing and popular son Horus (Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau). The coronation is rudely interrupted by Osiris's uncle Set (Gerard Butler), who feels that the time has come for him to rule, killing his brother and ripping out his poor nephew's eyes in front of a terrified crowd. With the Egyptians forced into slavery to satisfy Set's greed and vanity, Bek, a talented thief, swipes the plans to Set's vault in the hope of stealing back Horus's eyes and assisting him in defeating his uncle. But when Zaya is killed after the successful theft, Bek strikes a deal with Horus to help guide him through Set's pyramid in exchange for returning Zaya from the underworld.The main question lingering over the head of Gods of Egypt is why was this film made? For a modern blockbuster from a talented director, the film lacks maturity and brains. For a film possibly designed to appeal to fans of explosion-heavy sci-fi/fantasy extravaganzas such as Michael Bay's Transformers franchise, the CGI is often embarrassingly bad. And for anybody hoping for a throwback to the kitschy B-movies of the 1950's and 60's, where giant monsters and grotesque gods mingled with us puny humans, you will find more charm in one frame of any movie involving the work of Ray Harryhausen than you will for the entire 2 hours of Gods of Egypt. The whole thing just feels oddly out of place, paling in comparison to even the most sickly of recent CGI-fests. Re-telling essentially the exact same story told a thousand times since Homer put ink to paper, this could be re-titled as A Simpleton's Guide to the Hero's Quest. Utter tripe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I guess I'm a diseased vulture then...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films that are so bad they're good and then there are films that are so bad they're just bad. Gods of Egypt very much falls into the latter because it really is just an awful film. Weirdly, I'd been anticipating this film for a while and it's finally arrived in the UK, a whole four months after its release across the pond.Although I'd heard nothing but bad things about Gods of Egypt, I was always keen to see for myself whether it was actually that bad. Alex Proyas, the director of this film, came out in defence of his work and described modern day critics as 'diseased vultures pecking at the bones of a dying carcass' back when the film was originally slated by critics who got to see this total mess four months ago.Here I would normally give a brief rundown of the plot however, due to the scattershot nature of this film's plot, I will try my best to keep it as brief as possible. Betrayed and exiled by his uncle Set (Gerard Butler), Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is a god who was to be crowned the new King of Egypt. Under Set's reign, Egypt descends into chaos and human Bek (Brenton Thwaites) takes it upon himself to find Horus and persuade him to return and defeat Set to regain his rightful place as the King of Egypt.I can't stress enough just how embarrassing every aspect of this film is. For starters, there is not one actor who gives anything resembling a good performance, whether it be Gerard Butler as Set or Geoffrey Rush, yes Geoffrey Rush, as Ra. I've never really been majorly impressed with Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau in Game of Thrones and he does nothing that could possibly change my mind in Gods of Egypt.Elodie Young is in the same boat in the way that she never impressed me too much in Daredevil and she's not very good here either. The worst of the bunch though has got to be Brenton Thwaites as Bek, who has more or less the same delivery for every emotion; utterly emotionless.Then comes the writing...Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless are a writing duo who haven't written a well received film yet in their three attempts. This is the only film of theirs I've seen and if this is anything to go by, I will be avoiding Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter. The dialogue is so laughably bad throughout the entire film and the story jumps from scene to scene with no cohesion whatsoever. I don't think I've seen a film where I've laughed at nearly every single line before.Alex Proyas, judging from his comments about critics, is not a man who can take any criticism lightly. I would be able to describe Proyas as a style over substance director if the visuals were any good but they just aren't. For a film with a $140 million budget, you'd think they'd at least be able to make it look good. It makes me wonder whether they just blew all of the budget on the cast. Gods of Egypt feels like you're watching someone play a shoddy video game rather erratically, particularly during the fight scenes where Peter Menzies Jr.'s cinematography will leave you dizzy and wanting the sick bucket.Are there any positives I can take from Gods of Egypt? Marco Beltrami's score was probably the best thing about this film and oh, the film did finish eventually which was a bonus. I felt exhausted as I left the cinema because the film is far too long at just over two hours, it becomes a chore to watch, especially when going in to the cinema thinking it was going to be just an hour and a half long.As of now, Gods of Egypt has surprisingly made a profit on its budget. Not a profit the studio would be hoping for though, coming in at a measly $2 million. Sounds stupid to say that's a measly amount however, in today's market, that's an amount that could well see careers end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the good old times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm truly divided when it comes to reviewing this movie. First of all it's not a good movie, the acting was cheesy, the characters are beyond annoying, 80% is CGI/green screen, the story/script is half baked and the tone of the movie jumps from comedy to action to drama. But damn what did I have a good time watching this. Now LET ME EXPLAIN!!Most of you all know that I'm a man of nostalgia. I love things that can pull my nostalgia strings &#xf04a; and boy did this movie do that and in spades. Why you may ask? Well let me tell you. Movies these days, good or bad, have become too serious and gritty, which isn't a bad thing. However, because of this I've noticed that a specific genre of movies have been dying out. Namely, fun adventure movies, or fun action flicks or just fun movies. How long has it been since you've seen an action movie in the vein of demolition man, commando, or (to stay in the theme of the movie) the mummy. Movies that can take you on an adventure and not take itself too seriously without emphasizing the humor.DAMN Henny you're OLD!! That may be the case, but let me ask you (everyone older than 25 :P ) don't you miss fun movies? Movies with one liners, adventures with ridiculous plots, a basic message like "be good", and just have a good time watching it? NO? Hmmm . Well I do miss it and this movie brought me back to that time when these movies were the standard and not the exception.Gods of Egypt hearkens back to a time of simpler movie making. A homage to the times of old. However, the question remains if this was the intention of the director. If it is I find it surprising that Alex Proyas, one of the founders of gritty and serious movies like The Crow and Dark City would make something like this.Now let me sum it all up and quickly end this review (since everyone thinks that my reviews are too long).The story: The movie is about the Egyptian gods of old and during a coronation of the god Horus (aka the protagonist) his uncle staged a coup d'etat and took the kingdom and his eyes away from him. After that we follow a mortal boy named Beck (sidekick) whom steals the eyes back. And together they go on an adventure to take revenge.The bad: I've already summed up most of the bad in the introduction. What I do want to add is that the movie is too long: 2 hours. It was hard to keep my attention. I would cut 30 minutes from it. The movie also wasn't balanced, switching from a slow pace to a fast face. They should have cut some of the action and spend more time on character development and MYTHOLOGY building.The good: It was fun for the most part but it is a shame that they didn't make the script more compact. I truly liked the cinematography (even though it was mostly cgi). But I especially liked the design of the movie. I thought it was original how they have given the mythological creatures form. And I truly liked the cheesy performance of every character (except the sidekick).Three-Act-Structure: The movie has a fun interesting beginning, lazy middle, and an acceptable ending.So should I recommend this movie? Absolutely NOT. If you truly want to visit the good old times just re-watch the old movies. This was fun for me since I had nothing better to do but it isn't worth your time.I'm feeling generous today and I'll give this movie a: 5.5</fullReview>

It looked great and have seen Immortals (2011) which I really liked I was looking forward for another flick about the Gods of Egypt. Sadly it wasn't my thing at all. Not that I was bored or whatsoever but it was clearly made for everybody. No gore or nudity to see.I mean, in the beginning there's a murder going on with stabbing, you can see the knife going in the flesh but no blood, when he wipes his knife clean there's no spot of blood to wipe. And we do have a love scene and the so-called queen is indeed undressed but it's all filmed without showing a thing. Further the CGI used is really good but not that superb because sometimes you could easily spot the key used to fill in the picture. Also the Gods are shown on a strange way, some faces are correct with history but Ra sitting on a ship and stuff like that, just look at Egypt itself. Where is the dessert? For me it was more a story like the old Sinbad flicks or even the Clash Of The Titans flick(s). An immortal helping 1 God to fight against his brother God and yes, there are monsters around to defeat. So if you think it's truth to history it isn't, it's a pure fantasy flick.

		<fullReview>To put it simply, it's an entertaining movie if you have a little time to waste.Yes, many elements are bad. The CGI is over the top and varies in quality. The acting is uneven, but that's mostly a result of poor writing. However, it still manages to be fun.Gerard Butler steals the show with his depiction of the evil Set. He's just having so much fun, and he's invested in the role. Every time he's on screen you can't help but feel a little testosterone pumping.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is an adequate Horus. It's a typical fallen hero's journey where he has to discover himself, but in the mythical Egyptian setting it works and doesn't feel overly cliché.Brenton Thwaites, who I really liked in The Signal, did a great job with the material he was provided. He was also quite invested in the role which helps add credibility to a world that is mostly comprised of CGI backdrops.The action is mostly computer generated set pieces, but it's fairly well done. I was never straining my eyes to figure out was going on like Jupiter Ascending where they just throw CGI at the screen and expect you to figure it out.I really like the idea of taking mythological stories and turning them into super hero films. After all, Gods are the original super heroes. I would really like to see more films like this rather than "the true story behind the myth" kind of thing. However, they might have to take things just a bit more seriously if they're going to attract a bigger audience and get a better rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen quite a few movies this year and I have finally seen a film that is just truly awful and just hilariously bad. The premise of the film sees mortal Beck having to get the help from disgraced god horas to stop the evil king set and save his true love. Now to start the actors that play horas and Beck didn't have any chemistry between them and neither performance was interesting at all. I especially found Beck annoying which means when I was meant to care about him I just didn't. Gerard butler plays the villain set and even though he is totally cliché and over the top he was easily the most entertaining part of this film. Chadwick boseman played black panther brilliantly in captain America civil war but he was just a cartoon in this film even though like butler he was pretty entertaining. Elodie young fresh off playing elektra in daredevil season 2 doesn't have much to do in this film and her character comes across as unnecessary. Becs girlfriend also has no character and is just an attractive girl with not loads of acting talent. The story is as basic and generic as you can get, there is no uniqueness to the story and everything involved and you have seen it all before. The script has some pretty cringe worthy dialogue that comes across as forced whether it be dramatic or humorous. The style has some of the worst cgi I have ever seen and it is pretty clear that the budget for the film just wasn't big enough for what they wanted to do. Overall this film is really bad and just not worth your time.</fullReview>

The script is very sub-par that could have been written by any grade school student. The acting is so ridiculous, it may as well been cartoon characters. The direction? What direction? The only exception would probably be the CGI, but there is so much of it, that it just all merges into the background and becomes peripheral. The movie is just horrendous.If you are going to spend $140 million dollars to make a movie, they really have to start with the script. Pay some attention to the writing, and have a story. Clearly, this movie started with the idea of flashy gods, named stars, women in revealing clothes, and only after did they hire a couple of yahoos to pen the story as an afterthought. Don't pay to see this tripe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad CGI and lame story combined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt has produced with massive 140 000 dollar budget. Partly you can see it on set, but the scenery looks many times shockingly lame and unnatural. It is a big surprise, that it looks just made in studio like movie. It just doesn't feel natural at all. Maybe it is a director's way to see the agent Egypt, but to me it felt almost like B-movie set. Story is quite predictable and not even script satisfy me. Movie rely on too much for digital effects and scenery. As it is a digital rumble effect movie it is not too bad, but I myself like too much of agent Egypt mythology to enjoy this movie story. If you enjoy CGI-effects and don't bother so much of the story you may find this movie entertaining. It remind me of Clash of Titans movies. Lot of action but not much content. You can watch this quite easily, but it wont offer you much of it's story line. It is one of those "don't bring your brains with" like movie. And of course it is a must to see from big screen. From television it has nothing to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was invited by a friend to watch this in a movie theater. I haven't seen the trailer, although I knew Butler was in this, and given the movie's name...I was a little skeptical about the whole idea especially with the director of the Crow involved (talk about a weird combo). The movie was OK, it didn't feel like a waste of time. It has big problems though. 1. CGI overkill, it wasn't bad but I'd still love to see more practical effects. 2. Story. Even though it had some creative ideas I enjoyed...overall the story was a huge mess. Movie often ignores its scenes and breaks its own rules just to get it going. 3. Characters. Some of them were really likable, yet cliché, but the ending pretty much destroyed all character development. 4. Action. There's a lot of it, but some scenes are shot in a way you can't understand what's going on. Like the Waterfall scene, check it out, I couldn't even count how many bad guys were there to begin with. 5. Editing, some scenes are incredibly rushed. Like it should've been longer, but got heavily stripped down. And it feels. It often cuts to a completely different location or situation just a second after something important. 6. Actors. Too many white actors, really. You can't have this much white people in an Egyptian mythos. 7. Ending. Movie tricked me into thinking the ending would actually be good, but then... I'd still recommend seeing this just to enjoy Elodie Yung as Hathor... damn, she's attractive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt was directed by Alex Proyas, the very same director that also brought us movies like The Crow, Dark City and I, Robot. While I liked at least two of those movies, I think Proyas has gone completely insane this time.Gods of Egypt is without a doubt, no matter how you approach it, one of the biggest turds of 2016 (bold statement). It is so dreadful that it looks like a spoof. It is so unintentionally bad in every possible way. It is actually physically impossible to mention all the things that sucked. So let us forget all about the shameless whitewashing, terrible CGI, cheesy plot, bad direction and utterly horrid and soulless depiction of Egyptian mythology and move straight to the fact that it less engaging than Meet the Spartans. It feels like a mature-themed movie for very small children, even aiming at a target audience younger than ten. But Proyas was unaware of this and boldly marketed it as fantasy for an adult audience.In the end, this movie should be graded one or maybe two out of ten. It is really, really bad. It is just so awful that it could have been directed by Tommy Wiseau or Uwe Boll. Enough said. Proyas should be ashamed of this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We don't really get enough adventures in movie form, I mean the Clash of the Titans I remember when young (the remake -er - nah). I love a good adventure movie and fantasy to boot. Here we had a slightly promising cast promising lush CGI and action. It was a fine enough mindless diversion with most attempts at humour falling flat, a few hitting. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau channeling his Game of Thrones Jamie character to a minor extent is hard not to approve of. Butler gives a normal day at the office enthusiasm with his Character, he's alright. Rufus Sewell, underused is a silly role. Chadwick (the new Black Panther) given little time for a curious character. Anyway the whole movie was curious and the extensive CGI used simply detracted from the movie. Some of it looked simply bad and not 2016 and equivalent to its budget. Came across as a mediocre 3 year old video game you could only watch. Had me actually pining for Immortals which is I think the movie of this style I've enjoyed most in the past few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very very clean filming. Cute story, and nice directing. I'm a person for action movies. One of the things I hate most, is film critics, hating on action movies, because they have only action to them. However I believe that when action movies are done well, they can be amazing. I didn't think this movie was done well. It wasn't even close to amazing. The after effects were great, but the green screens were completely visible, and the dialogue was extremely cliché. The story is awesome, and I predicted it all, but it's easy for me as a film student. Highly recommended for those who seek fun. For those who want beauty, you'll have to look somewhere else. SPOILER!SPOILER!SPOILER!SPOILER! The afterlife and Ra scenes were beautifully done, and kept me interested. So there's one good thing. I also liked the play on words with the fishing, and enjoyed the 300 style of the movie. The Gods' powers were also pretty cool</fullReview>

To those who want a better film than this , I'm sure there are lot more, but I just watched the Immortals(2011)and that film was better, in terms of action scenes and effects.And to the people who thought that this is a perfect representation of Egypt, please read a BOOK.</fullReview>

So if you like Mythical beasts and gods, give it a go, you may enjoy it, but if you want to see a decent film that's gripping and enjoyable, get a DVD and watch something else.</fullReview>

The fight between Horus and Set looked horrible. Some would argue that it is fantasy, not real. But it looks really bad.

		<fullReview>Director Alex Proyas can't seem to decide if he's creating an animated picture or a live-action film, yet he fully embraces this confusion with the excesses of his larger-than-life visual spectacles and deafening sound design, most of which are a struggle to take in.

You can't deny that this film does not delight you from start to finish.I sat there actually enjoying some of the movie: its grand-scale CGI, production and costumes, corny one-liners, razzle-dazzle action sequences, "love that transcends death itself" concept, etc. This is your generic "Hollywood popcorn movie", a movie that you can take your family to and that kids are bound to enjoy?pure escapism imprinted with pure gloss.Full review here: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/gods-of-Egypt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alex Proyas, the director of one of my favorite movies of all time, Dark City, is not a lucky guy. Forced to apologize for his casting choices, the marketing department has completely lost the plot in terms of how to pitch this movie to mainstream audiences, that most dumb fans are gonna end up missing what's a very fun ride at the local multiplex.Watched this on a 4k digital non IMAX screening on an IMAX screen. Missed opportunities indeed.Leave your brains at home, grab your favorite snack, find a decent IMAX 3d protection location, and enjoy this no- frills sword and sorcery men-on-a-(fantasy)-mission for what it is, especially when it also acts as a parody of the genre, intelligently too (at times).Butler and Coaster-Waldau (the latter, after 'Mama') know they're in here for their paycheck, and gave fun with what they're given, as doesGeoffrey Rush and the mistress of the 7 realms (more on her below). :-). The mismatched buddy pair-up is used heavily (and the pairs vary), and all the exchanges are infused with a kind of humor, juvenile for sure, but it makes the overall experience all the more light. Brenton Thwaites, fantastic in 'The Signal' and 'Oculus', is wasted here, and basically is used the way Sam Worthington's character was in the Titans movies (the 2nd one of which is superior to both the first remake, and this one too). Chadwick Boseman (the upcoming 'Black Panther', having also headlined the well-received Jackie Robinson biopic, '42') is under- utilized, but that's par for the course in a movie of this scale. Elodie Yung, soon to be seen as Elektra in TV Marvel's Daredevil, is one of the best things about the movie, with her character being the ultimate survivor of sorts, and yet retaining nobility in character. Not something easy to pull off, imho.Rufus Sewell, reuniting with his director after headlining the superb 'Dark city', has his job cut out, and, as always, like he has done with every thankless role he's done, he makes it his own.The makers cleverly get away with showcasing gory violence creatively. They also get away with a lot of other stuff, rarely covered in the mainstream, which makes for done viewing pleasure studying from tongue-in-cheek humor.One of the best sorts about the movie is the godly perspective, and how that's maintained consistently throughout (essentially, the motif 'we walk among giants', done much better here than Singer's failed attempt in 'Jack the giant killer').The score is one of the worst ever committed to film, and if the visuals weren't as spectacular as they were,I might've walked out.One of the motifs that fell apart so badly in 'FF4: ride of the silver surfer', that of the realm-devouring monster, for done strange reason, is used here, to similar effect. Could've been done without.For all of its flaws, an entertaining watch on the big screen, and doesn't deserve all the hate its been receiving. Yes, Proyas has made better movies, including the middling 'Knowing', but this one's way ahead of the Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay mainstream fare, and that's surely saying something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Average Sword and Sorcery Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has always suffered from a jaundiced perception of reality that creates discontent about its films, and "Dark City" director Alexis Proyas' superficial sword &amp; sorcery saga "Gods of Egypt" is the latest casualty. Anybody who followed the pre-release controversy surrounding this $140 million spectacle about Egyptian mythology knows that the pillars of political correctitude have criticized it savagely it for its largely all-white cast. Comparably, "Alien" director Ridley Scott contended with the same criticism of his Biblical epic "Exodus: Gods and Kings" for its essentially Caucasian cast. Scott claimed he couldn't find bankable actors of color or ethnicity to portray his characters so his film could recoup its multi-million dollar budget. "Gods of Egypt" director Alexis Proyas and Summit Entertainment, the studio that released this 127 minute movie, apologized about their whitewashed cast before the film's release. Nevertheless, this isn't the first time Hollywood has clashed with the politically correct about casting the appropriate actor and actress. Most recently, the botched fairy-tale fantasy "Pan" cast Mara Rooney as a Native American character when she was anything but Native American. Films better and worse than "Gods of Egypt" have drawn flak from the Politically Correct fraction. "Birth of a Nation," "Cleopatra," "Prince of Persia," "Argo," and "A Beautiful Mind" exemplify Hollywood films that violated the tenets of political correctness. Casting celebrity actors rather than unknown native counterparts to attract audiences is the main reason. Clark Gable was far from British when he starred in "Mutiny on the Bounty" back in 1935. Of course, a British actor would have been more credible, but Hollywood wanted a genuine star instead of an authentic Englishman. Hollywood concerns itself about making money more than abiding by political correctness. Occasionally, however, a Hollywood producer appeared, like Mel Gibson, who defied traditional casting protocol. In his adventure epic "Apocalypto" (2006), Gibson hired Native American actor Rudy Youngblood to play a Mayan warrior. Happily, Youngblood was conversant enough with speaking in Mayan to make the difference work. In "Gods of Egypt," Gerard Butler could have eliminated his Scottish accent, but the political incorrectness of his casting prompted neither Proyas nor Summit to recast another actor. Indeed, miscast as he is, Butler remains a highly sought-after actor and his bankability as a star enhanced the box office potential for this mythological melodrama.The larger-than-life exploits in "Gods of Egypt" occur before the dawn of dynastic history, and all of it is preposterously outlandish. "Dracula Untold" and "The Last Witch Hunter" scenarists Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless appropriated the Egyptian myth "The Contendings of Horus and Set" as their source material. Pitting the gods Set and Horus against each other with the throne of Egypt as the prize, Sazama and Sharpless have forged an above-average, often contrived, but nevertheless entertaining escapade. Indeed, they recycle familiar conventions, but they have enlivened these shenanigans with a surprise or two. Proyas, who also helmed "The Crow" and "I, Robot," never lets the pace slacken, and he stages some compelling close-quarters combat sequences. Of course, we know the young mortal heroine, Zaya (Courtney Eaton of "Mad Max: Fury Road"), never stands a chance of being condemned to death in the Underworld. Similarly, you also know the Egyptian Lord of the Air, Horus (Danish actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau of "Game of Thrones"), is going to reclaim his throne that his treacherous uncle, Set (Gerard Butler of "300"), took from him after he tore Horus' eyes out and forced him into exile. Not only did villainous Set steal the crown from Horus, but he also stabbed Horus' noble father Osiris (Bryan Brown of "FX") to death in front of everybody at Horus' coronation. Mind you, you need not avert your eyes because this lavishly produced, PG-13 rated movie depicts these depredations in a manner shouldn't offend anybody. Despite some grandiosely choreographed battle sequences, "Gods of Egypt" never wallows in blood and gore. Everything unfolds as our charismatic young hero, an "Aladdin" like thief named Bek (Brenton Thwaites of "Maleficent"), steals a dress for his gorgeous girlfriend, Zaya, so she can attend Horus' coronation in the height of fashion. After Set halts the coronation, murders Orisis, and then blinds Horus, Zaya finds herself enslaved to the evil Grand Architect Urshu (Rufus Sewell of "Dark City"), but she concocts a plan so Bek can steal back Horus' eyes and restore him to his rightful position as monarch. Urshu surprises them and kills poor Zaya with a well-aimed arrow. A desperate Bek appeals to Horus to save Zaya. The lofty Lord of the Air calculates that he can save her before she reaches the ninth gate of the Underworld. Secretly, Horus isn't being entirely truthful to Bek. Meantime, Horus' grandfather, the Sun God Ra (Geoffrey Rush of "Shine"), wages a never ending battle against a toothy titanic worm with which Set seeks to destroy Egypt so he can acquire immortality in life. Most of what occurs is stuff you've seen before in movies celebrating legendary Greek gods, such as "Clash of the Titans," "Wrath of the Titans," and "The Immortals." The Egyptian settings, however, add novelty to this narrative. The deserts of Australia stand-in splendidly for the Sahara Desert. The computer-generated imagery is truly exceptional, with some of the best 3-D effects. At times, when you are admiring some of these over-the-top shenanigans, "Gods of Egypt" feels like an awesome guilty pleasure. Despite its politically incorrect casting, "Gods of Egypt" qualifies as exciting from start to finish. The spectacular CGI laden effects are dazzling enough to compensate for its standard-issue, formulaic conventions. The shape-shifting gods who tower above mere mortals reminded me of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and the "Transformers" franchise. Some scenes that invite derision involve characters riding humongous, fire-breathing snakes or Set soaring above a battle in a sleigh pulled by giant scarab beetles. Sadly, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau emerges as a rather lackluster hero, while Butler overshadows him in every scene. Altogether, "Gods of Egypt" is lightweight but enjoyable hokum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and spectacular despite the whitewash casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this out of the way first: most Egyptian gods and the main character should not have been played by Caucasian (white) actors. I tried my very best to get beyond that, but it was jarring throughout and hurt suspension of disbelief. Most of the actors were fine though, especially Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones) playing Horus with sincerity and gravitas, but they simply didn't fit the place and the mythology (especially Osiris and Ra). Gerard Butler (Leonidas from 300) was playing the kind of role he's a natural for, warrior-leader in ancient times, but evil this time. As for the main hero couple - Bek, a blond human thief, and Zaya of the ample cleavage - I'd just say they were mediocre and could have been easily played by many other young actors. I did particularly like the role of the ambiguous goddess Hathor who, as a bonus, also looked more Egyptian than the rest of her pantheon.So enough with the casting controversy. Story-wise, it made the mistake of having an older main character narrate, which basically removed any suspense regarding his fate. In an ancient time before history, the Egyptian gods live among humans and rule. The benevolent king Osiris is about to hand over reign of the kingdom to his son Horus. Set, another god, arrives at the coronation, bad stuff happens, and everything is thrown into disarray. Bek, the previously mentioned thief, tries to steal something important (neat traps), loses something precious to him that he wants to regain, and eventually journeys with an exiled god or two. Unfortunately, plot-wise, I felt as if focus groups or someone somewhere ruined parts that could have been more memorable, especially the ending.The gods were shown a bit bigger and taller than mortals, and could transform into humanoid animals. It might seem a silly thing, but I liked the size differences, which made them instantly recognizable and more impressive. As for the creature forms, those of Horus and Set looked CGI, but I liked their design anyway. As for the other creatures, be they giant snakes or Anubis, they looked and moved great (with the exception of the scorpions). This movie reminded me of a throwback to the big and good adventure/fantasy movies of the 80s and 90s. It wasn't too complicated, it kept you entertained and looking forward to the next incident or encounter. Weirdly, even though "Gods of Egypt" sometimes had the nostalgic appeal of a film made in another decade (with modern special effects though) and went through familiar tropes, it also sometimes felt fresh (like the sand magic or the afterlife). It had a few clever touches (like the assistants of the god of wisdom) but also a few dumb elements ("good" idea to leave your companion alone with a bad guy on a platform elevator going up while you decide to climb the side of the pyramid instead).Most locations looked very good (for example the "ship" in the sky) and were quite varied. Visually, I found it marvellous, and I didn't mind or notice too much the computer roots . I loved the costumes and armors, certainly not historically-accurate, and the gods looked more than mortal without going over the top (despite the terrible casting). With a couple of exceptions (the chariot escape), I found the action scenes above average, even exciting. The fights were well choreographed, but I liked more when the fights involved the human actors somewhat, instead of just the metallic creature forms that kinda took you out of the setting.In that kind of movie, I want to vicariously travel to a different land, experience some wonder, and forget the real modern world for a little while. I also want to meet interesting, unconventional characters and be kept involved in the adventures even if they're not the most original. It especially needs some heart and sincerity to make the proceedings relatable, even if it's awkwardly done. For me, Gods of Egypt mostly succeeded in doing those things making it a decent entry in the maligned fantasy-adventure genre. It shouldn't be judged as a pure comedy, drama, action or romance film. I quite expect this movie to be savaged by the critics for casting (mostly), camp, lack of originality, CGI and what have you, but you know what? Overall, I had fun watching it and I would watch it again at home some time in the future. Not a lot of competition, but one of the better recent mythology-inspired films.Rating: 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One for the Gamers and lovers of spectacular action scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some strange reason I was wishing for a big budget over the top version of Land of the Pharaohs (1955), with a bit of Cleopatra (1963) and Jason and the Argonauts (1963) thrown in. And true to form, it came pretty close to the campiness of those films! Apart from the storyline, this spectacular action adventure sure delivers in the CGI department and creative sound design. It's one for the big screen and thumping speakers, insulting your senses in a most pleasurable masochist way.Director Alex Proyas mostly delves in dark films where "The End Is Nigh". These dark themes were noticeable in Spirits of the Air, Gremlins of the Clouds (1989), The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998). They even had it's moments in the Hollywood blockbusters I, Robot (2004) along with The Knowing (2009). With Gods of Egypt, it almost felt like it wasn't an Alex Proyas film. Maybe a bit too spectacular for his style, but he managed to fit moments in where he got to play with his dark-side, mostly evident in the "Afterlife" scenes. In this film, Alex got to create his vision with perfection, thanks to today's technology. Hopefully he'll be able to use that on his next project, maybe something a little darker, a bit more Proyas than Hollywood.What saved this film from its own corniness is the talent it attracted. Gerard Butler is perfect as Gerard Butler the brute! Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets to play around with his Game Of Thrones character, Jamie, by adding a little more manliness to it. The surprise of the lot was the mortal, Bek, played by the Aussie cutie, Brenton Thwaites. He supplied the wit and charm desperately needed in this. Even the Aussie icons, Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush came along for the ride. What they both managed to do was play it perfectly straight, in a theatrical way, that suited the style of this film. You noticed the tone of the film changed when Rush was on screen with Butler or Nikolaj. The level went up a notch, and it was momentarily intriguing. (And see if you can spot another Aussie icon, Bruce Spence:)The true winner of this epic film is the "Gamer". This film has all the elements a Gamer would love. It has dangerous mazes our heroes have to get through, and thrilling combating scenes captured by frantic maneuvering cameras. If the film does well at the box office I'm sure there will be a game following hot on its heels.I must admit I was surprised how entertaining this film was. Maybe because I saw it on the big screen and was distracted by the incredible CGI and sound design. The story was pleasing enough, it has the Game Of Thrones element where characters you least expected to perish did. There was the Lord Of The Rings journey and a bit of everything else you might have seen if you love your big action adventure films. And not to forget the romantic element which played heavily in our heroe's destination. I think the studio executives got ever audience angle covered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Gods of Egypt" (2016) is basically a bad Transformers movie set in Egypt. I know that doesn't make sense, not does this flick. It is so badly written, so overproduced that it started to drag in like first 15 opening minutes. Performances, if there were so, are just OK for this material, while Chadwick Boseman gave the best performance in this disastrous poor flick. Even the visuals in this movie were poor and not engaging, not involving. There is one nice action sequence during the whole damn movie, and it's the one with two some sort of huge snakes in the desert, everything else were just plain poor.Overall, "Gods of Egypt" is a very poorly made nonsense. I know it is a popcorn flick which you need to see with some beer and popcorn and some friends - but even that didn't help me to like this movie. Poor, poor flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man... just couldn't take it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movies lover, this "Gods of Egypt" thing just made me sick. This 2 hour torture session will make you leave your sit and hope you were just having a bad dream. The entire Egypt population has been whitewashed and turned into blue eyed blondies. It's OK, if you put history aside and just enjoy the ride, the problem is, this isn't even the biggest issue that makes Gods of Egypt such a flop. The CGI were just UNBEARABLE and it makes me wonder how any human being (or even gods) could think that this was OK to be released to public. If the visual effect supervisor ever get another job, it would be nothing less than a miracle.It was impossible to like any of the characters, also. I couldn't care less about those guys with such a bad acting on screen. The comic approach they've tried - maybe taking a hike in Marvel's successful action-comedy-light movies - didn't work here at all.In the end, established names as Gerard Butller and even a decent actor as Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) will eventually look back and think, "why did i ever do this?"Do your brain a favor and run away from this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything wrong with Hollywood in one film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, lets not mice words - Gods Of Egypt is garbage. It's cringe after cringe of the worst sins a film can commit, to the point where one wonders if they have tried on purpose to make the worst film they could.The Good:The costumes are gorgeous. If these costumes had been used in any other setting, they would really have helped in making a great film.More Leonidas than before. We can't get enough of that one character Gerald Butler played in 300, so we get a second helping here. The Bad:Massive CGI overload. It's not "bad CGI", but there is just so much of it, the eye notices more. Also, there's just more detail on screen than there is in the same objects in real life, making it super obvious.Horrible acting; the actors don't even attempt to fit the characters, aside form Butler, they just read their lines, which results in half the cast sounding like they just got out of Jersey Shore, and half trying to ham it up (FORGIVE ME FATHER, I HAVE OVERACTED !!).Despite what the title implies, AND the multiple mentions of Egypt, Gods Of Egypt is not set in Egypt, nor is it set in the past, but rather, this is a completely fictional film set into some parallel world with a limited resemblance of Egypt. The director seems influenced by small screen film, such as music videos; i find it hard to believe it's the same guy who directed the excellent Dark City.The script, worst guilty party in this film, tries to cram as much garbage on the screen as it possibly can .. i haven't seen something this bad since Episode I.The plot isn't as horrible as the rest of the film, but it is however overshadowed by the rest of the garbage piling up on top of it, such as, for example, the dialogue. One scene can have comedy, tragedy, action and violence, sadness, amazement, all crammed into the same 3 minutes.I suppose that, after all, Gods Of Egypt does have a few things going for it, some scenes are visually impressive, mostly due to the sh*tton of money they have thrown at the screen, but i can't count one which isn't spoiled by something, be it greenscreen, some actor chewing the scenery, horrible dialogue, or simply the constant, relentless abuse of CGI.So, Gods Of Egypt is garbage. If you are no older than 15, and you want to see a 2-hour video game cutscene (and also have very low standards for acting), then this film is for you; if you are older, or simply want to watch an actual film, properly made, then i suggest you skip this monstrosity.My vote: 4/10 - revolting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CGI fest for the children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big CGI, easily identifiable characters, name-drop a few Egyptian gods, more big CGI, and there you got it. Nothing about this movie is particularly good, but nothing is particularly bad either. The plot is easy enough for a 7-8 year old to understand, and the casting appears to be done to please the eyes of teen. The movie is honest in the way that it doesn't try to be anything more than a children's movie - which it is - and should therefore be watched as one.With that in mind it does a fairly good job of entertaining. If you want a fast paced CGI fest set in an imaginary Egypt, about love and morals, this movie might just be right for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and Exciting Movie that Still Got it ALL WRONG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh God, yet ANOTHER movie about a WHITEWASHED version of Egypt. Based on ancient Egyptian mythology, Gods of Egypt features the epic journey of a mortal named Bek to save his true love from death and rescue Egypt. Along the way, he is assisted by the god of the air, Horus, who is fighting against Set, the god of darkness who has proclaimed himself the rightful ruler of Egypt. This film has everything an eager movie goer could want: an out-of-this world plot, special effects, an epic setting (who doesn't like Ancient Egypt??), romance, thrill, humor, and sweeping music. YET...it is about as accurate as watching an ALL BLACK version of 300 (Spartan movie) or Gladiator. Hollywood would be in an uproar. I'm sorry but as much as I liked the movie, I couldn't feel at ease sitting and watching a BOLD-FACED LIE. The whole time I felt like I was in some sort of DELUDED Caucasian/Asian FANTASY of an Egypt without African roots. There were just too many subtly insulting scenes in the movie to mention, but the overall feeling I got from the film was a sense of European ego-centrism. The only significant black character is Thoth, the god of wisdom; couldn't even make one goddess a Black woman even though they were often the rulers of ancient Egypt. No, the actress playing Hathor, the goddess of love, only serves to propagate racist, mainstream standards of beauty (non-black beauty), even if she's NOT blond haired and blue eyed. The idiot producers in Hollywood haven't figured it out yet (or they have and just don't want to ADMIT it)! The ORIGINAL ancient Egyptians were NUBIANS, Africans and people of color. It wasn't until the Hittites and other Caucasian peoples completely invaded Egypt that it became the diluted Egypt of today (Read The Destruction of Black Civilization by Chancellor Williams). That's why there are these delusions with some Arabs/Asians having the audacity and arrogance to somehow assume they ONLY are the true Egyptians (or denying Africans are). Look at movies like The Mummy, etc. Some may dismiss this as an Afrocentric rant and say that color doesn't matter and all that BS. But as a person of African descent, it's a little annoying to constantly have OUR history INACCURATELY portrayed by people who don't really wish to acknowledge us in the first place. STOP hijacking our history and projecting yourself into EVERY area of history you think you can do so!!! Hey Hollywood and SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT, get a clue from DREAMWORKS and have some historical accuracy. Look The Prince of Egypt, Joseph King of Dreams, and even La Reine Soleil (produced by Cinemon Studios). They got it right, and those are ANIMATED movies. Oh but why wouldn't they want to use an all- black cast? Because most whites would never want to see it, as they LACK empathy for brown/black people, as proved in scientific studies. I wouldn't be surprised if half the people watching this movie wouldn't entertain the idea of a Black Egypt. No, not just one anomaly black pharaoh but a lineage of African rulers who spanned many dynasties. All- in-all, maybe the movie would be 10 stars if they got the BASICS right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lion King...wait.. wrong movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does this plot look familiar? Yes? Oh... that's right... that movie from 1994... what was it called... oh yes, the Lion King... nothing significant. The special effects of this movie are mostly great (with exception to whatever the heck they were thinking when they tried to portray the sun god known as Ra). The cast was surprisingly well suited to their roles (once again with the exception of Ra) and the acting was fairly well done despite the hint of cheese throughout the film. Egyptian mythology buffs will appreciate the interesting take on the myth about Osiris. While certain inaccuracies were inexcusable, many of them were just liberties taken out of uncertainty and that is what made this movie unique. If I had to compare this to another movie aside from the obvious plot steal, I would compare this to Immortals (feat Henry Cavil). Like that movie, the special effects were great, but there were things that just weren't right. Overall, it gets a 6 out of 10. 4 of these points are just for Gerard Butler as he was by far the best part about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've Been So Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been so much better. The ideas were there, the entertainment value was there, the visuals, the cast... but yet somehow the script looked like it had been written by someone who had no idea of how to finish on the same high note as the ideas on which the movie was based. And a number of moments in the movie, where simply waiting a few seconds longer, before delivering a line or switching to the next scene would have made all the difference between epic moments or stupidly rushed parts with resulting lost effect. And this last bit, they did a number of times during the movie. It was pitiful to see such potential go to waste. Alas...So, should you see the movie? Yes. Even though they missed and or simply messed up various opportunities for greatness, such as cobras as scary as and about the size of Godzilla dying way too easily; the movie has entertainment value. Just make sure you disengage your critical mind long enough, it'll work. And pray, that the high school teen who was lucky enough to have gotten his first draft made into a movie, has learned how to clean up his work, and that the weirdness between the directing and various badly timed delivery of lines which ruined what could've been epic moments, is figured out and solved by the time this crew puts out another project...</fullReview>

The special effects were impressive and since I am an ancient aliens fan I think the movie was as close as it could get fact wise based on the cast available. Discount the historical inaccuracies, it is an enjoyable movie that will have you doing research on Egyptian mythology. I will say this, the humor and one liners will have you thinking, yet it is the eye candy and fights that will keep you anticipating the next scene. Now the story line is as old as time itself, it worked for me because of the way the story line was presented.

		<shortDescription>Crude but Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire film industry has always had a fascination with sword- and-sandal action adventures. They're like the Velvet Underground of movie subgenres, they may never be popular in their own time but they inspire countless film professionals with their bountiful style, unorthodox special effects and simple but effective story- lines. Where would the world of special effects be without Ray Harryhausen's work on Jason and the Argonauts (1963)? Would we know the name Sergio Leone without the famed director first cutting his teeth on the peplum film The Last Days of Pompeii (1959)? I dare not put the ghastly Gods of Egypt in the same category as Conan the Barbarian (1982) or Clash of the Titans (1981) but I do put it a head above the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans.Mortal thief Bek (Thwaites) and his love Zaya (Eaton) are trusted into a web of palace intrigue after benevolent God Osiris (Brown) is struck down by his brother Set (Butler) in a public display of brutality meant to keep mortals and other Gods in line. Osiris's son Horus (Coster-Waldau) attempts to take vengeance but his magical eyes are plucked from his skull and he's banished. Bek steals one of the eyes from Set's newly constructed vault thus turning the wheels of the plot, ultimately resulting in a rematch between Horus and his uncle.As garish as the sets are and as conspicuous as the computer generated effects may be, the movie is not without its inner-logic which works if you forgive some minor missteps. The characters are weak and uninspired but they all have perfectly respectable character arcs. What's more the precious moments of mirth are genuine in a cheesy Flash Gordon (1980) kind of way. The first act borders on self-parody and the last act is a-clutter with mindless action yet in-spite of all this, I think I caught myself actually enjoying the movie a few times. Yes, believe it or not Gods of Egypt is not entirely irredeemable.Don't get me wrong; it's goofy, it's dumb and it's loud; it's whitewashed to the point of cultural insensitivity, and it surrenders to some occasionally unsettling themes but none of these factors are important when faced with the film's endgame; it's here to entertain, that's it. With a bar set that low, it's easy to find a lot to like. Those with a thirst for blood and sinew will be glad to know that despite a PG-13 rating, the film showcases a lot of gleeful violence and action. They get away with it only because the blood of the Gods is gold not red. I personally enjoyed the application of certain Ancient Egyptian mythology, especially moments involving Ra (Rush), the granddaddy of the Gods, pulling the sun across the sky in his celestial catamaran.Gods of Egypt cannot compare to the middling mythological epics of Italy circa 1950's. Heck, it can even compare to 300 (2006) which provided the template for so many of these goof-ball celebrations of male bravado. Director Alex Proyas knows the script for Gods of Egypt isn't exactly Shakespeare and maximizes all the points of entertainment while still telling a cogent tale. The results are crude but effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a mostly fun movie. A few bad bits of humor and cringe-worthy acting aside, Gods of Egypt is an action/adventure in the spirit of Immortals and Wrath of the Titans. The battle between Horus and Set is nothing short of spectacular skill and power. The story is simple enough, and serves as a launching pad for the character development and fights. Set was an intimidating and ruthless villain murdering his way across the world to impose his will upon it, and only Horus has the power to stop him. It dragged in parts but the film makes up for it with its exciting and explosive final showdown. Children will love this movie, and adults can appreciate a film that finally explores Egyptian mythology in a big budget story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Your journey has just begun." The God Horus (Coster-Waldau) Is just about to be crowned king of Egypt. Right before the crown is placed on his head his brother Set (Butler) attacks him and robs him of his powers. With Set in charge Egypt begins to crumble. When a mortal seeks to restore order there is only one person he can turn to, Horus. Now the two, God and man, must find a way to defeat Set and restore order to the once peaceful land. I have to begin by saying that I am not a huge fan of these types of movies. Never been that big into mythology and the epic BC movies have never really interested me all that much. I'm not sure if that had something to do with this or not but I didn't enjoy this movie at all. The dialog is awful, the story is confusing; mainly because it couldn't decide what it wanted to be. Part of it was mythology, part of it was sci- fi, in one scene Horus gets his eye back...then flies into outer space. The movie was all over the place and really the only reason to watch this is because it looks great and the special effects are pretty impressive, on the other hand if the movie is bad none of that matters.

		<fullReview>Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is set to rule Egypt from his father Osiris. Set (Gerard Butler) steals the throne killing his brother Osiris. Set defeats Horus, takes his eyes, and his bride Hathor. Set kills anyone who opposes him and enslaves humanity. Bek (Brenton Thwaites) is a mortal thief. He steals one of Horus' eyes but his love Zaya is killed. He makes a deal with Horus to return Zaya to the living after they defeat Set. With Hathor, Goddess of Love, and Thoth (Chadwick Boseman), God of Knowledge, they set off to answer the riddle of the sphinx.This is overloaded with CGI flash and grandeur. It's fun visually for awhile but by the end, it becomes more of the same. The climax becomes sound and fury that signifies nothing more than waiting for the end. The story is simple good versus evil. Gerard plays evil for all it's worth. Horus is selfish at the beginning. Quite frankly, Bek is also selfish. Bek and Zaya are not more than puppy love. There is no development. They are simply in love. The good guys aren't that compelling. The whitewashing controversy doesn't help either. This is not the worst but it's not worthwhile to defend either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605; - "the god of stupidity"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Alex Proyas, who's previously made great movies like The Crow, Dark City and I, Robot, comes one of the most hilariously terrible films of the last few years. It's not just that there's nothing good about Gods Of Egypt, it's that pretty much everything about it is horrendous.We start off introduced to the half-dozen main characters. Horus (Coster-Waldau) is the new king of Egypt, who immediately is unlikeable - the kind of king who doesn't care about his people, neither gods nor mortals. His uncle Set (Butler) murders Horus' father before he is crowned and becomes ruler instead, as one of the most under-written villains I can remember seeing, who seemingly has no motivations other than being a massive, massive jerk. Their (both Horus' and Set's) girlfriend Hathor (Yung), the goddess of love - by which I mean manipulation - has little to bring to the table. And the two humans, Zaya (Eaton) who is defined entirely by how low her dresses are cut, and Bek (Twaites), the self-proclaimed "god of stupidity", have an awkward romance born seemingly out of them being kind-hearted idiots.Even worse, the ridiculously shallow characters are brought to an even lower level by some of the most pathetic acting I've ever seen. Thwaites in particular is unbelievably irritating, and Chadwick Boseman as the god of wisdom, Thoth, is laughable. It genuinely feels like Proyas deliberately asked his cast to give their worst possible performances (with the possible exception of Geoffrey Rush).Before production, though, we have the screenplay to blame. Whereas the general premise of the movie is relatively intriguing, the dialogue is absolutely all over the place - not a single line is believable. There are a few interesting plot twists that are well executed, but then giant plot holes you could fit Ra's chariot through, and several eye-rubbingly preposterous set pieces so inconceivable you don't even know how to react.And as ever with movies like these, a lot of it relies on fantastic visuals. Which it doesn't have. At all. The sickening levels of CGI make it physically difficult to watch, especially during the manic action sequences where you struggle to comprehend who's doing what. Many of the landscape shots work pretty well, but then so much looks cheap, fuzzy and outdated (for example the gods' armour and Set's minotaur henchmen). Costumes are pretty good though.Proyas' heart is in the right place. He wanted to make a fun, dumb action movie, and succeeded with 50% of his aim. Some of the more imaginative elements are pretty intriguing, but literally everything else lets it down. It's so bad it's worth seeing, but I never once got bored!1/5</fullReview>

The behaviour of people (towards the Pharaoh) is maybe Hollywoodian but again has nothing to do with Egypt.

		<shortDescription>Good potential, bad cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally thought the movie was pretty good and has a lot of potential. It contains wild &amp; thrilling actions that keeps audiences excited. It also has a pretty good ending and story structure. What led to so many critics? There are several reasons to that. 1. It is silly. Not all actors did a great job on their role. Many characters don't seem to be emotionally affected during intense scenes. For example, at a scene were the main character's girl friend died. He seemed sad at first, and seemed to fully recover 30 seconds later... It is just too dramatic for an action movie like this. There were some scenes, where they are trying to be funny; however, it backfires by making it more silly2. Bad scripts. The wording and the things said in this movie are weird. It just seems weird that in Egypt there is a silly man talking with British accent. The way they talk are too modern. It shows no Egypt culture at all. For example, in one scene; they used the term "pirates" &amp; "ions". Those things didn't even exist back then. There are many more modern term used such as lettuce. It seems to that the characters are 21st century people with costumes on. 3. Bad character/costume choosing. Many actors did not fit well in the movie. Almost 90% of the gods in this movie are white people. No racism here! But they are suppose to be Egyptians; NOT Americans/British! The costume was also do not fit. Set, the fire god was dressed up like a Spartan in 300. Beck's girl friend was dressed up in a typical modern 21 century dress. The sun god Ra, was dressed up like a Pope. The god of knowledge was dressed in a Chinese style silk clothing. Silk didn't even exist back then! That just makes the movie even more silly!4. Plot with some flaws. There were some scenes or mircales that just happened without any previous explanations.5. Bad Special Effects. The special effect wasn't as bad as the movie "Kingsmen", but it isn't close to realistic. The special effects did show the 3D background. However, the lighting just seems weird and unreal. To me, it almost seemed like the stones were reflecting light. The only actor that did a great job was Gerard Butler. He was like the only serious character. I already expected that, since he did a great job on the movie 300 too. This film had a lot of potential, but was ruined by bad casting. Don't blame the director, he did a great job. If it wasn't for the bad casting, I thought it would have earned at least an 8/10 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I entered the theater I knew I would need to leave my brain at the door and sit there with popcorn enjoying a visually spectacular movie. And that's what I got. At first, the dialogue and acting were cheesy. Normally, it would continue like that. Well, somewhere along the way it either stopped being cheesy or I just didn't notice it anymore. By the time the movie ended I felt entertained. I didn't feel as if I had wasted time or money. So, for me, it was a good movie.Now on to the racial controversy. My question is why is there even a controversy about this? The movie takes place in an ALTERNATE Earth Egypt. I mean, the world is flat and Ra created everything. Seems silly to put out the effort to protest a movie that has no basis in history whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egyptian Mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Gods of Egypt", starring Brenton Thwaites-The Giver, Maleficent; Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau-Game of Thrones_tv, The Other Woman; Courtney Eaton-this is her second movie with her first one being Mad Max:Fury Road and Gerard Butler-Olympus Has Fallen_FYI:His sequel 'London Has Fallen' starts next week_Tomorrow Never Dies.This is a mythological adventure about the Gods of ancient Egypt. According to this version, the Gods live among the mere mortal humans in Egypt. Of course, they tower over the humans, standing at about 10 feet tall. I really liked the way they showed the contrast between their heights, whenever the Gods and humans were in the same scene.It looked pretty cool. Nikolaj plays Horus, the God of air, who is next in line to be king of Egypt. Gerard plays Set, the God of darkness and the current kings' brother and uncle to Nikolaj, who thinks that he should be the next king instead of his wimpy nephew. Brenton plays a mortal that is in love with Courtney, also a mortal, and they both get caught up in the Gods' battle over Egypt. I remember reading a lot of mythology back in high school-a looong time ago-and enjoying it a lot. I used to watch those old movies like 'Jason and the Argonauts', 'The Clash of the Titans' and 'Hercules'. Now there was some controversy about the casting of white actors in the Egyptian roles but I don't know, I still enjoyed the movie. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and some sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 7 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as people say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot has been said of this movie. Even before the release there seemed to be problems regarding the whitewashing of the cast, as there are isn't one Egyptian actor involved in the production.The trailers also did not inspire confidence, with some decidedly ropey CGI used. I was hoping that this was just because of the trailers early release. Unfortunately, although a lot of the CGI is excellent, there are still parts of the film that look like a game. This is a minor nit pick though, as it is a fantasy and you can't really expect realism with this type of film.Of the leads, Gerard Butler seems to be having the most fun as the villain Set. From his scenery chewing intro, where he rips out his nephew's eyes, he doesn't let up. He also uses his own accent in this. Unfortunately he cant seem to decide what his accent is anymore. Still, he is still great in the role.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, as the hero of the story Horus, is in great shape and plays the hero well, although the character can be a bit bland compared to Butler.Brenton Thwaites is decent enough but cant live up to the two leads. The supporting cast is filled with greats like Bryan Brown, Geoffrey Rush and Rufus Sewell (re-teaming with Proyas for the first time since 1998's Dark City), but are pretty much wasted in minor roles. Elodie Yung gets a bit more to do than the other cast members and Chadwick Boseman doesn't embarrass himself too much.As mentioned earlier, some of the CGI looks more like a video game, but kind off adds to the overall look of the film. I like the fact that Director Proyas seems to do his own thing here, and doesn't give his fantasy film the expected drab, dark look that so many fantasy's these days have. I like it when a Director doesn't go with the expected. Perhaps that is why the film is failing so much at the box office.</fullReview>

I can see why it bombed. This looks cheap and tacky and I ended up half reading and watching this movie This is a real "Alan Smithee" movie if ever I saw one. I know that I have to write more and to be honest I'm struggling. The special effects are dire the acting is worse. Having all white cast where blatantly they wouldn't/couldn't be. It actually reminds me of an episode of stargate SG1 where they ran out of budget and ideas. And apparently this is meant to have a sequel. Worrying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so much easier to write a horrible review than to explain why a movie is good. That said, this movie was good for me but I realize this movie may be an acquired taste and therefore, not up everyone's alley.If you keep the thought of Nephillim (google it) in the back of your head while watching, this movie is entertaining. I will agree with everyone else -- it's not at all historically accurate. It's a fantasy movie, it's not supposed to be realistic. So, if you're looking for an accurate representation, this movie isn't it. If you want to watch some creative plays on ancient themes, give this movie a chance. It's certainly different which is always a crap shoot in terms of guessing whether someone else will like it or not. I did but I'm into off the beaten path productions. If you like the occasional out there movie and don't walk into it with great expectations, this movie may be a good watch for you. I thought the characters and the bantering between them made this movie worth the watch. Contrary to many other reviews, I thought the height difference (you'll see) was perfect based on the historical assumption that they were 15 to 30 feet tall. I would recommend this movie when you're in the mood to escape from the usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be in de Nile! You know, damn well, this movie wasn't good. However, it's not as bad, as people make it out to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame, this movie wasn't as good as it could had been. It always looked like it would could had work. After all, this is the first time in a long time that Hollywood is showing the mythological side of the Ancient Egypt that has nothing to do with Curses or Mummies. Because of that, the premise of this film does sounded reasonably cool. Plus, I like how the movie is based on the Osiris myth. That myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris (Bryan Brown) by his brother, Set (Gerard Butler), wanting to be primeval king of Egypt, with the remainder of the story focuses on Osiris's son, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) trying to capture the throne, and restore order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign. While, this myth is best known for its complex symbolism, which is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. The consequences of this clumsy retelling is that the audience got very confused. After all, not a lot of people know, of this story, nor does a lot of people know, how to even show this story. In their defense, I have to say, director Alex Proyas and his staff of writers and filmmakers did alright job in world-building. Yes, they made no attempt at historical accuracy, but as a fantasy movie, it somewhat works. The movie's world was indeed, unique to look at. However, there were some really jarring choices that I wish, they didn't do, such as focusing too much on the extreme action and huge fake-looking green-screen set pieces, rather than making the story seem like it kinda makes sense. At times the action resembles elements of an old school video game. After all, whenever, the deities fight in this movie, its fast mix with slow motion flying shots is essentially ripping off, 2008's film 'Iron Man' with of 2013's film 'Man of Steel'. It made the film seem so far-fetched and ridiculous, than realistic. I lost count on how many plot holes and unexplained story elements were present within this movie. Also, it seem that they cut a lot of things, out of the Osiris myth, like the whole idea of the story being about Osiris's resurrection. Instead, the filmmakers change it, by having a mortal thief, Bek, (Brenton Thwaites) seeking resurrection for his dead lover, Zaya (Courtney Eaton) by helping Horus recaptured the throne, before she gets judge in the underworld for the chance for afterlife. In my opinion, I found this added element to the story to be the weakest part. It's not like the mixer of mortal characters and the deities couldn't work, it's just the fact, that they made the deities so much, larger in height than the human characters. It's not like the 'Lord of the Ring' films (2001-2003) which only show the height different between the hobbits with other creatures, so rarely. In this film, the humans follow the much larger Gods, in every scene in the film. It's so distracting. Like the artificial-looking CGI backgrounds, it really took me out of the movie. I would rather, have the human characters, be the same size as the Gods. Another thing that bug me about this film is the white-wash of the Egyptian culture. There is barely any African, Arabic or Egyptian actors in this film at all. Honestly, what is a Scottish, Danish, and Australian crew of actors, doing in a movie, based in Egyptian mythological!? At least, get actors that look like, they are from that area like, they did, for 1994's Sci-Fi film 'Stargate'. It would have made a little more sense, than what we got here. Also, the acting in this movie from them, wasn't the best, since their characters weren't that fresh out to begin with. Everybody is one-dimensional as hell, and have little to no depth whatever. Yes, they did, try some character development with Horus and Bek, on learning to work with each other, but it come off, as underdeveloped. At least, the movie didn't add the myth part, where Osiris's wife, Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. Now, that's creepy. Also, at least, the music by Marco Beltrami was entertaining, even if it's sounds so generic. Overall: While, I will give it kudos for being ambitious and trying something, "different". In the end, all of the people that work on this film, work seem mediocre, as well. It's pretty bad. But there are some bad movies that are at least enjoyably so; we can derive pleasure from them even as we understand they're not the craft at its finest, and in some ways, 'Gods of Egypt' can at least fall into that category. I can't recommend seeing it, but if you do, it's somewhat watchable. Go see the movie for yourself and make your own educated opinion. If you like cheesy fantasy movies, then you will enjoy this flick.</fullReview>

The visual effects, visual of mythological legends and familiar faces in leading roles makes this movie at least fun to watch. But i really think that it could be better, at least story-wise. The movie has such a great idea in itself and in my opinion they didn't use it so well. If they would, there could even be a series of great films. Storyline was so simple and we've seen so many films like this before. You wouldn't regret watching it, but don't get so hyped. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is exactly what I had expected. Egyptian mythology brought to life o the big screen with Gerard Butler as a bad guy.The trailer makes it look like Transformers mixed with Clash of the Titans. However, I was pleasantly surprised since it had more fantastically elements than sci-fi. Butler is great as a villain and chews every scene he is in. The dynamic between Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's Horus and Brenton Thwaites's Bek helps the plot roll along nicely; though nothing deep develops (but come on, this is not your typical bromance; it's a god and a mortal). And surprise for Cambodian fans, Hathor is played by a half French, half Cambodian, and she is captivating on screen tool. It helps that Thwaites' character's love interest is lovely too. In short, the movie is not short on visuals. It also has plenty of action and 2 hours run time does not feel long at all. Also, where else can you see gods bleeding gold, and their body parts turn to diamonds. Cool fantasy stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Tale Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciated this movie most of all because it didn't feel like a retread (or copies) of so many others that are shown today. So you have gods that live with the locals, one of whom is King of Egypt. His brother (the antagonist) takes over the day the current king's son is supposed to take over for his father. So things go downhill for the other gods and the Egyptian people from there.Along with this you have 2 young lovers who are caught up in mortal peril, and one fights to save his love from the gates of eternal death, and will go through everything to save her.Yes, there are some corny parts, but also some humorous ones. At times the acting could have been better, but I thought that overall it was an enjoyable tale. I watched the 3D version and thought it helped enhance the larger landscape elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'GODS OF Egypt': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Big budget action-fantasy flick, from director Alex Proyas (the man who also helmed such beloved fantasy hits as 'DARK CITY', 'KNOWING', 'I, ROBOT' and 'THE CROW'). It was written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (the duo that also co-wrote such other mythical fantasy flicks as 'DRACULA UNTOLD' and 'THE LAST WITCH HUNTER'). The movie notoriously stars a mostly white cast of actors, as Egyptian gods and mortals: that are battling for all of Egypt. The cast includes Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Elodie Yung, Courtney Eaton, Geoffrey Rush, Bryan Brown, Rufus Sewell (who also starred in 'DARK CITY') and Chadwick Boseman (the one cast member of African decent). Despite being cheesy, and over-the-top, I mostly enjoyed the film. The story is set in a fictional Ancient Egypt; where the god Horus (Coster-Waldau) is about to be crowned the king of all of Egypt. Then Horus's vengeful uncle, Set (Butler), kills Horus's father, Osiris (Brown), and steals Horus's eyes; while taking the throne for himself. He plunges the peaceful Egypt into a world of darkness; where citizens must pay their way into the afterlife. A mortal thief, Bek (Thwaites), teams with Horus; to stop Set, and restore Egypt to it's past greatness. Proyas is a very talented director, and he doesn't disappoint here; the script could have used a little more work, but the movie is still a lot of fun. It's entertaining, action-packed and filled with colorful visuals. The performances are all decent enough, but it would have been nice to see a lot more ethnic diversity (if the studio would have just banked on more minority actors). Proyas has listed many reasons (why it was financially safer) to cast the actors he did. If you can overlook that racist injustice, the movie isn't that bad (it's mostly entertaining). Fans of the genre should get a kick out of it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U</fullReview>

So if you would see this Rating, you would know, that this is nothing serious, and maybe nothing for you, something like the Sindbad-Movies that you liked as a Teenager.

		<shortDescription>Egypt Jam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is not correctly categorized by IMDb, as it is an animation movie. Most of it looks like a Space Jam or Mary Poppins kind of movie but without the acting. Live actors play on animated (not even cgi! to me) backgrounds and wear animated armors. What annoyed me most was that all backgrounds were vague, something like bad photoshoped skies or desert sands.It's a pity they made it like that. It could have been a better movie if they had used more solid backgrounds, real scenery and more slow pace. The casting (although more Nordic than Egyptian) had great names that could have taken the film to satisfactory levels, if there was any dialogue that is! I think the 1st time the actors actually acted was somewhere in the middle of the movie and then words faded away again, leaving their place to foggy cgi. There was however some good material, like some traits of production design, a couple of action scenes and a couple of Courtney Eaton's assets, but other than that, the movie is as alive as the 2 pita-soulvakis I ate watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If like me you have been around a while you start to see patterns in genres of film. Gods of Egypt is pretty much what you would expect from a action/fantasy film.This flick takes a basic myth based framework and tweaks it to present a passable, predominantly exposition based, eye candy orientated film with a small side order of morality tale. That's not to say Gods of Egypt isn't entertaining. I'd argue its light weight, simple fun, thats probably going to look good on a large screen LCD with a surround sound system. Don't for a moment consider taking this film seriously, it might have a reasonable cast and not half bad acting but it is, what it is, an action film first and foremost. I enjoyed Gods of Egypt, its well paced and quite watchable. A good one to share with friends and family over some chips and popcorn. Six out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why this movie is being blasted by critics, but I found this to be a great movie. Much better than recent fare such as the remake of Clash of the Titans, Conan the Barbarian or Hercules. The sets are amazing as are the effects. Critics are again all over the fact that predominantly white actors are playing Egyptians, but unlike another recent movie, Exodus, where I'd expect at least some attempt at ethnic accuracy, Gods of Egypt is not trying to be a serious period movie or a telling of real life events. This is more of an overblown showy spectacle featuring horrendously unrealistic events and more inaccuracy than you'll find in a government endorsed history book. In a nutshell, the God Horus is due to be crowned king of all he surveys, however the ceremony is interrupted by his uncle, Set. After Set kills his own brother, Osiris, he defeats Horus in battle and removes his eyes. Set then enslaves humanity by creating a massive city for himself with a mammoth monolith taking centre stage. Horus has gone into hiding and a young mortal called Bek embarks on a journey to retrieve Horus' eyes and return them so Horus can reclaim his right as king. Bek manages to locate one eye inside Set's treasury and after evading several elaborate Indiana Jones- esque style traps, he secures the eye and returns it to Horus. He reluctantly teams up with Bek to locate the other eye and journey to see Thoth, God of knowledge, so he can answer the riddle of the Sphinx that resides in a constantly shifting pyramid and put an end to Set's plan to unleash chaos on Egypt. It's a simple story but what makes this interesting is the journey. The Gods are able to change into the deities that we come to recognise on the ancient temples in hieroglyphs and frescoes. The gods use these transformations for battle as this is when they're at their strongest. In addition to that we have 2 Goddesses riding giant cobras, Ra fighting Apophis the serpent of chaos, the giant riddle making Sphinx and travelling through the underworld with Anubis. Gods of Egypt isn't a history lesson; you won't learn anything about ancient Egyptian culture by watching this or any other movie remotely like it. What this is, is fun. Pure escapism on a grand and flashy scale. The effects are great and the action is relentless. Forget what critics are saying about this and just go to be entertained for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A two-hour epic of bloated CGI and total cinematic nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movie buffs may know by now that the first three months of the year consist of some of Hollywood's biggest letdowns of the year, even big-budget epics starring a few A-list actors are immune to failure. When it comes to the action-epic genre, however, the last thing we need is a fantasy adventure that descends on the level of "so bad, it's good" or just laughably bad. This Epygtian mythology-based fantasy epic directed by Alex Proyas who directed by criminally forgotten 'Dark City' and the surprisingly entertaining 'I,Robot', may fit in this category but it doesn't escape the ridiculously messy, CGI-crowded train wreck this is. The most difficult task to endure while sitting through this flick is spotting a single redeeming quality during the two-hour mess. This film stars Gerard Butler as Set, the god of darkness in ancient Egypt who grows jealously over the sun god'a position as King and decides to take over the throne, leading the formerly peaceful empire to plunge into chaos. With the empire gripping in fear of his reign, young thief Bek (played by Brenton Thwaites) sets out to defeat Set and save his girlfriend Maya (played by Courtney Eaton) who is held captive, with the help of Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the powerful god of the desert fighting by his side. It is difficult tell whether this is supposed a parody of big-budget epic flicks or just another fantasy flick tainted by unintentionally bad script. Either way, this movie fails miserably. Whethers it's the horrendous visual effects, the stunted acting, the painfully incoherent plot, or the overall lousy script; this movie seems to have no idea what it's trying to be. The film begins a shiny bird's eye view of the Egyptian empire that is nice to look until the camera pans down for a closer view of the environment. With the villages looking like sets we may find in a high school play and the bloated use of lightening, results in a painfully unconvincing production design representing Ancient Egypt. The rest of the time, we are left with settings consisted with cheap green screen effects and dull CGI. And it certainly doesn't help that the cast along the extras are populated with Caucasian actors, leaving an absence of any Egyptian actors. I mean a movie that takes place in Egypt and features no actual Egyptians? Come on now! And sadly, that's not the worst part. The worst past comes from the horrendous performances the cast displays. Brendon Thwaites plays the main character and throughout the entirety, never seems to bring his A-game here, either does Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as the supporting character. The biggest actor on screen is easily Gerard Butler who plays the villain, and even his role falls short of appeal. Those expecting him bringing the powerful energy he brought as Leonidas in '300' are in for a major disappointment. The only thing we get out of the acting instead, is insanely laughable dialogue that incite more laughs than anything worth taking seriously, even during the scenes that supposed to dramatic.When going into a epic fantasy adventure, one can easily expect to experience some flashy special effects, solid characters, and a decent, if not groundbreaking plot to keep the film moving. None of these is found here. The plot to begin with, is vastly incoherent and in the end, makes no sense. When the film is not feeding us tense action scenes, it tries it's best to develop the plot through the characters arguing constantly, when it's really just trying to fill in a two-hour runtime. Yes, Set, the main villain is trying to take over the Egyptian empire but before the first hour, we are given almost no reason to care. In brief summary, it's just boring.The action sequences along with the battle scenes are supposed to fun. In contrary, these scenes are painful to watch. It's bad enough there is lazy acting and ridiculous spiraling camera work associated with these scenes, but the special effects are plain awful to the point looking like effects seen in a B-movie. The visual effects aren't too solid either, especially with the bloated use of CGI. The computer-generated creatures may not look too inept, but they're pretty unimpressive, especially considering this generation's technology that's capable of making superior animation in video games than this. It's hard to believe how a $140 million dollar epic consists of such bad effects. Gods of Egypt is an epic disaster leading up one of worst films of this year so far. This film fails at just about every aspect in terms of writing, narrative, and technicality; and the worst part, it more than likely has made itself a wide target for the Razzie awards. With this film, slacking as both an epic and unintentional parody, If you hadn't seen this movie, don't worry you're not missing anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash!!!!! Of The Titans....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The survival of mankind hangs in the balance as a mortal hero Bek, undertakes a journey to save the world and rescue his true love. In order to succeed, he needs the help of the powerful god Horus, and team up against Set, the merciless god of darkness, who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the peaceful empire into chaos. As their battle against Set takes them into the afterlife and across the heavens, both god and mortal must pass tests of courage and sacrifice if they hope to survive, an to prevail.........The past ten or so years hasn't been kind to Proyas. I, Robot was enjoyable enough, but after repeat viewings, I can only remember Will Smith saying 'oh hell no' and pretending to sneeze because he's allergic to someone's lies.And Knowing was also okay, but it's best remembered for having a cow on fire and containing the quick downward spiral of Cages career.And now there's this film, and if like me saw the one sheet and thought 'this is going to be a spectacular failure' then it's worth two hours of your precious time.The film is terrible, the casting is dodgy, but that's Hollywood for you, so I'm not getting on my soapbox about choosing a Scottish Egyptian king, because no one moaned about Highlander, and that film has reached a cult status of legend.It's terrible because it's just beyond camp, so confusing, with ineffective humour and some of the most lethargic fight scenes seen in a long time................but by George, it's a lot of fun.Butler has never been so enjoyable on screen, to say he's channelling Blessed in Flash Gordon is an understatement, he chews scenery with every line he spouts, and despite the ridiculousness of it all, he appears to be having such a wonderful time.Our two heroes though are nothing more than a couple of Tolkien wannabes. They hate each other to begin with the old mortal and gods don't mix argument is the main reason, but wouldn't you know it, they become great friends and throw away eyeballs like nobodies business.Add Geoffrey Rush as a Space God Laurence Olivier wannabe, Green Screen that begs you to ignore the 2D version, and some hilarious Dune like costumes and obligatory quite good Special Effects, and you have one big mess of a film.Whether its historically inaccurate isn't the point, the point is that the film entertains, albeit for all the wrong reasons, but it entertains in a way that seeing an old woman falling over some ice entertains.You know you shouldn't be watching it, but you do, and for about five minutes after seeing it, you are happy in a 'I haven't got a clue why' sort of way.It's this years Ishtar, Hudson Hawk, and Dune.And it'll be remembered fondly in years to come, because of its sheer stupidity.A must see for any bad movie aficionado....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been So Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise was scattered, formulaic &amp; boring. A few scenes were well presented but only from an artistic/design perspective. Gerard Butler's Scottish accent was beyond the pale with generic acting - his overall look was more Hollywood model than an attempt to create at least a 'new' character-type. Everyone else at least fell into the fantasy hair style, costume look the audience is used to. Unfortunately more laughs were induced in our audience of teens to forty-somethings - all in the wrong places. It's too bad because this could have been so, so much better either taking the subject more seriously or taking the fantasy into a more clever &amp; intelligent path.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie looks great on the outside but isn't really that interesting if you look a little closer. This movie looks and sounds great. The visuals are lovely, some of the music is great and acting is... alright... for the most part.The biggest issue i had with this movie was the romance between the main character Bek and his girlfriend Zaya. Zaya gets killed in the beginning of the movie and i didn't really care. Their romance had about 3-4 minutes of screen time beforehand so i didn't feel any connection to her. She was bland and uninteresting and didn't really have any character aside from "Bek's girlfriend." This makes it really hard to care about the story as a whole since most of it revolves around Bek trying to get her back from the dead, with the help of a couple gods.The acting is ranges from believable to reading lines without much emotion. I wasn't a fan of Set's acting at all. He was really underwhelming especially considering he was king Leonidas from 300. Zaya and Bek were largely generic and nothing special. The only characters i remember fondly are Horus, Thoth and that CGI goat, cow, thing.In short, a big disappointment. Looks and sounds lovely but with bland characters and a story only a mother would love this isn't something i'd recommend to anyone. I expected more from a movie with 140 million dollars budget, King Leonidas and Captain Barbossa. Shame, such a shame.</fullReview>

But it was not that bad, and some effects are alright in parts but kind of see threw in some.But the performances except for Chadwick Boseman and Geoffrey Rush who seem the make there parts memorable. But everybody else looks there kind of sleepwalking through or look uninterested being here, even Gerard Butler who has the look like he just walked out of bar, and seems like he is doing an off color parody of his 300(2006) character.

		<fullReview>There's "fun but stupid". There's "so bad it's good". And then there's "Gods of Egypt", a movie so bad it makes the rest of your life better in comparison. Here's an example, the opening scene is a thief stealing a dress from a shop. The shop keep notices, the thief runs, guards chase after... immediate cut he's talking to a girl now.Yep, no fun chase scene, even if that's screen writing, like, 85, remedial screen writing for a 9 year old. Why was that scene there? Why does this movie exist? How did it ever get made despite having a huge budget? These are questions that, in a better movie, might cause you despair. It might ask you to question why you're stuck in a dead end job while the people involved with the movie in question got paid millions to push out this torrid drivel.But there's good news, God's of Egypt is even worse than that! None of the actors give a sh*t about anything they're doing, and since they only did one take each time why should they! The editor did the whole movie in a single pass while blindfolded. The writers came up with a pitch that appealed to a bunch of idiotic producers in Hollywood and then farmed out the actual screenplay to high school English students that got all got Ds.Plot? The white god who's a giant Horus is going to become King of Egypt, even though he's a god, but he's king also cause shut up. Then Gerard Butler shows up, stabs the current king, and says "I'm King now" and everyone but Horus gives up, then he tears Horus's eyes out. You think I'm skipping over parts, or selling the drama short or something, nope. He's just "hi, stab, I'm king OK? Well OK, that was easy, let's move on to the next part!Gods of Egypt isn't bad, it's not so bad it's good, it's not even worse than that. It's worse than the worst movie you can think of. It's so bad it makes you realize all of life is a random joke. So relax, because if God's of Egypt can actually get made and released that means actually trying in life is for fools and your fate is anything but in your own hands. Success and failure are random and arbitrary, so kick back enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some day the people who finance movies like this will learn that more-more-more is not necessarily the best philosophy--even for spectacles. Eight or ten fight scenes or harrowing escapes would be plenty. After that, the viewer's mind begins to numb.The first 20-30 minutes were fine, to me, although the characters could have used more development. You can almost imagine the director saying, "We need to get through this stuff so the CGI guys can take over. That's what they want to see!" Even after the story is launched, the interludes where we get to learn more about the characters were too brief. Bek was an entertaining, Ulysses-like character with some great lines, and Zaya was endearing and a feast for the eyes. They might have saved the film with more time on-screen. But no, they disappeared in a headlong rush of CGI-driven scenes where there's no real feeling of peril, just raging gods and goddesses, collapsing buildings, strange creatures slithering around, and Geoffrey Rush imagining what he's going to do to his agent after he gets off work.Don't get me wrong. I know it's a fantasy movie, and it is imaginary gods we're talking about. I also know that people who pay ten bucks for a ticket and fifteen more for popcorn and a Coke expect to go home having been entertained. But I think more focus on the characters, and a running length of 100 minutes, would have made this a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! this movie stunk. What a disappointment, and I herd they dump a lot of money into it.Off the top, the CGI in the movie was so overwhelming, the movie should have been animated. I don't even understand why they just didn't. It would be one thing if it was good CGI, but it was bad CGI. I think the movie suffers from the fact that they were doing something new with the Egyptian gods being bigger than man and having to match that up (of course that does not explain the other effects). Definitively nothing to brag about, just made my eyes water. Not fully familiar with all the Gods of Egypt and I was hoping this movie would change that. I don't know if the movie was using a actual tale of the Gods or was this an original story starring the Gods of Egypt. Either way the story was bland. Most of this had to do with both heroes of the movie, Horus the god and Bek the mortal by his side, being so uninteresting. I thought the supporting cast was a lot better. Chadwick Boseman as Thoth was amusing and so was Gerard Butler as Set (but I don't think that was the plan). The two girls that are in the movie are beautiful, but forgettable in their roles, plus Geoffrey Rush was kind of a waste of time.I have to say skip this one, definitely. There is not enough positive elements in the movie that justify going to see it.It's a real snooze.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, for all the morons whining about the cast being too white, just Google "Egyptian actors" and send me a call if you find ANYONE who is NOT white in the first 2 pages, because I had a hell of a hard time myself! But I won't have any argument for the British actors in the middle as well, but, to be fair, Gerard Butler as the arrogant, egomaniac, evil overlord of chaos and wastelands was the most perfect choice I could've though of. But casting issues aside....Visually, it was amazing. The special effects and designs were stunning, representing the Egyptian gods in new, yet very adequate ways, except maybe for Horus who looked like a golden Iron Man, the rest of the characters looked gorgeous. And the monsters were also amazing. The backgrounds made me wish I could jump inside the screen and live there, just so surrel and marvelous they were designed.But the plot....was that a gameplay I was watching? Seriously, I could pretty much tell what was a bossfight, a sidequest, a NPC talking, a RESPAW, an upgrade, even that moment of Set and the pieces of other gods felt like an RPG character and his inventory! Brain of Tot, wisdow +5, wings of Nemphis, agility 10+, eye of horus, Accuracy +20. WHich also made this movie completely TRAMPLE the Egyptian mythology. Oh yea, the gods of Egypt do have their OWN story and it's much better than this movie's. Whoever wrote the script really had a lot of ideas, but simply wasn't fit for a movie. If they adapt this movie into a video game, it will be better than the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Visuals, Boundless Potential, yet Wretched Pathetic Scripting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I for one was extremely enthusiastic towards the idea of a movie revolving around Egyptian mythology - especially in light of all the Greek-centric movies out there. I cannot stress how beautiful and stunning the imagery was throughout the entirety of the film. Although the look of the transformed Horus came off as entirely overdone and banal in reference to the myriad of other protagonists in shows and movies in the last few years appearing with similarly angel-esque wings, the vast majority of the visuals were outstanding.Several enthralling concepts were also presented that added a very distinct flavor to the movie - concepts rarely if ever dealt with or portrayed, especially in this genre. The breath-taking view of the flat-earth, the idea of Ra fighting off a giant alien-esque behemoth as it came from the void to devour the earth - both elements fairly unique to the film. But the script and the plot in general were just appalling. To preface, if any of my specific complaints are due to not personally being that familiar with Egyptian mythology than the movie could be argued to have failed in educating its viewers to the point where things made enough sense.Firstly, I am a strong proponent for the concept that any notion, no matter how seemingly far-fetched can be made believable if enough energy is put into justifying or explaining how such a thing happened. So Set is warring across the lands and taking out kingdoms of other gods... Wait, explain to me why the Gods haven't teamed up to take this pretentious prick out? No explanation is given so we are left to assume that either the other gods are all insufferably obtuse or the film-makers didn't care to enlighten us or just flat- out didn't have a reason. But why not??? It would be so easy to implement and would add so much value! It would be as easy as making up some kind of deity-level contract/oath/bloodoath/whatever that prevented the gods from banding together in some interesting and intriguing way. Oh noes! Set is attacking us one by one and we are all under oath so we can't intervene; all we can do is wait until it's our turn! But again, no attempt at an explanation was given.And if Set is so secluded, god of the barren deserts, how does he have the backing and the manpower to take out every single other god? Does he actually rule his own city? Is his army magically conjured? Did he steal another god's army? And if he has his own city, why is he acting so incredibly petulant and butt-hurt? Wait, so Set is super lonely and forlorn and boo-hoo poor baby but he has how many other gods working for him? Minotaur gods (that obviously don't deserve god-hod given their pitiful fight scene) and two random snake-affiliated gods? Were they always working together? Were they aligned with the rest of the gods then turned on them? Why even portray random NPC minotaur 1, 2, and 3 as gods at all? Why not portray them as beasts instead of diluting the semblance of potency of the gods?And the scene with the hall of traps... So let me get this straight: not only is their an easy-to-access blueprint showing most of the traps but the floor is covered with scorpions - and you just dump tons of gold onto the floor. There was infinitely more thought put into the revolving clockwork-esque mechanism through which the gold was dumped then the actual vault/trap-room. To top it all off, the character Beck (sp?) rides an avalanche of gold ornaments, tools, possibly blades and then jumps a good 50 or more feet down onto a pile of the same stuff and escapes without a scratch. Then he somehow escapes the vault because in all that time, no magical alarms went off, the scorpions are allergic to shiny eyeballs, and apparently the vault is really easy to get out of - easy enough to not warrant showing it on scene.Beck's lover is shot with an arrow that drives deep into her boob. He quickly rips out the barbed, wide-headed arrow with little to no reaction from the girl and leaving only a tiny hole from which she barely oozes a drop of blood yet somehow dies seconds (or was it minutes? Hours? Days?) later. I certainly hope it wasn't as quick of a chariot ride as it appeared because that would mean Horus was living in exposed squalor within a huge hard-to-miss landmark just a quick jog from Set. Which provokes the question: If Set knows where Horus is, why is he still alive?Beck in general is way too cheesy - everything he says just drips cheesiness... He is the abomination birthed of the stereotypical fantasy- themed rogue-type and Aladdin - a combination ill-fitting the epic potential of the movie.I could go on for days but the point is the visuals and concepts were amazing but they were overshadowed with an ill-conceived atrocious plot and script.9/10 on visuals 6/10 on innovative themes/concepts 1/10 on plot 2/10 on acting 1/10 on script</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well how many times have we Egyptians have to suffer the stupidity and idiotic handling of our history by Hollywood. Firstly: the cast itself is a disaster: blonde blue eyes gods of the country that is not just a part of Africa, but racially speaking was also populated by Africans (some Theories even suggest Egyptians are the ancestors of all Africans). moreover the horrible costumes and acting of the small characters: seriously do the idiots who made this movie thought Egyptians since the dawn of time used to wear these absurd clothes? the decor is horrible and the camera is trying to hide it sometimes and some other times that stupid director thinks his computer generated decorations are worth it so he shows it in details. the plot is so stupid and ridiculous it almost is annoying. it is mostly so boring that you would regret watching the movie, with all the irrational twists, the scenes which emerge with no introduction and characters coming and going with no actual purpose but cheap action. i could go on and on with the cheesy lines, the stupid acting by every main character but again i must assert the main point: this movie is so offensive to me as an Egyptian that i was really furious when it ended. it is one thing to use our history stupidly but it is totally another level of insult to maim and tarnish it. the scene that insulted me the most is the one coming after one hour and 28 minutes: where the dead are stepping to be judged by disfigured and horrendous mommies: the scene shows that you offer something in a scale which is the measure upon which you are evaluated,if your offering is rich and valuable your you pass to eternal life in what seems to be heaven,while poor people with poor offerings are sucked into hell literally. well. here is why this so insulting: one of the very dear and honorable things we Egyptians remember of our ancestors is the moral and highly sophisticated way they dealt with life and afterlife. Old Egyptians thought Auzir - the God of Life awaits the dead in the afterlife with a scale of two parts: in one lies the Feather of Justices - the true measure of Honor and truth, and the other scale is for the heart of dead man or woman - the heart holds your deeds and thoughts. and the measure is easy: if your heart is filled with good deeds and intentions you have tipped the scale in your favor and you pass to live in the paradise of afterlife with no worries or burdens. if not, your hear t is thrown to a beast that awaits near the scale to eat it and you literally Die Forever in hell. the Director and the two writers did not just make a horrible movie but a very insulting one as well. shortly: the movie is below Zero, if IMDb would allow it the movie should be labelled culturally insulting and Racially offensive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just Awful. It's God Awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt is awful in almost every way! This movie is directed by Alex Proyas who made movies such as Dark City and the Crow. Crazy right? But what's really weird is that this guy is from Egypt. Yet he thought i'd be a good idea to make a movie set in Egypt without any Egypt people in it... But I'm not gonna talk about the race issue because that's like beating a dead horse.Performances: The acting was God awful. Bek (played by Brenton Thawaites) feels like a sitcom character. He makes a lot of jokes and they all feel so forced and unrealistic. His character is incredibly annoying and would be better of dead. Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) was fine. Just like all the other characters in this movie, his jokes feel forced and unrealistic. But his performance was just okay. And Set (Gerard Butler) is here just to do some 300 impressions. Nothing special. There is this one guy Thoth (played by Chadwick Boseman) who also gave a terrible performance. I really hope this is because of the director because he'll be playing Black Panther! i really hope that won't flop.Plot: Yeah. What is the plot? I don't even know anymore. Something involving a guy whose girlfriend died, then he met a god. gods fight each other. Some useless big monsters (giant snakes and stupid space snake). After a CG filled journey they got trapped by Set. Set gets killed because for some reason ''love'' is the secret to become a god. Movie ends.CG: Oh my god. It was awful. The first fight scene look pretty cool, 2 flying objects fighting each other. But after that it went to sh**. There are some slow motion fight scenes but it's really hard to look at. The green screen is off. The jungle the walk in looks incredibly fake. The different scales between human and god look laughable. The old guy in flames looks like a 2000's movie. Normally I wouldn't be so harsh on bad CG but this movie has a 140.000.000 budget. Come on guys!In the end I think this is one of the worst,m most painful movie I've every watched. The only reason it gets a 3 instead of a 1 is because the first fight scene wasn't that bad. And the CG of the flying gods isn't the worst thing ever. Just. Don't see this movie!Ps. This is my first review so this review is definitely not the best review ever. I'll practice to write better ones!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low-rent script with a high-stakes pricetag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If I were even to try to explain, your brain would liquefy and pour out your ears." - actual line from "Gods of Egypt." Such a quote is so appropriate for a film like "Gods of Egypt," a two-hour long raucous ride through glorious production design and mediocre everything else. Rarely do I find myself sitting in an action film silently begging it to transition from scenes involving never-ending dialog and flat character relations to something more lively and harrowing. Fortunately, "Gods of Egypt" packs a wallop in its plethora of action sequences, but in order to get to the visual goods, you must sit through, in total, over an hour of monotone dialog spouted from beefy, hulking Gods that wears on the mind so quickly you wish they would just morph into chrome-coated creatures again and begin dueling until something meaningful happened.Consistent readers of my work will take note that I usually do not possess such an attitude when watching action films. Normally, I like my action/epic films with a lot of characterization and dialog; even if it's poorly conceived or lackluster dialog, I usually acknowledge the film's ambition to try and turn Gods and mythical heroes into characters modern audiences can sympathize with. With "Gods of Egypt," my admiration began to breed contempt after I saw what the film's visuals were capable of; after that, sitting through endless, rote dialog by characters who are just mythical cut-outs of Egyptian Gods, was just not what I was in the mood to do. The visual effects in "Gods of Egypt" are extraordinary; a commendable mix of modern sleekness with the pulpy aesthetic of a medium-budget epic, the production design in this film is truly something to behold.The film is centered around a mortal named Bek (Brenton Thwaites), who aligns with the Egyptian God Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) following the death of his lover Zaya (Courtney Eaton) in efforts to dethrone Set (Gerard Butler), the God of Darkness who has just seized the empire. What entails is a brutal struggle for Bek and Horus to get through numerous different traps and roadblocks in order to get to Set to reclaim the throne of the Egyptian empire and try to resurrect Zaya.I spend so little time introducing the plot for two reasons: one, if you're going to see "Gods of Egypt," the plot is probably the last thing on your mind, and two, it's convoluted thanks to the overabundance of characters and the lack of clarity in the respective chronology and period when this is occurring. The latter issues make it difficult to sink into "Gods of Egypt" and become invested in it on a personal level. This is precisely what led to me simply wishing for more action sequences than anything in the way of character dialog.The characters here are so archetypal and flat they might as well be hieroglyphics. They are fearless, immortal (even the mortals, it seems) beings that never seem to be in any real danger regardless of the circumstances, and they're played and written in a manner that doesn't engage. Thwaites and Coaster-Waldau are not very engaging screen presences at all, and for the umpteenth time, neither is Gerard Butler, who keeps getting cast in these films as if he truly bring some layeredness to the table. I'm convinced that all three of these actors, with the appropriate script, could be extremely convincing performers in a film, but once again, especially in Butler's case, Hollywood seems to have a lack of confidence and conviction in them as performers and throws them into a film with a low-rent script with a high-stakes pricetag.To be fair, the high-stakes pricetag results in some of the most visually eye-catching effects we're likely to see this year. The entire film is gorgeously photographed, largely thanks to the sun-soaked cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr., who has helped shoot everything from the "Lara Croft" films to "Kangaroo Jack." Menzies Jr. and director Alex Proyas direct this film with a series of sweeping shots and nicely paced sequences of peril, my personal favorite being a scene where both Bek and Horus are challenged with outrunning two gigantic, fire-breathing serpents on a maze-like floor. And let's not forget the suspenseful sequence involving Bek trying to obtain a glowing gem on heavily booby-trapped floors, which accentuates everything one has come to love about modern action filmmaking. However, as stated before, these scenes only come interjected between the incessant amount of droning dialog we have to endure over the course of a terribly long-wined two hours.The epitome of irony is "Gods of Egypt" opening on the same weekend as the 88th Academy Awards premiering on TV, which is being criticized for the second year in a row now for a lack of diversity, and the film featuring a cast largely comprised of Australian performers. Not to mention, the country of Australian apparently gave the film a 46% tax break if it shot on-location in Australia, which continues to add to the question; was this film made by the people who have their names on the credits or simply made by the circumstances that keenly fell into place for the filmmaking process (no-name actors in the biggest roles resulting in lower pay for talent, tax writeoffs, an ethnically challenged cast, etc)?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud, dumb and silly, this overstuffed god-versus-mortals epic still delivers two hours of solid swashbuckling adventure, romance, epic CG battles and sheer visual grandeur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>History is replete with the follies of Hollywood's gods-versus- mortals epics that have since faded into ignominy or is remembered with scorn, so much so that it is almost instinct to wonder which 'Gods of Egypt' will turn out to be, especially given its pre- release criticism about its literally white-washed cast. Yet Alex Proyas' first film in seven years deserves much better regard than the toxic buzz it has been getting ? not only is it one of the more imaginative mythological adventures in recent years, it is also one of the most entertaining by simply not taking itself too seriously.Imagining an ancient Egypt that never existed where gods and men live together, this effects-driven CGI extravaganza pits the benevolent if slightly flirtatious lord of the air Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) against the nefarious desert god Set (Gerard Butler) who usurps his throne of Egypt on the day of his coronation. As with most such power tussles, there is a familial dimension ? Set is in fact Horus' uncle, who isn't just resentful that his father, the sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush), had given rule of Egypt to Horus but also seemingly banished him to a bleak and barren wasteland. So Set kills his brother Osiris (Bryan Brown) and blinds Horus, exiling him to some faraway dune to wallow in self-pity and eternal misery.That opening sets the stage for Horus to embark on a journey of self-discovery on his way to reclaiming the throne, with immeasurable help from a mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites). It is Bek who returns Horus one of his eyes after breaking into Set's seemingly impenetrable vault, who also subsequently accompanies Horus on his quest in exchange for passage for his one true love Zaya (Courtney Eaton) back from the underworld. And so begins a series of razzle-dazzle action sequences, including a thrilling chase by two evil goddesses Astarte (Abbey Lee) and Anat (Yaya Deng) atop two giant fire-breathing serpents and a near-death escape from Set with some help from Elodie Yung's goddess of love Hathor inside the chamber of a towering Sphinx.Oh yes, there is no such thing as subtlety here. The chariots are pulled by giant scarab beetles. Sedan chairs take flight with hundreds of birds. Gods transform from their 11, 12 feet in height human form into glistening animal-headed robots and bleed liquid gold. Ra lives in a spaceship hovering above the Earth, bursts into flames at will and spends each night doing battle with the Lovecraftian ancient Apep by shooting fireballs from his spear. Indeed, as far as being gaudy is concerned, Proyas isn't shy at all about flaunting every single dollar of his significant US$140 million budget that went into creating the sheer visual spectacle (or excess, depending on how you see it) that you'll get to see on the big screen.Yet its silliness certainly isn't lost on Proyas; indeed, along with his writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ('Dracula Untold' and 'The Last Witch Hunter'), Proyas gleefully embraces its absurdity with campy humour. For one, Bek is never too far from an amusing quib usually directed at Bek. For another, the god of wisdom Thoth (Chadwick Boseman) is a ball being haughty and all full of himself ? and we mean that literally in the context of the hundreds of copies he has made of himself to serve him in his lair. It never does take itself too seriously, nor too flippantly to be completely dismissed, and the levity is a nice counter-balance to the elaborate kitsch on display.Credit that too to Coaster-Waldau and Thwaites, who sustain a lively bickersome chemistry as a pair of mismatched buddies forced to work together rather than apart. For the ladies, Coaster-Waldau also oozes sheer masculine charm, while Butler often chews up the scenery with pomp and swagger. Both actors are no stranger to the swords-and- sandals genre ? the former from the HBO series 'Game of Thrones' and the latter of course from '300' ? and have no trouble convincing us of their place in Egyptian mythology. Rush also lends his trademark eccentricity to Ra, looking just at home on his solar barque.And so like last summer's 'Hercules', 'Gods of Egypt' rises above the ashes by delivering two hours of solid sword-and-sorcery entertainment with dashes of self-aware humour. There is swashbuckling adventure, romance, epic battles and plenty of visual grandeur to meet its mad ambition with lunatic conviction. That it is overstuffed is part of its excessive nature, but you can't argue that it doesn't fill you with a sense of awe and captivate and delight you more than you expect it to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amazed at how much money was wasted creating this entirely horrific waste of two hours. Within the first fifteen minutes it is evident by the bad fx and even worse acting that the next two hours would be better spent gouging ones eyes out or driving nails into ones ears. It is shameful that people can spend money producing such rubber Sh whilst millions are in poverty, are refugees or that people go without. Whilst not as bad as the wastage on wars and religion, it is firmly high up there on the simply horrid scale. And Gerard butler, for shame, I know you've done some fairly terrible films over the years but you get the crown for this abomination. Save your money, or the two hours of your life and invest it elsewhere, for there is nothing here but wastage, stupidity, and a dire need for writing, acting and directing lessons.

		<fullReview>I went to this with a friend because she loves Gerard Butler and I love Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. So we thought it was be worth it just to see them without shirts on! Like I said, it was better than I expected with the story line, but there was SOOOOO much CGI. I get that it needed it because it's based on gods, but I KNOW there is better computer graphics out there. It was just so obvious. I did love the music though, I love the ancient Greek theme type instruments. I only paid 6 bucks for it though because of a special at our theater, but I think if you're paying full price, I would wait and watch something else. Might be good on DVD, but not really worth it in theaters. Unless you REALLY love Gerard Butler (he is a bad guy however)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods of Egypt is miscast but has some OK special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seemed poorly planned from the beginning and I couldn't convince anyone that this movie would be worthwhile to see and even I was reluctant to purchase a ticket, hence my review coming so late. The first issues that popped up once the preview debuted was the lack of diverse characters in a setting like Egypt. The casting was a foolish choice for the film and really didn't add anything, actually adding the setting as Egypt simply didn't make sense since this was an otherworldly place that would have suited the plot much better to be set off world. Still the casting needs to change on all these movies.Overall the acting wasn't so terrible but what is expected from the stock cast. Gerard Butler continues to copy his success in 300 with much less fanfare this time turning it into a villain role. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau reprises the role he plays in Game of Thrones as a rich playboy, or rather a God in this instance. From his first appearance, it is clear that the awkward sizing of the Gods to mortals was a special effect that they just couldn't seem to pull off.

		<shortDescription>What a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really have any faith in this film being decent when I saw the trailers but I figured it would at least be a bit of silly fun at the theater. Well, I've seen the movie and I can certainly confirm that it's not very good and it's nowhere near as fun as I was hoping it would be. To be fair, there are entertaining aspects to the story and some of the action (keyword being 'some') is cool to look at but overall the film just goes on for way too long and nothing really comes off as spectacular or very well done. I've enjoyed some of Alex Proyas's movies in the past but this one just left me disappointed and I found myself wishing that it would hurry up and end.The story focuses on an alternative world and Egypt where the Gods from Egyptian Mythology live with and rule over humanity. Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is being made the new king of Egypt by his father, Osiris (Bryan Brown), when a bit of family drama throws the succession plans out the window. Set (Gerard Butler), Horus's uncle, murders Osiris and tears out Horus's eyes after a short battle. Afterwards, Set rules over humanity and goes to war with the rest of Egypt's Gods. In all this confusion, a young human named Bek (Brenton Thwaites) is convinced by his wife, Zaya (Courtney Eaton), to steal Horus's eyes away from Set so that Horus can regain his sight and the power to save all of humanity. An overbearing adventure awaits everyone.The cast is actually composed of some talented people but it still feels like the acting comes off as sub par here. Coaster-Waldau does a decent enough job as Horus but I never really cared very much for him despite all of the hardships he went through. I believe they were going for a likable rogue type of character but he really just came off as a prick. Brenton Thwaites seemed alright as Bek but once again it just felt dull watching him say his lines and interact with the other characters. I have a feeling the fault for this lies more with the direction and lackluster script than it does the actors. The most disappointing one to me was Gerard Butler. This very much just seems like a lackluster performance in order to get a quick paycheck. Even then, I enjoyed watching Butler but his portrayal easily stood out to me more than anyone else in the story, and not in a good way. It's strange to say, I think Butler's accent had a lot to do with it. No one in this movie even attempts to emulate an Egyptian accent but Butler's brogue just snatched me right out of the film every time he spoke. I'm not sure why his voice did it and no else though.There are a few cool looking things in this movie that keep it from being completely forgettable. The environments are interesting and the weird bizarre scenes that take place on a ship sailing through space (stay with me) look kind of cool. There are also a few action scenes that I thought were done pretty well. Unfortunately, there's not enough of this to make up for the plodding pace of the film and laughable cgi. Like I said, I enjoyed the scenes that took place on Ra's ship until I saw Geoffrey Rush supposedly surrounded by ethereal flames while fighting off some giant demon. The demon looked alright but Rush just came off as goofy looking. It feels like the creatures in general looked a lot better than the Gods and the effects associated with them. As far as the pace goes, this film would have been a lot better if they cut out some of the fluff. When I say some of I actually mean about a quarter of the movie. This story really drags and I found myself peeking at my watch on a few scenes. A tight ninety minutes instead of two hours would have done wonders for this film.I don't want to go so far as to say that I didn't have any fun whatsoever with the movie, but for everything they did well there were two things that felt off. It kind of reminded me of the way I felt about that Pan film that came out last year. I enjoyed some aspects but overall it didn't really do a whole for me. I can't really give this one a recommendation unless there's absolutely nothing else out there that catches your attention. Just go for the one or two worthwhile action scenes and take a nap during the second act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods of Egypt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose that I could complain about the weak direction, far- fetched production design or the mediocre digital effects which saturate every scene of Gods of Egypt, but the truth is that its main problem is something simultaneously simpler and more difficult to solve: I simply couldn't care less about anything that happened in it. Despite the film being longer than two hours, co-screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (whose previous credits are Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter, something which explains everything) didn't invest enough time to develop the characters, either human or divine. Bek is the most generic and bland possible hero, lacking of any substance and emotions, and the other characters are equally hollow. As a consequence, all the actors of Gods of Egypt end up feeling like props of the animators and director Alex Proyas, who seem more interested in designing epic settings and complicated action sequences which don't wake the slightest excitement or tension. Those who remember Proyas for excellent films such as The Crow, Dark City and Garage Days won't be able to find even the most minimum trace of the talent and vision displayed by him in those projects. If you have seen any trailer of Gods of Egypt, you have already seen everything this piece of junk has to offer: elaborated designs and the usual Egyptian iconography taken to the levels of the typical Hollywood excess. And well, the least I say about the fact of a film about Egypt almost exclusively including British and Australian actors, the better (at least, Proyas is Egyptian from Greek parents). And the British accents might be explained by some kind of "alternative History" they are reserving for the sequel (don't worry; I highly doubt that that is going to happen). In order to enjoy an amusing mythological action experience, I would recommend the film Wrath of the Titans, or the video game Titan Quest, which covered a wide range of cultures, from the Greek to the Egyptian. But don't make the same mistake I did, and avoid Gods of Egypt at any cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual piece of no story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first i was actually excited for this film, saw an interview with Gerard Butler, where he was trying to say this was going to be his "Gladiator" and then i saw the trailer. The trailer shows what you are expecting, and that is a visual spectacular of the mythological gods and cities of ancient Egypt. It also alludes that there film is based on some story. That is a lie.I don't usually do negative reviews. Unless the film is really terrible, and even so i like to talk about the positive aspects of that film too. So I will start with the positives. The film has some pretty cool visuals for most parts, and I do mean for most part, there are moments where it looks like you are watching cinematic clip from a game that is equivalent to PS3 graphics. The rest of the film is filled with colorful and what i'm hoping for is expensive CGI to make the film stand out on its own and bring people into the cinema to get their money back. Because honestly neither the story or the acting would do that.Story: now i'm not really sure who wrote the script, and where was the script supervisor during production. The story was all over the place, and just to give you an idea of what i mean. Why is that gods can die? why are they bigger then humans? and if only gods are bigger then humans to showcase that they are gods, then what about their big guards? are they demi gods? why do they bleed gold? why do they not get stronger from the prayers of mortals. Why is one mortal has the speed of a god, and the strength to withhold a gods mighty punch??.. So, there are a lot of questions and plot holes to ask and cover. That's why i choose to skip over it. its simpler like that.Acting: I really have to say that acting was pretty terrible. Not just from new comers, but even from A-list'rs like Butler,Rush and Waldau. But it wasn't as bad as the new faces that played the love couple or the actress that played the love interest of Horus.Overall this film fails, not for it's lack of originality, but for trying to be too original and skipping over a lot of important information and key turns in the film, for allowing the film to have scenes which looked out of place and felt like they were made on Windows 97, and for really bad use of Green screen. The ride through town on the chariot is a perfect example.</fullReview>

There is a sentence:,,Overly confident and CGI''. Yes, so there's that but i don't want to spoil it because some people want to watch it! Good but movie doesn't have some point and its pretty linear as movie can get! Well in some movies you would probably wonder what would happen if... Here?! NO! Don't even bother! See this movie follows ,,mythology'' but you just may go back in time to your history class in fifth grade! After this movie you will scratch you head and ask yourself how much this movie costs... But don't ask yourself that because human spirit is so so strong! Like when you want to accomplish something and you are doing well to make masterpiece, sorry i don't want to waste your time... Well you really need to be concentrated for this if you lose track you will begging movie to be over even at the half time! You will begging anyhow! If you like this kind of movies that is fine with you... One thing to mention where movie fails so hard! Movie doesn't know what it wants to be!!!(pleas understand this, it isn't like i don't know what to say, here its true) You should read books rather than watching this! What could improve this move! Less CGI sure and unnecessary characters(mercenaries) overly sensitive characters and overly confident and script(God please)! Well since there are problems like this we are stuck with move as it is now! Feels like Jupiter ascending(i can't say which one is worst than the other) when that movie came out everybody were like:,,Cool, it will be awesome and best thing ever'' but what came from that is bucked full of tears and salt water and what ever do you want... I watched this movie today with my friends and teacher(probably the awesome-st guy that i know) and they were like: ,,movie is awesome'' And i was like people get really what is good about this movie that pumped you so much and they were like brain washed!!! I watched obviously more movies then them and they are brain washed that is all! So here it is watch if you like this kind of movies! But i warn you there's so much bad things in but some good as well... Well this is it!!! P.S: Move need soundtrack from:Queen,Smak and Ramones and also 11 other bands that i like! :)</fullReview>

I would legitimately be surprised if anyone genuinely wants to see this garbage, regardless of knowing or being informed of how irreconcilably s***ty it is. However, there is some degree of fun to be had mainly due to Gerard Butler's performance and some decent banter, but these moments are few and far between. It is rather disappointing, because despite having a solid cast, great production values and a somewhat talented director, the movie falls flat on most occasions.

		<shortDescription>"Gods of Egypt" is Above the February Movie Line! But Because of Casting Choices and Over-reliance on CGI, I Give it Stars of Nine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered "Gods of Egypt" when it was suggested by "The Divergent Series: Allegiant" trailer. It's very attractive for a fantasy action adventure movie. A story in the ancient Egypt is very refreshing to me, especially featuring gods instead of mummies. February feels like a passive month for movies, where usually romance and drama films dominate. Thankfully, this awesome movie is released.Set, the god of the desert, has taken over Egypt. Mortal hero Bek joins forces with Horus, god of the sky, to restore peace and order.It's a visually stunning movie from start to finish. For a 140 million USD film, this is impressive. Fight scenes are well- choreographed. Music is great. Set pieces and props are intricately detailed. I like the scenes featuring the giant serpents, the goddess of love Hathor, the god of wisdom Thoth, the Sphinx, and the booby traps. There's also a memorable scene where the afterlife is featured, where the dead will offer gold heavier than the white feather to enter the next life. The movie also immerses you into the Egyptian environment.However, I just don't like how the main cast is mostly white. Ancient Egypt is composed of Blacks and Arabs. I understand that the studios are betting on Gerard Butler for his "300" and "Olympus Has Fallen" movie successes. He's prominently shown in trailers and TV spots, even though he's a villain. Also, some scenes heavily rely on CGI instead of practical effects. The armors of the winged creatures, who are Set and Horus, feel like taken from a video game. A scene where Set is riding a chariot feels CG-dependent. I guess they should have used CG to be the icing and not the cake base.On a lighter note, I appreciate Lionsgate and Alex Proyas's separate apologies for the casting choice. Probably Australia's rules for tax incentives and relying on well-known actors are primary factors. They're humble enough to admit their shortcomings. I love the film. I'm actually delighted that this comes out on Feb. 24, just three days after my 21st birthday! It's a gift! If they include a racially diverse cast for a sequel, I'll see it with greater excitement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As legend tells, gods once lived amongst mortals in Egypt, the paradisiacal birthplace of life. Noble god Osiris (Bryan Brown), who has ruled over the land with compassion and generosity, chooses his son Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) as successor to the throne. But this decision displeases Osiris' banished sibling Set (Gerard Butler), who returns on his nephew's coronation day to murder his father and usurp the kingdom. A year passes and the people of Egypt find themselves wholly enslaved by the despot. While they toil away building massive obelisks in tribute to the evil monarch's conquests, their cries for help remain unanswered as Horus lies in exile at his father's tomb. When rebellious young thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) is coaxed by his true love Zaya (Courtney Eaton) into stealing a valuable artifact from Set's treasury, he sets in motion a monumental quest that will partner him with a god to save his beloved from the land of the dead, and thwart a tyrant's diabolical plan to destroy the world.Although the narrator states that the gods have gold running through their veins, and that they can transform into beasts to do battle, it's not enough to prepare audiences for just how outrageous those concepts will appear. The Roland Emmerich-styled excesses of digital extras populating epic landscapes quickly subside for the utter nonsense of mid-air, Transformer-like (or Iron Man-like) combat, full of metallic wings, fireballs of light, and shimmering blades that dart about as if lightning bolts perpetually unable to strike a target. And the gods themselves, designed to be slightly oversized humans (like something out of "300" or "Jack the Giant Slayer"), fit in quite poorly with the mortals, who frequently exhibit superhuman capabilities themselves.In fact, Bek is so agile and fast that he's able to swipe magical objects and penetrate impenetrable fortresses with both ease and skills that surpass the very gods he accompanies. It would have been more manageable if all the characters were simply the same size. This becomes especially frustrating when the various villains go out of their ways to avoid killing the puny human, since he's supposedly no match for their boundless divinity. Strangely, Bek's pursuit of love seems to be the invincible shield of armor necessary to duke it out with the titans that arm themselves with celestial weaponry so powerful that they're left unexplained.When even the human characters are impervious to peril, there's never really any suspense. Several of the monsters are amusing, with their designs matching the might of the "Clash of the Titans" movies from the 2000s, but they fail to present formidable danger for the dwarfed heroes who sprint around on the ground, always millimeters out of reach of enormous fangs or breaths of fire. It also doesn't help that new rules and ideas are continually devised on the spot to prolong the story. The loss of an all-seeing eye, or the momentary inability to sprout wings, or the portal-jumping transitions between the land of the living and dead are never given much thought; they just happen, spontaneously lending to a premise already too unnecessarily complex for the straightforward fantasy picture this should have been.When wirework, frenetic camera movements, and extreme murkiness cloud the lack of riveting choreography or inventiveness, it's evident that "Gods of Egypt" is trying to hide its muddled mix of borrowed designs. Derivative of far too many projects to mention, the plot still somehow possesses enough potential to be watchable. But the alternating of video game concepts, high-quality creature animation, and astonishingly pathetic, green-screen chariot riding makes the entire venture feel as if ten different directors alternated the tackling of every scene. At its best, its reminiscent of "Baron Munchausen" (or the Grimms' fairy tale "The Six Servants"), but at it's worst, it's barely fit for a made-for-TV movie from the '90s.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely terrible movie. The premise isn't so bad but the dreadful cgi and re-sizing of characters as they did in the Hobbit but really, really badly is embarrassing. There are some scenes that look amazing I'll grant but the story just seems to meander on with the obvious plot. Poor old Kingslayer, what a bad movie to be in after all the good he did in GoT. Spoiler alert: There is a scene where the young chap's girlfriend gets whisked away in a chariot and she's standing there in what is obviously a fake chariot with a green screen behind her, and she is standing there like she is at a cocktail gathering. Terrible acting. It does look like they have got their hands on all the tools used to create LoTR and The Hobbit and gone at it willy nilly. Simply awful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another mixture of all the famous tropes that you've already seen in a hundred different movies, veiled in a somewhat interesting setting that just doesn't work.It was an interesting concept, that fell completely flat due to lack of originality in every thing the movie tries to do. Action scenes couldn't convey any emotions, dialogues and plot felt completely bland with a number of low-effort comedy scenes and a cast that simply didn't fit. But what about the visuals? Well, the movie tried to put special effects in every second of the movie. That resulted in half of them being noticeably terrible and unconvincing. Some of these could be called more or less spectacular, yet certainly hard to appreciate considering how most of it was gibberish.In case you're still considering going to the cinema: my only advice is to watch the trailer carefully to see if you don't get put off by some of the special effects. If you do, there's much worse to come and you'd better save the money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many issues with this film. We can start by the fact that yet another Hollywood blockbuster whitewashes what should have been a diverse cast. But even if you can get past the whitewashing, the film itself is pretty big mess. On its premise alone, it borrows from plenty of films we love including Hercules and The Lion King, but the execution is something else entirely. Sadly, talented director Alex Proyas never manages to create something entertaining or thought provoking out of Gods of Egypt.The films stars Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler as Horus and Set, two gods battling it out to be the king of Egypt, Brenton Thwaites as Bek, a mortal who possesses untapped courage, and Elodie Young and Courtney Eaton as the main love interests. As I said, the story isn't all that terrible, the performances and execution of the story is horrific. For a 140 million-dollar film, Gods of Egypt may be the worst looking film I've ever seen. I'm not sure who is in charge of controlling how the budget is being used for this film, but it was not a good job of properly distributing the time and money. Whether it's watching Butler fly through the sky or a halfway decent action scene, the green screen is blatantly obvious.After a good portion of the 2 hour and 7 minute film, my eyes began to drift. That never happens to me during an action film. I just never found myself caring for the characters. Not necessarily to the fault of the actors, but they didn't do all that much to help their cause. The performances were subpar at best, and even the one really great actor, Chadwick Boseman, was completely wasted. I'm not sure whose idea it was to have Thwaites yell like Tarzan or George of the jungle every time he fell or jumped off rocks, but that was not the best decision to make. Even Jaime Lannister couldn't save this one. I hope to god that London Has Fallen doesn't make it back to back horrible Gerard Butler films.Alex Proyas went on a social media rant over the wretched reviews the film has received. Even after I went in with even lower expectations because of this, I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I never saw Clash or Wrath of the titans, but I can't help but think the sword and sandal epic is officially dead. The best bet for studios is to stick to what works, and that's disappointing, because this genre has turned out some of my favorite films of all time in Gladiator and Braveheart.+Some of the action and story potential-Horrific CGI-Weak and uninteresting characters-Boseman wasted-Whitwashed3.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amidst the current climate of unrest regarding the issue of racism in Hollywood, Gods Of Egypt hasn't escaped scot-free. Similar to the film Exodus: Gods And Kings, which was also set in Egypt, there has been much talk about the fact that there are non- Egyptians playing Egyptian characters. To me, I don't think this was necessarily a conscious decision by the casting agents to directly exclude Egyptians out of sheer racism. I genuinely believe this was just a case of hiring the right people for the job. I don't think it'd be right for a studio to deliberately seek out actors of a certain racial background and ignore others who might actually be a better fit. I could be wrong ? there could have been a multitude of tremendous Egyptian actors and actresses who auditioned and subsequently weren't hired. Either way, I don't think this should affect the success of a film and the level with which we enjoy it.Okay! Now that the serious stuff is over and done with, let me get to the fun stuff? this movie was shot in my hometown of Sydney (yay!). It's great to witness the generation of local jobs in the film industry, so this is something I'm super proud of. We were able to showcase our range of extremely talented Aussies, both in front of and behind the camera, including the likes of Hollywood heavyweight Geoffrey Rush, legend Bryan Brown and starring up-and-comer Brenton Thwaites who already has several big films under his belt, such as Maleficent, The Giver and Son Of A Gun. He had his first big break in Home And Away, which has been the stepping stone for many a successful actor (ahem, did someone say Chris Hemsworth?). Also starring in this epic feature are international talents Gerard Butler (looking great in a skirt? and why wouldn't he, he's Scottish) and everyone's favourite incest Lannister twin, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. The film was also directed by Egyptian-born Aussie Alex Proyas who has directed a range of hugely popular movies, including I, Robot, Knowing, and the cult-hit ? and one of my all-time faves ? The Crow.From the opening scene until the end credits, the set design was phenomenal. Everything was on such a large scale, with intricate costumes to boot. This, along with the great cast, was unfortunately the only highlights for me. The dialogue was often stilted and unnatural and the visual effects were hit and miss. There were many similarities between this title and the 2010 remake of Clash Of The Titans, which won't bode well for some. In saying that, when they got it right, it was amazing to see on the big screen and I believe this is definitely a big-scale film made to be seen in theatres? if you're willing to pay the inflated cinema ticket price, that is.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin.Nice graphics, nice effects, but the idea was probably better than the result. I didn't expect much, since as soon as I saw the trailer and saw Butler stars in it, I kinda expected it will not be good. Not saying I don't like Butler, but he was such a BAD BAAAAD terrible choice for this role, it could be worse only if it was Adam Sandler.Bek and Zaya relationship and characters were too cheesy and the whole thing didn't work out too well. All the stuff with him going to steal eyes for Horus happened too fast, the storytelling had huge holes in it. Then there are the way over-the-top parts like the whole Ra character and Seth attaching parts of other gods to his body...etc. Overall watchable, but nothing that would stand out or would blow you away.After The Crow and I, Robot, Proyas made a very mediocre piece. Fit for carefree popcorn night for people that just want to kill time and don't look for a decent cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An action-adventure movie inspired by the classic mythology of Egypt, that is enjoyable and fun at times, but not very good in general. The extraordinarily silly effects that look expensive, yet so fake, and the boring and also confusing narrative, make "Gods of Egypt" a movie that you will forget very soon. In all this, also add the uninteresting performances and characters. Gerard Butler (who I really like by the way), in this film, is flexing his muscles and growling like he did in "300". He is nothing but boring, but he is still the only reason for someone to watch the movie. Alex Proyas "Gods of Egypt" feels like a bad video game that I don't want to play again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He was said to be born of a virgin and his birth came to be celebrated on or about December 25th. As a baby, he was depicted in a stable scene, lying in a manger, with the image of his mother beside him. He was considered the light of the world, an avenger against the power of darkness and, as such, the savior of mankind. According to many historical sources, including the writings of former Catholic priest Joseph McCabe, this was the mythology surrounding the ancient Egyptian god Horus in the centuries before the birth of Jesus. Horus is the central character in the CGI-heavy fantasy film "Gods of Egypt" (PG-13, 2:07).The film, however, focuses more on Horus' deeds as a god than how he was worshipped. The plot is very loosely based on ancient Egyptian mythology, particularly the story "The Contendings of Horus and Set", and takes place at a time in Egyptian pre-history when it was believed that gods lived among humans. These gods aren't omniscient, omnipotent, or immortal, but they can live over 1,000 years, they bleed gold, they can be resurrected if killed, they have special powers (like turning into the birds and animals that symbolize them in ancient mythology) and they're about three feet taller than most adult humans. Naturally, the humans serve these earth-inhabiting gods. In return, they protect Egypt and its people.As the movie opens, the god Osiris (Bryan Brown) is about to crown his son, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) God-King of Egypt. The other gods have turned out for the ceremony, along with all the puny mortals, including an arrogant and self-righteous young man called Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his girlfriend, Zaya (Courtney Eaton), who is sporting the dress that Bek stole for her to wear at the coronation. But, alas, this coronation was not to be. Seconds before Horus was to receive the crown, Osiris' brother Set (Gerard Butler) shows up to totally spoil the party. Tired of ruling the isolated desert regions of Egypt and unhappy with being passed over for the throne of all Egypt, he stabs Osiris, gouges out the "all seeing" eyes of Horus and claims the throne for himself. He then presents the crowd this choice: worship him or be enslaved. What a jerk! The noble and selfless warrior from "300", Set is not.Life in Egypt really goes downhill for both humans and gods with Set in charge. He kills other gods who get in his way and he forces the people to work on his massive construction projects. Zaya ends up working for the mean and nasty Urshu (Rufus Sewell), Set's chief architect. Zaya, who still believes in the power and basic goodness of the other gods, convinces Bek to go find Horus and convince him to come out of hiding and help Egypt. But it's not that simple. First, there's that whole blindness thing. Bek breaks into Set's vault, survives enough booby traps to impress Indiana Jones and is able to make off with one of Horus' eyes. Secondly, Bek has to convince an exiled and bitter god to help the insignificant little humans. Bek accomplishes that as well, but with only one of his eyes, Horus' powers are limited.Horus and Bek are going to need a lot of help. Horus prays to his grandfather, the sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush), who transports Horus and Bek up to his space-based solar barge from which he battles the powers of darkness. Ra chooses to stay neutral in the power struggle between his son and nephew and does very little to aid Horus. Back on earth, with only Bek at his side, Horus has to try enlisting the help of Horus' former lover and now Set's wife, Hathor (Elodie Yung), Thoth (Chadwick Boseman), who is the God of Wisdom, not to mention Anubis, the lord of the underworld. Even with the help that he's able to gather, defeating Set looks to be nearly impossible. Now, I won't tell you how the movie ends, except to say that the last scene sets up a possible sequel ? but not likely, considering how poorly this movie did."Gods of Egypt" isn't the grand fantasy epic that it clearly wants to be. The quality of the CGI is mostly pretty impressive, but some of the visuals (like Ra's aircraft carrier-looking space barge) border on the laughable. More importantly, overblown special effects are a poor substitute for a good story. The film's plot points are alternately confusing, non-sensical and silly, as is much of the script's dialog. Take the character of Bek for example. While the gods helping the people and people standing up to the gods is indeed part of ancient mythology, the attempt to put modern phrases into Bek's mouth feels out of place and his attitude probably should have gotten him squashed like a bug by any self-respecting deity.It doesn't help that the actor playing Bek lacked the charisma to sell this silliness. He's not alone. Most of the acting was of poor quality and the glaring omission of actual Egyptians in the cast made things even worse. This movie is all style and little substance. Pre-teen boys may like it, but if you're outside that relatively narrow demographic, you should probably pray to the gods that you don't have to spend two hours with this highly-fictionalized cinematic interpretation of ancient Egypt's rich mythology.

		<fullReview>"Gods of Egypt" asks an age old question, "Does flashy sparkle outweighs written words?". Unfortunately for the two hours movie, its visual is inconsistent and the story has so many illogical flaws, that whatever gorgeous scenery it has would feel bland. Furthermore, the acting is sloppy, having less-than-charismatic characters mumbling cringe-worthy monologue for half its time.This is the tedious story of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the supposed king of fictional Egypt where gods and mortals live side by side. He then finds opposition from his uncle Set (Gerard Butler). He then forms unusual alliance with Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a human thief with a single-minded drive for juvenile love.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler are not bad, they have experience on this type of epic saga as Jaime Lannister and Leonidas, respectively. However, this also feels as though they are just going through the motion. Here they are shades, less appealing and more brooding version of their famous roles.Bek as the other main lead is your typical charming hoodlum without the charm. His characterization is too rigid and any attempt to romanticized or deliver witty humor is instead annoying. The two leading females are too over zealously created for flamboyant melodramatic romance. There are a couple decent supporting cast such as Rufus Sewell as Urshu and Chadwick Boseman as Thoth, but they merely have small portions of spotlight.The script feels forced to create any chemistry between the characters, however it often sounds like soap opera. Not to mention story line is plagued by awful plot devices. Being gods doesn't exemplify them from having sudden illogical and convenient twists, a few of these might be fine, but after half dozen times audience would appreciate more explanation than simple magic.Visual is arguably pretty. At its best the movie offers some aesthetically pleasing scenes and the costumes worn as well as the set are very easy on the eyes. Still, among these beautiful people and vistas, it's not often to see it smeared by strangely subpar CGI, as though these are Transformers made from low budget production.Tainted by shady narrative, corrupted visual and barren script, "Gods of Egypt" is mindlessly numb.</fullReview>

Tagging along with the gods and saving the day. It was like a really bad fan fiction. Not only the writing was bad, the acting as well. All throughout the movie, while Bek is walking around with Horus, he has an absurd smile on his face. He's too happy to be there. This was so distracting from the rest of the movie. There are several scenes where Bek has to run and dive. It looked like a bad video game. After a while I caught myself thinking in PlayStation buttons while he was running and jumping. XO &lt;- -&gt; XOXI saw the movie in 3D and it was a mess. At times it was hard to follow what was going on on the screen. If you do decide to see this, watch it in 2D. I would not recommend the 3D version of this.Too bad though, the director has made some movies that I really like and the actors are usually good in other movies...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods of Egypt is a movie directed by Alex Proyas and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. It stars Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Courtney Eaton, and Brenton ThwaitesMortal hero Bek teams with the god Horus in an alliance against Set, the merciless god of darkness who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict.Mythological stories were often told to teach a concept that was too elusive to be understood otherwise. For example, the story of Echo and Narcissus, was meant to define what narcissism entails and explain what reflections were. Like all mythological stories, Gods of Egypt, teaches all aspiring writers and directors, how not to make a fantasy movie.There's little to nothing good about the monstrosity movie seems. With that said I did reap some enjoyment out of this senses- assaulting trip to Egypt. This is a film that I can definitely say will become a cult film one day as it is a true train wreck in every which way. But, like in all train wrecks, it horrible, tragic, yet irresistible viewing. Perhaps the most entertaining part of this circus freak show, was the script. Everything but coherent, Gods of Egypt's two writers seemed to have truly thrown in the towel in this endeavor as each line progressively sounds like it was ripped out of a poorly made X- rated movie. This 'style,' if I may call it that, is complimented by the overly convoluted story that fails to engage the audience past its first few scenes. Rather I found myself focusing on how many times Gerard Butler tries to imitate Nicolas Cage. Moving past the laughable dialogue, Gerard Butler delivers a villainous turn as a man who wants to freeze Gotham city, Mr. Freeze. Wait a second?.I think I got the wrong movie. Though Butler's over-the-top performance was far from good, he stands out as the rest of the cast seem to be completely blasé towards this 'epic' fantasy movie.To add insult to a mortal injury, the direction in this movie feels overly stilted and scattershot. This is particularly annoying since I used to be a fan of some Alex Proyas' early works like Dark City and The Crow. In this movie he has fully demonstrated that he cares little about the craft of filmmaking as he opts to film eye- wateringly ghastly CGI beasts duke it out.Gods of Egypt is an unwatchable mess that will one day be appreciated for its laughable content and execution. Gods of Egypt gets a D or a 1.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gods of Egypt" had a few good things going for it. I thought the opening sequence was great; I thought some of the imagery was beautiful (mostly the beautiful colors); and I thought both Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau and Geoffry Rush were pretty good. Actually they were the only good source of acting in this movie, in my opinion. I also thought that Anubis was very well portrayed, and looked very good. On that thought, the entire after life setting was pretty great. Even though the imagery look good, the CGI was way to over the top at points, and downright laughable at others. When a chase scene reminds you of a chase scene from a movie from the 20's (moving picture background), it's pretty bad. Other scenes just looked choppy, almost like they were rushing through and instead of cleaning up the shots they just went with it. Also, I totally understand the ratio of gods to humans; however, it only managed to look really ridiculous. The acting was bad, like really, really, bad; overacting at it's prime. The dialogue is even worse than the acting, and the "humor" in the movie is incredibly unfunny. As I mentioned earlier only two actors really kept me somewhat interested in what was going on, and even after a while they got a little hard to bare. I do love the story they were trying to tell, I just don't think they pulled it off well at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main news about this movie prior to its release was how no Egyptians were cast even though the story is about Egypt and its inhabitants. Now that it has finally been released the major talk should be about how silly it is. 140 million dollars was spent to make this? The poor and homeless in Egypt should have been given this money instead. Australian backers played a pivotal role in the funding of this production. It now seems like the stellar year of Aussie films in 2015 has been diminished by this so-called God hovering over its success. 'Gods' in name only, definitely not through merit.Set (Gerard Butler) is a God of Egypt who has ambitions to reign supreme. He kills his brother Osiris (Bryan Brown) in order to ascend the throne. His nephew, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) seeks revenge for his father's death but cannot possibly do so without his eyes, which have been taken away by his uncle. Mortal hero Bek (Brenton Thwaites) finds one of Horus' eyes that has special powers, locates his whereabouts and teams up with him. Their mission: kill Set and restore order to the once peaceful and prosperous empire.The acting is simply atrocious. There's Gerard Butler's Scottish accent which seems so out of this place in this movie. There's Chadwick Boseman who camps it up as Thoth, the god of writing and knowledge. There's Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau who delivers a wooden performance. There's Geoffrey Rush as Ra, the father of Horus and Set. He must have been in it for the money for this is one of his worst ever performances. At least Brenton Thwaites provides a hero that the audience can cheer for with his energetic and kinetic portrayal of the mortal who wins the trust of Horus. Even if the movie is aimed at generating escapism qualities, it doesn't excuse the awful dialogue. Here is an example of the dialogue that will make you wince: While Set is battling Bek, he asks him where Horus' eye is. Bek replies with, "Up your arse along with the goats!" There should have been some script editing in the development process.There are several exciting action scenes which try to cover up the deficiencies in script and acting. It's only when the actors start talking again that you realise you have to endure further pain. The action sequences keep you awake, unfortunately the acting and dialogue do not. Where has the 140 million dollars gone? Most of it has probably gone to the visual effects which is predominantly CGI. It's not even state of the art CGI with some scenes looking decidedly fake. There is one scene involving a waterfall which is obvious to everyone that it has been generated by computer. Alex Proyas is the director and he has made a few decent films like "I Robot", "Dark City" and "The Crow". "Gods of Egypt" isn't one of them. He has gone out of control with trying to make this a visual spectacle by bombarding his audience with as many CGI effects as possible. Movies intended for the big screen still need to have a reasonable script and half-decent acting performances!</fullReview>

All the actresses in this film are incredibly bland...so it's balancing out as shite on the scale so far.Then there's the CGI...holy cow is there CGI. I believe this film has more of it than the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy combined. Not joking. I bet there's CGI in every single freaking scene of the movie! It really started to feel like my eyes were going to burn out of my sockets after almost an hour of watching it...and then getting a headache knowing I still had an hour more to sit through.The main character is an idiot and is also terribly bland. I think the only *kind of tolerable* character was Horus...even then I knew this movie was doomed. I just sat there tapping my fingers on my seat as the credits rolled by slowly. The movie theater was almost packed yet nobody clapped. Me and an elder woman booed. I wouldn't have been surprised if anybody else would have joined me if they weren't with their girlfriends or boyfriends or 12 year old kids.Don't go see this movie. I am shocked at how much it costed to make and have a feeling it's going to be a bomb. I'm sorry, but I predict it. Go see any other movie, but stay clear from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gerard Butler steals show in old-school action adventure tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are sick of today's self serious Hollywood tent-poles, this is the perfect antidote, a harmless entertainment that tells an entertaining adventure story in a great new choice of setting - ancient Egypt, something we have never seen before.Brutal God of Darkness Set (Gerard Butler) interrupts the coronation of his nephew Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), ruthlessly pulls out Horus's eyes from his eye sockets and banishes him, beds Horus' girlfriend, the Goddess of Love Hathor (Elodie Yung) and wreaks much general havoc. Horus then reluctantly teams up with a salve (Brenton Thwaites) to rescue Egypt from this monster.The movie keeps the tale simple and alternates by turns between various lead characters keeping the story nicely moving along. Now strictly speaking, the setting is not exactly ancient Egypt but more like a fetishized version of. Its more like a fantasia with an Egyptian theme. As such any bearing to reality is absolutely zero and the movie shouldn't be criticized on that front.The movie is often visual dazzling to an extreme. Alex Proyas is a great visualist and crafts some memorable images, specially visions of the afterlife and of sun god Ra towing the sun around the earth. But the special effects leave something to be desired, they are not most refined.The action scenes too are engaging but nothing out of this world. All feels a little bit been there, seen that. But the actors definitely turn in engaging performances.Top amongst them is Gerard Butler, who brings back some of the firepower from his outstanding performance in 300. Butler gives a fantastically over the top macho performance complete with bulging biceps and intimidatingly stacked musculature, loud Scottish intonation and enormous swagger as he overwhelms all before him. This is the kind of entertaining uber-masculine performance that Butler excels at and which many old Hollywood A-listers pulled off but which few modern actors can manage. Think of Set as King Leonidas, only with more clothes and less nudity, and a bad guy instead of the hero.As the hero Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gives a decent performance as the brash Horus who is humbled before he saves the day. Waldau looks the part of a god, with a handsome visage and cut abs but seems a touch muted and is easily eclipsed but Butler's dynamism.Special mention should go to Elodie Yung who is a sight to behold and holds her own as the Goddess of love. Enormous beauty and screen presence combine to create a memorable foil for the dueling testosterone soaked gods.Its fun movie overall, go for a matinée, be entertained and do not expect think too much about what it all means and you will be delighted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What in Ra's name was Gods of Egypt supposed to be? It's so bad that it's kind of enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years ago, I was at the California Science center in Los Angeles where I got to see an exhibit on Ancient Egypt based on the pharaoh Cleopatra. The experience featured several artifacts from the era that have been collected below the Mediterranean Sea and showcased a time full of gods and a collective tribute to the afterlife. This was one of my favorite museum pieces and reminded me that I used to really enjoy the history of ancient Egypt back when I was a kid. I think it was the fact that the Egyptian world was both beautiful with its pyramids and gold and disgusting with its obsession with death. Ancient Egypt has been present in a lot of biblical based features like The Ten Commandments and The Prince of Egypt. The fascination of the country grew upon even more with the discovery of King Tut and the curses supposedly set upon those that opened the tomb. Presenting it in film is nothing new, but I can honestly say I have not seen anything about the Egyptian gods like Ra and such. Gods of Egypt does this and is a throwback to classic sword and sorcery movies like Jason and the Argonauts. Though the setting is ancient Egypt, the story is set in an alternate world where the Earth is flat and the gods rule over the mortals. In fact, King Osiris is about to hand the throne over to his son Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), but a surprise visit from Set (played by Gerald Butler), one of the sons of Ra, changes everything. Set kills Osiris, takes Horus' eyes, and takes the throne. A year passes under the new rule where mortal Bek (played by Brenton Thwaites) is a common thief who is looking for his love, Zaya.Zeya gets killed and Bek decides that exiled god Horus is the only one who can bring her back. He takes her to him, but Horus says that he needs his eyes back in order to bring back the dead (and to be able to change into a god-like animal). They strike a deal to get the eyes in exchange for saving Zaya's soul in the afterlife. The briefly receive help from Ra (played by Geoffrey Rush) in his floating vessel above the Earth before returning to finish the quest. They are racing against the clock as Set is obtaining godly items in order to increase his power. Gods of Egypt is so fascinating! Not that it's a good movie (not at all!), but this is an example on how one can take an intriguing idea for an adventure and do almost everything wrong with it. The script is wrong, the castings wrong, the effects are wrong, and the overall direction is all over the place. The movie has gained controversy for having no Egyptian actors and it's weird how not only are there no Arabic people of any kind, but the majority is white (its even more embarrassing with Gerald Butler doing his thick Scottish accent in an Egyptian world).I have no idea how lazy the director was, but you'd think he would have taken another look at the computer effects and realize that maybe their not done yet. It's obvious that the majority of the film was made in front of a green screen. The lighting never convinced me once that they were outdoors. While some of the background shots look cool, most of the monsters and magical elements seem more like out of a video game then a Hollywood movie (I had this problem with Maleficent). These people need to learn from Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars: The Force Awakens with how proper effects are pulled off. I'll give this two Egyptian Ra's out of ten. I cannot recommend this as a genuine good movie, but I can recommend it for something else. Like how Battlefield Earth and The Room were made, Gods of Egypt is so bad that within its demented sense, it's actually kind of enjoyable. I could easily see this as an easy target for comedians to point out all the problems. So if your looking for something to laugh at and not with, ?wait for this to come out on DVD and put yourself in an strange Egyptian mind frame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's so bad I had fun laughing at it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously have a hard time understanding how this movie got made. There is hardly anything good about it. I really don't get why I saw what I saw, nothing in the movie made sense. I didn't give it a 1/10 because I liked some things: The girl Zaya is so beautiful, every time she's on screen I can enjoy her. The guy who plays Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones was likable. That's pretty much everything what is good in this movie. I don't even know where to start with listing the bad things. I will start with one thing that bothered me straight away: the showing of the title. When they showed the title after the opening logos they threw a really loud music bit at it and I knew that was going to be an issue (I saw it in IMAX so everything was enhanced). Throughout the entire movie it tries to be so loud that I thought I was going deaf. Some sound effects and music bits are so incredibly loud that you can't understand what is going on. I also thought I was going blind at some points, the light switches on and off so much at points that it really is blinding. Also I was getting a headache, the camera-work is so dumb that it made me dizzy.Of course the entire movie is made in the computer, the title of the movie should be CGI of Egypt because none of it looked like Egypt. You can clearly see that everything is shot in a green screen studio because the lights on the actors never match any lights in the background. Also every background looks fake and 2-dimensional. Even the CGI on the gods is so noticeably bad, I laughed every time they changed. I laughed so hard at the changes because it looked absolutely terrible it was really funny.If you look at more basic movie terms like pacing, tone, cinematography, writing, directing, it fails at every single thing. The writing was so bad, you can tell that nobody thought there was actual "clever writing". The directing is hardly there, nobody delivers a good line and nothing made sense. The tone changes so drastically throughout the movie, every scene is vastly different from the previous one that you can't focus on what actually is going on. I think I tuned out completely after 15-20 minutes. The pacing also shifts drastically, I never had a clue how much time actually passed because it switches so much it's hard to understand. And the cinematographer was either drunk or high, the look of the movie even changes every 5 minutes that it's really hard to get what they were going for.So with all that said, I can say this is absolutely terrible but when you can rent the DVD you should see it because it's so bad, you'll laugh a lot. I had a great time watching the movie because my critical brain switched on and laughed at every incredibly bad thing. 2/10 because I had fun watching it and it had very few redeeming bits in there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first word the came to my mind when the movie was over was "Pain", it was so painful. All of it's god awful acting, writing, insulting CGI and obvious green screen is just so unbearable. I won't lie, I had a very fun time laughing at this movie and making fun of it for the first 30-45 minutes but then it just gets repetitive with the slo-mo 360 cam in every scene. It's a falsely advertised love story that looks like it has a peanut butter sandwich budget but actually has the budget of a drug dealers house ($140 Million). Let's be honest the only reason I saw this movie is because the poll on twitter one. In the end, it's a forgettable mess that was unfunny repetitive and painful. I'm giving this one a 2/10 or a F.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to give this a 6.5, but I had to choose between 6 and 7 and so I rounded up. The best way for me to describe to someone who may want to see the movie what they are in for is to compare it to a Transformer movie. It's full of visual effects and a good amount of action, with a very simple plot. The movie has more humor in it than I thought it would. However, it does run a bit long and at times I just wanted the plot to move forward a bit faster. I try to keep my reviews short and to the point. If you are looking for a mindless action flick with lots of special effects, then this would be it. If you don't like action for the sake of action, simple plots, and iffy acting; then I would pass on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short because I don't want this movie to waste any more of your life than it has to.Garrish, oversaturated, blindingly horrendous CGI effects. It's so bad a cartoon would seem more realistic.Much of the acting is less than stellar with wooden delivery at times. The story is tired, cliché, boring and predictable. It never feels as though there is anything at stake. The characters were poorly developed. Not only did I not feel any connection with them, I didn't WANT to have any connection with them.I loved some of Proyas' other films (Dark City, The Crow) and really wanted him to succeed. It was only out of support for him I went to go see this film and had extremely low expectations given the negative reviews. Unfortunately, after seeing it, many of these negative reviews gave him way too much credit. It's obviously not the worst movie ever made, but it's so difficult to sit through I don't care about the difference.</fullReview>

Sure it was for effect, but there's such a thing as too much of a good thing.The writers of this movie borrowed ideas from many other movies. For example, the stone bridge crumbling under the guy in a cavern while he makes his way to safety. It's all downhill from there.If you like costume dramas, the price of admission might be worth it, but for everyone else, stay home and save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of note, I adore this type of silly romp and Gerard Butler is one of my absolute favorites. With that said, could they possible have done a worse job of casting the leads in this movie (It was as if he reprized One Two from, Rocknrolla, but wearing "godly" armor)? There are many excellent actors out there that would have been able to pull off the leads: take Oded Fehr for example; while not from Egypt, he's at least from the same continent and has the look, talent and comedic timing, sorely missing in this movie, to make an excellent Horus (Amr Waked would have made an wicked Set). Pretty much any decent actor would have filled the role of the young hero better than the insipid portrayal by Brenton Thawaites.Visually this was enjoyable and I wanted to like it. The $17.00 for the (3D) ticket was the only thing that kept me from walking out.</fullReview>

At times it felt like the camera shots where framed to far at times. East Enders in Africa is how I would describe this for friends.

		<fullReview>Saw this movie at an advanced screening and i would definitely have paid to see this movie. The movie in short is about two brothers (gods) who want to be ruler of Egypt and fight each other for power. I didn't give to much away as this is one of those movies you really need to see. There is a lot of cgi and some people may not like that. However i feel that the cgi was so beautifully done like the way avatar was that it transports you to another world, which is what movies are supposed to do. To see this in 3d was just breathtaking. The pyramids and architecture was just so monumental and larger than life. The fight scenes were extremely well done. I think the actors did good for the type of movie it is. it easily looks like they spent 250 mil to make it . I give this movie a 10 and i look forward to it coming on Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will be astonished how bad this movie is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I would sum up the plot before starting to explain my reasoning of the score I gave it. In this instance the plot to Gods of Egypt doesn't matter. Me trying to explain it would bore you as much as the movie itself. It may even beat my worst movie of all time. So I am going to attempt to write my review so bare with me.Back in November when the first posters dropped for this movie, I looked at them and thought to myself "Wow, this film is going to be horrendous". Unfortunately, I was right. Gods of Egypt is a terrible movie, but it could have fallen into "so bad, it's good" territory had director embraced the absurdity of the material and the dreadful tone of the film. Gods of Egypt takes itself way to seriously, drowning in scowls and super serious business talk regarding how the gods rule the world. Had this been a more faithful of Egyptian mythology, it may of even worked. All they had to do was have some fun with it but not even that was possible. Every actor in this movie is lifeless or nonsensical.There's a big difference between bravery and stupidity. Everything characters in this movie does relies on luck and not even the action sequences can invest you. No one smiles, or has emotions, no one says anything coherent, no one wants to be there. They just wanted a quick check. The only thing this movie has going for it is it's establishing shots. The cities look great. The rest of the CGI, nope. All of the rest of the settings and creatures look fake and cheap.Some shots are real but most are digital. There's also countless shots where it's impossible not to picture the actors surrounded by green screen. It looks like a middle school film contest runner up. I am not going to keep going on about this movie because it doesn't deserve my time. Overall, Gods of Egypt is just a big road trip movie with badly looking CGI everywhere. With no heart or caring that went into this production. This is a prime example of a lazy movie. Do not see this ever.</fullReview>

Nothing was engaging. I'm not normally a sci-fi, mythological, special effects, solid action type of movie-goer. I went to see "Thor" because it was all that was playing and LOVED it, because it was a good and very entertaining movie, snappy dialogue, etc.This movie was just plain awful. I couldn't believe the crappy special effects, especially in light of some of the amazing movies out lately (like Thor). The dialogue sucked. The big-God/little-mortal thing was creepy.I believe I've only walked out of two movies in my whole life: The Leopard with Burt Lancaster (yes, back when dinosaurs roamed the earth) and Wild Hogs (but I rented that, so I it doesn't really count).

		<fullReview>Should be called Transformers of Egypt.I don't even know where to begin when talking about this terrible film. This film already stole 2 hours of my life that I'm never getting back, therefore this review is not going to be particularly long.First- The CGI us atrocious. So many special effects are laughably bad. My favorite is when Bek is trying to get where the gold is stored and swing from a rope into the bin that has all the gold. (You'll know it when you see it) Also the fact that Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau turn into mecha gods that battle each other. This literally good be a prequel to the transformer films. There's also the god of wrath who pumps himself up to gigantic size. Speaking of size it's jarring that the gods are larger than humans. It worked for films like Lord of the Rings, but here it is just awkward. The action goes from frantic jump cuts to over use of slowmo in seconds.Second- The script is weak and riddled with clichés. Any problem the characters get in is easily fixed by movie magic. There are no rules for the characters in this world. They can go anywhere and do anything that gets them to the end of the movie. Also the amount of cheese is strong in the dialogue. Not a single joke landed for me.Lastly- The only character that is slightly entertaining is Chadwick Boseman. He's in the movie just a little bit shorter than Gerard Butler. Whoever is Gerard Butler's agent needs to be fired. Every other character in this film is just going through the motions. That's not even mention the fact that the cast is predominately white in a film set in Egypt.Please don't waste your precious time on this awful movie. Guarantee this will be the first box office bomb this year!1 out of 10 ReelsPros -a few good looking shots Cons - Transformer God's - Bland Script - Terrible CGI - Weak White-washed Cast</fullReview>

An event where you leave the theatre "glamoured" by the sheer spectacle of seeing such wondrous sets and excitement. Alas not for me, it was a joy to watch but would have been so much better with the sound off and radio four on instead. Honestly, the script is so tragic with all the subtle nuances of Dora the Explorer. Imagine Thor with a screenplay written by Enid Blyton ... getting the idea? It'seems the script, it is truly insulting.See it at your peril, remember, you can give your time easily but you won't get your 2hrs 7mins back.

Can't believe there's even 5 star ratings for this film. lions gate needs to get it together and so do the reviewers . The fact this movie was even created makes me want to vomit . It's like casting a black man as the role of Hitler . Seriously sickened by this . only reason I haven't finished is because of the stupid IDBM guidelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has the dubious honor of being one of the few I have not been able to finish; no idea way it has such high marks here. The plot, if any seems to be written by a teenager; transformers seems a piece of art next to this low level work. I sincerely recommend people not wasting time with this movie. The opening of the movie in Egypt seems quite messy, and the battle that ensues makes whatsoever no sense, from my point of view. The CGI is not enough to mask what is lacking in other departments. As I said, I have not finished the movie, and have not whatever desire to come back to it again in a near future. It is a shame, because I do actually like films related to Egypt mythology, and the film had so much potential and background to draw on, that was wasted.</fullReview>
