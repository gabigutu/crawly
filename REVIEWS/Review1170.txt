		<shortDescription>Eastwood &amp; Hackman shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is about as far from the fantasy mythos of A Fistful of Dollars as Clint Eastwood could get. No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to 'play fair' and face the enemy on even terms. If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.Eastwood puts in an astonishing performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife. Now, desperately trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the bounty offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom's number has been savagely beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.The film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife's memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature. Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.While all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film's stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.One of the greatest Westerns ever made? Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary. In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man. Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Requiem for a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven will always be the last Western. No matter what comes after it, Tombstone, The Missing, or Wyatt Erp, Unforgiven has the final word. Not that I wouldn't characterize those films as Westerns, but the spirit of Unforgiven, from the opening shot of the house with the scrawny tree and lonely grave, to the end which returns there, is imbued with the finality of a spent genre. The feelings evoked are ambivalent and distant, much like the characters within Unforgiven itself. Perhaps Clint Eastwood's genius lies partially in that he doesn't allow for us to mourn. It wouldn't be western to cry because a story-form is over, it wouldn't be leather to empathize for a broken man who doesn't want your sympathy, it wouldn't be spurs to despair about the implacable and corrupt forces of life which turn men like William Munny into killers. Clint Eastwood presents to the audience the most distorted configuration of the western; the most disfigured example of a genre whose classical conventions were untouchable and sacrosanct. We have no heroes and no villains, only a protagonist and a puffed up sheriff who thinks he's doing the right thing (and does in fact have more moral vision than the dried out killer) The movie itself is riddled with identity crises, the killer has turned into a farmer and a father, the young gunslinger is a virgin to bloodletting, the sheriff shows signs of being a slave master, and the innocent one gets it first and gets it dirty. Gone are the days of the Magnificent 7 where one rode into town, rallied the brave cowpokes with shiny silver pistols, and dispatched an easily recognizable enemy. Gone even are the days of Bonnie and Clyde where gunslingers were attractive and fascinating to the audience, exuding flair, charisma, and sparking the imagination. They were legends; William Munny is a sad bit of history. He is presented with deadpan honesty, not as a caricatured Tarantino assassin, or a misunderstood old man who has atoned for past wrongs. He is a broken human person, so lost along the moral frontier that the only compass he can grasp is more killing. Throughout the movie, we are reminded again and again of the stark contrast Unforgiven stands in to most other Westerns, by the obsequious scribe W. W. Beauchamp. He was the one who wrote the John Wayne stories, (the ones with ethical clarity at least). He was the one who coined phrases like "high-noon" and "hot lead". In Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood, takes apart the classical western narrative piece by piece allowing the audience to inspect the illusion. Characters like English Bob are unscrupulous frauds, ladies in distress are revenge bent whores, and old men really don't ever change for the better. They become that way when sensationalized by hack storytellers like Beauchamp. And when the only character materializes who seems to at least fit the description of gunslinger, Munny is so empty and hopelessly unheroic that we begin to reconcile ourselves to the end of the Western. Where else is there to go? We understand how the old stories were crafted thanks to the insider's view provided by Beauchamp, and what's left is a craggy faced cadaver with a dead wife, a dead friend, and two forgotten children.Every character within Unforgiven inhabits a gray zone that clouds the audiences's ability to easily categorize them as good or evil. We are forced to come to a more nuanced understanding of each as a human being with redeeming as well as corrupt qualities. The two cowboys committed a horrendous crime by knifing the prostitute, but did they deserve death, especially the young one, who didn't do the knifing, clearly felt remorse, and tried to make a peace offering? The whores are right to demand justice, but do they ever take into account the wishes of the victim, who if anything seems to strike some romantic sparks with the young cowboy. By the film's end, they are bloodthirsty sirens screaming at the body of the dead young cowboy. The sheriff Little Bill, compounds the opening crime by allowing it to go unpunished, but later exposes English Bob and tries to keep people from getting killed--(is he protecting unrepentant criminals, or is he allowing old wounds to heal?) And of course there's Munny himself, who won't pay to touch a woman but will kill prolifically for a purpose that is murky at best. By Unforgiven's end, the audience feels alienated from characters and message. The conclusion of William Munny's life is narrated by a cold, impersonal voice that labels him a scoundrel, but doesn't care enough to waste much breath condemning him. We are left with the image of the homestead, the center and heart of the Western film, where man attempted to master the wildness within his environment and himself. This house is empty and abandoned, its only companion the forlorn grave memorializing a genre which has passed away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There may never be another real western. Clint appears to be done with the genre and there really isn't anyone else I can think of that can do it Properly. Sergio Leone is gone. William Wellman is gone. Sam Peckinpah is gone. John Huston is gone. John Ford is gone. Howard Hawks is gone.Kevin Costner tries hard but he just doesn't get it. Dances With Wolves wasn't really a western. It wasn't even an anti-western. It was more like a political indictment of the actions of the Americans of the time. For all that I did enjoy it.Most of the others since Unforgiven are movies where somebody decides to put the characters on a horse, but the story is just generic pap. Nobody has the balls to make something with a meaning.I will grant that Deadwood is a truly excellent series but it isn't a movie.That's why I believe that Unforgiven is a fitting end to the western genre. I won't get all rhapsodic and spout a bunch of crap about how Clint made this movie as a symbol of the end of the western. Cuz that's a load of crap. The script had been around since the early 70s when things were still going strong. What it is, is a movie that shows us that there is no black and white in any time. There are only shades of grey.It is also just as dirty and violent as things actually were for most people in that era. Life was comparatively cheap and most people didn't have much hope of justice. The middle class was very small and the upper class was tiny. The vast majority belonged to the under-classes.Good guys didn't wear white hats and not every sheriff was a good guy. Some were violent and corrupt braggarts and bullies. Little Bill mocks English Bob's self-promotion, but at the same time he knocks Bob down he builds himself up. He doesn't bother with courts or judges and he is his own executioner. He isn't motivated by any innate sense of justice when he deals with any criminal elements. It's more that he takes it as an insult to his own power.William Munny is a killer, plain and simple. He has human feelings but basically he is unrepentant. He changed for his wife, but like many changes it wasn't permanent. He won't sleep with a whore but when he needs money he is willing to kill for it. At the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. And somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him. A classic anti-hero.Rather than being about the end of the Western genre I believe that it is actually an ode to what came before it. Sergio Leone would have been proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" may well be Clint Eastwood's greatest triumph as an actor and director. In this grim, dark, and yet strangely beautiful story of former gunslinger William Munny (Eastwood), who comes out of retirement for one last job, Eastwood deliberately sets out to demystify the old West. This is evident in the conversations between Munny and the Schofield Kid (Jaimze Wolvett), who has a romanticized image of the old-time gunfighters, and between sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) and hack journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek). Yet the "demythologizing" message doesn't feel forced; it is woven effortlessly into a gripping story that powerfully conveys the human cost of violence.Moral ambiguity pervades the film, which has no easy resolutions and no customary clear lines between good and evil. Will and his friend Ned (Morgan Freeman), nominally the heroes, have clearly done many bad things in their lives. When they come to Big Whiskey as hired killers, it is ostensibly for a just cause -- to punish two no-good cowboys who slashed the face of a prostitute. Yet, as we know from the beginning, the version of the attack that is reported to Will and Ned is highly and grotesquely exaggerated. While the cowboys certainly should have been punished, we may legitimately wonder if death is a punishment that fits the crime. The agonizing death of the younger of the two cowboys, who didn't do the slashing and clearly felt bad about what his partner had done, certainly doesn't look like justice.The ostensible villain, Little Bill, is not just a villain. He is a sheriff determined to preserve law and order in the town. One can't blame him for wanting to keep paid assassins out. In a violent society, there's no way he can do his job without using violence. Unfortunately, he also takes a sadistic pleasure in his brutality -- even though he also seems to want a peaceful, quiet life in the house he's building.One might say that Munny's heroics in the guns-blazing climax undercut the film's purpose of dismantling the mystique of the Old West and its gunfighters. But the truth is, "Unforgiven" is both an homage to and a deconstruction of that mystique. While Munny acquires almost mythic stature in that scene, his actions are still morally shady, and his exchange with the nerdy Beauchamp quickly dispels the romantic aura. What's more, his "rise" to heroism can also be seen as a fall from grace and a reversion to his old ways.The film may be just a tad slow at times, but at 2 hrs 10 minutes, it remains nearly always gripping. (As for those IMDB reviewers who've knocked the movie because there are too many scenes where Eastwood's character is weak and pathetic, falling off his horse or getting beat up -- why don't you just go see some Arnold Schwarzenegger flick!) Not only are the principal characters well-developed, but even minor characters come across as real people with individual traits; the credit is due both to the excellent screenplay and to the superb cast. The scenes between Will Munny and Delilah, the prostitute who was slashed, are very touching without being at all "sappy." Eastwood is simply superb as the tortured and self-loathing Munny; Gene Hackman fully matches him as Little Bill; Morgan Freeman exudes a quiet dignity as Ned; Wolvett acquits himself well as "the Kid." Add to this a scene-stealing performance by Richard Harris as the elegant, vicious gunslinger English Bob, and terrific work by Saul Rubinek, Frances Fisher as the prostitute Strawberry Alice, and Anna Levine as Delilah."Unforgiven" is a modern classic, a must-see for those who appreciate intelligent, high-quality filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'A Man With No Name' Becomes 'A Man With A Real Story'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's storytelling gives the western genre one of its most sublime story's. Gone is the trademark mysterious hero and in its place is an ex gunman who made his peace when he met his wife. Eastwood has transcended traditional entertainment to storytelling craftsmanship. He delivers rich characters with deep rooted problems inextricably linked to the villains of the story. Refusing to wither and die away, style has been perfectly adapted with age thus ensuring his maturation into a true Hollywood legend.Besides his now distinctive storytelling, there are numerous factors that make this a landmark Western. The ensemble cast could not have been stronger and there were no weak performances. The soundtrack accentuates the intended atmosphere of the director. A single detracting factor I could find only just qualifies as such. Munny's whimsical lines seemed a little contrived at times. They droned on like pale attempts to capture the Western era. But this is a consequence of the fact that they were more to do with the character of William Munny. He is after all a reformed killer with a now passive approach to people. Given this fact and also that it may have been distracting since it was so out of sync with what we are used to seeing from Eastwood, I still have to list it as a demerit on the account it slightly jerked me out of the story.Hollywood producers have to satisfy audience preferences if investments are going to accrue profits. It is the nature of the beast. The action and more specifically the Western genre will stick to tried and tested formulas in order to guarantee audience acceptance. But every so often you get people who as a natural consequence of their unique character appeal are able to deliver a story that is outside these understandably restrictive boundaries. Eastwood is a cool individualist who normally plays characters who are not team players and do it their own way. His own way this time is to give the western genre a real story oozing characterization. A sort of ballad for the bad guy.The ballads tune provides the story with a sad, introspective mood, within the opening and closing scenes. The opening scene depicts Munny in his new found life. He is cured of his wicked ways, helped by his dear, departed wife. But men are not willing to forgive or forget his monstrous deeds and in the final scenes he is who he has to be. Such is the sorrowful life of William Munny.Westerns are typified by clearly defined goodies and baddies, but this is definitely not the case here. Eastwood and Freeman play reformed killers who find circumstances drawing them once again to their evil ways. But the older and wiser men now realize the value of life and come face to face with their troubled consciences. This is unlike their na?ve, young partner who is attracted to the bravado image of the killer and relishes taking a man's life. This moral issue is virtually taboo for the classic western which glamorizes the lawlessness and the hero attraction of the gunslinger. This is also why in my view no-one besides Eastwood should have handled this movie.Then we have the juiciest character of the movie superbly played by Gene Hackman worthy of the weight of every micro granule of his Oscar. He is the epitome of every hard-line lawman that ever was. The misguidance of the so called righteously empowered, swinging the hammer against evil for good. Hackman must have salivated when he read the script since there was obvious relish in his performance. All the better for the movie, and of course for Eastwood at the Oscars. By far the best performance and the others were good further underlining the talent of the man.The antagonist of the movie is almost always the most complex and thus most interesting to analyze. His vain attempts at carpentry are his way of trying to appear to be a good man. There is purity in building ones own home and it is this wholesomeness that he wishes to capture. In that way his fellow citizens will see him as a simple man only wanting to lead a righteous life. But his inability as a carpenter is indicative of his depravity. He cannot be a good man. The source of his drive is anger and hatred. It is through this failing that we realize he cannot escape who he is.Indeed it was not only the power of the script that gave the audience a spellbinding climax, but the talents of the actors. The actors' characterizations deliver the audience a spellbinding climax. It is only through Hackman's performance that we not only acknowledge his ending as inevitable, but also as deserving. We saw him as a man who virtually thought that he was righteously empowered to rid the earth of Munny and his kind What he thought was an honorable task was one rather of abuse and suppression. He became the baddie in the eyes of the audience and it is he who the audience wants to see justice served upon. Munny was so weak throughout the movie that the eruption of his evil ways captured the interest of the audience. He transformed into the Eastwood of old ? the anti hero with a far more malevolent presence. Never could we have sensed this hatred and evil that we now see in William Munny. It is now that the frivolity of his mannerisms that I touched on in the beginning adds to the story as it helps to accentuate the turn in character. He is now only a killer, in it neither for money or fame as the writer nearly finds out to his tragic detriment.Those who have only seen his Westerns of old or the 'Dirty Harry' movies may enter the cinema with expectations of such like will either be disappointed or pleasantly surprised. It is the atypical western and an unfamiliar portrayal by Eastwood. But I believe that most people will have the latter reaction. The differences are their strengths helped by the fact that it was a superbly crafted movie with a meaningful story and thought provoking lessons for our heroes and villains. Eastwood was directly suited to the roles that we identify him with, but it is exactly because of this suitability that he eases into the role of Munny. No mellowing with age, no identification with the mainstream, he has always done it his way, and he is so good that any way could be his way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy the transformation of Clint Eastwood's character throughout the movie. In the beginning he reluctantly becomes a gunfighter but as the movie progresses you see how he slides down the slippery slope of wickedness to become the cold-blooded killer needed for the task. Morgan Freeman's reaction to the transformation is well played also. Richard Harris' character is colorful as is his sidekick. Gene Hackman's sheriff is pleasantly atypical of the role. All these actors and their characters effectively leave the viewer with a myriad of directions from which the movie expertly entertains. If you are expecting anything like Clint's "spaghetti westerns" you will be disappointed. If you are looking for an excellent story with characters that all have varying degrees of wickedness, you will be satisfied when its all said and done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the west was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a revelation, a western that DOESN'T LIE. The whole theme stripping away the mythology our culture has built around the west, scraping it away like the finish on a mirror and reveling the ugliness AND the humanity beneath. I was utterly convinced, both by the portrayal of the period and the reality of the characters. A large focus was its treatment of the subject of killing. The movie SHOWS US what it is like to kill a man, a stark stark contrast to the casual attitude taken by so many other westerns. We see what we already know, wild west or no, that killing is something that most people just aren't capable of. And yet the character of William Munny shows us that in spite of the mundanity he embodies in his later life, true evil still existed then as now, and every now and then, true heroism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ford, Hawks, Leone, Peckinpah, all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema, transforming what started as low-budget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism, classic tragedies, and legendary adventures. Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre, as his acting career began as the legendary "Man With No Name" in the Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director, he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like "High Plains Drifter" and "Pale Rider", but finally in 1992, Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western, and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre: "Unforgiven", an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.Clint Eastwood himself plays William Munny, a former gunslinger who is now living a peaceful life as a farmer with his two children. However, life is very difficult for Munny's family, as since the death of his wife the family has been facing financial problems. One day a young man calling himself "The Schofield Kid" (Jaimz Woolvett) appears looking for Munny. The Kid tells Munny about a bounty offered in the town of Big Whisky, and offers him the chance to join him as hired gun and split the reward between them. While Munny's days as a murderer are in the past, he decides to join him after thinking about the farm's problems, but not without calling his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join them. However, Munny's past as a notorious thief and murderer will return to haunt him in this last mission, as the Kid shows a true and honest admiration for Munny's fame as a gunslinger, even when Munny himself considers his past as villainous.While better known for his work in science fiction, David Webb Peoples' screenplay proves to be a very accurate description of life in the American west, particularly concerning the aspects of the uses and abuses of violence in that era. It is in fact the use of violence what comes as the main theme of the story, as Munny is escaping from his past's violence while the Kid is eagerly awaiting the next chance to prove his masculinity by the use of violence. The duality between man and myth is explored not only via the relationship between the Kid and Munny, but also in the shape of a character who writes novels about the wild west, and sees the figure of the gunslinger as an idolized modern hero. Peoples' screenplay is remarkably well written, as the many characters and their relationships are exhaustively explored, resulting in a character driven revisionism of the western, that in many ways criticizes the genre's origins as violent "Shoot 'em up" films.Peoples' script is definitely the movie's backbone, but it is Eastwood's masterful direction what transforms this meditation of violence into a unique revision of the Western. With a gritty and realistic approach very in tone with the script, Eastwood portraits the Wild West without romanticism and leaving out the mythic aspects of the genre, taking the revisionism of the Western one step beyond. Using Peoples' script, Eastwood takes a critic view on the figure of the "hero" in Westerns, focusing on the image of the gunslinger and the use of violence to solve problems. Visually, Eastwood has crafted his most impressive movie since "Bird", with an extensive use of shadows and light in the excellent work of cinematography by Jack N. Green. Eastwood's style, originated by the influence of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, and developed through many stages seems to finally have spawned its masterpiece in this film.As William Munny, Clint Eastwood is simply perfect in what at first sight looks like an extension of his earlier "Man with no name" persona. William Munny has a name, and a past he wants to escape from, and Estwood captures the image of guilt and regret to the letter. This is easily one of his best roles to date. Morgan Freeman is also very good as Ned Logan, although like Jaimz Woolvett (who plays The Schofield Kid), gets easily overshadowed by Gene Hackman's powerful performance as Little Bill Daggett. Hackman completely owns every scene he is in, showcasing his enormous talent in a very dramatic role. The legendary Richard Harris has a small appearance as another aging gunslinger, English Bob, in very memorable scenes where he demonstrates why he is considered one of the best actors of his generation.After starting his career playing a mythical hero in Leone's "Dollars" trilogy, it is actually fitting that is Eastwood who explores the figure of hero in his many movies. Ever since his first directed western, Eastwood showed an interest in the duality of the hero, taking a special interest in the archetype of hero portrayed in the classic 1953 Western, "Shane". Eastwood has explored this theme in many ways in the past: first as a true antihero ("High Plains Drifter"), then as a man becoming legend ("The Outlaw Josey Wales") and later as a true mythic hero ("Pale Rider"); all this culminates in "Unforgiven" as the ultimate demythologization of the concept, and his final ode to the Western genre. While the movie indeed feels a bit "preachy" at times, the story is devised in such a way that it never feels too heavy handed, as it unfolds nicely as a classic epic tale of the West.Personally, I can't praise this movie enough, as it is easily one of the best Westerns done since Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch", and required viewing not only for fans of the genre. While some consider it an "anti-Western", I think that with this movie, Eastwood's name can proudly stand along those of Ford, Hawks, Leone and Peckinpah as a master of the Western. "Unforgiven" is definitely Clint's masterpiece. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deeply melancholy and complex farewell to the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You just shot an unarmed man!" "Well, he should have armed himself..."Plenty of films have tried to examine the human side of violence. This is especially appropriate for westerns, where very often rows of men are gunned down without a thought. 'Unforgiven' does better than most, but where this differs from other films is that at the end this whole theme is flipped around as the outlaw William Munny (Clint Eastwood) pulls of a truly legendary piece of shooting. This scene though only emphasises a great sense of failure for the characters, which for me is the most prominent theme of the film. For most characters, their failures are obvious, but I won't give too many examples for fear of spoiling it. Look at the way the trio of Munny, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) are slowly whittled down to just Munny, as the others realise that they just don't have what it takes to kill people anymore. Munny, although carrying out his task to the full, has equally failed in his attempt to reform himself as he proves to himself that he is not a pig farmer after all, but still the legendarily cold blooded killer from years ago. Westerns have had different ways of looking at violence. Leone looked at the build up. Peckinpah looked at the violence itself. Eastwood here looks at the moment after the violence and shows the heartbreaking consequences. Given this it is all the more shocking to see just how merciless and devastating Munny's furious assault on the saloon really is, with him shooting unarmed and wounded men just for the sake of completeness. There is a question of motivations though-before he was in it for the money, but when a personal element is added to the mix the results are volcanic. But this is no blaze of glory for Munny, but something that has to be done, and although treated in a callous way there is a sense that this will have consequences as far reaching as before. Munny has failed in his attempt to reform himself, and the purpose of his life is defeated. There is a suggestion that Munny is damned-there is a moment in the carnage where Munny stops for a drink. The scene is shot so that Eastwood appears to have no reflection the large mirror placed above the bar. More obvious is the following exchange between Munny and Sheriff Dagget (Gene Hackman):"See you in Hell, William Munny" "Yeah."The way the climax is presented would be perhaps more appropriate for a more lurid western, with most shots going wild-far more shots are fired than are strictly necessary, in true action film tradition. This is just the point though, as the end is supposed to be at odds with the grittily realistic nature of the rest of the film. The end result is a powerful message powerfully put across.That is not to say that other westerns that do not necessarily share this sentiment (at least to this level) are less powerful-the theme of 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is equally strong and affecting, but the message is different and presented in a different way. 'Unforgiven' proves though, both to the writer W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) and to the audience, that there is a flip side to every story and a dark side to every man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly Thought-Provoking on How Much a Life is Worth and the Inner Workings of a Man With a Regrettable Past.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1992, Clint Eastwood created the last and greatest western; 'Unforgiven'. A tribute to the previous masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, who died within a mere 3 years before this brutal masterpiece.Eastwood stars as William Munny a retired gunslinger with a guilt-filled past. He lives alone with his two children and grave of his young wife outside. One day a young cowboy, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), comes in need of his service to hunt down some men who cut up a whore. William reluctantly accepts and with the help of Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) they work together to track down the criminals. Meanwhile, the sheriff of the town, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is also looking for them. This then leads to a bloody showdown climax, welcoming back a sort of 'Man With No Name' character to the genre.William Munny is a cold-blooded killer. The Schofield Kid wants to be one. But, all the murders and sins Munny used to commit has affected him in an extraordinary way. He takes no hesitation in killing. In the climax he just walks past a man he shot who didn't die and shoots him dead. It may sound like nothing now, but he just took a life for no apparent reason. When the Kid kills his first man, of which deserved it, he hesitates. This is The Kid who is so eager to kill people as he thinks it will make him a man. But after the assassination, he breaks down. He realized what he had done. He had wiped another man of the earth. And Munny does it with ease. So does Little Bill. He is a violent and brutal cop who uses torture to get what he wants from the prisoners. Logan also finds it hard to take lives.The film studies on how much a life is worth. Sometimes it is worthless (see Tarantino or Scorsese films) and sometimes it is a major feature. Usually a film only does one. Unforgiven does both. A life isn't worth the same amount to each person. When a life is taken, it is the killer who decides how much it is worth by how much it affects him. Whether he just lets it slide (Munny and Little Bill) or kills someone and calls it a day (Kid and Logan), because they can't bring themselves to forgetting it. This is the most thought-provoking thing for me personally, ever.Unforgiven in my opinion is the greatest western. Actually, its the greatest film of all-time. It shows how violent it was back then, and the fact everybody was beaten. It is more realistic than any of Leone's 'Man With No Name' films (though I will admit they were set in a sort of fantasy land). But, Munny is not proud of his violent nature. He blames it on alcohol; which his wife persuaded him to quit to explain why he also gave up being a murderer. The film shows the cowboys as they really are, either cowards or killers. The choice of word 'coward' is to say that they should be killers, as that is apparently what a man is (an exaggeration) as most westerns glorify violence, but the men can't handle it.Clint Eastwood did an amazing job as William Munny. He showed how he regretted his past very well by admitting to it in a shameful way; like when asked if he killed women and children he replied "I've killed just about anything that walked or crawled at one time or another, and I'm here to kill you?". He even admits that he will meet Little Bill in Hell. Gene Hackman delivers one of the greatest performances of the decade, the tension he makes is incredible. Woolvett and Freeman remain in solid above average performances throughout.The script, written by David Webb Peoples, buzzed around Hollywood for nearly 20 years, even being rejected by some of the cast, before Eastwood picked it up. Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar for best direction. The plot flowed fluently with some surprises and memorable lines. An instant classic. The cinematography is much different that of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' or the others westerns Eastwood appeared in. It is a much cleaner and crisp view, yet also being extremely raw. The score, though not used often is very refreshing and moving.'Unforgiven' is an unforgettable look on life, man and the real west. One of the most powerful films of the '90s. A true triumph exploring important morals. Do not miss it.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint... He just rules!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is The movie that convinced me that "Clint" is indeed from a higher ground. Thoug, I've always considered Clint as a good actor,I didn't know about his capabilities as a director, he really never proved him self to me. This movie does all of that and more. Grovin up whit western movies, I would have to say that unforgiven is about whole new genre among western movies. Unforgiven is really a true statement of man's brutality and what he "or" she is capable of. Religion,marriage,children, doesn't change ones true identity. After all, when the "society" comes on you hard, the steps you are willing to take in real life, are sometimes desperate. I hope that this movie could be a bridge for those who don't like western movies, but do appreciate a decent manuscript and some fine acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's right. I'm just a fella now. I ain't no different than anyone else no more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman who's past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he's tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence: both physically and of the soul.Clint Eastwood signed off from the Western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture, the appropriation and irony of which is in itself a majestic point of reference. After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years (written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples), Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West. What is most amazing about Unforgiven's screenplay is how we the audience are firmly on Munney's side, we are, incredibly, influenced by Eastwood's part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney's obvious murky past (despicable crimes they be), we wait (and hope) for Munney to make a quip and way-lay the bad guys; actually, salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it's with enormous credit that Eastwood, and his magnificent cast and crew, manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with. It's not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is the critical character that nobody expected. Beauchamp is a writer of penny pulpy novels that tell of derring-do heroics, gunslingers with a glint in their eye and death dealt like an heroic encore, this gives Unforgiven its excellent sleight of hand, this West is grim and a destroyer of all illusions.Eastwood is greatly served by the actors around him here, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman (winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a script he turned down many years before!), Rubinek, Frances Fisher, Anna Thomson, Jaimz Woolvett and an incredible cameo from Richard Harris. Along with Hackman's win for his brutally tough portrayal of Sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett, Unforgiven also won Oscars for Eastwood for his clinically tight direction, Best Picture, Best Editing and was nominated for in another five categories. One of those nominations was for Jack Green's cinematography, which now, in this age of High Definition enhanced cinema, can be seen in all its wonderful glory. The Alberta location is magically transformed into the western frontier, with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes. Ultimately, tho, Unforgiven is a lesson in brilliant film making, across the board it works so well, why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre so well, having been its sole flag bearer for practically 25 years, and learning from his peers, Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark, an incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic feel of Western with the added brilliance of Clint Eastwood and an equally strong cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard quite a bit for "Unforgiven", also I want to seen all the best pictures from the 90's. I was also excited to see Morgan Freeman in the cast, so I know now that "Million Dollar Baby" was not Clint and Morgan's first experience together. They work so well as a team and bring nothing but sheer entertainment and charm to movies."Unforgiven" is a very good picture that has a real story and isn't just about "cops and robbers" or "cowboys and Indians". How far would you go for a friend? I loved Will and Ned's friendship so much because you could tell how much they had been through together and Will went back to his old ways in the blink of an eye for his dear friend. I loved watching Will's story through the movie, the first time you see him, he's just so charming and you would never had suspected of his former life of crime, alcohol, and bloodshed. Through the film, you have a lot of doubt for his character if he could go back to his old life despite his promises to his deceased wife. He, the Kid, and Ned go on a trip to kill two cowboys who cut up a prostitute's face for $1,000.00. Together, they learn that this isn't going to be such an easy task when the boys they're hunting down belong to a town where guns and all arms are banned that could lead to a punishment as far as death. But Will gets sick and the Kid and Ned give a lot of talk in killing these cowboys themselves, when Will is just half himself he does the deed himself in killing one of the cowboys. He tells Ned to go back home and he'll take care of the other cowboy, he does so but gets caught and beat to death by the sheriff.The Kid and Clint do the rest of the job by killing the other cowboy and receive their reward by the prostitutes, but Will learns of Ned and goes back into his old habits. What happens next? You'll have to watch yourself. Something that I learned that was interesting, Clint dedicated Unforgiven to Don Siegal and Sergio Leone, two directors who believed in him as a young actor. Unforgive is a remarkable film: methodical, deeply felt, with a devastating emotional and moral impact. It is easily one of the best Western movies. Like I said, it just has such a classic feel to it and you can't help but enjoy it. It seems like Clint might just own Hollywood one day. :) 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Unforgiven' is a magnificent piece of film-making, yet a dark and troubling study in violence and machismo... It revels in memorable statements of crudeness and cruelty... Munny sums it up best: "Hell of a thing killing a man. You take away all he's got. All he's ever gonna have."Aided by Jack N. Green's cinematography and Lennie Niehaus's music, Eastwood gives the film an ensemble portrait of sorrowful beauty... Clint Eastwood shows another face of the Old West... He is perfect as the unforgiven, the stone killer, whose eyes are full of brutally painful memories... Will Munny (Eastwood) is a retired bad man desperate for the 'whore's gold' to save his shabby farm, two kids, and sick animals in the vast emptiness of the Colorado range... Munny had a monogamous devotion to the wife he'd lost, and is forced to confront his own past no matters how he tries to avoid it...Eastwood is supported by some quite outstanding character actors whose performances are impeccable:Gene Hackman plays Little Bill Daggett, the town sadistic sheriff who rules with an iron fist, forbidding anyone to carry guns across the town limits... He is a lawman cold as ice, who hates "assassins and men of low character." He also despises reward-chasers and tries to humiliate them, revealing their cowardice and indecision... In his judgment, he declines to punish a crime in a way that the hookers consider appropriate...Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan, Munny's longtime honest partner, who ensures the compassionate balance that keeps his friend from sinking in a self-pitying haze of recklessness and bitterness, but he also launches Will into one of the bloodiest shootout in that untamed place... Richard Harris is English Bob, the egotistical gunfighter who desires to leave the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him... He now lives off his publicity, and is followed everywhere by W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), a writer of books, glamorizing the cover scene for purposes involving the market place...Frances Fisher is Strawberry Alice, the outraged brothel's madam, who has raised, with a group of oppressed women she works with, a thousand dollars to anyone who punishes the two attackers who slash her working girl's face...Jaimz Woolvett is Schofield Kid, the ignorant young rider who tries to make a name for himself... He shows up at Munny's place offering to split the reward, just for killing a couple of 'no good cowboys.'Anthony James is Skinny Dubois, the owner of the bar and brothel, who pays good money for Delilah, and wants compensation...Anna Thomson is the 'damaged property,' Delilah, the pretty prostitute whose disfiguration serves as the starting point for the story...Nominated for nine Academy Awards and winning four major ones, "Unforgiven" becomes only the third Western ever to win the Best Picture Academy Award after "Cimarron" (1930/31) and "Dances with Wolves" (1990).On screen, Eastwood dedicated the film to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, his master directors and professional mentors...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood at his finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Unforgiven, and I would like to say as a younger film-buff, I appreciate the classics (such as this film), more than most new releases today. Unforgiven takes the sometimes mediocre western genre and introduces the moral questions of life. Eastwood and Freeman are brilliant together, and you can also see their vibrant yet melancholy energy also conveyed in the more recent Million Dollar Baby.This film is definitely deserving of it's ranking in the top 250. Although I found the musical score at times a tad soppy, the startling settings will compensate for any loss in that part. As previous users have mentioned, the running time may seem arduous at first, but the gripping action interspersed throughout the film contrasted with the reflective traveling scenes will keep you engaged. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Greatest Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is arguably Producer/Director/Star Clint Eastwood's best western and perhaps his best film overall. It could be very well his last western (I hope not), and if it is he certainly went out on top.In the town of Big Whiskey a couple of cowboys are being "entertained" by the ladies of the local saloon. Suddenly one of the girls Delilah (Anna Thomson) is attacked by one of the men and is cut up and scarred for life. When sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett (Gene Hackman) refuses to suitably punish the men, the "ladies" led by Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher) pool their funds and post a reward of $1,000 to anyone who will hunt down and kill these men.Word of the reward reaches former gunfighter William Munny (Eastwood) who is now a widowed pig farmer with two kids, when a cocky young kid called The Schofield kid rides up to his farm and proposes that they join up as partners. Munny reluctantly agrees and enlists his former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join in.Word of the reward has also reached other bounty hunters like English Bob (Richard Harris) who arrives in Big Whiskey first. Realizing that he has to discourage such predators, Little Bill brutally beats up the gunfighter and drives him out of town. In the process Little Bill meets a pulp fiction writer named Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) who is writing stories about the gunfighters of the west. Little Bill is only too happy to provide him with such stories.Meanwhile the unholy trio arrive in Big Whiskey. Little Bill spots Munny in the saloon while the Kid and Ned are being "entertained" upstairs. Munny has become ill during the trip and Little Bill takes advantage and savagely beats him. The others rescue Munny and take him to safety where the "girls" nurse him back to health. The trio then hunt down and kill the two cowboys during which Ned loses his stomach for such killings and starts out for home.Ned is captured by the murdered men's friends and is brought into town where he is "questioned" by Little Bill to the extent that he is killed. Munny who had mellowed during his marriage, loses it, arms himself and heads into town for a showdown where.........."Unforgiven" was honored with several Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman. Eastwood's performance as the tragic Munny was also of Oscar calorie.Its hard to find a hero in this film. Eastwood, Freeman and Woolvett are after all, bounty hunters. By his own admission William Munny describes himself as someone who has killed women and children and just about everything that walks in his lifetime. Hackman's character has good intentions in discouraging the gunfighters but cannot control his hair trigger temper. The only sympathetic characters are the saloon girls as they try to find justice for their dishonored colleague.A great western! A great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Escape From The Fate That We Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead;When this was released the local dimwit in our paper said it was nihilistic. Please, it is incredibly life affirming. The psychological costs of killing people could not have been portrayed more powerfully by Eastwood. When he shoots the first one, the whole past washes over him; he hates being that monster again. He was drunk then, here he is sober. Besides beautiful photography, music, acting, writing and directing, I really can't recommend it. Seriously, it is an experience not a movie. It will stay with you all your life like all great films. Little Bill's subtle evil sadism not overstated like Raimi's awful The Quick And The Dead. Here, Hackman has a very complex interwoven characterization, just a little evil smile here and there while he is brutalizing someone. The architecture is a metaphor: he cannot create anything or put anything together; he only knows how to destroy or rip apart. When he hands the gun to Beauchamp he is hoping to kill him. Notice the contrast, how adumbrated his evil is, it is not loud and stupid like Quick And The Dead. Who will ever forget,"It's a hell of a thing killing a man, you take away all he's got and all he's ever going to have."I have read some objections to morally rape / assault returned with murder. This is zeitgeist backward projection. In this time period, they had the death sentence for rape; I might also point out horse thieving was also punished by death. It is important not to project our zeitgeist into a radically different world. Here, the legal code was severe because law was so far away spatially. The extra severity compensated for the time chasing after people. Hackman steals the movie; Munny wants so badly to escape from what he was. Events, specifically, Freeman's cruel death, trigger the regression. Who cannot remember that scene as he lowers the shotgun at all of them? His face is more frightening than the weapon. The hate and murderous rage, I love his spaghetti westerns but he was nowhere this developed an actor back then. The warrior's shyness and awkwardness with his feelings around women, the need for reassurance from an old friend and finally the inner monster returns: he conveys all this range with great power and skill. The music is beautiful and pensive we sense the tragedy before it ends.His remorse for his great evil is genuine and we feel, involuntarily, great sympathy for what he was forced to become again. His disaster as a farmer, trying, to be what he could never be. The pathos of the movie is deep and affecting; as I said, this is not The Outlaw Josey Wales. That movie was great but shallow. This displays the damage done to a person who kills others. Even the young guy is afraid of him when he hears the list of the evil he has done,"I'd rather be poor than dead." Munny is the most complex of all of Eastwood's depictions; his existential flight and deep guilt over his evil past haunt and torture the man. Yet, within the darkness which is this movie it is not nihilistic: life is affirmed and the cost of killing others is depicted mercilessly accurately. Do not believe me? Talk with veterans coming home from war. My favorite of all Eastwood's westerns; with modesty, he dedicated the film to Don Siegel and Sergio Leone. That is Clint Eastwood, a modest man who leaves it to others to praise him. A beautiful, haunting, deeply moral movie with great existential and spiritual power. A Real Work Of Art. Thanks, Clint"We Are Our Choices." Jean Paul Sartre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Truly Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood's tribute to his mentors, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. Regarded by many as the last true Western, Unforgiven is truly unforgettable. Though, it being the last true Western is subject to qualification, but it definitely consummates the genre. In fact, it will easily make it to the top 10 of the decorated genre, a genre illuminated by greats like Ford, Wayne, Leone, Peckinpah, and Eastwood himself. The movie not only revived Eastwood's career as an actor, but also certified his directorial prowess. Unforgiven doesn't embody righteousness, but projects domination, based on ruthless opportunism. It is a clash of egos, a battle of icons in Gene Hackman and Clint Eastwood, each ubiquitously acclaimed for his idiosyncratic style and delivery. The two scenes that they share in the movie are exact antithesis of each other, giving them a chance to display their protean skills. The first encounter between William Munny (Eastwood) and Little Bill (Hackman), portrays Munny at his most vulnerable, pitted against a brutally dominant and unforgiving Bill. The second encounter is a completely different affair, with Munny calling the shots, against a helpless Bill. The other scenes are equally brilliant, especially the one between English Bob (Richard Harris) and Little bill. The entire cast has performed really well, with a special mention of Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan. Unforgiven is undoubtedly, a quintessential Western and a must for the fans of the genre.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersWho would have thought it? During the eighties, when the cinematic Western was at its lowest ebb, I doubt if anyone could have predicted not only that two of the best films of the early nineties would be Westerns but also that both would go on to win 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards, something that only one film from this genre had done previously. Yet that is exactly what happened. First came Kevin Costner's 'Dances With Wolves', then Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. In both cases the star also acted as director. In Eastwood's case he was returning to the genre in which he first made his name; this was his first Western since 'Pale Rider' eight years earlier, which in turn was his first since 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' eight years before that.In 'Unforgiven', Eastwood plays a former gunfighter and robber named William Munny. (Pronounced 'Money'; there seems to be a tradition in Westerns of giving characters surnames which suggest they are for hire. There is Charlton Heston's Will Penny, and in 'Hannie Caulder' Robert Culp plays a hired gunman named Price). In his younger days, Munny was a hardened criminal, but he abandoned his life of crime when he married and settled down to life as a farmer. At the beginning of the film he is a widower, trying to raise two young children on his own. He is tempted to return to his former life, however, when he hears of a bounty of a thousand dollars which a group of prostitutes have placed on the heads of two drunken cowboys who badly injured one of their number by cutting her face with a knife. Abandoning his children to fend for themselves, Munny sets off to try and claim the money. He recruits a former associate, Ned Logan, and they are joined in their quest by a young man who calls himself the Schofield Kid and who is eager to make a name for himself as a gunfighter. They are not, however, the only men in search of the reward; an eccentric Englishman named English Bob, who has won himself an undeserved reputation as a Western hero, is also trying to track the cowboys down.The film reminded me of another Western, Michael Winner's 'Lawman' from the early seventies. That film has at its centre a sheriff whose inflexible determination to uphold the letter of the law at all costs leads to tragic consequences. 'Unforgiven' approaches the question of law enforcement from a slightly different angle. A key role is played by Gene Hackman's sheriff, Bill Daggett. Unlike that of Burt Lancaster's character in 'Lawman', Daggett's approach to the law is arbitrary and inconsistent. He can at times uphold the law with savage zeal. He is determined to protect the two cowboys from vigilantism, but in doing so, he transgresses the law himself, dealing out a brutal kicking to English Bob and an even more brutal flogging to Ned which results in the latter's death. Moreover, Daggett has himself created the need for vigilante justice by denying the full protection of the law to the injured prostitute. (The only punishment imposed upon the cowboys is an order to pay compensation to the woman's pimp for the loss of her economic value to him). There is, in fact, no character in the film who is entirely sympathetic. Munny starts the film as a reformed character, but slips back into his old ways when he is tempted by the prospect of money. He becomes, to borrow the title of another Eastwood Western, a man prepared to kill for a fistful of dollars. The lack of an easily identifiable hero is a common feature of modern 'revisionist' Westerns. Unlike some such Westerns, however, (Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' is a good example), 'Unforgiven' does not lack a moral centre. The Schofield Kid and English Bob have both been seduced by the dubious mythology of the West. The Kid, as his nickname suggests, is an inexperienced young man, but would like others to see him as a hardened and ruthless killer because he regards killing as something glamorous. Bob takes the credit for acts of violence which are wrongly attributed to him but which in reality he would be too cowardly to commit. Munny, for all his faults, can see Western mythology for what it is. Even when he is setting out to kill for money, he remains uncomfortably aware that "to kill a man, to take all he has and all he's ever gonna have" is a desperately serious business. In Ovid's phrase quoted in the title, he sees the better path, and approves, but follows the worse.The first half of the film can be slow-moving, but the second half is gripping, as the death of his friend Ned leads Munny to seek a bloody revenge. As with many Westerns, there are some attractive shots of the local scenery (the film is ostensibly set in Wyoming, but was actually shot in Canada), but the overall tone is a dark, claustrophobic one in keeping with the film's theme. Many scenes are set in gloomy interiors, whether bars, brothels or ranch-houses. One of the villains is actually shot dead in an outside lavatory. Of the two great Westerns of the early nineties, I would, marginally, prefer 'Dances with Wolves', which to my mind has a greater epic sweep, but by any other standard 'Unforgiven' is a very fine movie indeed, wonderfully acted, especially by Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood himself. (Freeman's role is a rare example of a black actor taking a leading role in a Western). It also asks some searching questions about the nature of law and justice, revenge and the roots of violence. It is interesting that Eastwood has not made any films in the Western genre since this one; perhaps he feels that it has set a standard that cannot be surpassed. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great, Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that this is the best western ever made, or to say that it's Clint Eastwood's best film, would be wrong. Why? Because such droll understatement would be woefully misleading. This film isn't just those merely those things. Unforgiven ranks as one of the greatest films of all time. Period. No delimiters or qualifiers apply. And what follows is my view of this film's place in Hollywood history.When John Wayne died in 1979 it was emblematic of the state of the western genre in Hollywood. In fact, Wayne's last film, The Shootist, dwelt on exactly that, and indeed that was what The Shootist was all about: the end of the wild west, the end of westerns in Hollywood, and, of course, the impending demise of John Wayne. Hey, to say these things --to make these statements-- is precisely why they ever took the time and the bother to make The Shootist. So then when the Duke really did die, the keys to Hollywood's westerns kingdom were handed off to Clint Eastwood, a bequeath almost by default. Through the 70s Wayne and Eastwood were just about the only ones left making westerns, and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), his then most recent effort, was arguably Eastwood's best film to date. But Clint deserved receiving those keys, because he had earned them. Clint patiently waited nine years to release his next western, Pale Rider, a homage to the western classic, Shane. In 1985 the general consensus was that Pale Rider was Clint Eastwood's finest film, his defining masterpiece. But, as it turned out, Clint wasn't done. Seven years later, in 1992, he released what is now said to be his last western, Unforgiven. And with Unforgiven Clint hits all the classic western themes. I won't belabor retelling the story, because that's been done very well elsewhere in other comments. Nor will I dwell too much on the myriad layering of the characters. I will say that in watching and re-watching and re-watching numerous more times it became quite clear to me that Unforgiven was Clint's labor of love. It's the little things, subtleties, that reveal that truth. Things like the classic cowboy lines that roll off the character's tongues, without a second thought, but which reach deep and stay with you. Too many of those to list, but just read all the other reviews on this site, where they are recounted nicely. One striking thing is the implicit irony that the characters, as ostensibly depicted, are to a one exactly opposite of their true nature, or of how they themselves want to be. The Schofield Kid, blustering braggadocio notwithstanding, is no killer. "I ain't like you Will," a chastened Kid says as he departs. And Little Bill Daggett remonstratively represents law, order, and justice, the supposed peace officer keeping the peace, is in truth corrupt and sadistically violent, unable to rise above his own vicious lawlessness. English Bob, the erstwhile cosmopolitan gunslinger, is a fraud and a coward to boot. And William Munney keeps saying he's a changed man, that he "ain't like that anymore." But, oh yeah, he is. The only honest character, the only compassionate character, is Ned Logan. He's the only one who kills no one, because of all of them, he really isn't like that, and yet he is the only one of the hired killers to get killed and to suffer the consequences of being a supposed killer.To tell this story that plumbs the depths of human depravity, telling it convincingly, exploring various relative degrees of the human character, holding the requisite feet to the fire, and doing it all tightly in 131 minutes, Clint assembled great cast to work with: Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris. All are marvelous. The film is a masterpiece.Is Unforgiven to Eastwood as The Shootist was to Wayne, i.e., his own swan song of sorts? Well, certainly Clint, unlike John Wayne, wasn't dying, but the fact is Clint has never made another western. It appears that he has said all he has to say in that genre, and is finished with it.And to the critic poseur who suggests that Dances With Wolves was a slightly better western, puh-leeeeze. Kevin Costner can't carry Clint Eastwood's jock strap, literally or figuratively. At least couldn't back then, at that point in his career. All too often, and certainly in Dances With Wolves, Costner's main attribute is his gargantuan --yet wholly unwarranted-- ego, and a self-absorption that runs amok, chewing scenery and stepping all over everybody else. And Costner's dime store cultural anthropology, while earnest, is laughable. The combination of Costner being Costner, a corn pone and contrived story, and the 4 hour length of the movie is a definite mind number. Dances With Wolves's real value is as a sleep aid. None of which is to say that Kevin Costner did not possess the capacity to make and leave an indelible mark on Hollywood's westerns. He did, and he did. But it wasn't with Dances With Wolves that it happened. In 1993 Costner's career took a fortuitous turn when he worked with Eastwood in the contemporary western, A Perfect World. There Costner learned and showed an ability to sublimate himself into a role, and to keep his egocentric tendencies in check. Immediately following that experience Costner released Wyatt Earp, a better film and a better western than Dances With Wolves. Then, in 2003, Costner, working with Robert Duval, made Open Range, arguably Costner's best work to date, and certainly the best western made since Unforgiven.We can all hope that Clint has more westerns in him. If he doesn't, the keys he inherited from John Wayne appear destined for Kevin Costner. Again, by default.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong Unfocused Anti-Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting that when UNFORGIVEN was released every review show that showed an excerpt would would always show the same clip - the climax where Clint Eastwood's grizzled anti-hero walks in to the saloon and informs Gene Hackman " I've killed everything that's walked and crawled and now i've come to kill you little Bill " . This hooks the audience in to thinking they're going to be watching one of these old school Westerns where convention dictates if you want to survive then you've got to be quick on the draw. This is entirely misleading because UNFORGIVEN is very much an anti-western , something of an antidote to the syrupy feel-good DANCES WITH WOLVES which kick started a mini boom of the Western genre. Both films are at a polar opposite in most ways but share a common ground in that they're both films that won the Oscar for best pictures. They also share the common ground that they're overlong One wonders how well it would have been received during " The New Hollywood " era ? There wouldn't have been much need to recast . You could still have Eastwood , Hackman and Harris play the same characters. One can speculate the critics wouldn't have held it in too high regard because there wasn't enough violent action as seen in the likes of HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER . David Webb Peoples screenplay is well over long by about an hour and is populated by characters that don't really drive the plot forward . Take for example the character of English Bob superbly played by Richard Harris . He arrives in town is beaten up by Little Bob , who arrests and taunts him in the town jailhouse and is then run out of town . It's an acting tour de force by both Harris and Hackman but what has this to do with anything except to perhaps point out it's July the fourth ? It's a very loose screenplay which puzzles me why it was so rewarded by that year's award shows I can see what UNFORGIVEN is trying to do . The title alone points out the subtext - it's a story of one man's redemption . The problem is that the story for some perplexing reason introduces so many characters that it looses focus on the person and clogs up the story unnecessarily . These characters are cast very well and this saves the film from its most obvious fault in that it's an overlong film lacking a central narrative drive . You don't agree ? Imagine if Kevin Costner as Bill Munney , Eddie Murphy as Ned Long , Hugh Grant as English Bob and Jason Priestley as The Schofield Kid . Different film now isn't it ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Spacey, Vacant Western Makes Shockingly Slow Progress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play two retired wild west bounty hunters, back in their saddles to chase one last bounty after decades of silence. Agonizingly slow, its two leads take their sweet time collecting their belongings, mounting their horses and trotting at a leisurely pace across state lines, sharing less than a few sentences along the way. We gather that Eastwood was a shady character in his day, reformed by the love of a deceased wife, but he seems more like a caged animal than a redeemed spirit and we're never given much reason to pull for him despite the presumed change of heart. Though his beloved bride's spirit lives on in the couple's two young children, he barely acknowledges their presence before leaving them on their own for a month to randomly hunt a new bounty. Freeman tries to drag some character development out of him on the trail, but Eastwood holds onto it with an icy grip and piercing eyes, and there we sit for the rest of the picture. Gene Hackman is noteworthy for his portrayal of a smarmy, cocky town sheriff with a chip on his shoulder, but on every other count this is a western that misses with each squeeze of the trigger. Despite a few beautiful panoramas, the world feels stiflingly tight and compressed. Outside of Hackman, there's no fire and passion in the cast, even when Eastwood turns the page and transgresses to his wilder young persona. Finally, the atmosphere, crucial to all films of the genre, feels too clean and polished where it should be gritty and dirty. Much as I would have loved to see Clint don that familiar parka and revisit the days of his Sergio Leon sunrise, it's just not happening here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't add much to what have already told the other users. They have all explained. Far better than i'll do. YES YES YES, that's the best Clint Eastwood's film ever made. As an actor, I mean; although as a director, it's ALSO a masterpiece. But as an actor, I have never liked Clint; always the same kind of characters, except maybe in HONKYTONK MAN and WHITE HUNTER... where he gives us unpredictable performances. But in his westerns, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, PALE RIDER, I hate his characters, all alike. In Harry Calahan, well...Nearly the same too.So, in UNFORGIVEN, his character is really different. A genuine bad guy who plays the good guy. Gene Hackman is here the perfect contrary. The good town sheriff who protects his fellow citizens and plays "the bad guy". Don't forget Eastwood's characters's sentence, just before he kills Hackman: "Yes, I have killed women and children..." Have you ever heard a hero say this in a movie? In this movie everything is mixed up, if you compare to other films of this kind. And that's what I love. No real hero here. A pure masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gritty uncompromising view of life in a moral vacuum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's first movie as a Director (also Producer)it was a coup. Much in the mould of McCabe and Mrs Miller, it gives a reality of what the West might have been like living in a world without effective law, and an ultimately moral vacuum After shooting his first victim (when his old time bandit mate, refuses to) who dies slowly from an abdominal bullet wound, crying for 'water'and sobbing. After listening to the slow death unfolding for what seems an age Eastwood calls to the victims friends, 'Give him a drink for Christ's sake; we won't shoot'. Later, after his companion kills the second victim at point blank range sitting on the loo, (and becomes distraught at what reality of what he's done) he says to Eastwood, 'Well, he had it coming'. Eastwood, framed against a blue sky, face in shadow, replies; "We all got it coming, kid" It's a Western with a difference, but not without the Good Guy (who's actually a Bad Guy) winning out. Hollywood couldn't really step too far outside the traditional pattern. But it's well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece in nuance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably Eastwood's best, as far as both directing and starring. The depth and the lack of black and white or judgment are astonishing. Every single character is well-written, credible, developed thoroughly and a *human being*. Not one of them is limited to only one side to their personality, everyone is flawed... the antagonist is arguably not a "bad guy", and you can get behind him and see things his way. This does not present us with right and wrong, it offers differing points of view, and allows the audience to decide for ourselves what we think. Food for thought, not a raised index finger. The script comes from the man who would later give us Twelve Monkeys and Soldier(no, it wasn't brilliant, but that wasn't his fault, Webb Peoples gave them a great start-off point, blame Paul W.S. Anderson), and the plot is relatively simple and easy to follow(not to be confused with predictable), so that the focus can be put on exploring the people. This portrait of the fictional William Munny is entirely unforgettable, immensely insightful and ultimately quite tragic. The level of realism that is present in every area of this is impeccable(the one thing I can think of that strains credulity is the presence of an African-American who isn't a slave, but with how incredible Freeman's performance is, I can forgive it), sets, costumes, dialog, language, relationships, etc. This has excellent and spot-on acting all the way; heck, even the kids aren't too bad. The editing and cinematography are amazing, and this holds several gorgeous and memorable images. This is not about action, it's an engaging drama set in the Wild West. With that said, there is definitely thick tension, as well as exciting scenes in this(and they neither are, nor feel, out of place in the least). There is a lot of brutal, bloody and unpleasant violence, a bit of disturbing content, occasional swearing and a little sexuality and references to such in this. I recommend this warmly to everyone mature enough to handle and appreciate it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very flawed Eastwood film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of "early" Clint Eastwood (you can see by some of my other reviews) and have seen UNFORGIVEN (1992) several times, but I just can't completely get into this film and don't think it's a masterpiece, as with several of his other films that he has starred in and/or directed (A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, DIRTY HARRY, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, and the criminally underrated elegiac A PERFECT WORLD). Also, there are several other "lesser" other Eastwood works that I'd pop into the DVD player before this one, ones that I find to be provocative, immensely entertaining, or re-watchable or all of the above (HANG EM HIGH, THE GAUNTLET, THE ENFORCER, SUDDEN IMPACT, TIGHTROPE).With UNFORGIVEN, I think a recurring word I find when I watch it is "monotony". At the end of the day, I think everything is too one-dimensional. On repeated viewings, I find nothing really deep or provocative about this film. I don't pick up on anything. It's a well-made, professional film with decent-to-good acting, but that's about it. The only 2 characters that I find to be interesting are the ones played by Gene Hackman (Little Bill Daggett) and Richard Harris (English Bob). Everyone else just is kind of "there". Not to mention that virtually all the characters seem like the SAME person! There is no uniqueness about any of them.Save for Daggett and Little Bill, they all have the same mannerisms, mood, and tone. I've seen many so-called "lesser" films with better developed, written, and performed characters that allowed me to latch onto the film the more and more I watched it. With UNFORGIVEN, these characters (and there are tons of them) fall way too flat. Examples: The scene where Munny, the Kid (played by Jamie Woolvett), and the (totally unnecessary!) Morgan Freeman character track down the first of the 2 men they are to kill is totally devoid of real emotion and resonance. I feel nothing when watching this scene. The acting by all involved is strangely similar (Freeman ironically being the weakest link in this scene). Eastwood did Freeman no favors by casting him in this film. Seems like stunt, friendship casting as far as I'm concerned.Eastwood (as former vicious killer, but now reformed family man William Munny) strangely evokes very little as the lead. It is hard to buy that this man was once a vicious killer simply because Eastwood gives himself the same singular tone as most of the rest of the cast. Then all of a sudden at the end he is a badass again. I think the intent was right, but the execution (pardon the pun!) is rather unbelievable. This ending scene is in it's own right pretty spectacular as it demystifies the mythology of gunslinging that so many films before (ironiclly including many early Eastwood Westerns) had glamourized and I find it (and the Daggett-English Bob scenes) to be the only good ones.At the end of the day, a great film ought to draw you in, not push you away. UNFORGIVEN, sadly, does the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent if slightly self-worthy western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years have passed since William Munny was a savage killer, years of marriage to his late wife changed him and he is now a pig farmer with his two children. With fever ravaging his livestock, he takes up the offer of a job killing two cowhands who cut up a prostitute. Joining the Schofield Kid and his old partner Ned, the trio set off unaware of the welcome in store for gunslingers from Sheriff Little Bill Daggett.A rightful Oscar winner of it's time, Unforgiven is one of the better Westerns of the last 15 years or so. The plot is deceptively simple and is more about it's themes than it's actual liner run. As such we get to see the film point how just how exaggerated and glamorised the `legends' of the west are ? illustrated in English bob and his writer friend, in combination with this we also get to see the reality in Munny ? a man who has all the stories but also carries with him all the pain and grief that his `legend' has brought to his life. With this opening up of the old west comes a greater role for women in the film ? prostitutes, so often just background dressing in saloon scenes, are given a major part to play and we see their role in very much a man's world. Despite these themes the main narrative flow still works very well and is supported to a great extent by them. The final gunfight is no less thrilling for the fact that it is very gritty and un-Hollywood. The only thing that did damage it a little was the sheer self awareness of the film ? it knows it is working on several different levels and at times it shows rather than just being natural.The film has a lot to thank the cast for as they do a fantastic job in lifting the material and never letting it dip ? this is no cheesy western full of bad dubbing! Eastwood leads with a stony performance that sheds light on the cardboard characters he himself has played and attempts to shatter a myth that he had a part in creating. Hackman is strong in support, as is Freeman who finds the better angels of his nature. Woolvett appears to be just playing a headstrong kid until his final scene where he shows real ability. Smaller roles from Harris and Rubinek add value and, as I said, the women in the cast have their time in the spotlight and add to the ensemble feel of the film.Overall this is a very intelligent and enjoyable western. Shattering the ideals and myths that we have been sold by westerns over the years and looking at the effect of violence on men ? this is almost an anti-gun film with gunfights such is the strength of the despair that Eastwood takes his character to. A worthy Oscar winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a lot of viewers read more into this film than is there. I didn't think it was all that good. For one thing, near the beginning, the Eastwood character cannot hit a stationary bucket with his six-gun at very close range; yet, in the denouement, he goes into action like Wild Bill Hickock on steroids, taking on a whole room full of bad guys and taking them all out on his own. Where did he acquire this acuity? We don't see him taking intensive target practice throughout the film.This is an overrated film, no more realistic than the average John Wayne shoot-'em-up, yet most reviewers were drooling and falling over themselves to praise it. The more recent "Open Range" was much better. The Kevin Costner character could have had Clint Eastwood's character for breakfast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much is made of this film, because it appears to be a western, and because Eastwood starred in some rather important 'Spaghetti Westerns.' Some call it the antiwestern as if it were conceived by Clint to be an intelligent escalation from the ideas of 'Good, Bad.' But Clint wasn't responsible for the intelligent conception of the Leone films. This film grows more out of science fiction than westerns, and the responsible party is the writer, not the director.This isn't to take away from some fine photography and smart pacing. But one only has to look at other films from this director and cinematographer to see that they are not geniuses. No, the real novelty comes from Peoples. I assume he figured if 'Star Wars' could appropriate the old fashioned western, then he could appropriate old fashioned scifi values and toss them in western dress.Check it out. This is the 'Blade Runner' and 'Twelve Monkeys Guy.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A violent story of revenge set in the cold and inhospitable town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, with touches of the earlier High Plains Drifter, it revolves around the disfigurement of a prostitute and the inability to find justice through the law. It becomes quite a convoluted story, given each of the characters backgrounds and personalities. The traditional good guy, the sheriff, is here a sadistic monster, while what was always portrayed as the bad guys, hired killers, are now wearing the white hats. The girls in the brothel have to pool their money in order to pay for the killing of the men responsible. Paying proves to be the easiest part while carrying out the mission makes a repeat offender of one of the men, and a first time killer of the other while the third, who never really did anything to deserve it, is captured and tortured to death. At that point the operation takes on its own life and leads to a final scene in the same darkened saloon where the girl was attacked. Eastwood makes it all very apt to happen in the stark and brutal environment he creates with great camera, acting, and music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still not forgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will keep this review short and simple. Unforgiven lives up to its name as I have still not forgiven it. Richard Harris portrays one of the weakest characters I have ever seen in a film. Despite being listed as a star of the film, he barely features. He arrives in town, acts rather stereotypically English, gets beaten up for said actions and leaves. The end. Gene Hackman is laughable as Little Bill, with a name that makes him sound like an Indian war chief than the hardened Sheriff that he is supposed to be. The way in which he plays his character is like a detective in Murder She Wrote...only with less life and even worse acting. When the prostitute gets her face cut up I half expected Angela Lansbury to burst in with a piece of evidence linking the saloon owner to the crime. 'Bill; I think I know who did this, but I need your help to prove it...' It would have been more entertaining certainly. This brings me neatly to Clint. Oh where did you go wrong. One minute you're a mysterious preacher in Pale Rider and then you are a cardiac waiting to happen like an extra out of Dads Army who keeps falling off his horse... The only person who brings some redemption to this film is Morgan Freeman who, tragically is killed by the producers before he can make a true impact on the film, for being mildly entertaining. The question really, is just how much worse could this film be? With its all star pantomime cast, it could be tricky to pull off, though no doubt the producers could still nick a few coins from all our pockets. If you want a good classic western, pick up Appaloosa or Pale Rider. These are far more entertaining and do not stereotype the Englishman as a t**t.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, the Bad and the Unforgiven...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" is a nod to the old spaghetti westerns from the sixties and seventies, such as "The Dollars Trilogy" by Sergio Leone, the very films that made Eastwood a major Hollywood player. But this one is more touchy than the others--it features a character who may be The Man with No Name (a.k.a. Blondie) thirty years after we saw him ride away at the end of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." This particular man is filled with guilt trailing him from his past, when he was a gunslinging drunkard made infamous throughout the west as a brutal killer. Now he's older and a retired cowboy--he lives with his two children in the middle of nowhere as a farmer. His name is William Munny.The film opens in a town miles away run by the evil Little Bill (Gene Hackman), the corrupt town sherriff. In the town brothel, a hooker is beaten to a pulp by two men who get away with simply having to hand over some horses to the owner of the joint. Seeking revenge, the women of the facility put together their small fortunes and put up a stash of reward money for the assassination of the two men.Enter the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), who is eager to hunt down the two men and collect the reward money. He invites Will Munny to accompany and help him with his quest. At first Will refuses, but then he decides to put down his pitch fork and use his weapons one more time. Along the way, Will and the Schofield Kid pick up Ned (Morgan Freeman), another retired gunslinger living out west in peace and harmony. Together they ride off into the sunset in hopes of finding their targets and collecting some reward money for their efforts. Things aren't always as simple as they seem.The Schofield Kid claims he has killed five men. But Ned and Will come to an agreement that they think he's bluffing. The Schofield Kid is like an eager kid wanting to impress his role model. Whe"Unforgiven" is a tender western that isn't quite as unrealistic as you might expect walking into the theater to watch it. Clint Eastwood is famous for the cowboy roles. Now it's his turn to give a new insight into the feelings of cowboys. The underlying roots of the movie are quite simple--you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Even though Will has left his brutal and abusive past behind him, his old personality is still in there, somewhere amongst the chaos of his colliding feelings. He's a man beaten by his heart more than by any enemy he has encountered in the past.Gene Hackman is always good for bad guy roles, mainly because he can create some of the most hateable characters of all time. I saw "Crimson Tide" immediately after "Unforgiven"--his roles are often the same, but there is no doubting that he can create a truly mean character while still adding some depth to his persona.Clint Eastwood is one great director. He has created a wonderful and grim epic that transcends the genre. Westerns have always been a bit cheesy as compared to more contemporary films (after all, there's a reason they're often called spaghetti westerns). "Unforgiven" is given the regular screen treatment. This is a more accurate portrayal of the wild, wild west. "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is superior, but that's a given.The end of "Unforgiven" is a mix between "Taxi Driver" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." It's a bit depressing, but, at the same time, refreshingly noble. It's one of the best cinematic climaxes ever created. The message behind "Unforgiven" may not be encouraging, but some of the greatest films aren't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven personifies the end of the Old West, and specifically in Eastwood's Will Munny as well as himself, a relic of Leone's Spaghetti trilogy. That Eastwood went under several aliases but was always calm, collected, deadly with the draw and ruggedly handsome. Here he is ragged and elderly; he tends to pigs, not to bounties, misfires from a few paces on a still tin can, and can barely mount his horse without a decent struggle. That vehicle in itself is becoming obsolete - the crowded and lively steam engine train a sign of the old world being mechanised. I am reminded of the opening of Red Dead Redemption, and that climatic monologue. So, in a changing age where digital effects were increasingly improving and wowing audiences, Eastwood's love letter and eulogy digs deeps for those Western roots. The camera-work emphasises this; dollying as we ride through a perfect replica of every small Western town, swivelling and soaking up the wooden signage, the dusty buildings and streets, the curious stares of whores and strangers. Later this is used to slowly reveal the fate of Ned in his coffin and that savage warning. The harsh sounds of his whipping reverberate throughout the settlement, and we get reactions from every concerned citizen of the community. DoP Green frames gunslingers and their steeds in solitary one-shots, in sepia seeped palettes, in silhouetted two-shots at golden hour sunset, enveloped by the dusty western plains and grasslands of infinite stretch. And the opening and closing scrawls best emanate nostalgia and longing, of a thief and murderer that cannot survive that way any longer. We get a sense of the wider community in the warping of the story, of whispers and gossip travelling between taverns and banks and ears all across the state. A few slashes of the face becomes whole body mutilation. Eastwood demands each of his characters to excel within the drained weary sets. The self-named Schofield kid is cocky and brags of his gunslinging prowess, yet these words fall on the deaf ears of two veterans. Later, after being presented with the easiest first kill of any man in the West, he drinks vigorously and laughs nervously, revealing his more modest persona beneath that confident Western renegade. Another life and career awaits him. Ned also comes to the same conclusion, at first eager to revisit his old life but after firing the first shot clearly unable to commit those same crimes. The pair speak with weariness and regret of those old days, and do not want to be thrust back in. Hackman's Little Bill recalls the humorous elements of the past, and displays his power, tenacity and technique even in his old age. But he is a man who does not want the bloodshed and violence in his town, he actively stamps it out, and would rather spend the rest of his days adding to his leaky shambles of a hut. Long gone are the days of sleeping in caves along the camp-fire. David Webb Peoples subverts all the old tropes with every step of his screenplay. Harris' English Bob is eloquent and dismissive, mustering his intimidating persona in ignoring the sheriff's rules, before being brutally taken down, not even being able to retaliate when given the opportunity. For all the talk of old rivalry, the classic showdown would have been inappropriate. Guns are hesitantly drawn and held in that final 'showdown'. Murky moralities and perspectives are displayed instead of a duel between the heroic gunslinger and villain. Strawberry goes far in seeking revenge, while Delilah stands aside meekly, even touched by the offering of the finest pony. She is shaped in the mould of the dear departed Claudia who cured these violent, bloodthirsty men. They are of the past. The recurring motif of story and recording is key. The bustling little writer Beauchamp is almost comical - he provides one of the funniest moments when he suggests to a stoney-faced Bill to "shoot the carpenter". More importantly, he follows power and legend, from the theatrical tales of English Bob, to the humorous reminiscing of Little Bill, looking for writing material and figures to immortalise. There is a quick shot in that climatic shooutout where I almost see a slight hint of glee in his face. He has struck gold, and will mythologise Munny for these deeds. It might not be captured quite the same way it went down, but it will make for a better book than the Duke of Death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bringing the good and the bad side of Human nature?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>UNFORGIVEN is a story of death and revenge in the Old West. It's a classic, in the western genre, and it's considered by many as a masterpiece. I watched it today for the very first time, in spite of been hearing about this movie since it was release in 1992. I didn't use to appreciate westerns, it was not the type of movie that used to call my attention, but a few years ago it changed. Today UNFORGIVEN was broadcasting on a Portuguese TV channel and I decided to give it a chance. For a while that I was wishing to watch a good western movie... I guess I picked up well! UNFORGIVEN is in fact a very good film. It's mostly a retaliation story as told but it depicts very well the most basic Human feelings as friendship, fear, anger or the willing for revenge. The cast is superb and the performances too, and I sure did appreciate the realistic way all story and characters are portrayed. It's more than a "typical" western, UNFORGIVEN is a movie that brings out the good and the bad side, the strengths and the weaknesses, that are inside of every human, even of those who are supposed to be villains! Nice work from Clint Eastwood indeed (direction and acting)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama does not get better than this *personal TOP 10*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...except, *arguably* in Shakespeare. The character motivations and interplay are every bit as powerfully rendered in this magnificent tale of justice, revenge and life and death as in Hamlet or Julius Caesar. In fact, this is very much Shakespeare of the wild west; just substitute Tudor English for the dialect of 'Big Whiskey', c.1880, and throw a seasoning of Clint Eastwood into the mix. The violence blindly perpetrated by the cowboys (one in particular) in the opening scene sets into motion a tale of retribution as deadly as it is (alas) natural and believable. A tragedy unfolds in which the innocent - "Innocent of what??" - are as likely to meet their end as much as the guilty. Why each character wants what they want, why they believe what they believe, and where they are coming from in their life experiences is revealed by singularly brilliant plotting and dialogue. Forces beyond his or anybody else's control seem to impel William Munny to his course of violence, with all the tragic ripples this brings, yet every character's decision-making is clearly shown every step of the way. Finally, a monumental confrontation between he and the intimidating figure of Sheriff Daggett seems inevitable to us if not to them. The ending - sometimes criticised - strikes the perfect balance of credibility and 'miracle': legends can be truth or lie, or a mixture of the two.The flawless plot-structure is imbued with an elegiac style, deriving from Eastwood's directorial genius, and no small musical talent (he wrote the simple but memorable guitar theme, which frames the movie along with the beautiful cinematic prologue and epilogue). The measure of Unforgiven's greatness can be seen in the many quotations which resonate in the mind ever-after - "I've killed just about everything that walks or crawls at one time or another" - likewise the visual images, such as the dark, dismal downpours in Big Whiskey or the beauty of the landscape it is situated in, both of which are important supports to the psychology of the movie. Acting also does not get better than this, from the most peripheral characters to the leads. James Woolvetz as the 'Schofield Kid' - not because he's from Schofield, but because of the revolver he uses :-) - is a revelation, while Eastwood, Freeman, Hackman and Harris bring all the authority we expect from them. Watch out, too, for Mr Beauchamp (the fine Saul Rubinek), the narrator of Munny's 'legend', and the touchingly nuanced character of Delilah (the 'cut-up whore', played by Anna Levine) through whose eyes we are invited to further interpret the main characters. Immense credit for all this excellence must surely go to David Webb Peoples, the script-writer.'Unforgiven' is the movie with which Clint Eastwood signed off from the western, leaving us with a masterpiece not only of the genre but of all cinema. Eventually, this grandmaster of the industry will himself sign off from us - and whenever it happens it will be too soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man's dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a western film. Recently this film was remade as Japanese western movie. Ken Watanabe stared as Will which Clint Eastwood acted as same character in original version. Actually, this is the first time for me to watch a western movie. I enjoyed watch this film and I think this film is good for people who are less familiar with a western movie such as me because the story is not difficult. However, I didn't emphasize Will's feeling. I think only man can agree with this feeling. I feel this western movie shows man's dream. I was surprised that there were many beautiful landscapes in this film. These landscapes show character's expression. In addition, background music also express character's feeling. I love this film's direction. I recommend you to watch this film from bottom of my heart, especially, people who have never watched a western movie in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very dark western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very dark movie. Like Mystic River, it has some disturbing scenes. One of the last scenes shows Eastwood leaving the town of Big Whisky at night in the rain and the town looks like Hell. The film is so well made that it sticks with you long after the movie is over. Unforgiven is #98 on the American Film Institute's 100 best movies of all time list. It won Best Director and Best Picture at the Oscars. It's definitely worth seeing but it's a rocky ride. Clint Eastwood plays Bill Munny a reformed gunslinger trying to raise crops and his two children following his wife's death. In the town of Big Whisky two cowboys cut one of the town whores and when the Sheriff 'Little Bill' (Gene Hackman) lets the cowboys off easy, the town whores put a bounty on the two cowboys. Back at Munny's pathetic ranch, a young guy calling himself 'The Schofield Kid' (Jaimz Woolvett) shows up. He asks Munny to go with him to get the bounty. Munny talks his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) into going with.All the characters in the movie are unforgettable. Sheriff 'Little Bill' is a guy that soon as you start to like him he does something mean and Hackman (Best Actor in a Supporting Role) has a field day with the character. Morgan Freeman is excellent. So is Richard Harris (English Bob). Eastwood, who has played so many gunslingers, knows exactly how to play Munny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western As We Have Never Seen It Before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is one of those films that may not become a classic, but will definitely be a curiosity. Clint Eastwood (in an Oscar-nominated role) stars as a retired gunfighter who decides to go back to his old ways one more time for a score that he cannot refuse. His nemesis is a sadistic small-town Wyoming sheriff (played to the paramount by Oscar-winning Gene Hackman) who will keep law and order regardless of the cost. The friction will lead to a somewhat untraditional showdown in the end. "Unforgiven" is one of those films that is difficult to analyze. I think that Eastwood planned this from the start. He wanted to convey the western genre in a whole new way and he does succeed in that regard. Eastwood looks at the myths surrounding the post-Civil War west and shows that these men were just ordinary folks trying to make a living in a place and time that was always dangerous. He shows that making a living sometimes means breaking the law. All in all the film was a big enough critical and box office triumph to capture four Academy Awards in 1992, including the Best Picture Oscar. Even though its success is second-to-none, the film is flawed in several areas. Some things just do not make sense. Morgan Freeman is adequate in somewhat limited screen-time, but Richard Harris is totally wasted in a cameo appearance. Eastwood's direction and Hackman's performance are the key things that make "Unforgiven" work, but the screenplay is a bit disjointed and the film suffers a bit from that fact. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Other Westerns such as Shane and Culpepper Cattle Company hint at it, but Unforgiven uses it as the basis of the film. Eastwood uses this issue brilliantlyThe dialogue between him and the Scofield kid is possibly the greatest dialogue in any Western.I would love to see a prequel to this film be made in the near future.

		<shortDescription>'Innocent? Innocent of what?'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true star of this star-studded film is never on screen. He is David Webb Peoples, whose script languished in Clint Eastwood's file cabinet for years, and who gives us the aforementioned line, and many other memorable, profound, paradoxical utterances. And of the characters inhabiting Peoples' screenplay, not a single one is stereotypical of the western, or any other genre. Each is given an important moment in the film, from the slashed whore Delilah to the one-armed deputy. And each is, to varying degrees, doomed.Yet for such an overwhelmingly dark movie, "Unforgiven" is full of light moments, touching moments, hilarious moments. English Bob, played with sardonic verve by Richard Harris, muses on the recent assassination of President Garfield. "I mean, why NOT shoot the president?" he asks. W.W. Beauchamp, a reporter just as mercenary as the three men seeking Delilah's attackers (and the $1,000 reward), arrives with Bob to chronicle his dubious exploits, then gloms on to Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff, and finally seeks out Will Munny following the saloon bloodbath. "So who'd you shoot first" asks Beauchamp. "I only know who's gonna be last," glowers Munny.The theme of who "had it coming" is central to Peoples' script. First uttered by Ned, Munny's running buddy from the bad old days, the sentiment is repeated by Alice, the head madam, and finally by the Schofield Kid as he ruminates on his first kill; this theme is summed up by Munny: "We all got it coming, kid." But two characters in particular do NOT have it coming. Ned, who balked at the opportunity to kill, is returning home when he's captured and later beaten to death by Little Bill. And Davy, who did not participate in the maiming of Delilah and even presents her with a horse as compensation, is only guilty by association. But in this movie, that's enough.Characteristic of Peoples' understated style is the scene of Will's departure from his failing pig farm. He visits the grave of his wife, who broke him of his drinking and killing ways. In any other movie, Will would speak a few lines, asking her forgiveness perhaps. Not here: Eastwood simply sweeps some brush from the makeshift marker and moves on. There is not a wasted motion in this film, nor a single unnecessary line.Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are good friends in real life, and their camaraderie shows through in several strong scenes. (The two would share equally profound moments in "Million Dollar Baby".) No doubt the material would be effective with any two actors of their caliber, but it truly shines with Eastwood and Freeman.Epic in scale, but deeply personal in execution, "Unforgiven" is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1880 Big Whisky, Wyoming. A cowboy slices up a whore's face. Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) together with greedy saloon owner agree to a fine of a few horses with not even a whipping. Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher) is outraged, and pool together a reward for killing the two cowboys. The bounty attracts every killer around including English Bob (Richard Harris). It also attracts The Schofield Kid. He contacts William Munny (Clint Eastwood) who reunites with Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). Together the three men travel to collect the reward.This is a movie only Clint Eastwood could make it legendary. It is decades in the making. Essentially, he is recalling the years of playing the man with no name. It is the perfect role for him, and he's perfect for the role. Clint is seeking to ask some morality questions. Bill Munny and his crew are a bunch of law breakers. Little Bill is the law, but he doesn't have the moral high ground either. It is possibly the last great western to be made. Certainly there will never be another Clint Eastwood. That era is gone forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild West again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all its traditional shooting galore. Around a rather poor and somewhat unconvincing story of a group of bar prostitutes trying to hire a killer to revenge the barbarous cut up of one of them by two cowboys, Clint Eastwood made a good western movie in technical and formal terms with a de luxe cast (himself, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Richard Harris). When I say a good movie I mean a good movie in terms of images, sequences, dialogues, acting and cut. It's of course a movie full of the usual violent and tough scenes since the main characters are violent and tough people who can easily kill other people for money or pleasure. Nevertheless this doesn't prevent some of them to show good human feelings, revealing even on some final scenes curious conscience problems. The general atmosphere is one of the lawlessness that was in force in the American West by mid-19th century where law was dictated by who could shoot first and faster. That atmosphere is well reproduced in this movie. The feminine element is here composed only by the group of the bar prostitutes who show often more human feelings than men. A worthy movie, well structured, well acted and well directed and presented, to sum it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionizes Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a brilliant movie because it brings humanity and life to the stock good guy-bad guy western movie. The traditional protagonist/antagonist struggle is more than just reversed. In other words, the protagonist isn't merely switched to the bad guy role. Rather, the viewer is never sure who the bad guy is in the first place. Sometimes we find ourselves rooting for the protagonist, other times we are shocked to find how violent and abhorrent the protagonist really is. We seek to turn to an antagonist as someone to root for, but there are so many, and they are constantly in flux as well. If this sounds complicated, that's because it is! Clearly, this is the resounding message of the movie: that humanity is sloppier and more complex than traditional westerns. However, this message is implicit and it propells the plot further and leaves it embedded in the viewers mind long after the tape is rewound. Traditional western lovers will enjoy the movie's gunfight scenes, and the fairly rudimentary storyline: atonement for the damage of an "innocent" woman. More intellectual types will watch it again and again in search of a message that will speak to their inner psyche and help to reveal to them what lies within.</fullReview>

He enlists the aid of friend Ned Logan(played by Morgan Freeman) to help him track them down, which leads to the town led by corrupt sheriff "Little Bill"(played by Gene Hackman,who also won an Oscar) an amiable but ruthless man who resents these gunfighters in his town, and will stop at nothing,(not even murder) to get his way, prompting a violent showdown on a rainy night... Superb acting and script here, and works as a tribute to Clint's mentor director Sergio Leone, though this sometimes ponderous and overlong film doesn't measure up to their famous "Man With No Name" trilogy. Still, it is well done and memorable otherwise, with a haunting finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is unforgiven if you haven't saw this movie yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Clint Eastwood was talking to chair, he was making good films like Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a uniquely different Western, at the time as it gave the audience the most realist example of how life was like in the Old West. A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, are looking for any bounty hunter to kill two cowboys who disfigured a woman's face. Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), is wanting to keep the town peaceful and is against any bounty hunters coming in. Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime. News about the reward reached Kansas, where a pig farmer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is approach by the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man to collect the reward. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, who able to hide facts with his eyes, and his facial expression. Much of the charm of the first part of the movie is how unlikely he could be a bounty hunter, but he go on to do it because he's raising two children alone and his farm is failing. On the way, Munny's friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) joins in for the search of the cowboys. They weren't the first to make it to the town. Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies savagely beat Bob, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. When Logan and Munny got the chance?they were able to kill one of the cowboy. It becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan tries to return home. Logan gets captured by the Sheriff's men and this is where the story gets intense. This is where we see how bad-ass Munny is. David Webb Peoples, adapter of both Twelve Monkeys and Blade Runner, wrote the screenplay. He wrote when Munny drinks whiskey, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The audience does truly find out whom Munny really about in the last ending scene. That was where it shined. The beat up up, pig farmer was urged by multiple consequences to take a drink and the monster erupted with horrific consequences. Mr. Hyde took a lot of prodding but his reputation was well founded and could been worse if he was the Hyde that shed all humanity. He still had a foot in his human side. There is a film noir feel to the film full of ambiguity and atmosphere. The dark Western deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence, deep and steeped in morality. It was a perfect fit, hand for a glove. The screenplay is unique, written for Eastwood to direct. Still, the film realism is kind of distracting and depressing. It tends to break up the myth of the West. Unforgiven is a film that doesn't hold a candle to Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollars Trilogy in any way. Certainly, it's a classic Western, regardless of it not following the classic theme. There is something appealing to a film that takes an old concept and makes it up to modern standard. Everything about this movie is good, from direction to acting! Gene Hackman's acting is keyed to the film to work. The Sheriff was right. The only way to handle real criminals is to show them you are meaner and more ruthless than they are. Hackman did a perfect job of demonstrating the "style' that all good law enforcement people "should" follow to actually get the job done effectively. Today's soft, limp wrist, politically correct cops pay a very heavy price when incorrectly believing that they can warn and make friends with bad guys; and the politicians could care less how much they or their families suffer. It finds it kind of surreal that Little Bill is painted the villain of the film. Willy tried to be a family man, Bill wanted to build a house. Bill killed one man (a mercenary) and Willy Munny killed six (most of them innocents). Any way you look at it there were no heroes in this film. Clint's acting is just bar none, and it is a movie that has characters so compelling, it makes you wonder about the nature of humanity. Everybody soon learns a harsh lesson about the price of vindictive bloodshed and the malleability of ideas like "justice."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few glaring, safe politically correct Hollywoodisms keep this from being quite the grisly, raw, take-no-prisoners western deconstruction Eastwood probably envisioned. There's the frequently rote, made-for-TV- esque directing, then there's the disfigured prostitute who actually isn't that disfigured, not to the extent that a bunch of grizzled cowpokes would care, anyway. Come on, hookers back then probably had peg legs and eyepatches. So, the characters making such a huge deal over a little scarring must be commentary on how unfair life could be for women, right? No, they probably just assumed audiences can't sympathize with ugly women. Then there's the black cowboy that shows us just how colorblind Clint Eastwood is. Oh please. It's just strange to me how much darker and grittier the old 60s spaghetti westerns are than this movie, when it's pretty much a single-minded attempt to subvert the genre, strip it of it escapism &amp; heroics and reveal the brutal, seedy underbelly. In reality, Leone got WAY closer to that underbelly without even trying.But for a 90s film, it's not that bad. Hackman is awesome, and the final act just bleeds a sense of doom and self-destruction. Just don't expect anything too intelligent or subversive besides some soap opera pacifist undertones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never got what is so great about this movie. At least other Eastwood Westerns could entertain. Even "Pale Rider", a pale hybrid of "Shane" and "High Plains Drifter", was better than this, entertainment wise. Whatever message of anti-violence in the film made no impression on me. John Wayne's final film "The Shootist" was better at that with the last scene in the saloon where Ron Howard throws the gun away and John Wayne nods in agreement and dies. Certainly the director of that movie, Don Siegel, were he still alive at the time, would have done a better job with "Unforgiven", as he had as director of earlier Eastwood films. It was only Eastwood's aging that allowed him to make this particular kind of Western, and with that aging came a consistent decline of quality in his output. Not that any of his movies are all that great to begin with. None of them inspire. Not even this "message" Western. It needed a much more involving story to relay its "message".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the hype the movie received, I found this movie at best average. The only real difference between "Unforgiven" and older Western movies is the use of profanity and the lead having a black sidekick, as well as explicit mention of prostitution and sex. The plot is simple and predictable, and the movie makes no important points.The story is about a Western town where the law is enforced rather ineptly by the sheriff Little Bill, who has to deal with two cowboys, one of whom has slashed the face of a prostitute. To settle the matter, Bill has the cowboys give the house of prostitution several horses as recompense. This fails to please the prostitutes, who hire a young man to assassinate the cowboys. The young man in turn finds a former gunslinger who has lost his wife and has two young children and a hardscrabble farm, and talks him into helping him with the job, and the gunslinger in turn finds his old black gunslinger companion and they set out to do the job.In the meantime, a gunslinger named English Bob comes to the town, along with a journalist to write of his exploits. But when they meet the sheriff, Bob is quickly disarmed and beaten up by the sheriff, and Bob spends the night in jail while Little Bill tells the journalist what a legend English Bob wasn't after all.In the end, though, we feel little incentive to root for the protagonist. He shows little affection to his children and leaves his dead companion behind, and there is no indication he did anything for his companion's widow. Basically an unsatisfying movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I'm not a fan of westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like western films as they remind me of history in secondary school, which I hated. However I decided to give them a chance after watching the more recent '3:10 to Yuma' and thoroughly enjoying it. I'm a younger audience member so my film knowledge goes to around the late 90's onwards, so I thought I'd broaden my horizons. And I have come to the conclusion that if you're not a fan of westerns, then you won't like this film. Unforgiven is paced so slowly that it takes over half the film to get the main plot. There are hardly any action sequences, and when there are they evoke no excitement in me - they just take their time, which is perhaps more realistic, but I watch films that help me escape reality not mirror it. Which leaves you with a slow plot that offers very little substance, and the characters. The character are good, however, with Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Jaimz Woolvet providing convincing performances. My problem, however, is with Clint Eastwood's acting. It's clear that he has thought about his character, but he only has one expression. This is the first film I've seen him in, and his face stays the same the whole time, as far as I could tell. His voice portrays grief and regret well, but even when he gets angry, his face stays the same as before making him impossible to read. That may be just his style of acting - not everyone has to be extremely expressive, but even his body language didn't convey anything to me, and it just irritated me throughout the whole film.Overall, I can't determine how good this film is, because I know it's intended as a tribute to westerns; for fans of the genre and as such I'm a poor judge because of my dislike for it. I gave it 4/10, based on what I felt as guy who has seen one other western in his life.</fullReview>

No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired tough guy. When I see him on screen, I see a man laboring at his acting. Then there's the anti-Western Western plot. It is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women, blacks, native Americans, and single parents; a disrespect for violence and drinking; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage, and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting those values, the movie comes across as mannered, if not preachy. Then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold, the kid who can't shoot straight, the city slicker new to the wild West, the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords. Finally there is the pacing of Eastwood's direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still riding north, chatting with Morgan Freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight, sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion. It was way too slow. Somebody had to find these elements uncompelling. I am afraid it was me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typical, sanctimonious Eastwood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of the intertextuality of this revisionist western, but as a movie it's pretty much ruined by pompousness and good taste. This is the second time I've viewed this in an effort to reassess it's merits. I didn't think much of it the first time, because it simply could not compete with a better version of "Unforgiven" in my mind, compiled from my brothers enthusiastic retelling (before I saw it). He tells it better than Eastwood does; offering praise for all its clever ideas while leaving out all of it's many deficiencies.The whores of a old west town pool their resources to avenge a hooker (Delilah) who was attacked after mocking a mans small penis. Within ten minutes the movie has passed on a rumor that is incorrect; that the perp has "cut out her eyes and cut off her teats;" this is patently incorrect. We also hear that "she ain't got no face left." And by the time the victim arrives, the over the top violence of the early scenes is represented by two or three minuscule scars, not the knife wounds you get from the arm swinging motions we witnessed. Most liberal film-makers can't bear to depict true immorality (as in Costner's A Perfect World) and waffle like this. So when constructing a movie as an argument, they find the need to be dishonest. Eastwood wussed out and gave her scant injuries, making all the ensuing violence pretty pointless. It never deals with this issue, even after Mundy meets the barely-scarred hooker.Anyway, William Mundy (Eastwood) hears the rumors. He retrieves pal Morgan Freeman, who leaves his own wife (Sally) presumably defenseless (and eventually widowed and unsupported) to go off half-cocked as wrong-headed moral avengers.The movie has a sufficient number of intriguing ideas in play; Hackman building a rotten dream house, a man chronicling the old west for public consumption (Mr Beauchamp). But it's burdened by a moral agenda which is very unsubtle. This production is offered as an apologia for Eastwood's earlier, violent work. But I can't name an Eastwood movie where his violence is due to "craziness" or "liquor," the two excuses given here. Mundy's sainted dead wife Claudia is painted in hallowed terms, but she's also responsible for his goofy gender baggage which causes the conflict to play out. The movie strands Eastwood as the same self-appointed, easily-confused morality-ranger that took us into Iraq.Little did we know he had an even larger hunk of rotten sanctimony in him (Million Dollar Baby) and would win the best director Oscar again. Just a reminder; Fellini, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick have zero Oscars between them, but Eastwood has two.The movie strangles its intelligence with a lackluster script and too much sanctimony. Skip this and rent Once upon a time in the West, a movie likewise burdened by artistic pretensions, but which occasionally delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good western that deserved its best picture Oscar. Just about the only drawback is that it tends to drag on at times and make it seem longer than its 130 minutes, but it's still an excellent movie. Clint Eastwood plays a late 19th-century old west retired bounty hunter who gets called out of retirement for one last "job." He seems to want to avenge his wife's death.The cast is excellent, as are the performances. Any movie with Eastwood, Gene Hackman, and Morgan Freeman in it can't be all bad, and it did win a lot of Oscars, including best picture and supporting actor. I like the story and cinematography. Overall, you will like it too.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's still the best western I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this again, after a long, long time. We've had a few good westerns since then and before that, but the simple, character-driven drama in "Unforgiven" just hits home in a way that is hard to match.Just like all good genre movies, this isn't so much about the genre itself, but a simple story with plenty of human elements. The western part is just a fine coating over it. So if you don't normally enjoy westerns, and if you've found that many of them lack real substance, try this one and you might change your mind.In its core, "Unforgiven" is about the age-old story about a human being with a horrible past who tries to change his life, even succeeded in doing so, but eventually has a hard time burying monster he was. This could be called a cliché, but the execution had so much heart and thought put into it, that it stops being a cliché and starts being a real story again. Also, one can see that the title "Unforgiven" doesn't only apply to the main character, but to several others as well. There are other elements too: longing, hubris, cowardice, faithfulness and regret. Everything is handled with care, and none of it comes across as redundant or pretentious. The characters are deeper than you'd think, and every interaction, every scene serves a purpose. I can't recall a movie that made me care so much about a character that is never seen, only talked about. I'm of course referring to William Munny's late wife. Also, this was the first western I saw that presented whores as human beings. So many great touches. Before the final scene, we can see the storm clouds gathering. Everything on the screen seems to compliment the story and where it's going. Writer David Webb Peoples deserves a lot of credit for this, but so does Clint Eastwood. Let's talk about good old Clint.Clint Eastwood is a wonderful catalyst to all of this. Many of us remember his old westerns, and there is a sense of nostalgia. At the time when this movie was released, I considered him an old man trying to make something of the genre he made so great when he was younger. I was cynical about it, but after seeing it I was blown away, and my cynicism was too. This was not a desperate effort to cash in on nostalgia and to make himself relevant again, this was a movie with so much energy that it didn't even need that much action. The man didn't only make a really good movie, but he proved that he was a fantastic filmmaker who understands the human side of a story, the heart or the matter and how those stories are driven. So Clint Eastwood didn't only play his part very well, he directed the movie even better. He made the western that to this day remains the one to be beat. One could argue that "The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly" is right on top with this one, and I couldn't argue back. Two very different kinds of westerns, both magnificent in their own way.So Clint Eastwood is the man, that much is clear, but everyone else is good too. Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Jaimz Woolvett, Richard Harris, Frances Fisher were all great. Anna Levine/Thomson was surprisingly good, bringing tons of restrained emotion to every scene she was a part of.I could bring up some issues from a movie that's almost 25 years old at this point, but I would feel like an idiot doing so. It would feel like nitpicking, because it is a really well-made film. Every movie that manages to push through a wall of cynicism with force, with its own natural presence, deserves to be recognized as something precious.I love "Unforgiven". It is simple, but it's also surprisingly deep and wonderfully honest throughout. It is one of my favorite movies, up there with "Alien" and "Apocalypse Now". It can't match those movies with grand visuals or spectacle, but it's got so much heart that it simply can't be ignored. Recommended for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1881 in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), the local sheriff and former gunfighter, does not allow guns or criminals in his town. Two cowboys, Quick Mike (David Mucci) and "Davey-Boy" Bunting (Rob Campbell), disfigure prostitute Delilah Fitzgerald (Anna Levine), accusing her of stealing, but according to another prostitute, Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher), the real reason was that Delilah "giggled a little" at the small size of Quick Mike's penis. Instead of punishing the cowboys, Little Bill allows them to pay compensation to the brothel owner, Skinny Dubois (Anthony James), by delivering five ponies to him the following Spring. The rest of the prostitutes, led by Strawberry Alice, are infuriated by this leniency and by the casual denegation of all of them (to be valued as worth no more than a few horses). So they decide to pool their "earnings", so as to offer a $1,000 reward to whoever can come to Big Whiskey, and kill the two cowboys. While they don't advertise openly; they count on their "Gentlemen" customers; taking the gossip of their $1,000 offer; back down the cattle driving trails south, to the rail-heads in Nebraska and Kansas.In Kansas, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a boastful young man, a gunman turned killer; visits the pig farm of a widower by the name of William Munny (Clint Eastwood). The "Kid" is seeking to recruit the renowned Munny (if this is him); to partner with him in the "contract" to kill the cowboys. In his youth, Munny well known was a bandit; and was furthermore, notorious as a cold-blooded assassin and murderer. Now a repentant widower (as an aging father; now alone, raising two young children next to the gravesite of his young wife (whose family of course disowned her, because of him); it has all given him some sense of reflection).For the sake of the two children (given their age at his wife's death he could not have done otherwise), the youngest a daughter; and a son, William Munny Jr (Shane Meier), Will Munny has sworn off alcohol and killing. But though Munny initially refuses the Schofield Kid's offer to join him; his pig farm is a failure; and, his lack of any other prospects on the horizon, are putting his children's future in jeopardy. So Munny reconsiders a few days later and sets off to catch up with the Kid. On his way, Munny recruits his friend and former partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), another retired gunfighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real western, shocking and stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real western, a farewell one of the most important genres of film history, the film is amazing and in my opinion is a seal, "Unforgiven" has a spectacular, brilliant script, you care about each character, you know everything about them, their dramas, their anxieties, their desires and their dreams, everything is very deep and well portrayed, and look at the film only has two hours, the performances are magnificent, few things are more rewarding in the cinema to see Clint Eastwood making your paper unnamed man (although in this film he has gained a name), and Gene Hackman is also magnificent, editing the movie is great, especially in the final scene, the outrageously good sound mixing, the beautiful photography, trail sound is good, but lacked that painted Ennio Morricone, If you like movies, watch "the unforgivable" if you like the western genre, buy the DVD and watch every week. I rarely comment on the film giving spoiler, but the final scene can actually be quite jarring climate of the film, perhaps Willian (Clint) have to have died, but kill the unnamed man is like killing Superman, Rocky or Batman. The character is an icon, almost a superhero, kill him, it would be like to kill Clint himself, so the director (Clint Eastwood himself) opts for a redemption, not a death. Another point to be discussed is a movie western to where no one pulls the gun and kills 20 people with the eye closed, but a killer who can not kill another killer who never killed and has problems vision and one that has visions of death and can barely get on the horse, and Sheriff claims to love the law and hate killers, beating people who believes to be criminal, are real cowboys, humans, this point of unforgivable is incredible.And the personal drama of the character played by Clint Eastwood is a counterpoint to his character's past, who killed, robbed, only saw the money, he tries to redeem the past and almost 30 years later, the man nameless goodbye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this film so great is Clint Eastwood himself and his history in the world of westerns. Which means that in a sense you have seen the younger William Muny in his wilder days (yes I know Clint was never the "bad" guy but Hell Man-with-no-name was hardly squeaky clean either) and can visualise what he was like. Nevertheless that is just icing on the cake. Clint delivers a powerful performance of a man trying to escape his past which clings to him like a bad smell. It because of his past that he is sought out to join the bounty hunt and everyone he comes across who knows of his past exploits is wary of him. But Clint is a seemingly a broken man and not the black terror he once was. Only at the end do we catch a glimpse of what made him so feared before as he passes into the night and becomes the darkness. The late great Richard Harris is superb as the aged gunfighter English Bob, and like Eastwood plays up to his own past as a hell-raiser. His biographer Saul Rubinek counterpoints him as a bumbling writer who recasts the brutal and morally dubious reality as legend. Both Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman also give excellent performances. Especially Hackman as a brutal sheriff in a brutal world who only wants to sit on the porch he made. In many ways the film is about how stories grow in the telling, from the increasingly horrible verbal descriptions of the injuries suffered by the prostitute to the literal creation of the legend of the west by Bob's biographer. Muny, continually telling himself that he is a good man, fails to escape his past and is dragged back into his own legend. Who is good? who is bad? Who deserves to die? As Clint says "Deserve 'ain't got nothing to do with it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb - a western with heart. Trust Clint Eastwood to turn the genre on its head by making a western where the characters have depth, the plot is more a human drama than an action drama and the "hero" is frail and flawed, as are his comrades. Excellent direction by Eastwood, showing a deftness, sensitivity and poignancy that are now his trademark. His acting is also something to behold - no longer playing the bold, confident, action man, but a man frail and unsure of himself, with waning powers.Gene Hackman delivers an excellent performance and well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Probably the greatest, and certainly most original, western ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven places Clint Eastwood precisely in his element. I haven't even seen that many Clint Eastwood films, but I can say without a doubt this is his type of movie. The 1992 Best Picture winner also directed by Clint Eastwood is the Clint-essential (see what I did there?) western depicting a retired gunslinger who wants a new life, but is still needed for his particular set of skills. This precise role is one Clint has played time and time again, yet with each turn brings something new, yet very Eastwood to the role.Everything is going fine in the town of Big Whisky, a domesticated place in the new Old West full of people working for a living, ready to leave the vagabond days of the old Old West in the past. That serenity was disrupted when an injustice occurs that cannot be ignored. One young vigilante The 'Schofield Kid' (Jaimz Woolvett) enlists the help of retired widower Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood). The kid finally convinces Munny to help him seek revenge under one condition; Bill never does any gunslinging without his lifelong partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). The three then march on with murder in their eyes to right the last wrong in Big Whisky.The cinematography is always a treat when a film is centered largely outdoors. The shots of hills and valleys of Canada were a wonderful backdrop to our hero's tale. The acting was never really stretched, as it was what you'd expect from the two male leads. The story was a little tired, with a very been-there-done-that feel to it. I can't really attest to how well this does or does not stack up to the rest of the 1992 Best Picture nominees, as I have not seen any of them, although my initial assumption is to guess that it was a slow movie year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven, unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writing a review about a film done so long ago can only mean the reviewer wants to see on the list of reviews so far compiled. Why? Clint Eastwood is one of those really special actors that can, with good camera and direction, create a character that is life itself, or at least what we can imagine life could be for a certain type of person in a violent world.Unforgiven can only be unforgiven for giving Hackman too little time, and RICHARD HARRIS, too little time, but what can be done? Harris and Hackman alone made the work unforgettable. They, of course, were shot for a larger story, and that was correct and well made, but, oh boy, was that ever a cinematic moment!Eastwood's roll, well supported by superb flow, character support, and a truly great script, put him right where he does that incredible thing he does. He might get gunned down by Streep in a shot, looked bad in a director's role in somewhere Africa, but, here, in this work, he is the greatest character actor of the genre,(sorry, Mr. Wayne).Unforgiven is one of those works that stand at the top of their genre. (I read reviews that included Deadwood, the series((incredible!)), Let's remember Silverado, Lonesome Dove, and anything Duval ever got into, with or without Kostner, who stands up real well.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's last modern classic masterpiece western film he made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take Clint Eastwood's last modern classic masterpiece western film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Unforgiven 1992 is which I believe is Clint Eastwood's last western masterpiece that is a modern classic that he made. I don't think it is Clint Eastwood's best one but is a great one to watch. I love this movie. This one and Million Dollar Baby are real close masterpiece to me. Clint Eastwood is a Legend. Long before Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River Clint was directing a plenty. This is just another great in a long line. I love this film to death and it is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood's western flicks. Clint Eastwood is an amazing actor with directing talent that rivals his acting. This movie is a masterpiece. It is as simple as that. Every western fan should absolutely love this movie and even those who do not like westerns should find a deep interest in it. Awesome! My favorite movie! Plot: Clint Eastwood, who also stars in the film as William Munny, a former gunslinger who is recruited to hunt down the men who were involved in the mutilation of a prostitute. He then has to face the reputation of his past as he clashes with the sheriff of the town (Gene Hackman).The film, among other things, addresses the question of morality- is there complete moral or immoral people, or is it possible that people could be both? the film suggests that people are too complicated to be rendered moral or immoral, and that one is as moral or immoral as one's specific action indicates. The film creates a relative scale of morality and masculinity that helps us assess how moral or immoral the characters, as people in general, could become. Unforgiven has a dark emotional core of revenge and redemption, but still has an entertaining quality. It's hard to express all the great reasons I love this movie. Just as Silence of the Lambs was to horror, and Saving Private Ryan was to war movies, Unforgiven was to deconstructing the Western Myth Genre. Direction is purposeful and sparse, photography is beautiful, acting is perfect, writing is flawless, editing is excellent, set design is inspiring, and production is without measure. Like The Passion of the Christ, Unforgiven transcends it's makers and becomes a brilliant work that stands on it's own, not so much written and directed, but conceived and born. Among other things Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman started opposite Clint Eastwood which both of them teamed up later again in Absolute Power and Million Dollar baby. The movie even has Richard Harris in it as English Bob. The acting performance in this movie is superb believable awesome and portrayal of the old west is beautiful. Such as his sequel to Flags of Our Fathers with the equally respectful and understanding Letters from Iwo Jima, following the Japanese side of the battle. So back in 1992 when the western was as good as gone, Clint Eastwood visits his roots from his spaghetti western days to create possibly his masterpiece, if not close to it. Telling the story of a man drawn back into a life of violence, you see the contrasting scenery and plot. The natural beauty of rural Kansas mixed with the brutality and violence that was the old west, and the truth behind the myths of dime novel sharpshooters. The strong characters and suspense of what will happen next will lead you to the end, where you'll shake your head in disbelief at how quick people change, that is all I can say. Watch and enjoy what is a classic masterpiece in cinema. Certainly think it's a classic Western, regardless of it NOT following the classic theme. There is something appealing to a film that takes an old concept and makes it up to modern standard. Everything about this movie is good, from direction to acting!Overall: I love this movie, It Is my fifth favorite Eastwood western movie. Again I don't think it is Eastwood best movie, better than For a Few Dollars More, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider and A Fistful of Dollars, but is close to those movies. I love Eastwood, Freeman and Hackman they all gave wonderful acting performance in this film, that is pretty good. It is well paced and the story is well written I love it and It has great dialogue lines. The film get's a solid 10 by me. Unforgiven is a 1992 American western film directed and produced by Clint Eastwood, who also starred in the lead role. 10/10 Grade: A+ Studio: The Malpaso Company, Warner Bros.

		<fullReview>I read on Wikipedia that the screenplay was with Eastwood for some time but he wanted to take up the movie when he grows old enough to play the role. I bet he achieved perfection in it ! The script, per SE, isn't unique, yet it impresses the brain in it's subtleties, e.g: Till Ned's death, one feels pity for the frail, repenting and struggling Munny while Little Bill inspires both respect and hatred - he is vigilant, a fearless leader and a ruthless but constrained law enforcer but one is left wondering why the hell he doesn't eliminate the cowboy menace (but I guess that's what gives a gray shade to his character) !. In fact, he seems an antihero and overshadows all the other characters in the plot. But when Munny learns about Ned, he easily helps himself with the liquor, seems determined, plans and acts boldly. By the end of the movie, Munny shows the vestige of his fearsome and deadly outlawed past. Then the viewer easily forgets the other characters around and are awestruck by Munny.In my opinion, a strong film is one which has characters(and acting, of course) that cannot be neglected or forgotten, however small their footage is. 'Unforgiven' excels here. The defiant Strawberry Alice, the innocent and pitiful Delilah Fitzgerald, the shaky deputies, the boastful English Bob, the coward but curios W. W, the soulless Skinny Dubois all leave a mark. I was rather disappointed about including Morgan Freeman in the film - his potential is wasted on a secondary character with a minuscule importance ! The cinematography and the sets etc. deserve 10/10 given the screenplay(I am a naive person to spot or be disturbed by goof-ups ;) ). While I loved the 'Dollars Trilogy', this movie portrays better the occupational hazards of the bounty hunters - sleeping under open skies battling weather, staying awake whole night for surveillance, selecting hideouts and so on.Well, this may sound crazy but when I was watching this movie, I got the same pleasure and enchantment that I got during 'Taxi Driver'(the distraught and dark texture of the whole film). When I read the 'trivia' section, I was(I am still!) unable to believe the David Webb Peoples quoting 'Taxi Driver' as an influence !!!Overall, this movie is one NOT to be missed, even if you are not a WESTERN FILM fan. Clint Eastwood and the others have produced a nothing short of a gem work !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Done Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with somewhat high expectations, considering the fact that it won best picture of 1992 and it's high ratings. I wasn't surprised to find that it was quite good. The plot is, although not particularly unique, still interesting. The movie plays out differently than I expected, which isn't a bad thing of course. I felt like it strayed off topic a few times, but it was mostly for character development, which I was fine with. The characters were pretty average for a movie, which is fine. I felt like William Munny's character, the main one, was probably done the worst though. He didn't feel real, and instead ended up feeling like a cliché anime protagonist who ranted on and on about his life story and whatnot. It fit his character well enough though, but it gets annoying after the first hundred or so times that he talks about it. Overall Unforgiven is a solid western movie. I don't watch many westerns myself, but I enjoyed it. With a good plot and good characters, it was worth the watch. Unfortunately the characters suffer from being annoying unrealistic at times and the plot wasn't exactly the most original. In the end I'd recommend watching Unforgiven. It's good, but definitely not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9 because It ended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So yeah, another review by the guy that makes reviews for you, the guy that is searching for a movie to watch! Lets get to it:I gave 9 to the movie because it has a ending and it was so good by the time it reached the end that I really wanted more. So why should you watch this movie and when? You should watch this movie if you are feeling western! This movie has the western structure well developed: a main group of 'outlaws' that are searching to do good as well as some bastard folk that want just the opposite. That resumes why you should watch this if you came here feeling western... but and the other reasons? This movie has a thing that I love in movies: good characters! All of them have more than just a image, they are deep, they have back stories and they live to them in non obvious ways. The characters show their guts! Finally for the bad, maybe the ending of the movie was too dark for the camera? Or that was something wanted because of the meaning of seeing little. Still, the end could be a bit different with some more loose ends. That would make this a western masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a story about Avenging a Wrong or about Murder as an Addictive Behavior?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree that this is a great Western movie of the 20th Century -- it is certainly not typical with the reason for the Action and Conflict being the aggrieved women themselves. The cast of characters as developed by David Webb Peoples and director/producer Clint Eastwood are a sordid bunch. We see the earthy and grim parts of a lot of the "Wild West" and learn that Gun Control is not just a measure of the contemporary U.S. political groupings. I don't quite think that the main character is an anti-hero but he does seem a bit like a reformed addict pushed to the breaking point. It is not for the young and over-sensitive. UNFORGIVEN (1992) is a good example of a two-hour feature that doesn't need the big tech-effects to keep us thrilled and on the edges of our seats. It does reflect a kind of critique of gun violence while showing that guns can provide a kind of means of revenge where the "bad" people get their comeuppance. I rate it an "8" *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but a little overrated..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be very interesting and see how far Eastwood would go with one of his first own directing movies. It is a great depiction of a man who once lead a violent and evil past but has changed his ways. It is also the story of his partner Freeman who has agreed to join in on there worldwide redemption of killing. And the young killer who has lied about killing so many. It is a great movie about characters and goes very deep. Eastwood finds himself in a spot where he is faced to confront a man who has wrongly killed his partner and he ends up turning into the man he once was int he past. It is a great movie with a great script and fantastic characters. But if your looking for a western with a lot of action or a very active script you are looking in the wrong place. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly realistic western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is one of the few western films I've seen where the main character isn't perfect at everything he does. In movies like Tombstone and Silverado the good guys are always great shots who can miraculously dodge bullets and ride off into the sunset, but Unforgiven was much different. Like the scene where Munny comes into the bar with the shotgun and one of his barrels misfires, that just adds invaluable realism to the film. In how many other movies have you seen something as simple but important as a misfire, very common in those days but rarely shown on screen. In a nutshell that's why I especially enjoyed Unforgiven, it veered away from the ideal image of the west and showed every little gritty detail about what life was actually like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually enjoy western films, simply because they're the mass produced action movies of the past. However there are some exceptions, such as this. Very fine action by all, especially Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman. I personally feel Clint Eastwood is only a good actor in rough, gruff cowboy style characters, such as the one he played in this film. I feel Clint Eastwood's true calling is directing since he has done such a fine job with so many of his films. He might be one of the greatest directors of our time. But all and all this was a fabulous film and definitely worth watching even if you don't have a taste for westerns.</fullReview>

Many personal conflicts that escalated to gunfire back then were resolved by someone getting shot in the back of the head or craftily ambushed.This film also reveals a very blurry line between official right and wrong and situates that narrative upon the fateful pressures that impel Billy Munny toward his fate.If someone doesn't like this film, for reasons other than the violence itself, it can only be because they prefer the superficiality it lacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Heaven's Gate was supposed to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Western will hopefully never die out, but Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood's last go around with it. The film took home four Oscars, but that hardly seems enough. Unforgiven is a film that shows us a different perspective of the Old West. In this film, good and bad are not easy to pick out. The characters we identify with the most have done every bit as much wrong in their lives as those they find themselves shooting at. This film may take a different perspective, but it still allows the genre to maintain its dignity. That is the mark of great film-making. That is the mark of Clint Eastwood.Eastwood plays a retired gunfighter named Will Munny. It has been 11 years, he tells us, since the last time he shot at a man. His departed wife apparently tried to make a decent enough man out of him that he doesn't drink, cuss, or have any reason to resort to violence any more. He runs a tiny pig farm in Kansas, but his reputation is still known as far away as Texas, from what we are told. One day, a cocky young man rides up to Munny and tries to recruit him for a bounty hunting job in Wyoming. It seems two ornery cowboys have cut up the face of a prostitute, and her fellow whores are offering $1000 for anyone who would kill them. Munny tells the kid he doesn't do that kind of thing any more, but he badly needs the cash. After briefly deliberating on the matter, Munny recruits an old partner (Morgan Freeman) and the two of them ride off with the kid to collect that reward. Trouble is, the town where they're headed has a nasty sheriff (Gene Hackman), and he knows there will be assassins coming for the reward. He wants no part of bounty hunters riding through his turf. The conflict between the sheriff and Munny is unavoidable. For most of the film, Munny and his pals hardly seem up to the task, until the sheriff takes things a bit too far.The film is absolutely astounding in its narrative and cinematography. The story gives us one gut-wrenching scene after another with the beautiful backdrop of Western North America behind them. We learn just how difficult it really is for supposedly tough men to draw their pistols and accurately fire at someone else. We wonder about the motivation behind Eastwood and Freeman's characters. Do they really need the cash that bad, or do they really still have murder in their souls after all these years? We find out just who does and who doesn't as the action unfolds. Not only are the lead performances great, but so are the supporting roles. Gene Hackman won as Oscar for his turn as Little Bill Dagget. He's just as good as he always is, but it's great to see the Academy finally reward talented people like that. The late Richard Harris, at Eastwood's request, also turns in a very memorable performance. No film since Barry Lyndon has had better cinematography.Toward the end, when Eastwood stares down an entire saloon of would-be toughs with a double-barrel shotgun, we get perhaps the scene he will be remembered for more than any other. The glint in his eyes peering out from under that hat... the glow from the torches outside... the tone in his voice... Absolutely haunting.This film is not to be missed.10 of 10 stars from the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Western Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I make this statement for its realism. Most westerns, including The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, never really seem to capture what the Old West was really like. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was fantastic in terms of its film technique, but we never get to appreciate what it was like to be inside the Old West. Not only does this film do that, but it also delivers the quintessential Eastwood as the great gunslinger. What I liked about this film was how an excellent story line easily integrated with heroism antics (the ending scene) and top notch acting by everyone in the film, as well as showing us what the Old West REALLY was like... hardly romantic, but dirty, filthy, and full of people living on the edge of society. People constantly facing off against the elements of nature and societies barely on the map, societies that as of yet could hardly offer infrastructure and social equity. what we get is a stark and shocking portrayal of people forced into a situation of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which is what historians are saying the Old West was really like. Neighbor against neighbor as people, without the resources of the city, fight daily to stay alive. We see what happens when we are stripped of our resources, and how the 'stink' of the human character really shines. Eastwood and Hackman's greatest performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unforgiven -- The Clash Of Myth and Existentialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwoods triumphant masterpiece "The Unforgiven" turns the American Hero/Antihero myth on its head by using its most culturally accepted form: the Western. his choice to play the pivotal "hero" was brilliant consideration previous Western roles, especially "the Man-With-No-Name" in Sergio Delonne Westerns.This is one of my top 5 favorite movies.*Don't read my review any further until you see this movie*An angry, damning incident at a hoar house snowballs a tale of revenge, control, and poor choices guided by violence and moral ambiguity.Each character chooses to participate with there own rigid viewpoint, yet none of them ever let go and walk away from fueling and inevitable catastrophe. (The accept ion being-- a peace offering)What'S beautiful about this Movie is that we never suspect the direction the story is taking us. our Pop-Culture myths of heroes and villains; and acceptance of subjective choices are subtlety put to the test as the movie reaches the climax. In the end, we are left with the questions: "Have i defined my moral judgments correctly; Do I have enough perception outside my subjectiveness to make choices; When do I walk away from a bad Scenario." As movie watchers, we can hopefully address these Questions and not become The Unforgiven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly the kind of Western you expect Eastwood to make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a Western for sure, but a quiet one, and one that focuses more on the characters than the clichés of the genre. It's the kind of film Clint Eastwood was destined to make after the movies he had made in his past, and it stands alongside Million Dollar Baby as one of his masterpieces.Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, a former drunkard who had a knack for killing people. He now lives on a pig farm with his two kids, clean and good after meeting Claudia, his wife and the woman that made him change. One day the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) comes looking for him to ask him to be his partner in killing two men who scratched up a whore in the town of Big Whiskey. William needs the bounty money, so he goes with the Kid and Will's old partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman, in a simple, touching performance). Gene Hackman plays Little Bill, the sheriff of Big Whiskey, who doesn't stand for assassins in his town, and Richard Harris plays English Bob, an assassin who gets on Bill's wrong side.The movie would stand fine on that plot alone, but Eastwood adds so much more into the story. His characters transcend any preconceived notions we may have had about their Western origins and they become real people. Things happen that we aren't expecting, because this movie is more than a Western. It's Eastwood's condemnation of violence and it takes an engaging screenplay that slowly reveals its purpose to really bring that across.After seeing The Searchers a few weeks ago and being slightly disappointed in a movie that is widely regarded as a classic, I was a little tentative going into this one. I had no reason to be. It's everything you want it to be and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Best... Without a Doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to Unforgiven, I recognized the many talents of Clint Eastwood that I had been misjudging for so long for whatever reason. Before Unforgiven, Eastwood just seemed to be a squinty-eyed, raspy-voiced, uptight desperado who liked to shoot people and occasionally hang out with an orangutan, respectively. In 1992, Eastwood took his directing, acting, even music composition (!) seriously and made the best western I have ever seen (so far... and yes, I've seen Tombstone). The people who say Eastwood is a terrible actor are either A) still bitter he swiped Paul Giamatti's Best Actor nomination spot last year, B) unaware of the powerhouse undertones Eastwood can spring on an audience, or C) both. My favorite scenes (tie) are both because I marvelled at Eastwood's acting: when he responds to a crying young fella who wrongly thought he was ready to kill a man, and the climactic ending. This classic western about a showdown between two unofficially retired gunslingers (Eastwood and Morgan Freeman) and a no-nonsense sheriff (Gene Hackman, another Oscar-winning performance) has everything anybody could ask for in a Clint Eastwood film. Though Million Dollar Baby cemented Eastwood's rep as today's best film director for an actor, Unforgiven is his masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An affecting, elegiac memorial to the violent western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood's craggy but scrutable William Mundy is a good central character to this film. I feel though that it is his direction which is most admirable. The film could be either sickly or over-violent. It's achievement is a sense of pathos with a taste of that frontier lawlessness which the film marks without mourning.Though supported by an excellent cast in which Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris brilliantly combine great seriousness with humour (comedy almost), Eastwood's true doppelganger is the sheriff Little Bill of Gene Hackman. Both men are morally equivocal: both struggle to make the honest end game of their lives work (Hackman with his leaky house, Eastwood with his diseased smallholding). The final showdown between the men is not executed in pursuit of justice but a face-off of personal attrition.A fine, affecting western-tribute in which Eastwood tells us neither to excuse the violence of the past nor to judge the men who lived through it. 8/10</fullReview>

I find 'Unforgiven' has such moving appeal and force that I cannot think that any other movie that Clint Eastwood would make will be better than this one.Eastwood is in fine character as a remorsed William Munny, a notorious killer who returns for one last job from an offer by the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) so he can provide money for his poor family who seemed to have lost hope after there Mother died two years back. Will finds his old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) along the road to Wyoming and asks him to join his hunt for two men who cut up a woman. Along the way Will and Ned go, they discuss a few past situations as a result of what may happen when they go on this hunt. When they reach there location, there only big trouble to be dealt with as well will be the sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman).This film is worth it if you like something that is moving. The film won four academy awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Hackman), and Best Editing. Good selection academy! Best one I have ever seen from you guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films of my lifetime. Perfectly cast and directed, William Munny's character is the best Eastwood has ever played and Gene Hackman's Little Bill is as evil yet oblivious as they come. Many films try very hard to use the scenery as a character; how most fail, however is when the scenery becomes so lush, so vast, so beautiful; it becomes a distraction and cannot blend into the story. Unforgiven needs no chase scenes, no big shoot-em ups, etc. Clint Eastwood allowed his actors to wind their way through the story and backdrop, rather than running into it and it created a seamless union. He also allowed us to have great sympathy for a character in Munny who, in any other circumstance would merit none.</fullReview>

At the start of the movie they describe his old character who would kill many men and would drink all the time. But the next scene that they show is him with his children and they are working on a farm to survive. He has stopped the killings and has not touched a drink in a long time. He was not able to shot a gun and get on a horse at this point. But throughout the movie he got better. He did end up killing someone and drinking it but it was in the job of helping the women who got her face messed up with the cowboys. But I think that he will be able to go back to his old ways when he gets back to his son and daughter on their farm. What is you opinion of this?</fullReview>

He, in a way, makes fun of the westerns because in the classic western no one misses the target/person when shooting their gun, but in Unforgiven he misses a can several times before getting mad and getting his shotgun and blowing the can to pieces. Eastwood also pokes fun of western by showing that farming isn't as essay as they made it look. He does this when he is trying to separate the hogs away from the ones with a fever. He falls over several times and gets his face muddy before giving up and never actually separating the hogs.

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwoods Unforgiven is an updated Western that goes against the rules of classical Western movies. Eastwood makes fun of the fact that in real like it actually is hard to shoot and kill a man. He shows this by having fight scenes that are not as the other Westerns. In these fight scenes there are more miss fires and people not getting hit. Eastwood also plays at the fact that the cowboy life is not as fun as most people perceive it to be. Its actually a tough, taxing life that is not fun. There is much work, long days of just riding, etc. This movie updates the genre of Westerns to show a new audience what life was like in the West. It takes the perception that most people have of the West and changes it to a more truthful one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film! Though, it is not a traditional western staring Eastwood. If you go into it thinking that you'll be looking for something that isn't there and might be disappointed. Having preconceived expectations can ruin a good film.If you're not familiar with the story, it's about a man who was once a ruthless murderer, who becomes somewhat reformed after settling down with wife and kids becoming a farmer. His wife had since died and along comes an opportunity to take on a rub-out bounty job. Along the way his life long friend is killed (somewhat unjustly) and Eastwood returns to his dark cold murderous self to get revenge.I think the reason why I am so taken by this film is because of the realism perceived by the movie. Whether or not the `Wild West' was really like this I have no idea, but it sure seemed more believable than most western flicks I've seen. Even in the movie itself it calls attention to how gun fights and the mood are exaggerated in most instances. Somewhat ironic I think. Some people complain it was too slow or not enough action, ect. I loved the pace and flow of the movie. In saying that, I'd classify it more as a drama western than an action western. Something that bugs me in modern day movies is how unrealistic they become due to special effects and the directors need to oust the films of 5 years ago. So you end up with these CGI, steroid like fights that are just totally unbelievable. In this movie, the fights / shootouts are in my opinion much more exciting because they are so realistic feeling.Amazing acting throughout, giving credit to mostly Eastwood, Hackman, and Freeman. They play really believable characters, which helps make the whole story believable. Even the acting of the characters I didn't like so much (the writer, Kid, English Bob) were good. I didn't really find this movie to be much of a `Good guy, bad guy' kind of a movie. It's much greyer than that. You get the feeling that everyone was more or less good and bad in there own ways, which I found to be very non Hollywood and realistic. You have the Murderous outlaw who hangs up his pistols to become a pig farmer and providing father, who then reverts back after being indirectly pushed. A meaty tough sheriff who's not afraid to beat the living p*** out of someone to set an example. And Freeman who plays the long time partner of Eastwood who realizes he hasn't got the brutality that he once had.Definitely one of those movies that I will watch time and time again. Awesome directing by Eastwood, fine acting by everyone, great simple storyline, good character development, very down to earth / realistic feel, and cool theme song. One of those movies you really get absorbed into. Hat's off to Eastwood on this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had watched this film before, back when I was 17 or so, expecting a gunslinging, foul mouthed, cool, action-filled western similar to A fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More or The Good the Bad and the Ugly. Of course I was disappointed back then when I saw the product. There just was not anything I had expected there to be. No cool Clint slingin' guns and shootin' off worse guys than himself from the first minute to the last. No cool music by Ennio Morricone. No duels. No abundance of one-liners. So understandably I didn't like the film that much. But now, I'm six years and since I like Clint Eastwood I thought I'd give this film a second chance. On top of that can over twenty-thousand people visiting IMDB and giving this film a 8.0 be wrong? Well I found out that they are not. Unforgiven is a good western, but only for those out there who are prepared for a bit of storytelling. If you're looking for action and one-liners pick up one of Clint's films that I mentioned earlier or their 1990's equivalent: Desperado. You could try to convince yourself to watch this because it has won 4 Academy Awards, but if you're looking for fun and action, do you really care about artistic quality in Directing or acting. I know I didn't and I know most other folks just want to see a lot of shooting as well. This does not mean that there is no action here, or no shooting, it's just that it is not the focal point of the movie. The focal point are the characters here. The professional gunslingers, the starting gunslingers and the retired gunslingers. Good, mature western, made by a matured Clint Eastwood and although I enjoyed it I thought that there was something missing. I know I searched, but I could not find it. Maybe it was because the intro and the text in the end of the film were scrolled onto the screen in dutch. I really hated that!7,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS "Unforgiven" is one of the best Westerns ever made and then to think that it actually is an Anti-Western movie.Dedicated to his mentor Sergio Leone,this movie goes in the opposite direction of any normal Western.Eastwood plays an old ex-killer who lost his wife and has to take care of his two kids and takes on one final kill for the money.Eastwood shows his acting qualities by playing a sad and done-for Cowboy,named Munny.His mate,Ned,is played by Morgan Freeman and the Sheriff of the town where he has to kill is played by Gene Hackman. The final scene in which Eastwood takes on revenge for his mate Ned,who was killed by the Sheriff,is to me the best scene of the movie.It shows that Munny is still a killer without remorse.This scene is really well played by Eastwood.Although it is not your regular Western,it is one of the best ones I've ever seen.This is because of the story and because of the brilliant acting by the three main characters. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was really a good western movie. That is, the first 30 or 40 times it was made. So, I think you ought to have a really good reason to make it yet another time. However, if Mr. Eastwood had one (beyond making a pot of money), it isn't evident on the screen. We have seen every single element, idea, and dialog - almost scene by scene - done before and done better. So, how does one account for the good reviews, the good box office, the Oscar? Ever hear of another movie called Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? Mass hypnosis maybe?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>UNFORGIVEN is most likely Clint Eastwood's last western, and it was a good film to make as a goodbye to the genre since he portrays a gunslinger who goes on one final adventure with his former partner played by Morgan Freeman. The film has good acting and is well written and directed. Gene Hackman is great to watch as the bad guy, and the rest of the cast is great. UNFORGIVEN is definitely recommended to western fans and is the only western from the 90's that I enjoyed. 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Won Oscars for Best Picture and Director of 1992. Clint Eastwood, starred and directed this journey into the heart of darkness of the western. Clint plays William Munny. Will is lured out of gunfighter retirement and a life of squalor, back to his wicked ways as his deceased wife called them, by a bounty. The bounty is being offered for a cowboy who disfigured a prostitute, by her fellow prostitutes. In the face of need Will returns to his old ways. He rides with Morgan Freeman, and the young inexperienced gunman who recruited them to collect the bounty. In the town of Big Whiskey they find the brutal sheriff, Gene Hackman, is waiting for all those who come to collect. The ensuing confrontations are packed with the malevolence and tension that one would expect from this superb cast. Will rains down on the town of Big Whiskey serving a cold dish of vengeance after receiving a brutal beating from the sheriff, in a memorable final sequence. Richard Harris makes an animated appearance as, what else, an English gunslinger. While the action and violence might lead one to think this film is superficial, it has enough emotional drama and soul searching to balance things out. One of the best westerns since the Duke rode off into the sunset. If you like westerns, don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood gives us the last true Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is one of the greatest films ever made. A fatalistic, dark, emotional masterpiece, it is the last true Western. It is no accident that no great Western films have been made since "Unforgiven" came out in 1992. The film effectively closes the book on any other statements that could be made in the genre. It is a fitting elegy to a type of film that brought cinema great achievements ("The Searchers", "Shane", "The Wild Bunch", and many more). The film chronicles William Munny (Eastwood at his best), a retired gunslinger, who was once the "rootin' tootin' meanest son of a bitch who ever lived," deciding to pick up his guns one more time to kill a few cowboys who mutilated a prostitute. There is a bounty on their head, and Munny is a failing pig farmer trying to raise his two children, so the money looks might promising. Before he sets off, however, Munny picks up his old partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). "How long's it been since you fired a gun, Will? Ten years?" Munny answers "Eleven." It is true that Munny is rusted over-he continually says that his wife Claudia "cured him of wrongdoing". However, he says this so much it sounds more like the affirmation of a man in denial than someone who has actually changed.So Munny and Logan ride off (in several beautifully shot scenes) to meet the Scofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a young hotshot who claims to be a killer. But as the film progresses we learn there is more (or less) to the Scofield Kid than is apparent. As the three men ride toward Big Whiskey, Wyoming (the site of the whore-cutting), the town's sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman in one of his great performances), tries to keep order. A brutal, violent, and menacingly intelligent man, Little Bill is a formidable presence indeed. As these elements come together, the film's tension is racketed up to almost unbearable heights. The film's climax is one of the most truthful, brutal, and sobering finales in cinema history. We learn that no one can escape their past, and no man who was once a killer will ever be anything else. As you watch the final scenes, it comes as a sudden shock to you that the people you thought were heroes and villains were nothing of the sort. In a film like "Unforgiven", there are no good guys and bad guys, only a gray existence between the two. That is the message of "Unforgiven": that when it comes to violence, there are no good guys and bad guys, only men who do as much damage to themselves as to others by killing.That is the film's message, but there are other things in "Unforgiven" that make it unforgettable. The acting is top-notch, including Richard Harris as an ill-fated outsider looking for the bounty, Saul Rubinek as his leach-like biographer, and Frances Fisher as Strawberry Alice, the leader of the prostitutes and a singularly unforgiving individual. These characters interact against the backdrop of a quickly eroding culture. The Old West is in its final days in this film, and that sense of soon-to-be-loss carries over the entire movie. "Unforgiven" is a film about the end of something: the end of a lifstyle, the end of a culture, the end of lives. Because it so effectively and brilliantly takes place in this dying time, it acts as the final chapter to the Western genre, ending a celluloid odyssey on a pathos-filled guitar note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people would say that if you want realism, go outside. But sometimes it is just want a particular genre needs, and the Western needed it. After being saturated by innumerable implausible one-man-against-many plots, Eastwood delivers a wonderful-realised conclusion (or so it would seem) to his Western career. It could only really be Clint, the star of the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, who manages to mix into the usual gunfight glamour and clear good guy/bad guy mix the realism of sleeping in the rain and the past that you sometimes cannot escape. Ignore the people who bleat about how un-Western it is. Just enjoy the fantastic performances from Freeman and Hackman; and possibly the last time you'll see Eastwood in his natural habitat of the Western</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint's Coda...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Munny is a self-proclaimed `retired' old west law breaker and all around hell raiser. His former life was rife with whiskey and useless death, but his late lamented wife showed him the error of his ways. When Munny is offered the chance to join up with a youthful and eager wannabe renegade to assassinate two men that cut up a whore for a reward. With Ned his old partner Will sets out to collect the reward. The only thing that stands in their way is the town sheriff, Little Bill.But will Munny be able to resurrect his mean streak or will he succumb to his 11 year retirement. Clint Eastwood's coda to the western is a somber piece. The realism of the film is in stark contrast to the westerns of the golden age. Gone are the clearly drawn lines of good against the bad, instead what we are shown is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the `glamorous' western with fallible characters that are never quite as they should be. The depth and breadth of the characters is quite spectacular. The heroes are all broken and battered and suffer from their pasts in many different ways. The production design is wonderful. The town is a very detailed and realistic set. The photography is very dark and personal, the film does have moments of large expansive shots but for the most part it stays closely focused on the actors. The acting is top notch. Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance as Little Bill is interesting and he seems to play him with sadistic glee. Freeman and Harris round out the cast that is full of outstanding performances. All the characters are represented. Almost every character has a seen to shine in. including many of the smaller parts. The script is character driven and thought provoking ode to the real west. Clint Eastwood is at the top of his game creatively. This film is an exclamation point to his career in westerns. And the theme he wrote for the film is beautiful. The winner of 4 academy Awards (including Best Picture and Director. A must see for western fans and others alike. Highly rated and a must-see. One of the best. 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an art house western (warning spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has always been an icon of the western along with Gary Cooper and John Wayne.WIth Unforgiven he takes his icon status and the genre of the western into new direction. Like Sam Peckinpaw, Sergio Leon and even John Ford, he treis to show a deeper meaning to the violence and themes that run through this genreThe movie centers on Eastwoods character named William Munny. He is a man that once an alcholoic violent gunfighter that according to himself "killed everything that walked or crawled at one time or another" He is a man seeking redemption and forgiveness for his past and for a time found it in the arms of his wife that has died. He has two children to raise and is not a very good farmer. He is presented with the opportunity to avenge the mutilation of a prostitue and make some money that he needs.One of the most striking scenes is with him and Morgan Freeman camped around a fire. Here Eastwood see's that he could be falling into his old ways and is desperatly trying to convince himself that he has changed. He sounds like a young boy beaten for having done something wrong and wishes not to do it again.Another spin on the genre comes with Gene Hackmans character. Hackman plays little bill the sheriff who ruthlessly enforcs his no gun policy. Hackman take what some might have played as an easy villian and transforms him into a man so convinced that what he does is right, he blinds himself to just how evil he is. He thinks by enforcing his rules and building a house he is a decent man. It is a masterfull and chilling performance.Morgan Freeman is the only real decent character in the film. He is not as adapt to killing as Eastwood and Hackmans characters. In another western he wood have been the hero while Eastwood would be the villian.The screenplay truly tries to show that in the old west, men did not avenge womens honor. Here, the men are out to make money. And the fact that the women is a prostitute must be taken into account when in most other westerns these characters are usually made into villian or ignored.The real power of the film comes in the last third. Jamz Woovett finds out what killing a man really means. He finds no glory in that act. In another western, this wouldnt even come up. He finds no comfort from eastwood who says "we all got it comin" while trying to rationalize the killing.In the final showdown we see a younger more lethal Eastwood harking back to Dirty Harry and the Man with no Name. Eastwoods entrance in this scene is legendary. I wont even describe it. All I can say is that he is the films avenging angel. He brings the violence and revenge to those characters that are suppose to represent justice. In this film we see that revenge and death bring us no catharsis or joy, only a sadness that seems to fill this film and makes us think about who are the real good guys and bad guys in this genre.The ending is moraly ambigous. Is Eastwood damned or maybe some people would like to think that he uses the money to bring a better life for his children as said in the films coda. With this film Eastwood stares down his icon status and the western genre. He gives us no good guys, all we are left with is the question of what does revenge and violence truly bring us in this genre. In the end all the characters are truly left unforgiven.In the end, see this wonderfull film for yourself</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art as Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns are typically about the fight between good and evil. And so is this one except that fight exists in one character.William Munny is a man divided. In Unforgiven, Eastwood explores that rift that exists in all of us. Faced with the temptation to do evil over good, to what does a man succumb? Therein lies the basis that forms the characters and action for Unforgiven.Rather than a politically correct Western, this film has no clear cut hero. Gene Hackman as the despot sheriff, Lil' Bill, represents no clear side of good or evil. Also, Eastwood as a reluctant killer driven to his old murderous ways by circumstances of accepting one last hit.Thus, we see that Unforgiven is like life itself as most art must be. There is no clear good or evil but both existing side by side in characters driven not by large set pieces of plot but by circumstances of the moment. A character kills in a fit of rage because he's run off the road by a punk in a BMW, not because he retains the fatal flaw throughout his entire life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>UNFORGIVEN (1992) **** Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, Frances Fisher, Anna Thomson, Saul Rubinek. An instant Western classic. When two cowboys cut up a town prostitute and the sadistic sheriff lets them off easy, the madam and her girls set up a bounty for justice.Enter former murderer of women and children-turned family man/pig farmer William Munny (Eastwood in arguably his best performance and Oscar nominated) who is coerced by a young, cocky near-sighted vigilante wannabe (Woolvett). With the aid of Munny's old friend (Freeman), the trio set out to get the dirty deed done. Brilliantly directed by Eastwood (Best Director Academy Award and for Best Picture), this revisionist Western proves to set a new standard for the genre: redemption for a gunslinger. Great performances all around including Hackman (Best Supporting Actor) as a man of bent justice and Harris as his old nemesis who isn't all he appears to be. But clearly this is Eastwood's coup de grace with his tight direction and excellent interpretation of David Webb Peoples' script (the story was ten years in the making with Francis Ford Coppola one-time attached to helm). Savage and at times comical, the film is head and shoulders above its past contemporaries in countless times of reviving the genre.Eastwood, who dedicated this film to his directorial mentors Don Siegel and Sergio Leone, also co-composed part of the musical score with Lennie Niehaus. Stark and beautiful crisp photography courtesy of Jack N. Green and tight Oscar-winning editing from Joel Cox.</fullReview>

Fantastic performances, with a small role by Richard Harris as English Bob being particularly memorable although all the actors involved are at the top of their game here. Solid direction by Eastwood, great script, ace cinematography and superb editing. It all adds up to one of the finest westerns ever, or any film for that matter. If you're after a rootin tootin shoot 'em up western then you'll be left disappointed. This isn't an action film, far from it.

		<shortDescription>Well worth a watch if you are a Western, or a Clint fan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the best Western around, but it is good, solid fare. Clint Eastwood reprises his role as the quintessential gunfighter, here retired from gunslinging, who is forced by circumstance into buckling on his gunbelt again.From the start, of course, you know that Clint will go on the warpath, it's just a matter of time. However, when things really do take off there's an element of darkness in Munny (Clint's character) that rises to the surface rapidly and quickly dominates the rest of the movie. Not that this is bad in any way. It really serves to show how thin the veneer of civilization really is with Munny. His character goes from the affable, gunslinging Clint we all recall from earlier Westerns, to the dark and menacing murderer we are told he was in his youth. And Eastwood handles this acting challenge superbly. He's someone you really don't want to be around.That said, there are a few comic lines in the film. I'm not sure if they were designed to lighten the mood, or just to remind the audience that it's just a Hollywood movie, but they work. My favourite is after Munny shoots a man dead. Someone says "You just shot an unarmed man!" to which Munny replies "Well, then. He should have armed himself."The other actors give great supporting roles. Hackman's villain is oily and obnoxious - he always seems to play those roles well - and you dislike him right from the start.But on the whole this is a darker Western than the usual Hollywood stuff. Well worth a watch if you are a Western, or a Clint fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is true that throughout the years Clint Eastwood has portrayed the quintessential tough guy, but Unforgiven seems to be a response to every tough guy he ever played. The gloss of action movie violence is stripped away and the true horror of killing is shown. William Munny (Eastwood) doesn't kill fifty people in the course of the movie, nor does he revel his exploits like English Bob (Richard Harris) or Little Bill (Gene Hackman). He is a man who realizes the all of the terrible things he did as a young man and now has to live with those memories. The woman who made him change his ways is dead and all he has left are his children and his memory. Eastwood is not responsible for the writing of this film , but he did choose to star and direct in it. Unforgiven takes the American western and removes the quick draw glamour Eastwood shows in The Outlaw Josey Wales and The Man With No Name trilogy, and scrapes off all the shine until the only thing left is a raw accurate portrayal of an aging gun fighter.</fullReview>

Eastwood would have gotten Best Actor if he wasn't slated for Best Director.Although many great Westerns have been made, Unforgiven benefits from contemporary film standards. The glitches of earlier generation Westerns are gone. Moral arguments, philosophy, grand statement are also gone. A great story with neither a good or bad ending. Everything happening seems to make sense but again it's all so senseless. A quest, heroes, villains, comedy, tragedy, death. A film noir Western. Who would have guessed Eastwood would be the one to do it. It's impossible not to sense the unusual feel of this movie. Art, genius, brilliance, Western - never before combined. Story telling - not telling a story but real story telling - a story no one has told before - but it all seems so familiar. Of course it all makes sense but we really don't understand why. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a truly wonderful film. If you don't like westerns, then I still suggest you see this movie, because its quality transcends the limits of any particular genre. Eastwood plays William Munny, a former gunslinger who picks up his six guns looking for one last score. He is joined by his friend and former partner Ned Logan, played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman. The two aging outlaws set out for Big Whiskey, Wyoming, where a group of vengeful prostitutes are seeking retribution for the battery of one of their own. Gene Hackman gives an Oscar-winning performance as "Little" Bill Dagget, sheriff of Big Whiskey. He is desperate to keep bounty hunters from riding into town looking for the money the prostitutes are offering. Richard Harris gives a memorable performance as English Bob, a legendary gunfighter who rides into town looking to collect. Little Bill looks to make an example out of Bob, who is an old rival. Along the way, Will desperately tries to convince himself that just because he is temporarily returning to his old life, it doesn't mean he'll stay that way forever. Will's journey to face the man he once was is accompanied by a truly haunting musical score, and breathtaking cinematagrophy. Unforgiven is a story of violence, revenge and redemption, with a non-violent message. It is truly worthy of its best-picture Oscar.</fullReview>

Like a jibe at his previous efforts that prided their violent content, "Unforgiven" examines the emotions and motives that drives men, both of the law and outside it, to do evil.Each actor in this film plays a character of extreme depth and importance. Clint wonderfully portrays an aged widower and recovering alcoholic who is drawn from raising his two young children back to the violence of his past. In his younger days, his violent tendencies were legendary and his later life has been spent fighting to put it behind him. Eastwood's character is constantly tortured by the moral battle within himself that is being fueled by the wickedness of the world around him.There are also several wonderful actors of the leading calibre who put their extreme talents to work in the supporting role. Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek each offer a character who do not comfortably fit into the basic categories of the American Western where characters wore either a black or white hat. Rather they have characteristics that make them indefinable in simple terms.Finally comes the character of Little Bill who is played to absolute perfection by the always superb Gene Hackman (who won a Best Supporting Oscar for this role). He is the perfect "villain" for this story that questions the role of evil. Hackman is the sheriff of a small town who is respected by his subordinates and outlaws alike. He maintains peace in his town through ferocious acts that either leave the recipient viciously beaten or dead. And that is what makes his character fascinating. The majority of the audience is in favour of a law-abiding society, but this makes us question at what cost we want law and order. There are also moments where Little Bill is not acting in his role as sheriff but of laid-back homebody who enjoys making home rennovations and joking with towns-people. He is not a cartoonish villain whose singular purpose is evil, but a complex man who wants to do his job to the best of his ability and in the end to retire. His acts of cruelty while on the job have the purpose of maintaining the peace and Hackman's character does not question the means to achieve that goal. The movie then asks us if violence is necessary to put an end to Little Bill's ways, therefore continuing the cycle.As far as I'm concerned, this is the final chapter of the Western. Clint, a true trail-blazer of the genre revisits the territory as a character and film-maker and demonstrates that violence begets violence and the toll it can take on the human soul. All this makes "Unforgiven" more than a simple Western, but also an examination of man living in a society and the role of violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 5 best westerns ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many say that film was in it's golden age when we had a new Western coming out every other weekend. The Western genre allowed so much for filmmakers to explore: the battle between good and evil, the choice between what's right and wrong, the teaching of strong morals, ethics, and values. It was a canvas for a modern American mythology. But once Peckinpah created his savage western to end all westerns (preceded by Sergio Leone's anti-westerns), there wasn't much more to say on the subject. There wasn't any room for the classic western of yesteryear. Until a skinny actor named Clint decided to take all he had learned on the subject over his thirty year career and make the most self aware and intelligent western ever. Superbly acted, sublimely written and photographed, UNFORGIVEN is Eastwood's master work as a director and actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven tells the story of a retired gun-slinger who has hung up his guns and been domesticated by his now dead wife. An offer to avenge a cut-up prostitute and receive a bounty lures him (Eastwood) and his old partner (Freeman) out of retirement and into partnership with a youngster...who is blind as a bat!Everything is right about this movie; the acting is top-shelf, especially by Hackman, and Eastwood puts in perhaps his career best performance. The music is stirring, but seldom used, cinematography stunning and the story is gripping, with a wide ensemble of characters all fleshed out beautifully by Peoples screenplay.Not just a reviving of a classic genre, Unforgiven defines it and deserves its space with the classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best FILMS ever **spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The death of the Western genre, which began, ironically enough with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns (Clint's claim to fame), was a slow but painful thing. As the standard Western heroes - John Wayne, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper - either died or got too old for their parts, only a few Italian Westerns and an occasional Eastwood one (though he went nine years between "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "Pale Rider" - and seven between the latter and this) kept the genre alive. Then, in the early 1990's, two classic Westerns briefly breathed new life into the Western, before it continued to decline (or just died). Neither were conventional. The first, "Dances With Wolves", is the first. Second only to Leone's "Once Upon A Time In The West", it turns around the standard John Ford theme of "good white and black guys/bad Indians" (as Ford himself did in "Cheyenne Autumn", his last Western). Even though Kevin Costner has become one of the most egotistical and hated directors/producers/stars (though I still like him, in spite of "3000 Miles to Graceland"), this film (his directoral debut) was a classic film in every sense of the words. This one, however, was a little different. Eastwood always knew that he owed his career to Leone (and Don Sigel), and dedicated his Oscar(s) to the twosome. Most of his Westerns ("High Plains Drifter", "The Outlaw Josey Wales", "Pale Rider") are spin-offs of his infamous Man With No Name. And yet, nothing could compare to this, his magnum opus. Screw "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" and "Dirty Harry": this is Eastwood's best. The death-kneel for the Western, "Unforgiven" takes many Western cliches - the veteran gunslinger, the kid who's all talk, brutal and corrupt lawmen, the whores - and turns them inside out. Will Munny is at first very likeable as a (somewhat) reformed gunslinger; however, towards, the end, as he rumbles towards the inevitable showdown with Sheriff "Little Bill" Dagget (the Oscar-winning Hackman), he resorts to his merciless, cruel, drunken self of old. His one friend, Ned Logan (an outstanding Freeman) is dead; the other, the all-talk, no-guts, half-blind Schofield Kid (a suprisingly good Woolvett) refuses to continue the mission after killing one of the criminals. So it's Munny against Dagget and his deputies. The violence is portrayed very realistically; there's actually little violence (and only minimal shootouts); the whore being cut up; English Bob (a likeable Harris) being roughed up by Hackman; Freeman being the same; the death of the two cowboys (including the cowboy being shot on the toilet, which in any other film would've been a stupid sight gag); and of course, the final confrontation.  With a cast that includes Eastwood, Hackman, Woolvett, Logan, Harris, Frances Fisher ("Titanic"), character actor Saul Rubineck, and many less famous faces. There is little more I can add to the comments on this film. Bravo, Clint. Ten stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven for What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually reserve my reviews for less well known movies. I feel that they are the orphans of the industry and deserve some recognition. But after seeing this movie, I was moved to comment on it.Clint Eastwood the director, seems to have a knack for finding those little quirks in an otherwise routine plot that nudges his movies up the respectability ladder a step or two (and making it big at the box office as a result). This movie is no exception.He plays an over the hill gunslinger who is seduced out of retirement with the promise of money and a just cause. His wife has died and he has two young kids to raise. His hogs are dying and he needs the money. He is hired by a couple of hookers to kill a couple of cowpokes who cut up one of their own. He hooks up with an old pal (Morgan Freeman) and a young wannabe gunslinger - none of whom, including Clint, could shoot worth a damn. This mission takes on a life of it's own. They manage to track down the culprits but must face a showdown with the local Marshall played with sadistic relish by Gene Hackman. I am reminded of his performance in "Prime Cut". The final shoot out is not to be missed.What's quirky about this movie is the total ineptitude of the gunmen. Clint can't hit what he shoots at, Morgan Freeman is afraid to kill, and the kid is all bluster and no guts. Still they take on the mission and all three come into their own one way or another. Something else. Clint's history is never revealed until the very end of the movie and I was shocked to hear who he really was. He also shows true compassion for the "whores" despite his obvious discomfort.These are the kind of things that make Clint Eastwood movies a cut above the routine. It is not one of his better known efforts, but I urge you to see it. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie exposes the truth that all human beings are flawed, to a bigger or lesser degree, ranging from "she just gave a giggle at his little poke, she couldn't help it" (the cowboy didn't forgive her, he proceeded to cut her face) to "I've killed just about every thing that moves, and I'm here to kill you, Little Bill." (the main character couldn't forgive himself) It explores what can happen to a man who's own flaws are unforgiven..."Don't worry kid, I'm not going to kill you, you're the only friend I've got". It exposes how we sometimes blind ourselves to own flaws..."I don't deserve to die like this, I was building a house." I was very moved with the way this movie exposed just how little forgiveness there can be in this world and how just a little bit goes a long ways..."you're not ugly like me, it's just that we both have scars."

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood fits this role so well that the William Munny character becomes real on the screen, despite the seeming inconsistencies in the character. I detected an underlying theme that is familiar, and an interesting observation of people, both in the past, and in the present. Many people take up a vocation not because they enjoy it, or because they think it is good, useful, or important; but simply because they are good at it. Eastwood portrays William Munny as such a man, whose skills happen to be in the art of killing. This theme is punctuated in the closing comments. This is Clint Eastwood at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some movies get better the more you see them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie several times and each time the detail and depth of the plot and characteriszations grows richer. In revisting the movie the reality of human drama grows in the context of American values and how we have come to the type of society (America) we have created.Clint Eastwood has created an iconic masterpiece that over time may become more appreciated in the same way that Casablanca and other iconic films have become. The film is a definitive moral summary of all American western films from the value set of today's society.The plot, centers around the uniquely American response (in the character of Clint Eastwood) to the injustice and dictatorial slavery of a sheriff (Gene Hackman) in a small town in 1880 Wyoming. The story builds from a small offense in a brothel (literally an insulting giggle by a small town prostitute) to the climatic finish of a bar room shootout on a dark and stormy night. Good and evil is constrasted in switched roles where the sheriff becomes the villan and the criminal the hero.I highly recommend serious film lovers to revist the movie several times. The iconic nature of the movie may well characterize it as the best western ever made. Unforgiven is as good as Clint Eastwood's other film, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'. The difference between the two however shows up over time. Like an event that happens in your life that you think of over and over again, this western reminds us of why we are the way we are (as Americans).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anybody don't wanna be shot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is an excellent Western made by one of the genre's icons, Clint Eastwood. The film is a superb meditiation on the Old West and its heroes, deconstructing myths raised by John Wayne films, turning the good guy - bad guy formula on it's head and defying audience expectations. We long for Eastwood's Will Munny to rise heroically into the hero mould, but throughout a picture emerges of someone definitly dis-likeable, a "killer of women and children" as he puts it. Also, Gene Hackman's "Little" Bill, a sheriff, is simply upholding the law and trying to keep the peace in his town, to the extent where it is very hard to find him a villian (Hackman is splendid.) Also, the film leaves no satisfaction for the audience to take from any deaths - you cannot help but feel sorry for the guy who dies slowly as his body is riddled by mis-directed bullets from the no-longer deadly sharpshooters. Also, we cannot even find comedy in the "shot whilst on the toilet" sequence, as the close ups capture every moment of that character's humiliation and pain. Eastwood, Hackman, and Morgan Freeman (as Eastwood's former partner and fellow aging gunslinger) are excellent in one of the best movies ever made. "Any man who don't wanna get shot had better clear out the back."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what i was expecting from Unforgiven but i dont think i was expecting an old fashioned traditional western. That is exactly what Unforgiven is. A story of a fabled gun fighter who rides into town to carry out a revenge (all abeit for money) against two cowboys who cut up a prostitute. What makes this a little different is the hero is old and fairly frail and is well past his sell by date. Clint Eastwood is superb as is Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman and they all contribute to a highly entertaining movie which can be compared to most of the great westerns. There is something quite sad about the movie too because we can see that this was always going to be Hollywood greatest Cowboy's last western. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film on HBO a short while ago... And I guess I am just a little over 10 years behind watching it... The cast line-up would probably attract many a serious movie-watcher.. The story, like what most reviewers before me have said, is one that re-examines the glamour and glory associated with most westerns. I thought the show was kind of slow-moving but it wasn't the kind of pace that would put you to sleep... It is an OK film but I wouldn't rate it as one of the classics... Like I said, perhaps it's because I watched the film 10 years too late. This genre of films where reckless killings and the heroes' lives are re-examined has already been brought out in many war films of the 90s. Then again, maybe I should not draw a parallel between those films and this film, or it could be that I am just not a serious western movie-watcher... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best American western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disappointment of Pale Rider I would not have cared one iota if ole Clint never got into the saddle again. But thank goodness he did. And in the process he not only gives us a truly great western he also delivers a career defining performance. Unforgiven is the best American western I have seen and, in the genre, ranks only behind The good, the bad and the ugly.An act of brutality sets off a chain of events with tragic and far reaching consequences. A prostitute has her face sliced by an angry customer. When the town sheriff, Gene Hackman, dishes out scant justice the other prostitutes offer a bounty on the head of the man responsible. Soon Hackman has his hands full (and bloodied) trying to keep order in his town as gunfighters come from far and wide to try and claim the reward. He is particularly harsh on English Bob (Richard Harris) a "gentleman" gunfighter with his own personal scribe who embellishes Bob's stories for a magazine.Clint Eastwood is William Munny, a rogue turned pig farmer. He is a widower, the woman who reformed him having passed away. He is left raising two children. When he first hears of the reward he is reluctant to return to his old ways but the prospect of earning the money which he desperately needs is too enticing. He enlists the aid of Morgan Freeman and they are joined by a young upstart who has a totally warped and glamorous view of killing.Apart from the superb performances of Eastwood and Hackman, I was also impressed by the beautiful photography, the score and, in particular, the screenplay by David Webb Peoples. But what really got to me was the scene where, after fighting personal demons for much of the film, Eastwood finally regains his natural instincts and William Munny, pig farmer becomes William Munny, killer. This is a moment of incredible power and, if Eli Wallach running through the cemetery in The good, the bad and the ugly was that film's standout scene then this is surely the most memorable scene of Unforgiven.A top notch western and a fine film in any genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fierce and very unforgiving western story about a reformed gunslinger, William Munny (Clint Eastwood), who enlists his former partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to go along with him and a cocky young man, "The Schofield Kid" (Jamiz Woolvett) to head to Big Whiskey, a small town in Wyoming to find and kill two cowboys, one of whom severally mutilated an innocent prostitute.What the trio don't know about Big Whiskey is Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), the town's brutal sheriff who will stop at nothing to enforce his version of justice. One example of how Daggett carries out the law is when he takes his anger out another bounty hunter, English Bob (Richard Harris). Daggett's methods of law enforcement are....just frightening enough.Eastwood, who also directs here, brings out not only how mean that men in the west can be, but the honesty that is buried deep down inside. Casting the likes of well-known actors such as Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris in roles that were meant for them is a real benefit for this. Woolvett, Frances Fisher, and Saul Rubinek are good here in the smaller roles. The performances by everyone here is sharp and very clear. As for the editing, cinematography, and the musical score, these parts give "Unforgiven" an extra boost of excitement.I can't make up my mind of what "Unforgiven" reminds me, so this film has the feel of "The Wild Bunch" and "Taxi Driver" or "Death Wish". Anyway, it's pure Eastwood; cold, swift, and heartfelt.</fullReview>

Rather than sit here and try to do justice to this GREAT film by explaining the plot, let me instead just say that Clint Eastwood was CLASSIC Clint in this one. By the time it was over, it had me wanting to go out and find everyone who had ever wronged me and whoop their tails. Never has revenge been so sweet in any other movie. And what can I say about the cast. It is impossible to go wrong when your three leads are Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman. This film is right up there with the greatest westerns I've ever seen. Between this and Tombstone and Wyatt Earp, I think it may be my favorite western of all time.All in all, this movie is Clint's greatest flick yet, and he was also the one who directed it. This movie was easily a 10, and if I could rate it higher I would. It is a must own DVD. And if your are just starting out and only own one DVD, make sure this is it.

I was disappointed when I didn't get all of this. A co-worker convinced me to watch it again, and this time I enjoyed the characters and how they unfolded, which is the strongpoint of this movie. My recommendation to you is to watch this with that in mind. If you want to see a straight up western with non-stop action, check out a movie like "American Outlaws." If you want to see a movie that makes you think about a person's inner struggles with good and evil, check out "Unforgiven."</fullReview>

Gene Hackman is utterly ruthless as the town sherrif, and the movie is exciting from start to finish. The pacing really isn't very quick, but there's plenty to interest here.It's hard to talk about much without giving away the ending, but it's great to watch the morality issues at play in the movie. Is it right to kill the two cowboys after they have already been punished? Is it right to leave your kids or your wife to pursue some reward? These questions you'll have to ask yourself as you watch.

		<shortDescription>The new Clint Eastwood western style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're expecting to see another one of the happy-shoot-'em-up westerns with Clint Eastwood in it, I strongly suggest to go with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. This is probably the most un-western like film ever because it is so close to real life and not the hollywood fantasy we hold as the 'wild west'.The Unforgiven is more about the question of 'what makes a man?' then anything else. Its a question of how our personality can be different in different situations and how we can be influenced by those around us. Wild West was just a setting, not a central part of the movie. THat is why there is little shooting and more verbal action in comparison with almost any other of Clint Eastwood's work.For example, Will Munny (played by Eastwood) used to be the most cold blooded killer in the west, blowing up trains, murdering U.S. marshals, shooting guys for just looking at him the wrong way. Suddenly he just marries a simple girl and becomes a farmer. Through out the movie he talks about how she changed him, how he settled down with kids now. Though his wife is never shown since she died 'bout 3 years before the action takes place, we get quite a realistic picture of her.Through out the movie we see characters changing. It's not black&amp;white like most westerns. Heroes don't have signs on them, neither do the villains. The deputy is sadistic and bloodthirsty. The assasins are humane. The tough men with guns are just scared witless. We see the what makes a character and so the whole movie is about that, about how Will Munny is no longer a cold blooded killer and yet his last job forces him to become one again, how the Schofield kid pretends to be all tough and yet turns out to be just a kid playing with guns, how the deputy is not so lawful afterall and how men can have as many sides to them as there are stars in the sky.I suggest this film to anyone interested in watching an interesting film about what most films are about, human nature. Again this is not an action movie, though the climax is perhaps one of the most explosive one's brought out by Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil is never black and white (know what you are criticizing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a brilliant tale of the complex nature of humanity. This movie is asserting the undefined dualism inherent in all people with regards to good and evil. There are enough reviews (some insightful, others embarrassing) that give an outline of the plot. I would like to refute some of the more popular criticisms thrown at the film ("Violent" and "Boring").Graphic violence. This film was released in 1992, what is it that is so appalling to these viewers? The fist fights? The blood? The gunfire? It is as though, these viewers have never seen an action movie or western (not that this film is given to either genre entirely). The violence in Unforgiven was not gratuitous. Take the characters for example; two of the "bad guys", the ranchers who cut up the prostitute were not killers. That scene, though uncomfortable to watch, only depicted a girl getting cut in the face. In real-life, yes, this would be horrible. But in the "old west", in a movie, this scene could have been far more brutal. However, that was not the intention of the scene. The act was to prove that though these men were drunk and acted maliciously, this was not given to their usual way.Other characters took part in more violent scenes. The beatings administered by Little Bill were illustrating the hypocrisy of his office and sadistic nature of the character. (To say nothing of the enormously abused power of law enforcement gone unchecked). Will Munny, "a known thief and murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition." How did you expect him to behave once his character had been reduced to his former self? His scenes of violence were necessary and should have been expected of any viewer that had been paying attention to the film.Boring? I don't understand how this film is boring because I enjoy all types of movie-making for what they are. I can see how some viewers might think that there is a lull in the action (no doubt the same viewers that complain about violence in those scenes that do contain "action)...). The story develops gradually along with the characters' evolution. The movie was not intended to be an "action-shootout". I enjoyed watching the masterfully acted characters reveal every aspect of a man living in a time where good and evil are not black and white. (I especially liked "matthannafin"'s take on the "Beauchamp" character, very perceptive) Good and evil are in fact only interpretations of those involved in the situation and the perception (formed by their own values and experience) of the audience. More so, the characters become disassociated with their acts, in that even in performing acts of evil, the audience still loves the character because (they had no choice). They become identifiable at the root level, despite the environment.I loved Unforgiven and would recommend it to anyone who can enjoy a film for all its merits: acting, writing, directing, cinematography, etc. If you don't like "westerns", you may yet like this film regardless as it tells its story despite the genre with which it will most likely be labeled. Viewers should not expect an action-blockbuster and more importantly should not criticize a movie because it is not what they expected or they do not understand its intentions. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>character study based in a western setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all this isn't a classic western. I'm sure many of you know this is no fistful of dollars. In fact, aside from the setting, it may not even be a western movie. Some people cannot like a movie with a despicable main character. But this is what is presented throughout the movie. As with real life though, each character has more than one side. Munny is evil yes, but is able to show compassion, and even fear (unheard of in action movies). So to really enjoy the movie, you must look at the main character from the outside. Not like an action movie where you are basically rooting for the protaganist like a ball game.This movie truelly is a masterpiece. Violent yes, but much more tame than any action movie made in the last 10 to 15 years. And yes it is dark. Many will not like it for that reason. If you don't like movies that show the human mind and spirit for what it is, then this movie isn't for you. This is no mindless action flick. It delves deep into many issues that are still applicable today. The sheriff being the prime example of this.But there are scenes with humour to break away from the tension. And while the pacing is slow and deliberate, it is for good reason. Not once did I ever look at my watch. The suspense easily carries you through the slow scenes. And very important character development occurs in these scenes.On first viewing the ending never seemed right with me. But on subsequent viewings, I realize this is the only possible ending, although it might have been a little better. I am not sure I like the dark humour at the very end, but it fits with the rest of the movie, so I have no objections.summary: one of the top 10 films of the 1990's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with some viewers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really, what is wrong with some people who saw in this film only it's graphic violence and the slow pace? Maybe the fact they "didn't get it", as they simply confess in the same time."Unforgiven" is, along with "12 Monkeys" and "Fight Club", the best American film of the '90's. It's as simple as that. It is a complex film, a real epitome of the Western genre and - at the same time - a tombstone for the genre as well."There is no good and bad", is the surfacing message of the film. "Every man is responsible for his actions, no superior being can be credited with the redemption and for every action is a counteraction" is a second-read message.But the true nature of the film (and, I think, the intentions of the writer and the director too) unfolds as you try to understand the characters. No stereotypes, no easy path to Eldorado, no fixed hero-antihero recipes. Just the man. The man who dares, the man who struggles with his fears, the man who is trying to find his own personal heaven - or hell.Yes, folks, it is not an easy film. Nietzscheish questions about the origin of morale and the absence of god are not always easy to swallow (especially if you go to the theatre fixed to watch another bang-bang-down-with-the-baddies western) and I can understand that.But, there is an old saying. Don't criticize what you can't understand. And if you "don't get it", better let some of those "who got it" to present their thoughts and their opinion on this true American masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misperceived? And how.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read through the other reviews of "Unforgiven" on this site, and was surprised at how many people called it "unnecessarily violent." Heads up, folks: You missed the point. Fact is, this is the only violent film I can think of -- certainly the only violent AMERICAN film I can think of -- in which every single act of violence has consequences, both for the characters and for the audience. Every murder leaves grief behind, every beating shocks -- just like in real life. The only really evil character in the film is W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), the voyeuristic writer who cozies up first to freelance killer English Bob (Richard Harris), then to lawman Little Bill (Gene Hackman), then finally to Eastwood's own character, Will Munny. And who is Beauchamp a stand-in for, in the cosmic scheme of things? For the audience, of course -- all us folks who don't blink when our action heros shoot holes in a hundred extras in the first ten minutes of the average blockbuster. And people call THIS film violent? Think about it a little more.Best line in the film: "Yeah." (Said by Munny just before the end, to Little Bill. Think about the resignation behind it.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action in 1881 with flawed characters recognizable in 2001</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is an outstanding character study involving Clint Eastwood's initially-retiring leading role, retired and reformed gunfighter Will Munny, and his antagonist, an over-the-hill lawman who goes by the name Little Bill (Hackman). The movie is carried by fine acting: Hackman, Harris and Saul Rubinek's acting make the middle third of a somewhat long film surprising and upsetting. Little Bill reveals his utter lack of compassion and a tendency to punctuate his duties as officer of the peace with gratuitously violent acts. (Speaking as one who has been disappointed by Mr. Harris' over-the-top style in the past, I found his performance to be generous--which gives Hackman the latitude to develop the Sheriff's character).The plot is not without some difficult to accept features. In particular, the matter of the five "billiard girls" raising and/or giving over $1,000 as a reward for any gunfighter which will help them settle a score. Also, it is not clear whether Big Whiskey (seemingly 100 miles from nowhere) is supporting a sheriff AND four paid deputies or are most of Little Bill's peace officers acting out of duty? If the later, they would be unique among the characters for having essentially high-minded motivation for their actions...It is important to accept "Unforgiven" as a film about violence and men that have been broken by their behavior and must struggle with the temptation of acting out in violence. Several reviews have commented that Will Munny's cold blooded behavior is beyond the pale of Little Bill's. I doubt that the script of the movie is supposed to the lead us to debate the question of "who's badder: Munny or Bill?" Rather, both men have been shaped by similar horrific experiences. Their characters seem complementary in light of their mortal conflict. That Little Bill did his time a lawman seems to have offered him little redemption. Does a classic Western require a moral hero at it's center? If so, then I agree with the person labeled "Unforgiven" a great American movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nver a big fan of westerns,I was reluctant to rent Unforgiven. i read some reviews online that said it wasn't so much a Western,so I tried it out. Well, I must say,it was one of the best risks I ever took.(Seriously.) The story is well told in other reviews so I'm not going to go into too much detail. William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is hired by a group of prostitutes to kill two cowboys who cut up one of their friends. Eastwood,along with his partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) team up with The Scofield Kid (Jaimz something or other) to kill the cowboys and split the bounty. However,there's a couple of problems in the way,the main one being the sherrif(Gene Hackman). Everyone gives a a top performance,especially Hackman in his Oscar-winning role. The script is excellent,the dialogue is great and Estwood kicks major ass throughout the whole movie. You should rent this. Even if you don't like cowboys. Seriously. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic! Clint Eastwood is magnificent in his own movie. He and Morgan Freeman really show you that the "good guys" in westerns aren't always so good. It also emphasizes the emotional impact on people when they actually take another person's life. Gene Hackman, who is one of my all-time favorite actors, is gritty and riveting in this movie. He is such a terrible villain. Yet, those parts can sometimes be the best, and Hackman won his second Oscar for this."Unforgiven" is a movie that you definitely can't miss.

		<fullReview>Once, there was a land known as the Wild West where unshaven buckaroos herded sluggish beasts on dusty trails. That was then. Now, Sage-covered plains remain to grow, but no longer produce wild-eyed figures that roam its hills. Men of this kind have long expired. Still, however, they ramble as characters reborn from oral traditions, in modern tales of heroism. Writers have recreated, in countless chapters and scripts, scenes of range-worn cowboys taming the natural frontier. Such efforts have produced a Western genre that defines the American film industry. Lately, fewer Westerns are produced than that in previous decades. Nonetheless, recent films are more delicately written, and have larger budgets to accurately develop the scripts. An example of such a produced film is Unforgiven, released in 1992, which was written by David Webb Peoples and directed by Clint Eastwood. Critics push applauding critiques and claimed Unforgiven to be one of the best Westerns ever filmed. Reviewer Rob Smith comments, `One of the greatest Westerns ever made? Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary. In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man. Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style.' Smith addresses one significant point. He detects that the Western frontier is merely the scene of the film and not the twine that threads the plot together. Unforgiven is not a Western, simply because it lacks a hero. William Munny, the primary character, is a retired gunman whose savagery was tamed by a bride, Claudia. She died some short time after marriage. `Wife cured me of drinking wickedness,' Munny later confides. She sobered him of his drunkenness and was the deciding factor in his decision to settle down to a life of pig farming. He clings to a bare framed-portrait of his late wife, for it is the only thing that keeps the shot glass from his lips and the six-shooter from his holster. Several times a day, Munny visits the modest gravestone that marks her death. She extracted from him elements of evil and impurity; an unlawful beast was distilled and smelted into a loyal husband and tireless sodbuster. The poor man is a granger who realizes his mistakes and works strenuously for self-penance. However, unsuccessful as a providing father, Munny decides to pursue a bounty reward of $500. Committed to killing two ruffian cowboys, he sums, `This killing doesn't mean that I am going back to my old ways. I just need money, for a new start for those kids.' He justifies the soon-to-be murder as an act to save his youngsters. Is this foreshadowing the birth of a hero? Tim Dirks of Filmsite observes, `Western heroes are often local law enforcement officers, territorial marshals, or a skilled, fast-draw gunfighter.' A film must have a hero to be a Western. The epic character must be composed of certain components. `They are normally persons of integrity and principle - courageous, moral, tough, solid and self-sufficient characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude.' Unforgiven casts characters that are harsh, twisted, and cowardice. They are evil, spiritless men who team-up, outnumber, and kill their counterparts from behind. This is opposite from a true Western hero who, `stands and faces danger on his own.'Instructing his children to take care, the farmer assures them that he will be home in two weeks. `Kill a few chickens if you need,' he adds. Obviously unskilled riding horseback, Munny reminds his children, `Ain't hardly been in the saddle myself in a while. This old horse is getting even with me for the sins of my youth." For the first time in eleven years, Munny packs a gun and rides off to Wyoming on a white horse in an awkward fashion. He is off to chase the bounty. A hero slowly dies. Claiming the sake of his kids, Munny seeks the life of two cursed cowboys who cut up a prostitute. With this, Peoples is making a puzzle of right and wrong; it is a social inquisition begging the question, can a hero be moral and rightfully evil? Bill Munny reverses in polarity. He slowly devolves back to a man whom unjustly slaughters innocent people. First, the slayer-reincarnate visits a past partner in crime, Ned Logan, who is settled down on a lowly ranch. Logan is a living lockbox of memories past. He fuels Munny's digression. Together, after a realization to their `call of duty,' they start and finish the hunt. In the process of killing the bountied cowmen, Ned is captured, beaten, and killed from behind by Little Bill, a truly evil and demented sheriff. Munny snaps. Vengeance ignites his wrath. Munny is ineligible for the role of hero. The barbarian `[is] portrayed as a reformed man totally against killing from the beginning, he cannot become a more moral man now (Truby).' There is no room for his self-revelation. The pattern of a hero's growth is totally defeated by the path he chose to follow. At first impression, as a farmer, Munny seems to possess the characteristics of a noble man who has reconciled and recognized the errors of his ways. The farther he travels from his children and portrait of his wife, the farther he strays from values that determine a man of strength and integrity. He is more of an anti-hero. `If a man takes a shot at me, I won't kill him, I will kill his wife, friends, then burn down his house,' declares a monstrous Munny after wiping out Little Bill and his deputies in a one-sided gunfight. Dark clouds drown the earth with heavy rain. The bloodthirsty cowboy trots out of town, drunk, immensely richer, and morbidly satisfied. The only man who once possessed any sort of grace is corrupt. The film exhales and is left orphaned without a hero. For the past century, stories of cowboys have been rewritten into so-called `horse-operas' that have lured audiences into states of captivation. Much like a viewfinder, Westerns are scopes to something foreign- remote places and historic times when toughness was common and not romantic. Ideals of chivalry, created by revisionists, are today used as standard codes of conduct. Films are mediums for social commentary and imagery desperate for attention. Most importantly, Westerns have simple plots, which can be understood and accepted by all. A story without a hero is a tragic tale of depression, not a tale of the West. Unforgiven illustrates a new front in the war between good and evil; a cowboy can kill a man, unjustly, just because he is a cowboy. Why is this acceptable? He is not a defender of morality. Maybe modern struggles are best told through the lawlessness of the unbridled Wild West. Even, if the film is not really a Western at all.</fullReview>

Hackman gives a great performance as the sheriff who utters "there will be no assassins" throughout the movie.You have Eastwood, Hackman and Morgan Freeman. What more could you possibly want?

		<fullReview>Once, Martin Scorsese was asked why he did not direct a western. His answer was that the definitive western had been done, and that its name was Unforgiven. This superb film will eventually be ranked in the top hundred American films of all time; it may have been the last film to fully deserve a Best picture Oscar.( Both American Beauty and Braveheart had films competing against them of comparable quality, while such trash as Titanic or The English Patient should NOT , repeat should NOT have been nominated, let alone won.)The cinematography, script, and acting of this film are uniformly excellent. Once again, the underlying theme of the Western- the problem of bringing civilization to "the wilderness' is addressed with intelligence and insight. In addition, like the great films of Ford and Hawks , it analyzes the relationship between history and myth.This is more than a great Western; it is a great film about America-superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood directed to perfection this incredible western. It easily won it's 1992 Best Picture Academy Award. Eastwood also won Best Director and Gene Hackman got himself an Oscar for best supporting actor. A USA Today columnist calls "Unforgiven" the best western in over 20 years. I say it is simply the best western EVER. The story is quite simple. A couple of aging gunfighters William Munny (Clint Eastwood) and Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) go after a reward being offered by some vengeful prostitutes in a town called Big Whiskey. They are also accompanied by a young gunfighter-wanna-be calling himself, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). Already in town is the sassy, brash, queen loving, president hating English Bob (Richard Harris) who is also looking for reward money. Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is the ruthless Sheriff determined to keep all reward seekers out of his town."Unforgiven" gives some of the best acting I have ever seen in almost any film. Eastwood keeps it realistic and believable. There are a lot of thrills and surprises in the film and it is a must see by anyone that likes Eastwood or westerns. I have seen and given my own personnel rating on well over a thousand films at the time of this writing and only a fraction have been worthy of a perfect 10 on the IMDb rating system and "Unforgiven" is one of those rare few. Don't take my word for it though see it for yourself and I think you'll agree. Just a reminder if your ever in Big Whiskey remember Ordinance 14 and leave you fire arms home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.I am really not much of a fan of westerns. But I did enjoy getting inside the head of an old gun slinger coming out of retirement...Background:I am a 24 year old male engineering and computer science student living in SC. I do have a large humanities background.WARNING: I sketch out the plot a little in this review.Overview:I get the feeling that this movie may be a sequel to a movie I haven't seen yet. But I get that feeling with all of Clint Eastwood's western movies. He always seems to be the hero of the "Dog eat dog" and "Kill or be killed" western movies.The storyline is simple and sweet: an old gunslinger is trying to raise his kids now that his wife has passed on. He is having a hard time of it and is offered a job as an assassin to kill two men who hacked up a prostitute in a small almost lawless town. There are several good subplots. Ones between the Eastwood's character and his old partner and him and his new partner. Basically there is a good character interaction between all of the characters but I don't think the character individually are filled out enough not even the main character. I wanted a little more depth so I would be more involved.I really am not sure why this movie won the Best Picture Award for the 1992 Academy Awards. I can understand things like Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, Titanic and so on but not Unforgiven.I think this movie is a good movie to watch with someone or a group. You will have a lot of comments that you will want to share with others, nothing too strong, but I think I would have liked it better with someone. You will have something to say about each character and about fate, and luck.Be sure to check out my other reviews.Thanks.</fullReview>

When I stepped away, I asked myself, " Is this what ugly, un-educated people do when they try to solve there problems?". "Two wrongs don't make a right", is what most of us are told.

		<fullReview>Briefly, I think it's important to point out that calling "Unforgiven" a "Western" falls short in describing it. There's a film theory out there that every genre undergoes a number of stages ranging from the defining films of the genre to parodies. Unforgiven falls into an important stage (in my opinion the most important) of Western called the Anti-Western. Anti-Westerns began somewhere around "The Wild Bunch" and "Fistful of Dollars" on through "Little Big Man" and culminated in "Unforgiven" The Anti-Western questions the sensibilities and moralities of the genre setting films and some say that once a genre reaches this stage it dies. This may or may not be true, however, there will probably never again be a "Western" that compares with "Unforgiven". Unforgiven acts as an iconoclast to every High Noon Showdown western by putting the gunslinger in his place. He's a human being and as such, fears and panics. It's not who is fastest, but who can keep a level head long enough to shoot straight. For Will Munny being drunk helps a lot. Look to the climax for the factor of fear - half the deputies are too panicky to shoot straight and I loved it. It hearkens back to "Yojimbo" and "Sanjuro" the Kurosawa films that gave rise to the birth of the Man With no Name. Cowardice is one very important aspect of the human experience and it isn't portrayed realistically in films (particularly Action-films) half as much as it ought to be. It isn't very "Hollywood" to show fear, but it is a very human thing that brings a film like Unforgiven to the next level of quirkiness and , ultimately, reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conscience and revenge do not mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't like westerns, but this one is so full of thoughtful questions- like why do men kill and why do they stop that I decided to watch it. Gene Hackman shines as Little Bill- the epitome of the town bully and the prostitutes add a human dimension to the story. Most of all the tug of war that Munney fights between honoring his wife's memory and going back to what he does well. All this is subtly played out in the battle with the bottle-- you can feel his tension. Though there was some violence- it all fit into the context well. Clint Eastwood excelled at the ambiguousness of the morality involved. Not for faint hearted- but a good study of men and why they do the things they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's pinnacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood feels a lot of gratitude toward The Man with No Name for establishing him as one of the most recognizable actors in history (and he pays his respect to the two men who essentially created his image by dedicating "Unforgiven" to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel), but he bashes The Man in this film. His Will Munny has a name, a kind of sleazy sounding one, too, and he has all the problems and baggage 'Blondie' in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" never knew existed. In fact, Munny has been saddled with all kinds of character: used to be a cold-blooded killer, was reformed by a religious, loving woman who turned him to Christ - she died leaving him sad, lonely, 20 years 'on the wagon,' and devoutly Christian still (if more for her memory than for himself). On top of all this, he's a pig farmer raising two small children, still dragging around in his heart the guilt from having once "killed nearly everything that walked or crawled."Well, trouble strikes and, as is typical in this genre, a character straps the guns on one last time. However, Eastwood and writer Peoples handle things in a very atypical manner. Munny is sometimes weak, frightened, and pitiable. Morgan Freeman is his partner, providing that actor's trademark calm and reason, and Jaimz Woolvett is Freeman's opposite - the jittery and immature, a teen-ager who reckons to become the next 'Billy,' and actually [seems] to look forward to going down in a blaze of glory. Woolvett has an amazing showcase here, and it's surprising to me that he has virtually disappeared since (with naught but bit parts in "Rosewood" and "Dead Presidents" to show for himself). Equally good are Gene Hackman, Saul Rubinek, and Richard Harris (especially) as a trio of negative forces, and Frances Fisher also has a few brief but strong scenes. People will always remember Clint the actor for moments like his holding an entire saloon at bay with a shotgun, but quieter moments, like the handling of Clint's first swig in two decades, is why we'll remember him as a director. One of the few films in recent years to deserve the Best Picture Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justice and forgiveness at heart of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found that this movie presented several moral dilemmas that caused, and still cause, deep contemplation and offers no easy answers. The title, "Unforgiven," suggests characters, actions, or events that are unforgivable. It also sets the audience up to decide (or judge) for themselves if they are. Issues of forgiveness, deserving, and justifiable homicide are presented by the repetition of certain words, and themes of Heaven, Hell and death emerge, in no small part, to effective low-key lighting and the recurring use of fire. Vigilantism, and the effects it has on people, are explored. Questions are raised, such as how is the taking of another human life justified, or can it be justified under any circumstances?The importance of how a man lives and dies is expressed by the attitudes of the characters. It leads us to ask ourselves if murder can be forgiven if remorse is genuinely felt? Can someone repent for an action performed under certain circumstances at a different time? Can we believe him when he says that he's changed? "Will" was forgiven once, by his wife. He says "I'm just a fella now, I ain't like that no more." But what is justice, and who has to pay? Who deserves to die, and how do they deserve to die?My experience with movies that Clint Eastwood has starred in and/or directed has been that his characters are almost "biblically" just. Their philosophy is "an eye for an eye." "Dirty Harry," particularly, is a sensible, tough, out-for-justice kind of guy. You expect "justice" to be done by the end of the movie. However, in his westerns, his characters border on the spiritual. They attempt to answer questions taking a broader philosophical approach, i.e., "High Plains Drifter, " and "Pale Rider."In "Unforgiven," he presents us with a crime victim, two villains, and an inefffective justice system, similar to many of his movies. However, this movie takes less time with law-breakers being held accountable for their actions, and more time with the main character reflecting upon his life, and what it is to take another's. The "Schofield Kid" tearfully recalls a man he shot when he says " It don't seem real, how he can never breath again, ever, how he's dead...all on account of pulling a trigger." " Munny" replies, "It's a hell of a thing, killing a man. You take away all he's got and all he's ever gonna have." He contemplates his past as a drunken thief and murderer more than any other character of Eastwood's that I have seen to date.In the end, we still don't know for sure if "William Munny" is the Unforgiven man; by his wife, his God, or himself. I will continue to mull over the issues and themes presented by this movie but won't hold my breath until I find the answers. I am inclined to think" Munny" was right when he said "Deserve's got nothin' to do with it."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much as John Wayne said his farewell to film in "The Shootist", Clint Eastwood made "Unforgiven" as a symbolic leave-taking of westerns. The film is sombre and elegiac throughout, relying on autumnal reds, browns and golds.In Wyoming in 1881 a prostitute is injured by a drunken cowboy. Her colleagues in the brothel club together and offer a bounty to anyone who will kill the culprit. William Munny was once a gunslinger and a general all-round mean son of a bitch, but he has been living quietly on a Kansas farm for years. The reward tempts him out of retirement for one last killing.This is a wistful film about the sense of regret which comes with maturity and the decline of youthful vigour, and the wisdom which compensates for what is lost. Both William Munny (Eastwood) and his partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) are ageing hellraisers who who have come to view violence as a grievous and unnecessary evil. They are saddened by the antics of the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), the arrogant young hothead who rides with them. Even the iron-hard sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, now has visions of a tranquil retirement. The emphasis of the story is on the grief which violence engenders. English Bob pays heavily for his espousal of violence, and Ned's woman looks in eloquent silent misery at the rifle holstered in Munny's saddle.The terrific vistas of Wyoming form a stunning backdrop to the action. Human figures move along the skyline, tiny against the might of land and sky.The themes of loss and decay recur in unending variations. Munny's talent for killing has deteriorated so badly that he can no longer hit a tin can from six yards or mount a horse with dignity. The older men are reluctant to talk about their past exploits, and Daggett shows us why, explaining how the famous shooting of Corky Corchoran was a cowardly comedy of errors, rather than the heroic exploit which English Bob has built his notoriety upon. When Bob leaves town alone and humiliated, his bent gun-barrel is a symbol of his empty vainglorious life. Even the meannest of them all, William Munny, is now a weak, broken, scared old man.Daggett, the sheriff who does not stoop to half-methods, is both an attractive and a repellant character. Gene Hackman plays him wonderfully, capturing the monolithic inner conviction of a very strong man who has never doubted his own moral code. This is a lawman who gives a newcomer a severe beating, merely to discourage other undesirables from hitting town, and tortures a man to death in the jailhouse. Yet Daggett is a good man according to his lights. He knows how the riff-raff of the West can pollute a community, and he is determined to protect the town which has been entrusted to his care. He is utterly fearless. He also has endearing human foibles, like his wayward carpentry skills.Munny feels the righteous influence of his wife, even though she has been dead for three years. She took him on when he was little better than an animal, a whiskey-crazed murderer, and straightened him out. When the Schofield Kid first calls at the Munny farm and then leaves alone, we feel Munny's yearning for the old ways as he watches the rider recede towards the skyline. Munny is a study in stillness and self-contempt, in contrast with the shallow posturing and babbling of The Kid. However, when the test comes, it is Munny who reverts to type and proves meaner and deadlier than any man alive. Daggett thrives on provoking confrontations, but when the chips are down, it is Munny who reveals himself to be the truly nerveless assassin.Metamorphoses proliferate throughout the film. Munny is prostrated by a fever but emerges from it like a butterfly from a chrysalis, newly strong and confident. The Kid undergoes his own (overly abject) transformation. Delilah the whore becomes a real woman as a result of her mutilation.Eastwood is paying homage to the violent machismo of the Western, the formula which made him a star, and at the same time turning his back on it - apparently for ever.</fullReview>

BEING BROKE AND DESTITUTE, HE IS CHARGED TO RAISE HIS YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE PROCESS AFTER HIS WIFE DIES OF AN ILLNESS. SOON, MUNNY HEARS ABOUT A REWARD OFFER TO CAPTURE SEVERAL OUTLAWS WHO ARE WANTED BY THE LAW. HE, AND HIS FRIEND, NED LOGAN (MORGAN FREEMAN), SET OUT TO ROUND UP THE OUTLAWS AND GAIN THE REWARD IN THE PROCESS. AFTERWARD, THEY ENCOUNTER THE GOINGS ON IN A TOWN CALLED "BIG WHISKEY", WHICH IS RUN BY A CORRUPT SHERIFF, LITTLE BILL DAGGETT (GENE HACKMAN).

		<shortDescription>As the Anti-Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched and wrote up this movie in conjunction with a film studies class where the professor referred to this movie as the "anti-western". Watching this movie with that precedent gives great insight to the characters and the story itself. Normally, in any given western, the main character is a good man, or (in the case of Clint's spaghetti westerns), a man that doesn't suppress his instincts. William Munny was an evil man that didn't suppress his instincts, in the past, but now is a good man. A good metaphor for this is that while he dresses in dark clothing, rides a white horse (or it could be a grey horse). The blending of this western stereotype is great visual , as it twists the conventions of the western. Another twist is that usually, the sheriffs in the town are the 'good' presence, whereas in this movie, it is clearly not the case. Try watching this film with this in mind. It give one much to think (or write) about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every character in this film is not simple to grasp as one fiction character. What I think about characters at first is always betrayed in later scene about them. In this film, there is no completely good person and bad person. I dare say that one of the main characters, William Munny is a good person relatively, because he goes to kill cowboys for the prostitutes. However, that thought changed later by the scenes that William and his partners try to kill others who are not completely bad persons. I wonder what this title, Unforgiven means. At first I thought unforgiven person is the cowboy, but later I also thought there would be another. So there is no one who can punish others, although someone looks a good person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story with a clear look into the human heart....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns, it seems, present an unobstructed view of human motives and the reality of things more than most movie genres. There is no fluff, ulterior motives or stupid dialogue from any parts in Unforgiven. Here we see an older widowed man who has an unexpected yet dreadful opportunity fall into his lap to provide for his young children, a younger short-sighted man looking to prove himself, an old faithful friend who wants to support his widowed friend, etc. Every character has a noble motive BUT as life is, circumstances cause these motives to clash and deathly calamities ensue. This movie is a perfect blend of casting, acting, directing, cinematography, and plot. No wasted scenes, no unnecessary plot lines, no superfluous explosions - simply a perfect movie. I am sure Eastwood, Freeman and Hackman (and Harris in a lesser role) would find it difficult to select a film that captures their acting in a better light, especially with such actors in a cast.Most good movies will leave you impressed as it presents the human heart as what it is. My takeaway from this movie is that human nature is fallen and as much as we try to forget or grow from our past mistakes, or uphold justice, or try to make ends meet, or seek glory - we all fall short. We each see ourselves in the best light possible BUT the truth of who we each are is will ultimately catch up to you. If you do not deal with your past, you may cover it up with a new present but it will still haunt you and the glory you seek may not be all it promises! *** Minor Spoiler Alert *** Interestingly, the title alludes to being forgiven and without seeking proper redemption outside of ourselves for all of our sins, like Will says in response the Schofield Kids' idea that the guilty man he had shot had it coming - "We all have it coming, kid". I hope this movie serves as a springboard to each viewer to look into the ideas it presents about human nature and the need to be forgiven. God bless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood and Hackman. Freeman and Harris. You get a classic 1880s western .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My neighbor Ron owns the 2-disk DVD set and urged me to watch it. I did and it is a fine western. There aren't really any good guys here but it is hard to not be sympathetic with some of the characters, even the whores.Produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, it also features him in the lead role as Bill Munny. We learn via opening captions that he had been a murderer and a thief, but he married a young woman and they had two children. But the wife became ill and died, now Bill had a small pig farm, trying his best to be a reformed man and good father.But the main conceit of this story is that your past will always follow you and, as Bill needs money and finds out there is a monetary reward for killing a cowboy who cut up a prostitute who giggled at his small "member", he is sought out to help get the reward.In another one of his great roles Gene Hackman is Little Bill Daggett who runs the local town as lawman, and requires that weapons be checked. But not all do and that creates opportunity to show Bill's real nature, and it is vicious.Morgan Freeman plays perhaps the most sympathetic character, as Ned Logan he is also a reformed killer who as a friend of Munny's goes along on the hunt but turns back to go home, only to be captured and imprisoned by Little Bill.Richard Harris has an interesting role as English Bob who supposedly is a famous gunfighter, and traveling with his own biographer. English Bob turns out to be a fraud and when he is run out of town we never hear of him again.Good movie, one of the best examples of 1880s westerns.SPOILERS: Even though Munny participated in killing the bad cowboy, he still didn't return to his mean ways until after he was told that Little Bill killed his friend Ned, and the saloon owner was displaying Ned's body in front. Munny cornered all of them at night in the saloon, and killed all of them. Then, as the closing captions state, he took the kids and moved away, rumor had it to San Francisco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From top to bottom, "Unforgiven" is an exceedingly well put-together movie, even as it sets out to unravel the romanticism of the Western genre. A sterling cast, poignant script and great performances all around - but, for me, it really comes down to the two leads . . . Gene Hackman is a true highlight of the whole movie, painting Little Bill with shades of gray. He brings a welcome charisma to the role even when Bill acts despicably. But it's those final moments that make "Unforgiven" one of my favorite Westerns. Because of the loathsome actions of the unjust lawman, Eastwood's reformed gunman slips into his former drink-fueled violent self. You're left feeling a mixture of heartbreak and awe as the vile killer makes his descent. Eastwood, to his immense credit, so ably embodies this turn, and it makes for some captivating cinema. Not sure I've ever rooted for such viciousness, but I love to watch him go to work. Powerful stuff.9/10</fullReview>

Unforgiven moves through a nice path of events sometimes feeling bit too uselessly stretched. There are few moments which will make a fool think this movie as provoking about life's worth and the thoughts of man with regrettable past, but if one avoids to get entangled in such ideas of unforgiven, he can certainly enjoy a nice drama.This movie is good but yet it is easily forgettable.

		<fullReview>I have viewed many Westerns over the years, especially with my dad. While he prefers John Wayne, I have gained a preference towards Clint Eastwood films. This is not a film for everyone, as my father who loves Westerns does not have a taste for this one. He thinks its too long, too dark, and too depressing, a far cry from many other Westerns that tend to champion a hero overcoming the villains. This film has much more complexity, starring Eastwood as a man tormented by his past that he is so hard trying to forget. When a young prostitute is cut up by a man she unintentionally insults, her coworkers seek justice in a town that does not value prostitutes as anything higher than a few horses. Pooling their money together, they create a bounty on the man's life. Eastwood hears of this after a young man seeking the legendary killer, William Munny (Eastwood) to help him on this quest. Filled with imaginative characters, rich dialogue, and a true gritty vision of life during these days, this film stands out as the penultimate picture of Eastwood's career. I urge any fans with a strong stomach for occasional scenes of intense violence and the attention span required for an epic Western to view this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money must have a lot to do with the story of "Unforgiven" because it's the name of the lead character, William Munny, just spelled different (writers are clever like that).William Munny is, by his own admission, a heartless murderer of everything that ever walked or crawled, women and children included. But it's only because he was bad, wickedly bad, and it seems he was drunk, real drunk, most of the time. And so bad and drunk, he murdered people, lots of people.But that was then, he's a changed man now, everybody deserves a second chance, even heartless drunken murderers.But old (and bad) habits die hard, as hard as a gut-shot cowboy.You see, William Munny needs money, and there's money in killing people, a thousand dollars in this particular instance. He needs the money because he's getting old and he's all muddy and so are his kids, all muddy and dirty, and he's the sole caretaker of those two muddy dirty little kids, and another pig has fever.OK, so killing pays and William Munny has experience enough, and a thousand dollars is a lot of money, so who needs to be killed, and why?Is it a legal bounty on a fugitive, dead or alive?Nope, it's entirely ILLEGAL, it's not a bounty it's a contract killing, it's murder for hire.You see, a whore got cut up by some drunken cowboy who didn't think it was funny that the whore he was paying would insult his manhood (if you know what I mean), and the local whore Union wasn't satisfied that justice had been done for the laughing cut-up whore, and so a contract was put out by the Union, for the murder of two cowboys... I'm not sure why two cowboys, maybe they both cut her up, it was pretty dark, maybe they took turns (it is a whorehouse).And so William Munny is going to murder the two cowboys for the whores, for a thousand dollars, not because he really wants to but because ANOTHER PIG has fever.But wait, if you thought all you would get for your enjoyment was two lousy murders, no way, William Munny deals in bulk and volume, he kills everything that walks or crawls, and so once he starts in drinking again, BANG!He kills the guy who owns the whorehouse/saloon (because of how the place is decorated), and that's OK because that guy was ugly and greasy and he owns a whorehouse...But William Munny also kills the Sheriff and just about the whole danged Sheriff's Department, including the one-armed Deputy and young Deputy Andy and the fat Deputy too (shot in the back). And after William Munny shot them all, and with the one-armed Deputy still barely alive groaning to lift his gun up, Munny shot him again (in what seemed like the groin) just for the fun of it I guess.Why did he shoot all those people, what did Andy and one-arm and fat man do to deserve being murdered?Nothing as far as I know, but William Munny (and Clint Eastwood) shoot people, lots of people, and they do it for money, lots of money.A Great American Hero, William Munny or Clint Eastwood or both.Whores everywhere are safer tonight, they have their avenger, and all it cost was a thousand dollars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood western "unforgiven" debunks the melodramatic mythologies towards the western genre to create a unique universe that does not consist of stereotypical characters that represent good and evil but rather creates a universe where the characters are morally conflicted and where 'good' and 'evil' are concepts that embody each other.The story follows the retired gunslinger 'William Munny' played by Clint Eastwood who accepts a bounty with the help of the 'schofield kid' and his previous partner.When we are first introduced to munny, the scene establishes his retirement as he works on his farms and visit his wife grave, however more importantly these activities suggest his failure in living a normal life and his sense of alienation suggested from the filming in widescreen format that captures the vastness of the western landscape, similar to john ford films. Munny character is presented as morally conflicted, in a sense has been 'unforgiven' for his past sins.What follows are truly some of the most captivating scenes committed to the western genre that encapsulate Eastwood philosophy of violence, there is no salvation for a killer, whether depicted good or bad "we all have it coming".Also one final note, this movie boasts perfect performances across the board. Each actor embody their character brilliantly, from Eastwood morally conflicted gunslinger, hackman as the sadistic sheriff, freeman as munny elegant partner, woolvett as the naive gunslinger how idealizes the bravado masculine western figure and Harris as the arrogant assassin.A truly unique western.</fullReview>

Characters names only add to the myth of a time when lawlessness was the way, even when doled out by authority. Women were disrespected as branded cattle in this town and men were only as good as their last shot, when character itself takes a back seat. Sickness meant death and honor lost a lot of battles. Long in the tooth yet deep in emotion, the truth of the small and vast Midwest is injected and exposed in "Unforgiven", the last western you ever need to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many westerns have been made and yet Clint Eastwood has made one which is fresh and is done with Sergio Leone as a template. Eastwood has learned much from his first director of this genre(The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly). William Munny is an ex-gunfighter who now raises pigs and has renounced his old ways. After a prostitute is disfigured, Munny is recruited to pay back the men responsible for the crime. Munny convinces Ned Logan(Morgan Freeman) to join him in his pursuit of justice and to also be paid a bounty for their services. Eastwood has done it again, directing and simultaneously starring in the same film; bravo Flint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's epic eulogy to his peers - 90%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By this stage, Clint Eastwood had moved on from playing enigmatic gunslingers and was carving out what would prove to be a successful directing career. So the decision to revisit the genre might have been thought an odd one but this is no attempt to relive his past. This is Clint's passionate farewell to his roots, a eulogy to Westerns as a whole which had become stagnant and hokey. And what a effort this is, full of classic imagery alongside some stunning performances and a story that simply works on so many levels. Even if Westerns aren't your thing, this remains a true modern classic.Eastwood plays William Munny, a reformed outlaw now struggling to care for his children on a run-down pig farm. With the death of his wife still painful to him, he is resistant to the offer from the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) to ride with him to kill a couple of cowboys who butchered a prostitute (Anna Levine) in the town of Big Whiskey. But Will needs the money so he reunites with his old running partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and sets off with the Kid to Big Whiskey, running the risk of angering the local sheriff (Gene Hackman) who runs the town with his posse with a cruel fist of iron."Unforgiven" may take its sweet time to get going but honestly, I can think of few movies that makes so much of its running time - every scene is a wonderful culmination of direction, acting and editing. Performances are faultless with Hackman and Saul Rubinek simply unmissable. The film offers a different vision of the Old West than the one you may be used to, a world where rumour and myth mean more than character and violence is seen to have deep emotional consequences - again, I can think of few films to deal with death and the act of killing as well as this one. Instead of largely anonymous cardboard cut-outs (one of the problems I had with the "3:10 To Yuma" remake), the characters make you empathise with them - the scene where the Kid realises the full horror of his actions is not just gripping but completely believable because it's what YOU would do in the same situation.The only issues I have is that the ending felt a little neat for my liking and Richard Harris's appearance as English Bob is sadly superfluous to the tale. It also isn't as enjoyable as I'd hoped for but this is a movie to make you think instead of whooping, hollering and shooting your pistols in the air. It's a quiet Western with only a couple of shoot-outs and not much in the way of body count - even those who do die do so off-screen, reinforcing the film's anti-violent message. The truth is, this is a simply magnificent film and one I would have no hesitation in seeing again. "Unforgiven" remains the current yardstick for Westerns and the fact that none since have come close in terms of scale and quality speaks volumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood starred, produced and director Unforgiven which was the final western he ever appeared in after being a huge western movie star in the 1960's and 1970's. Eastwood originally got the script for Unforgiven in the late 70's but held onto it for a while thinking he needed to be older to play the role. Including him in the cast are Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris which is one hell of a starring cast to go along with himself.Unforgiven won a plethora of Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor(Hackman). Eastwood was also nominated for Best Actor, which this and Million Dollar Baby was the only times that Eastwood was nominated for Best Actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure genius, although in my opinion not for the reasons mentioned so many times. I've seen and read so much about this movie, simply because if I had to make a list of my all time top 10 favorites this movie might just be at the nr. 1 spot, although a shared position with a few others. But the message of anti-violence I don't see as much. Of course Munny is tormented by his ghosts from the past but in real life things would be a little different. Men who kill women and children have much bigger problems than Munny does, at least mentally, and in the end he even prospers or so it is rumored, and I don't see the anti-violence in that. On the DVD extra's people who have worked with Eastwood said that this is the picture where the character he has played before, more or less, shows a deeper side of himself, a more fragile side. But in that last scene we just see the same cold blooded Eastwood we know, much more so, and there's nothing wrong with that, far from it. I love this movie but let's be honest, it's because everything builds up to that last few minutes when we finally see the old fragile man back in his saddle, the saddle only one actor I know fits as well as it does Mr. Eastwood. If it were such an anti-violence movie that maybe Little Bill should have killed Munny, leaving his children orphans maybe, I don't know, I'm not a screen writer. But Munny kills a bunch of people and moves on to prosper and Little Bill did have a point when he said: "I don't deserve this, to die like this". My kid asked me why I love this movie so much as a big painting of Munny is in on our living room wall. And the only thing I could say is: "well, this is a movie where the bad guy is good, and the good guy is bad", or at least it's not sure which is which. But anti-violence? Ned is the only one that is really fed up with it and when he decides to leave Munny says something like: "we'll find that other one, shoot him and catch up with you", that's cold blooded, I don't see any lesson learned or ghosts in that. No, Munny seems to have regrets at first but in the end he just does what he has always done, kills everyone and moves on to better times. You might say this killing is just what Munny needed to get his life in order. We all love the bad guys in movies, plenty of top-10 lists out there, Hannibal, the Joker, you name 'm. But if this movie was made from Little Bill's point of view William Munny just might be the coldest bastard ever to appear on screen. Simply because he's the only one that is not insane and get's away with it all squeaky clean. I'd like to see Hannibal or the Joker raise 2 children as if nothing happened. No for me this movie is about the build up, it builds up to that last scene where we get to see that everything Munny said and was before that was, more or less, nonsense. On the DVD David Webb Peoples mentions Travis Bickle as sort of a inspiration for writing this. But Travis Bickle is out his mind and a pretty sad character, Munny would eat him for breakfast. To kill that many people and just have a few bad dreams? Wauw...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For be the best western ever made. Star of spaghetti westerns Clint Eastwood became main actor and director in this realistic, tough and dirty western, which tries to show how the west really looked like. In one small town a cowboy slashes prostitutes face with a knife. Hard hand sheriff (Hackman) gives him and his friend only the fine and lets them go. Other prostitutes get money together and put a bounty on those two. Among the cowboys who seek the bounty is also former bandit turned farmer William Munny (Eastwood) who goes to town with inexperienced Schofiedl Kid and his old friend. But sheriff of the town hates gunfighter and is prepared to beat or kill anyone who is going to seek to bounty. This story is very good; dying here is not heroic but awful and painful. Also most of the characters even the main heroes are immoral and unsympathetic. This a great movie and I can recommend it also to people who do not like western because this is far different form other ones and it is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No more heroes any more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was a conscious effort to turn the American Western on its head. Eastwood's career and acting persona were defined by the genre. This was no doubt a large part of the motivation that he had in directing and starring in this film. You could say that Unforgiven was the logical end-point of the revisionist western. It demythologized the genre to the extent that there were very few romantic notions left unturned.The story is basically about a retired gunman who is brought out of retirement by a young would-be outlaw to claim the bounty raised by a group of prostitutes who wish to have vengeance meted out to two cowboys who cut up a fellow hooker.In this story there are no heroes. While Eastwood's character William Munnery is ostensibly the good guy, his history of violence marks him as otherwise. He has even killed women and children so this is one outlaw whose past can never really be justified. This clearly makes Munnery a most unusual central character for the audience to relate to. But this is one of the central points of the film in that no one is untarnished and good in the traditional sense. Gene Hackman plays the part of Little Bill the sheriff, who despite being the upholder of the law is the most sadistic character in the story. His brutality is entirely unjustified, and on the one occasion where he is required to carry out punishment he let's the culprits off, so long as they can pay their due with horses. The third important character in the story is English Bob (Richard Harris). This professional killer on the face of it represents the mythologized gunslinger that the western genre is typified by. He even has a biographer accompany him to document his heroic outlaw lifestyle. He is of course unmasked as a cheap-shot murderer and brutally beaten up. His romantic version of the outlaw is revealed to be a lie in the same way as the film as a whole unmasks the fictions of the old west. The only characters approaching heroic status in Unforgiven are the prostitutes; characters, of course, who are traditionally never portrayed in this way. They are the only ones who truly seem to be victims, and are the only ones who selflessly try to help someone else.Another way in which the film deviates from others in the genre is that the killings are neither shown as quick and clean or violently operatic. They are messy, slow and unheroic. The two cowboys who have the bounty on their heads are not killed in duels in the sun ? one is shot from afar, while the other while on the toilet; both of them are unarmed. The young gunman who brings Munnery out of retirement for these bounty killings is left traumatized by the reality of his direct part in one of the murders. The shoot out in the bar at the end of the film is about as close as this movie gets to a traditional western motif.Unforgiven is an unremittingly bleak and grim western. Despite Eastwood's presence it isn't at all like his iconic 60's Dollars movies. Those films were of course brilliant examples of the spaghetti western; this is very much in the revisionist sub-genre. It's not an easy film and I expect that it will not be appealing to a few fans of the genre either. It's more of a dark drama than an action film. I think it was a great way for Eastwood to say adiós to the genre that defined him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mainstream that did not forgive to "Unforgiven"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The many fine qualities of this film are appreciated well enough; so that I hardly can say something new, except adding my sincere admiration for Eastwood's last western. What I prefer to turn your attention to, is the generally accepted as granted vision of the film's place in cinema history as an end of the western genre. I. Was the movie ground-breaking "deconstructing the myths"?1 ) What were Leone's westerns or "A Bullet for the General" of Damiano Damiani? What were Eastwood's "High Plains Drifter", "Outlaw Josey Wales", "Pale Rider" ? Didn't these movies revolt against long ago established clichés - and far not only cinematographic , but much more historic,social and psychological stereotypes.Wild West without virtuous pilgrims, but with plenties of bandits, bounty hunters, prostitutes, mercenaries, cheaters, etc. Without clean shirts, shaved faces and pastoral landscapes; but with dust, mud, sweat,vulgar language,ghost-towns, stinking of tobacco, cheap alcohol and horse-saddles. Wild West in which evil is not an exception, instantly corrected by a highly moralistic hero(es);but a norm which continues to rule no matter how many morally dubious gunmen come and go. A Civil War in which "good" and "bad" are not differentiated by the blue or gray uniforms. Indian tribes being eradicated in the name of white man's civilization; petty farmers ruined in favour of railroad and other tycoons; unrestrained crime labeled as "honorable business". Town communities welded by racism, greed, hypocrisy, ignorance, etc. Corrupted high-level politics and politicians, imperialist US government that intervenes in the affairs of the smaller nations...all of that and more was in the movies that I envisioned above (and maybe some others ,too, I just mention movies that I have watched). In that sense "Unforgiven" doesn't seem to be so revolutionary, but much more a contributary work - which is in no way a depreciation!2) In "Unforgiven", after all, we saw some of the most repeating patterns(like a revenge plot, a dramatic comeback of the treated as an underdog main character), including the one that is most inseparable of that genre - the final shoot-out. And that shoot-out was hardly realistic - 1 against 5, plus the rest of the fellows run away when Munny's pistol is already empty (or with one bullet). In that sense the most mythical of all myths remained untouched: no matter what and who were the fearless, cold-blooded, rattle-snake fast and pin-point accurate gunmen - they existed! In this sense "Unforgiven" is a continuation - though with new means of expression, in a new environment and in a generation-lag time later! - of western's implicit, but clear enough admittance that the invincibility and especially the extraordinary gun-skills of his movie characters play role dominantly as a materialized, visualized expression of the innate spirituality of the archetypes presented and the collision of their natures and ambitions.A deliberately unrealistic epitomization of the otherwise pretty realistic struggle for deserving and keeping your place under the sun - which actually is the struggle, that makes the viewer identify himself with the story on the screen.3) Was the moral outlook of the characters so blurred as claimed ?Not for me. I myself can clearly define my attitude towards a thug-like Little Bill, the consciousless Skinny, the arrogant English Bob, - and on the other hand, the burnt-out, afflicted and overwhelmed by burdens Will, the friendly loyal Ned, the disfigured Delilah. Of course - the halftones in many cases were obvious, but far from hiding the essence of each character: again something seen in many previous films (were you ever against The Man With No Name?). The same as 4) The question of the price of violence I doubt that the earlier westerns so light-handedly treated that topic: just remember the POW camp scenes in "The good, The Bad, and The Ugly",the execution of a traitor's family in "For a Few Dolllars More" or the meeting of Josie Wales with chief Ten Bear; or the murder of McBains family in "Once Upon a Time in the West". Simply here the main line revolves around that problem.II. The end of the genre ?Eastwood himself said in an interview that a good film is made by a good story that is revealed in a good way. It's far not necessary to be a Hollywood legend to make this statement. The funeral march of western was announced long before "Unforgiven", while the script for that movie is far not something that appeared (in mid' 1970s) as a deliberately planned end of genre. Is it just a chance that after "Unforgiven" during the first half of the 1990s came a wave of new westerns? Why they were not successful is a different question :were all "spaghettis" at the level of Leone's works? Yet there's something more: what can kill a genre and cinema at all is not a "masterpiece that shall end all masterpieces", but trivial scripts, hollow performances, butaforic pictures, simplistic characters, shallow musical scores, box-office idolatry, political conjuncture, etc."Unforgiven" as a whole stays in the line of revolt against that mainstream - that's why it's so outstanding. Some people say if others movie makers learn from it - how to make not cinema-industry, but cinema-art - that can give a new life to the genre and the cinema at all. Up to now, unfortunately, that expectation seems an empty illusion. The mainstream has totally conquered everything and has no intention to forgive the unforgiven sin of being a rebel against it. One final point -I saved one star from the 10 , because I don't the movie had a good music. "Claudia's theme" is too lyric for the bitter feelings in Munny's soul. Besides , the same tender melody was played when Will and Ned were going on a their bleak mission. No separate memorable tunes for the climactic moments, for marking the other important characters or scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The in'Sight' on the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The in 'Sight' on the movieThe movie 'Unforgiven' is a heroic but tragic film. The setting takes place out in the west during the older days. It is about two guys and one younger kid who try to find two men who cut up a lady. The opening scene really grabs your attention. Two fellows were in a whorehouse when she giggles at him in the wrong way and the man got very angry. He told his partner to hold her still so he could cut her. They finally were tied up and had to give the owner something in return because that girl was no longer any use for him. All of the ladies in the house got together and decided that who ever killed these two dirt bags would then get one thousand dollars. One day while Bill Munny, Clint Eastwood, was working on his pig farm a kid comes riding up on a horse asking him questions on his past life. He then tells Bill about the guys who cut the girl face up and how they were going to pay any cowboy who kills them one thousand dollars. Bill says no at the time. Later on he got his partner Ned Logan, Morgan Freeman, and catches up to the kid. They then set out to find the guys. During the journey Ned finds that he's not cut out to kill any more so he turns around and goes home. I like the movie because it had an interesting plot. The gunfights were my favorite. Even though fake and somewhat humorous, it kept me on my toes. I also like that throughout the film, Bill's horse was acting up and being difficult at times. I love the fact that they had a saloon. You knew then that it was a true western film. Of course, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did an amazing job playing their characters. Clint was so calm, cool, and collective you would have thought it was him being himself. I would have liked to see Morgan's character be a little stronger and not such a chicken. Gene Hackman, playing the role as Little Bill Daggett, did a fantastic job in being the town sheriff. He made me believe that he did have control over their small town. It is an awesome film and I would recommend any to see this movie if you like older western ones. They did a good job at trying to make it look like the old west. I rate this movie a 7 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Look at the Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, the Western has been one of the most dominant genres in the movie industry. It was the typical western movie about good cowboys fighting against the odds to beat out the bad guys. The typical John Wayne Western. Then, Sergio Leone, invented the infamous Man with no Name. A new step in Westerns, we saw the creation of an anti-hero. Someone who was tough and bad but still had the decency and morality to stand up for others. The evolution of the western has finally evolved to this film; it is the ultimate climax. An amazing look at the violence, notoriety, and tragic history of how the West actually was. Unforgiven took everything about the Western and re-examined it. It is a powerful and dark film that has redefined and brought an end to what can be thought of as a western.William Munny (Eastwood), is a a long time criminal who after fading into retirement, comes out to do one last job with his long time partner Ned Logan (Freeman) and a young gun named The Schofield Kid (Woolvett). They agree to hunt down some criminals who cut up a girl who worked at a house of "whores." But the whole thing ends badly when the sheriff of the town where the "whores" live, Little Bill Daggett (Hackman), goes after Ned and Will because of their vigilante justice.There are several important concepts addressed in the story of Unforgiven. One is the idea of murder. Men are either born to kill or not. Either they can handle it or not. Unforgiven is the perfect example of this. The Schofield Kid is a virgin to killing and wants his opportunity and when he finally gets it, he feels regret and remorse. Yet William Munny has the ability to kill a dozen men, no problem. Either you have it or you don't. Another theme is related to this. William Munny was a man who tried to settle down after his crimes and make peace with himself. He was described as "having killed women and children." But when he comes back to that world, he finds out it hasn't changed at all. He is just as capable of repeating his sins as he was years ago. Which shows that William Munny just did not shape himself, but the entire world he lived in shaped him. There is a character in the movie named Beauchamp. He is a writer who wants to understand the ways of the west. He is the person who understands the west as a story of good and bad. The ideals of the typical "John Wayne Western Film." How there are bad guys, good guys, and their preconceived stereotypes. Good vs. Bad, Black vs. White. But in the end, when he is confronted by Munny, he learns differently. People like him don't understand the true ideals of the west. The violence, the darkness, the scars that come from that time. The Old West and the lives of people like William Munny, are stories of how dark and unforgiving the old west really was. It was more then just good guys and bad guys; its the reason there is such difficulty in labeling any character as good or bad. There is that gray matter which exists in between them all. In Unforgiven, you have the typical western characters. English Bob (Richard Harris) is the washed-up showboater. All he does is brag about his "Golden years" and make himself out to be a True Legend of the West. The Schofield Kid is a youngster who thinks he can make it in the big times but of course, he can't. Ned is the loyal and faithful sidekick to the major "anti-hero." Little Bill is the tough-ass corrupt sheriff who stops at no measure of brutality and indecency. His past has effected him as much as Munny's and he wants only to be content with what he has done in life. Munny is represented as the "anti-hero" to an extent but he is also represented as the long time villain seeking redemption (Which we find, he will never truly attain). But all the typical characters of there, examined and laid out, to truly understand what they stand for and their importance in the old west.Don't watch this movie cause its Clint Eastwood's Best Performance or because Hackman won an award for best supporting actor. Not because it won an academy award for best picture and academy award for best director for Clint Eastwood. Watch this because it is one of the most thought provoking films ever made. Easily one of the three greatest westerns ever, this film redefined the western. It has been called the Eulogy of the Western and for good reasons. This is exactly the movie the western should die with, because its the harshest and darkest portrayal of the old west ever on screen. A T-R-U-E Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's final epic Western...an homage to the Western King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Unforgiven years ago when I was a kid and I hated it. I hated Westerns and thought it was boring...thank goodness our tastes change. In the last few years I became a HUGE Clint Eastwood fan which led to me finally seeing the Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood trilogy and a love for the Western but it took me a long time to come back around and see what many consider to be his quintessential Western. This really is his best piece of work when it comes to Westerns and I think it's really terrific that it got the critical and public praise that it deserved and as big of a fan that I am of Eastwood and his westerns he could not have gone out on a higher note. Unforgiven is gritty and brilliant, beautifully shot, and definitely not your typical western. The lines of good and bad are very blurred, there isn't a clear cut hero or villain. I even think that Unforgiven pokes fun at Eastwood's persona a little bit in a darkly comedic kind of way. Eastwood is a long retired killer/gunslinger and stumbles in trying to get on his horse or shoot a weapon and it has an heir of spoof to it without ruining the dark tone to the film. Regardless you can feel the film building to the climatic gun fight at the end. The characters are well created, wonderfully written and fit the story perfectly.Clint Eastwood directs and stars...the two things he is amazing at. As the star Eastwood gives one of his most powerful performances. His usual gruff and rough character makes way for a very emotionally powerful, deep character with a lot history and back story that he tells with his performance. It is brilliant. Morgan Freeman plays Eastwood's best friend and former partner in crime Ned Logan. Freeman and Eastwood are amazing together and they feel like they have a history together. Freeman's character definitely is one who blurs the line between hero and villain. While not evil his character blurs morality a lot in the film. Gene Hackman gives his award worthy performance as Little Bill Daggett, in my opinion the best performance he has ever given. Daggett is a justice minded sheriff that is brutal in his delivery of justice. Hackman is the one to see in this film, he delivers an absolutely amazing performance. Jaimz Woolvett plays opposite Eastwood and Freeman as The Schofield Kid, a fast talking, conceited, young kid that wants to prove his manhood by killing two men. Woolvett's performance is not as powerful as some of the other performances but he does have a lot to live up to. His character is naive and impressionable and he does a good job of showing both. Richard Harris, Saul Rubinek, and Frances Fisher are some of the stronger supporting members of the cast.Few westerns go to any great lengths to tell a really deep story instead giving up that for guys with bad accents, bar fights, swinging doors and gun fights...something Unforgiven has BUT also tells this incredible sweeping story with this back story that unfolds without ever being shown. The story can be a little slow and doesn't have a lot of action from beginning to end but it's a very deep and careful character study and the characters make it worthwhile. Eastwood may have found himself the perfecting ending to an amazing genre career although I hope he has a lot more in other genres ahead of him. Unforgiven is an incredible epic western with an incredibly amazing actor and director at the helm. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A reformed bad man turns bounty hunter in this revisionist Western. Eastwood's low-key direction serves the movie well, relying on character interactions to build the story. The performances are pretty good, particularly Hackman as a sadistic sheriff. There are two weaknesses that keep this from being a better film. The dialog becomes somewhat pretentious and preachy in driving home the point that violence is bad. Then the film does an about-face at the end, going against everything that it has been preaching, with Eastwood seemingly having a flashback to his Man With No Name days. Still, about 90% of the movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film splices in existentialist messages with the counter-clichés used as poignant commentary on the romanticized Old West Myth, albeit the film is just one of a countless many pitching that revisionist view, and there are others still far grittier. Gene Hackman is outstanding in the role that earned him the Oscar nod over Nicholson (A Few Good Men). His character is brutal, but also discerning and just--so, almost wisely brutal. Commend the filmmakers as well that his portrayal makes a convincing antagonist even if the audience so happens to perceive him as essentially--a good guy. Lines such as "...because he was so damn drunk", "I've always been lucky when it comes to killing folks", and "Deserve's got nothing to do with it" will resonate long after the end credits. The historical and natural order can be blurred with ideas highlighting our inescapable yet vague understanding of the utter randomness of life, a matter which makes any analysis over what the film accomplishes especially subjective.Misc. Question: Wasn't the "Deserve's" line used in the final season of HBO's The Wire? Doesn't Snoop say it in her final scene?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate Westerns but I loved this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ex killer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is called out of retirement by the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). It seems a bunch of prostitutes are offering $1000 to any men who kill two men who beat up and slashed the face of one of their own. Munny brings along friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). The problem is they have to go through vicious Little Bill (Gene Hackman) the sheriff of the town this all happened in.Plot wise this is nothing new--but Eastwood set out to make an anti-Western and he succeeded. The killings here are not quick or painless and cowboys are not portrayed as heroes while shooting people to death left and right. The killings here are vicious, bloody and horrifying to watch. It also shows the killers feeling remorse for what they're done. They're not proud of what they've done and are questioning if they had any right to kill anyone. It's also made clear here that Munny is only taking the job for money for him and his kids to live on. The other cowboys (except for Munny and Logan) are portrayed as liars, vicious and cowards. Also women are portrayed in a (sort of) positive way. They are all prostitutes but they watch out for each other and aren't cowards like the cowboys. Also they set up the money for the killings despite what the sheriff says. The acting is just great across the board. Freeman, Woolvett and especially Eastwood are great and Hackman is incredibly evil and vicious. He won an Academy Award for his role.I hate Westerns so I avoided this when it came out. I also heard that audiences were cheering on the killings which was not the point (I heard Eastwood himself wasn't happy over that). I am glad I finally caught it...but this got an Academy Award for Best Picture? While it is good the middle section is very slow and the film is far too long. Also it's very vicious and shows no mercy to either the "heroes" or villains. I realize that was the point but it left me feeling kind of depressed and angry. Also the ending struck me as being way too unbelievable. Still, Eastwood deserves credit for successfully deconstructing the Western. If you like Westerns you might want to avoid this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as it gets!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This "western" is my favorite of all time...with no disrespect to the masters of this genre like John Ford, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Gregory Peck, Henry Fonda, Don Siegel, Sergio Leone, Walter Huston, John Huston et al, this film is more true to reality than most any of the others. In reality,it is not an easy thing killing someone, quite the contrary, it is a very horrific experience (I would imagine) full of internal conflict with one's own emotions, morals and fears, not to mention nerves, especially completing a task as up close and personal as "face to face" can get. This film deviates from the traditional "Hollywood" western by putting the emphasis on the human condition and not by simply glorifying acts of violence by allowing the protagonist to reign victorious despite any of the odds or obstacles involved. Clint Eastwood and company did a stellar job in conveying a story in such "true-to-life" fashion. A most excellent piece of cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a hell of a thing, killing a man. Take away all he's got and all he's ever gonna have."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven Very much a modern classic. Very much a human film. It feels real. Like the real West was. It wasn't John Wayne's West. It was a land of on the edge of civilization. I think that's why the Old West interests me. There was something primitive about it.Clint Eastwood, stars here as William Munny, a retired once-ruthless gunfighter, now a gentle widower and hog farmer who picks up his gun one more time to collect a bounty from the prostitutes of a local brothel.One of them, Delilah (Anna Levine) was viciously slashed by two clients and Little Bill Daggett ( Gene Hackman), the dictatorial sadistic Sheriff, denied justice to the prostitutes, thus the bounty.Eastwood is joined on this bounty by his former partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) and a cocky greenhorn 'The Schofield Kid' (Jaimz Woolvett) However, Munny must contend with his new moral code in the face of revisiting the life he once held.Hackman is a worthy opponent on screen to Eastwood. His Daggett is a lawman of sly charm..and chilling brutality. Two scenes really reinforce this. The first is where he confronts English Bob ( Richard Harris): an ill-fated killer for hire. The other is where he is torturing Ned.The thing that strikes me the most about the film is how it is willing to confront the effects of violence on both those who commit it and on those who suffer it.Furthermore, the sense of the character's realization of their own mortality. There is a very powerful scene in which, 'The Schofield Kid' kills his first man and he breaks completely down. This the same Kid who was so eager to kill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great feeling of a true western life!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some years I wish Sergio Leone was able to produce those trademark masterpieces of his about the great life in the west in the 19th century but when I saw Unforgiven it was a relief for me, Clint Eastwood really benefited from working with Leone not only as a director but surprisingly as an actor, and believe it or not: Clint Eastwood is now an Academy Award nominated actor!!! From a PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW I think Morgan Freeman was better than Gene Hackman, and yet he did not get a single nomination, maybe I need to watch it again to see about that even though I don't do that a lot.The great value of the film strikes like heart attacks all over this film and that scene in the bar at the end of the film was probably one of the greatest in all the western, I am really amazed that it was all about Clint Eastwood acting and directing.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's unforgiving western masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven (1992)Number 1 - 1992Top 25 - 1990sTop 10 Westerns - All Time In an age where the Western is an old dying trade, you occasionally get one or two that stand out. 'Unforgiven' is one of those films.Clint Eastwood's revisionist western is far bolder, darker, uglier and more realistic than his 'Man With No Name' trilogy or those mediocre heroistic John Wayne westerns. This is what is called a revisionist western. Eastwood's film is more about the grim, boring and often brutal nature of the Old Wild West.Eastwood plays William Munny an old, widower living with his son in a shack in the middle of nowhere, until one stranger persuades him to take on his old job and hunt down the killers of a prostitute in a little town.With a supporting cast that includes the always consistent Gene Hackman (in an Oscar Winning Role), Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, 'Unforgiven' is a thrilling hit, a measured and restrained film about a period where America was at its early and most primitive stages.Quite possibly, the best western ever made, this film comes highly recommended, especially to any particular fans of the genre.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I ain't like that anymore, Kid."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a compelling scene in the movie where the scarred whore Delilah (Anna Levine) offers William Munny (Clint Eastwood) a 'free one', not from herself, but from one of the other girls. Munny's response has to do with the scars they both carry as a burden in their lives. For one brief moment, Delilah takes comfort in the fact that someone finds her beautiful after the savage attack that left her disfigured, and Munny realizes there are only just so many things he can hang on to before reverting back to his true nature, a grim, cold hearted killer.It's fascinating to follow the rebirth of William Munny as a paid assassin after ten years of trying to scrape by as a pig farmer, the last two as a widower. The cocoon he weaved for himself to honor the memory of Claudia Feathers slowly unravels after that first conversation with the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). With friend and former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) rounding out the trio, Munny is an unwilling participant in the reliving of his past, hazed even back then by the taint of alcohol and binge induced black outs. Would Schofield be amazed that Will escaped certain death by taking out not two, but three gunmen? The legend it seems, is greater than Munny is willing to allow. Had he heard his daughter's question, I wonder how he would have answered - "Did Pa used to kill folks?" I've spent some time thinking about the fact that Eastwood, in his early sixties, was portraying a character in the story in his mid thirties. All the math works, we see that his wife died at twenty nine, and his oldest son is about ten years old. He gave up his outlaw ways ten years earlier when he married. The reason I bring it up is because in 1950's "The Gunfighter", Gregory Peck's character felt over the hill and washed up at the age of thirty five. The harsh conditions of the late 1800's had a lot to do with the shortened life expectancy compared to today, and was exacerbated by one's choice of profession. When I saw the film when it first came out, I'm sure I chuckled when Will couldn't get on his horse the first time, but now I have a different view. Munny had become not only morally crippled, but physically crippled as well in an impoverished life with no hope of bettering his family.If one could write a thesis on the character of Will Munny, the same would be true of his antagonist in the story, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman). The marshal of Big Whiskey establishes his complexity early in the story with the way he handles the situation with 'the hard workin' boys that was foolish'. Trading off a handful of horses for the scars on Delilah, Bill has a peculiar way of dealing with human lives. His savagery in dispatching English Bob (Richard Harris) has the effect of getting us ready for the assault on other would be takers of the whores' gold. "I don't like assassins, or men of low character..."; Little Bill was not looking in the mirror when he said it.As the story progresses, it's interesting to examine how Munny's partners on the trail drop out when faced with the prospect of pre-meditated evil. Ned Logan's decision to leave was a bit surprising considering the past he had with Will, but necessary for the film's finale to explore Munny's loyalty to a friend. You had to know that Schofield's body count was a complete fabrication, once the reality of his face to face latrine assassination crept in. Munny's analysis said it best - "Well you sure killed the hell outta that fella today". I like to think that The Kid made it back to Sally Two Trees.The measure of justice one might be expecting on a first time viewing of the movie is prominently shaken at the climax when Munny calls out the owner of the saloon. It's a jarring prelude to the calculated shoot out so engrossing to writer Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek). It's not about a hero exacting a measure of fair play, but the cold reality of giving back far more than anyone ever bargained for. If you were a resident of Big Whiskey, you believed Will Munny when he challenged them all to bury Ned Logan proper, or he'd return to kill their friends and burn their homes. The fury of Munny's vengeance lends further support to the Schofield Kid's most damning assessment of the once and present outlaw - "I ain't like you Will".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Deserve Ain't Got Nothing' To Do With It."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This universal truth is echoed throughout the movie in one form or another. "I reckon he had it comin'." "We all have it comin', kid." "Little Bill, you just killed an innocent man." "Innocent of what?" And on it goes. The theme of this movie seems to be that no one who can call themselves a human being can be said to be guiltless. This is further reinforced by the fact that none of the characters in this movie seem to have any redeeming features about them whatsoever. And, believe it or not, it makes for a damn good, if slightly uncomfortable story. Sometimes the truth hurts, but it must be faced.Let's look at the characters. Gene Hacman plays Little Bill, a guy who may have been a judge in Montgomery County, Maryland before he got the job of sheriff of Big Whiskey, with the lenient sentence he gave to the boys who cut that woman (a whore, actually. See what I mean about the characters? Where do your sympathies lie with these types of people in a story?) Then the people who come to the rescue are nothing more than lowly assassins. You have English Bob, who got the hell kicked out of him just for bringing in a gun and mentioning the queen's name on Independence Day. Again, was Little Bill once a Montgomery County judge? Kill each other, but I'd better not catch you with a gun or saying something politically incorrect. Anyway...Clint Eastwood is William Muny, a man with a past who is trying to leave it behind him. But because he is struggling to survive and take care of two young children by himself, the $1000 is too much to resist. "I ain't like that no more," he repeats throughout the movie and it sounds like the refrain of a ballad. Ned is his partner in crime. Then you have this worthless braggadocios kid who comes along and you're left wishing they would shoot him just so he would shut his damn mouth.Like I said, it's tough to pick loyalties among such a bunch of lowlifes, but I cheer when Clint comes into the "poolhall" toward the end of the movie and says in that quietly menacing voice of his, "Who's the fellow that owns this s--thole?", because I know what's coming next. And it ain't "Let's all hold hands together and sing GIVE PEACE A CHANCE." William Muny gives Little Bill his due in spades and then rides off into a stormy night.Clint dedicated this movie to Sergio Leone, and it is a movie worthy of his old mentor. Like Leone, the good guys and the bad guys aren't clearly defined, and it depicts the Old West as it perhaps really was. No real heroes, no cowards, nothing is glorified or affirmed. Only who is left standing when the gunsmoke clears. A great movie. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tribute to the Western, A Raw, Emotional Masterpiece of the Old American West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a true western, directed by a genius and it shows in the cast. Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood and the late Richard Harris.Unforgiven starts with a retired gunslinger, William Munny, now a pig farmer living on a remote farm in 1869 with his two kids, wife deceased. One day a young gunslinger, The Schofield Kid, turns up requesting for his help in a bounty.This bounty was set by a group of prostitutes after one of them was severely cut on the face by two cowboys. They set the bounty for the two cowboys.William accepts, but only after inviting his friend, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to join the hunt. After they all meet up, they set out for the town of Big Whiskey to assassinate the two cowboys and collect their bounty.Enters Little Bill (Gene Hackman). He's the sheriff of Big Whiskey, and he HATES assassins. After English Bob(Richard Harris), an English assassin, arrives in the town armed against the town rules, Little Bill beats him to a pulp and imprisons him, taking his biographer.All of these characters, more different than the other, set on course to clash with each other, sets up for the one of the best westerns of our time, possibly ever. Raw emotion and powerful directing reveals the dark truth of the old American West. The ending is one of the most powerful I've seen, and William Muny is a classical character. Truly one of the greater films of the 20th century. One of my favourites.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best ever western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood will forever be remembered as "The Man with no Name" form Sergio Leone's immortal spaghetti westerns. 25 years later, Clint decides to comeback and make his own Western. The result is Unforgiven, the best western ever, and is a film which really captures the brutal lives the people of the time had. There is no glamorisation of the cowboys, none are portrayed as good men, but as brutal killers.Eastwood plays William Munny, a retired former gunslinger who owns a farm. Due to lack of money, he joins up with his former partner and a young man to collect a bounty, returning to the life he thought he had left for good. It is shown that having a respectable job is not enough. Munny is failing at trying to make an honest living, and by killing he can make much more. Also, the most brutal character, Little Bill Daggett, who is brilliantly portrayed by Gene Hackman, has the most power. He runs the town, and anyone not obeying his laws gets brutally beaten. People who do not resort to violence get killed, and women are treated badly - they are worth less to the men than horses.The final shootout is one of the best things I have ever seen in any film. It is worth watching the film just to see it.The fact a western - pretty much a forgotten genre, won 4 Oscars, especially best picture, is a measure of Eastwood's immense talent as a director as well as an actor. All Oscars were thoroughly deserved too, this is certainly one of my favourites.</fullReview>

In many ways this is the "total Eastwood" of all his films.The realism in the tale as it is told on the film is so gritty that there are scenes that are difficult to watch but your so engaged by the way it is being told, that you can't help yourself. It has been a while since I have seen this one, but I still remember being queasy when Gene Hackman is portraying some of the real evil of men's souls in this film.The baring of the evil of people is what makes this compelling viewing. It is so well done that there is no doubt this deserved Best Picture in 1992.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful tribute to Eastwood's western legacy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is probably the most thoughtful Western ever made. Nowhere to be seen are clichéd conventions of the anonymous gunfighter (exemplified in Leone's 'Man with No Name' trilogy, of course featuring Eastwood himself as the lead), or tense one-on-one duels. Instead we are treated to an intensely complex depiction of the morality of violence, without any of the genre's usual glamorisation.The story revolves around the violent attack on a prostitute named Delilah by two cowboys that opens the film. It is a brutal opening that grabs the audience by the throat, and sets the realistic tone present throughout the movie. Munny (Eastwood) is brought out of 'retirement' by the Schofield Kid - after a partner to help him collect the whores' bounty. Munny is desperate for the money now he is the widowed parent of two children and his pigs are dying of a fever; and recruits his old partner Ned (Freeman) to the cause. When they arrive in Big Whiskey (home to the prostitutes offering the bounty for the two cowboys responsible for slashing at Delilah), Little Bill Daggett (Hackman) violently asserts his authority as sheriff to stop the bounty hunters, eventually becoming a murderer himself ? and this contradiction throws up the questions of forgiveness implied by the title.Eastwood has assembled a fantastic cast for the film, and their pedigree shows ? he included, gaining an Oscar nomination for his troubled, desperate old man. Their performances are on the whole effectively subtle; in particular Freeman's realisation he no longer has it in him to kill a man. Gene Hackman, as you may expect from his Oscar win, is also excellent as town-sheriff Little Bill ? an evil burning in his eyes and a powerful, cocky presence about his person.Peoples multi-layered script (which took 16 years to finally be produced) paints a far grimmer, darker picture of the Wild West then we are used to (including another Eastwood-directed western The Outlaw Josey Wales), and it is perfectly complemented by the slow-paced editing (Oscar number 2): stripping the artificial excitement of what has gone before away. Only two scenes in the film feature gunfights; neither provide a visceral thrill. The first takes place in a canyon, another stereotypical feature of a Western ? but there is no sense of jubilation when Munny finally hits his target; more a sense of waste. When Munny cries to "fetch him some water", the futility of violence is highlighted, as is the act of revenge ? throwing up questions of forgiveness.Eastwood's direction is perfectly handled (the third Oscar), long shots emphasising the characters' mortality and vulnerability in such a volatile environment. A gorgeously shot sequence involves Munny and Ned riding through a golden wheat field and sharply contrasts the darker, rain-swept moments. The sets are also fantastically designed, evoking the Wild West in a suitably dingy, run-down fashion ? and Little Bill's self-built home is full of holes in the roof: representing the moral contradictions of his character.The film is most definitely deserving of its fourth Oscar for Best Picture, and is a wonderful tribute from Eastwood to his roots and mentors ? Don Siegel and Sergio Leone ? echoing the latter's Once Upon a Time in the West in its epic scale and drama. However, it is infused with a much more thoughtful depiction of violence than has ever been seen in a Western; for that matter most films of any genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Take On The Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the popularity of the western has been in decline for decades (save for a few mini resurgences here and there), many filmgoers may lack enthusiasm for catching UNFORGIVEN. They need to reconsider. Clint Eastwood has never been better as William Munny, an aging gunslinging hit-man who comes out of retirement not for the thrill, but for the money. He and partner Morgan Freeman team up with young, gung ho Jaimz Woolvett to knock off a pair of scoundrels involved in the brutal knife attack of a prostitute.UNFORGIVEN may be set in the old west, but it's not really a western in the traditional sense. Rather than cowboys and Indians, this is cowboys and their consciences. Our three protagonists (or antagonists?) each come to grips with the fact that pulling the trigger on another man ain't all it's cracked up to be -- even if he has it coming. Eastwood spends the picture grappling with his inner demons, caught between conflicting needs to be a better man than he once was and to provide a better life for his young children. It's a fascinating take on the rough 'n' tumble cowboy legend.UNFORGIVEN could have easily come off as corny. With western film clichés so firmly ingrained in pop culture, a special talent was required to bring the genre to the 1990s. Director Eastwood, no stranger to this film category, proved to be that talent. The writing, action, camera work, and acting all gel together beautifully. None of it feels contrived, not even squinty Eastwood's words of cowpoke wisdom.A deserving winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 1992, UNFORGIVEN is a treat. It's actually the first western I've ever seen, but it hopefully won't be the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long goodbye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood taking all his experience as actor and director and utilising it to say a lasting and fitting goodbye to a genre that he has always been so closely associated with. In the process Clint Eastwood also made one of the best films of the decade and certainly one of the all time great westerns. Where does Unforgiven sit in the roll call of all time great westerns? Perhaps only Once Upon a Time in the West and classics such as Rio Bravo come close to the epic yet subtle and controlled Unforgiven. Everything in Unforgiven is perfectly judged from an economic but effective script to sterling performances from Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris. But to top these is Gene Hackman as the chilling town sheriff who so easily could have become a panto villain but remains human throughout and the shocking conclusion leaves you with plenty to contemplate on the nature of violence, justice and revenge. I cant recommend this film enough a must see.9/10 - An all time great of it's genre and required viewing for any western fan or any film fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western as Myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is the ultimate Clint Eastwood movie and the ultimate western. Eastwood's character William Munny is a man legendary for both his killing ability, and his lack of remorse about his handiwork. There are imprints of his other characters here, including those from "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly". But this one goes much deeper than those early spaghetti westerns. In a sense William Munny is based on the myth of Eastwood's own characters from those old movies. The movie is peppered with stories about his legendary, grisly "accomplishments". It seems to revel in the cold-bloodedness of his prior actions luridly, until you realize that there's a point to all of this. Munny is tired, and he does have remorse for what he's done in the past. Further, he doesn't consider himself that kind of person anymore.Setting the movie off is the disfiguring of a beautiful, naive young prostitute named Delilah. When Little Bill (Gene Hackman, and he's as good as ever), the pompous sheriff of the town, refuses to so much as whip the men responsible (these aren't people, they are property), the ladies at the whorehouse (led by Strawberry Alice, the tough, decisive madame, played by Frances Fisher) decide to take matters into their own hands. They put a price on the heads of the people who did this.This is where Munny comes in. A young cowboy who calls himself the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) approaches him about teaming up to collect the bounty. So after some thought, Munny decides to pursue the bounty, enlisting his old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).A huge amount of the movie is spent on build-up to the climax. Little Bill finds out about the bounty and prevents the anyone from entering his town with firearms, while the three cowboys ride to town, and the prostitutes wait for their vengeance. We also meet English Bob, a gentleman whose killing abilities are known far and wide thanks to his biographer WW Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek). He has some of the funniest scenes in the movie until his clash with Little Bill, who beats him, locks him up, deflates the overblown stories written about him, casts him off, and even steals his biographer.A lot of this is to set the mood. It looks on the surface like a traditional western, but it's not. It is the traditional western on acid, elevated to true myth, with gut-wrenching drama thrown in. Everything from the cinematography to the acting to the directing is vivid, striking, and beautiful, and meant to evoke a simpler style of movie-making while at the same time being completely state-of-the-art. The movie won several Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director (it was directed by Eastwood). I'm not going to say anything about the climax as it would give too much away, but suffice it to say, it's pretty powerful. "Unforgiven", more than just the greatest western of all time, is also hands-down one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortiven (1992) Directed by Clint Eastwood - Starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, and Frances Fisher - 10/10Unforgiven represents Clint Eastwood's final film of the western genre. With four Oscar nods (including best picture and best director) and five more nominations, it's safe to say that he went out with guns blazing.Eastwood has challenged the western formula before, first with the spaghetti westerns, then pushing the edge even further with High Plains Drifter. But Unforgiven is something else altogether.Eastwood plays Will Munny, a man with a nasty past. When the film opens, he's a widower living in Kansas with his two children. He's sworn off the bad deeds of his youth and has taken up life as a struggling pig farmer. This all changes when The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) rides up to his ranch in need of a partner to collect on a $1000 bounty on the head of two men who cut up a prostitute in Wyoming. In need of the money, Munny eventually obliges, but not before adding his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to the band.Complicating matters is that their destination, the town of Big Whiskey, is run by Little Bill, a sheriff with a mean streak, played by the incomparable Gene Hackman. Little Bill has heard of the bounty on the men in his jurisdiction and will not allow it to be collected. He sends his message by not only beating the famous English Bob (Richard Harris), but letting everyone see how much Bob fears him.Given that it's a western, obviously a confrontation between Munny and Little Bill is coming (two confrontations actually), but it's not the ultimate focus of the story. Much of the story deals with the inner workings of Munny and Logan. They are two men on a mission to do something that they swore never to do again. Yet they continue to tell themselves that it is just a one time ordeal for the money to kill men who deserve to die, they are not returning to their wicked ways. Their mission brings their inner demons right to the surface. Meanwhile, they are riding with Woolvett's character, the kid who believes in the glory of the gunfighter and that a man's toughness can be measured by the number of men he's killed (the kid claims to have killed five himself). Munny views the kid as ignorant and almost worthy of pity.Where the western rules are really broken though is with the characters of the protagonist and antagonist. The role where we expect to find a 'hero' is filled by Will Munny. But is a no good former thief who has killed women and children and on a mission to kill two more men really worthy of the audience's sympathy? The antagonist Little Bill brings up questions as well. He's ruthless and mean, but not completely immoral. He's more interested in scaring (and beating) away the assassins who come into his town than actually killing them. His pride and joy is the house that he is building by hand. This is certainly not a case of the good-hearted Marshall Rooster Cogburn vs. the scoundrel Ned Pepper in True Grit. Here, the lines between good and evil have never been more blurred. Eastwood the director does a masterful job of forcing the audience to consistently ask questions of what is right and what is wrong all the way up to and past the climax.Some might call this an anti-violence film. I did not see it that way. The message is stronger that violence has consequences. The film deals with the emotional and reactionary consequences that arise from both the violence that occurs in the plot and the acts that have occurred long ago in the past. Munny is forced to live with the things he's done and the realization that the man who did those things may still exist. Rarely attempted (The Shootist comes to mind), never before has this been done so effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Western films and have only really liked several western films. The only other western I have really loved was Dances With Wolves. Unforgiven is easily the best western I have ever seen and one of the best films I have ever seen. The writing is wonderful. The screenwriter manages to capture some of the best characters and plot points ever created. His dialogue is just so perfect and we completely understand just why each character is doing what they are doing. The performances are also very fine. Gene Hackman is in particular wonderful as the brutal sheriff. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are both also very good though. The film is also very well directed by Eastwood. He knows his story and respects every inch of it. The best western ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood has starred in many Westerns, but this time... he directs one (and stars in it)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has been partners with Sergio Leone during Sergio's career. I'm not sure how many westerns Clint did, but he stuck with the whole "Man with No Name" trilogy. There was even a song by the Gorillaz called "Clint Eastwood." (However, it has nothing to really do with him. You can find it in Now 8.) I suppose putting Clint Eastwood in Westerns is like putting Vince Vaughn in comedy; it always happens.Now, I'm not sure what happened to Sergio Leone. He either retired or died. I'm also not sure how Clint Eastwood became so successful. He started out in some Western show, and then went into Sergio Leone's movie, and now he made himself into a director! He made one hell of an impact upon audiences and critics when he directed his own Western, "Unforgiven." It begins with some prostitutes giving a man some "service" and then getting attacked. The offenders get captured, but not full punished. Their punishment: bringing a number of ponies to the sheriff. (or some other person. I forgot who.) Of course, the offenders aren't considered fully redeemed ("They cut her face, her eyes, her nose, and even her teats.") by the prostitutes, and they gather up all the money they have. They use the money ($1000) to set up their own bounty for the two offenders.Clint Eastwood stars in his movie, playing William Munny. Instead of playing the young bounty hunter he was in all the Sergio Leone Westerns, he plays an older, retired version of them. A once young, fearless killer is now reduced to a mere pig farmer who had a wife named Claudia, who apparently changed him for the better. Now, he no longer kills, and just takes care of his children. However, a farmer never does to well in economy. So, when the Scohfield Kid visits Will with an offer to join him on an attempt to collect the bounty that the prostitutes offered, Will declines. (Almost) He needs the money, but worries about the promises he made to his wife.Reluctantly, William gets his friend, Nate (played by Morgan Freeman) to join the party. Tensions mount between the group (Nate and The Kid despise each other.) who already struggles with the problem of killing the two criminals. William struggles with himself, and struggles with the fact that he doesn't want to kill people on the account of his wife.Unforgiven is filled with Clint Eastwood's dark style. Clint and Morgan bring depth and seriousness to their roles. It talks about killing, and uses it as a dark theme very often. Even the name sounds dark! Supposedly, it shows the truth about killing, and doesn't support it. By the end, death affects each and every one of the characters in a dark and even sometimes hypocritical sense. The truth and horror of killing is where all the power originates from.The film also uses a great cast to create great characters. I think that "The Kid" may be my favorite character because he is young, and because of that, he is extremely excited for a killing. He also doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, which results of abuse from his partners. Very realistic.Another thing that makes it dramatic is the music. It sounds like the music we heard in "Million Dollar Baby." It is also the music that sounds simple, but melancholy and dramatic.However, the film does carry flaws, just like many others do. First of all, it seems very repetitive. The audience knows that Claudia changed William's life, and ended his killings. But throughout the film, William is constantly repeating himself. "Claudia wouldn't want me doing that." "I would, but I can't, on the account of my wife." I know that he has to explain that to every character that questions him, but come on! If they left out some repetitive parts like that, than we would have more time to get to the good parts.However, the movie delays its dramatic parts by adding in that whole thing about English Bob. It seemed kind of pointless. I'm sure it had some divine meaning behind, but the parts seemed painfully long and dull.Yet, the last scene is truly intense, and (intentionally) hypocritical.I was disappointed, but the film is dark and dramatic, and sometimes, gets pretty intense. I don't think "Unforgiven" "summarizes everything Clint Eastwood thinks about the Western genre." I think it's a showcase of Clint Eastwood's dark style. The success of this film most likely inspired him to make such masterpieces such as "Mystic River" and "Million Dollar Baby." "Flags of Our Fathers" comes out next year, and I sure do have high expectations for that.Good: Intense and dark with good characters and acting Bad: It seems so slow-moving, and delays the arrival of the harsh and dramatic scenes because of repetitiveness and the whole English Bob stuff.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely the best Clint Eastwood movie I've ever seen. And definitely one of the best Westerns I've ever seen. I even rank it above The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. True Leone's movie starring Clint Eastwood was marvelous, but I just love Unforgiven a whole lot more. I have ever since the day I first saw it.Aside from Clint, we have several other familiar faces. Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris co-star with him. And there is also Jaimz Woolvett, Frances Fisher, Anthony James, and many others, all of which are well developed.Clint sure knew what he was doing when he made this movie. The plot is pretty good, not exactly what I was expecting, but I guess that made it even better. Clint Eastwood plays a retired gunfighter named William Munny, who has set down whiskey and guns for eleven years now thanks to his wife. But now she has passed away and he is struggling to support him and his two kids on pig-farming. And when a young man called The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) tells him about a reward of a thousand dollars for killing two men who gashed up a hooker, he finds it hard to resist. He joins up with his old killing-partner, sharpshooter Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and they team up with the Kid and ride into a town of Big Whiskey in Wyoming. But there is only one problem: the lawman down there, Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) doesn't take too kindly to assassins. Nor does his deputies. And they sure made an example by beating up on a gunfighter known as English Bob (Richard Harris) and damaging his reputation.Clint as director and lead actor sure made this movie a masterpiece. Not only does he entertain the audience, but he's lecturing them about how killing can sure affect a person. He displays it greatly with Jaimz Woolvett's character, who thought it would be easy to kill a person, but when he does it, his soul gets completely ripped apart and unable to heal itself ever again. And even Morgan Freeman's character finds that after so many years of never harming anyone, it's hard to shoot a man dead.Another aspect of this film that I like is how Clint directed the shootouts. The great gunfight that happens in the saloon at the end is magnificent. No ordinary director could have done that.Overall, Unforgiven is a masterpiece of a Western and on my top list of favorite movies. The only other Western that compares the reality of 19th century life is Kevin Costner's Open Range. And if you liked that movie, you'll enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, I did not think of Clint Eastwood as a serious film maker. Wowed by those two films, I decided that I needed to see The Unforgiven, which when it came out I disdained as another of the shoot-'em-up Westerns in which Eastwood had frequently starred. If you haven't seen this film, do so IMMEDIATELY. Although it is being sold in a package with Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, I wasn't able to find it as a single. However, I signed up for Netflix, put it at the top of my list and received it two days later. In many ways, The Unforgiven serves up a heaping portion of the clichés that have deservedly caused film makers to avoid Westerns in recent years. There's the retired gunfighter (Eastwood) and the sadistic sheriff (Gene Hackman), the black sidekick (Morgan Freeman) and the inevitable shootout. But Eastwood's character is a lot more interesting than the usual retired gunslinger and Hackman's is possibly the most sadistic sheriff ever. A wonderful touch is Richard Harris as English Bob, a preening professional killer brutally beaten by Hackman's sheriff. If, like me, you thought Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby were wonderful, go find The Unforgiven and see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To praise "Unforgiven" as perhaps the best western ever filmed feels like faint praise. This is a wonderful film in every respect.While some have complained that the film is slow moving, I found that steady movement towards an unexpected end to be compelling and informative.The scene where Gene Hackman's character explains to a writer just how gunfights really occur is wonderful - plus it prepares the viewer for what lies ahead.Eastwood has a wonderful supporting cast and as the lead shows a subtle range that should have won the Best Actor Oscar for that year.It's hard to watch this film and not feel chills when William Munny (Eastwood) steps into that saloon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood has created an iconic masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie several times and each time the detail and depth of the plot and characterizations grows richer. In revisiting the movie the reality of human drama grows in the context of American values and how we have come to the type of society (America) we have created.Clint Eastwood has created an iconic masterpiece that over time may become more appreciated in the same way that Casablanca and other iconic films have become. The film is a definitive moral summary of all American western films from the value set of today's society.The plot, centers around the uniquely American response (in the character of Clint Eastwood) to the injustice and dictatorial slavery of a sheriff (Gene Hackman) in a small town in 1880 Wyoming. The story builds from a small offense in a brothel (literally an insulting giggle by a small town prostitute) to the climatic finish of a bar room shootout on a dark and stormy night. Good and evil is contrasted in switched roles where the sheriff becomes the villain and the criminal the hero.I highly recommend serious film lovers to revisit the movie several times. The iconic nature of the movie may well characterize it as the best western ever made. Unforgiven is as good as Clint Eastwood's other film, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'. The difference between the two however shows up over time. Like an event that happens in your life that you think of over and over again, this western reminds us of why we are the way we are (as Americans).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tortured soul in the wild west...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns. This genre of film is one of the most interesting ones out there even though a lot of westerns are pretty much the same. There's a small town way out west that has a run in with a group or gang of unsavory characters, and the local sheriff or another hero of the town has to get rid of them. Sometimes you get one that is a little different. You get one that truly defines the genre.In Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, we follow William "Bill" Munny, an assassin of the old west who just wants to forget about his past as a shootist and raise his two kids. What he doesn't expect is some hot shot mercenary to come along and offer him a job for $1000 split 50/50. He gets his partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) and meets up with the kid who calls himself "The Schofield Kid" (Jaimz Woolvett) on account of the Schofield weapon he carries. The three men trek out on the open range in search of the town called Ordinance 14 or "Big Whiskey" where Sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett (Gene Hackman) runs the show. This is where the contract has been sent out for the two men who cut up a local prostitute named Delilah. Her friends want justice for what the two cowboys did.Little Bill thinks that he has total control over what goes on in his town. He has no guns allowed with the exception of the arsenal he and his boys carry. He doesn't like assassins like Munny, Ned, the kid, and the aging English Bob (Richard Harris) who even wants to try and collect the bounty. Little Bill will have no one shooting up the place while he is in charge unless he is the one behind the trigger. Munny, a recovered alcoholic thanks to his late wife, isn't as excited about killing men again as the kid is, who claims to have killed five men. Munny has a dark past that only he and Ned know about, the kid only knows him by reputation. The three men don't know what to expect in Big Whiskey, but they are sure about to find out.Eastwood's film Unforgiven is a masterpiece. He has been on top of this genre with the legendary John Wayne. The two have made some of the best westerns ever. Unforgiven, however, has an edge that other westerns don't have. Much like John Ford's The Searchers, which also starred Wayne, these movies possess an element not shown in most westerns; mystery. The unknown is one of the most essential elements to a good western. The old west has always been mysterious and an ominous subject in American history, and it is best shown in this fashion.The trio of Eastwood, Freeman, and Hackman make for an incredible cinematic experience. They bring a dark shadow over the west. Writer David Webb Peoples has written some great pieces of cinema (Blade Runner, Twelve Monkeys). The combination of him and Eastwood directing certainly earned this movie a total of four Oscars for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Hackman), Best Director, and Best Film Editing (Joel Cox). It was also nominated for Best Actor (Eastwood) and Best Original Screenplay (Peoples). This movie is not just entertaining but well made, too.Eastwood delivers a sensational film that is one of the best of its kind. It can be considered a new western, with its harsher way of telling a story and a more violent account, nevertheless, it is impressive. This film will make your movie collection. Unforgiven is the story of just another tortured soul...just another story of the old west...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For once, the Oscars went to the right film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood as a director seems to enjoy wearing his influences on his sleeve. When he received a screenplay for an independent Italian production called The Magnificent Stranger (at the time), little did he know that it would make him a big star. The director on this project was a man by the name of Sergio Leone, who is mentioned towards the end of the credits of Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a tribute of sorts to Leone's style of direction. Before Sergio Leone hit the American markets, Westerns had fallen into cliché, and had stagnated so much that they were no longer taken seriously. Kind of like almost everything produced by the MPAA and its studios today, but with a smaller price tag. Unforgiven, from start to finish, is a tribute to Sergio Leone's unconventional direction and style of story. But it also succeeds well enough on its own merits, taking all the clichés that other Westerns had reinserted into the genre, and once again turning them on their head. Half of Gene Hackman's dialogue is a direct stab at all the conventions and clichés.Not that Hackman is the only one at the peak of his game. Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris deliver some of the smoothest and most natural performances I have ever seen from them. Eastwood himself is as smooth and calm both in front of and behind the camera as the heroes he portrayed in Sergio Leone's masterpieces. Overall, if there is a single weak performance in this cast, it escapes my memory. You will not remember all the actors who appear in Unforgiven, especially since a lot of the populace of Big Whisky are little more than extended cameo appearances. What you will remember is that none of them give the appearance of phoning in their performance. Saul Rubinek's performance is both the most subtle and in the widest arc, as his character goes from admiration of an exaggerating show-off, stopping along the way at admiration of a sheriff who happens to be the real deal, and finally getting off the bus at frank terror of a man who has come out of retirement with a vengeance. If it were not for the fact that much of the action happens whilst he is on a train to Big Whiskey, one could say the film is seen through his eyes.Nobody has ever used widescreen more dynamically than Sergio Leone, although Eastwood makes a fair stab at the same demonstration of why Pan and Scan should be outlawed throughout. The scene with his character, the mercenary, and the whore sitting outside the wooden hideout, just having a serious chat, shows plainly why the 2.35:1 aspect ratio was introduced to film. Combined with some beautiful landscapes mostly in Alberta, Canada, this film becomes a real pleasure to look upon. Just as the shots are beautifully composed, they are arranged together in a paced, deliberate manner to give them the proper impact. Roger Ebert hits the nail on the head when he says that Unforgiven is also a homage to a dying style of film, where quick-cuts, jump-cuts, and shaky-cam were considered mistakes rather than standard techniques. Common sense will eventually prevail, and allowing the viewer to see things clearly will again be considered a virtue, but not before many films in the same vein as Unforgiven are passed over. Who would have thought that the man who grit his teeth all through the Dirty Harry series was such an auteur at heart?The Christian Spotlight On The Movies describes Unforgiven as "Very offensive", before giving it four and a half stars for film-making quality. In some ways, I agree with that review, in that Unforgiven is definitely not a film to be shown to children. But that is beside the point. Eastwood understands throughout that the films which made him famous were put together in order to entertain an adult audience, and continue to do so for as long as they existed. The results were films that one could not outgrow. In Unforgiven, Eastwood effectively takes all the Westerns that were aimed at children during the early stages of his career, and shows them up for the unmitigated bunk they are. A prime example is when Gene Hackman's character tells Saul Rubinek's the story of how Richard Harris' character really killed a particular threat. It is just one man telling another a story, but the details are so well-chosen and so clearly set up that it triggers a picture of its own in the imagination. Come to think of it, Eastwood may well be one of the few directors left who trusts in the imagination of his audience.Without hesitation or qualification, I gave Unforgiven a ten out of ten. It is definitely an acquired taste, and the deliberate pacing can put off some viewers, but it is a film you will never forget after a viewing or two. It also shows that Eastwood was paying attention when he worked with Siegel and Leone, for the best of both directors can be seen in many a shot. This is one film you have to have to see before you can truly understand how extraordinary film can be as an art form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable And Dark Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon writing this I would just like to say that this review is just one mans opinion.This is a western which was also directed by its main actor, the excellent Clint Eastwood who does an excellent job with both. He portrays William Munny, a former assassin who is enticed back into one more killing by a young apparently would be killer. Their targets are two men who have cut up a lady which basically means they slashed a hooker. Munny leaves the two young children he has behind before his journey. Their mother and his wife has previously died of smallpox. All this is excellently depicted in a print at the outset of the film. Munny looks to his former partner Ned Logan played by the excellent as always Morgan Freeman. And so it commences. What follows is a terrific story of violence, deep thoughts and much great and memorable dialogue.This is a grim anti western with a superb script and in my mind is most memorable for its characters especially the dark and deserved Oscar winning performance by another legend Gene Hackman.His performance is so spot on you actually hate him and forget hes just acting. Hes the local sheriff Little Bob in the town which William , Ned and the kid go to for the killing. The town bans firearms and he revels in finding men carrying them. This brings me to the most memorable scene without Eastwood in this movie. Richard Harris makes a brief appearance as English Bob who denies carrying firearms. Little Bob discovers firearms however, and hands out a savage beatings to Bob. This may well have been the scene in which Hackmans Oscar was sealed. he carrys out another well depicted beating later in the film. This time its on William and later one on Ned.However Eastwood is equally as impressive in his role. He perfectly captures the feelings of a man who can't escape his terrible past but must try to for the sake of his two young children. We hear his wife had him straightened out before she passed away. she apparently rid him of all violence and his alcoholism. Its scary to think of what he may have been like before that which is also portrayed amazingly by Clint. I won't ramble on any further but this film is worth all the credit it receives and is a must see even if you don't like westerns. To sum it up in one line I will say the following. Powerful and dark anti-western with few faults and an excellent script and cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood proves that the Western is still 'his' genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is a man who, as an actor, I'll always associate with Westerns. Sure, he has had some other projects like the "Dirty Harry"-movies or for instance "Absolute Power" or "True Crime", but never ever was he has good as when he played the not very talkative, rather mysterious and strange cowboy. In my opinion every actor has a genre that suits him best and for Clint Eastwood that definitely is the Western.This time he's William Munny, a former criminal who now lives somewhere on the prairie with his two little kids, where he grows some crops and raises pigs. His wife, who's already dead, was the one that brought him back to the right way of life and since then he hasn't done anything wrong again. Life is very hard, but than he gets an interesting offer from "The Schofield Kid". A young prostitute was stabbed several times and now she has several awful looking scars in her face. Her colleagues have put a prize on the head of the two cowboys who did it. William Munny will try to kill the two cowboys with the help of The Schofield Kid and his long-time friend Ned Logan...Most Westerns don't take the time for some character development, but this one does and it has to be said, it's done excellently. What makes this movie so interesting and good is the fact that the characters in this movie aren't black and white at all. The line between good and evil, between heroism and villainy is very thin and is crossed several times in an excellent way. You always think you know the characters, but than they act completely different from what you think they will do.The story is a lot better than what you might expect from the average modern Western. Of course we aren't talking about Cowboys vs. Indians here, but it still could have been a rather thin story line (think for example of "The Quick and the Dead", where we only get to see one duel after the other). Somehow they were able to keep the original features of the Western, but with a very interesting story added to it. I can only admire that and that's why I give it a well deserved 8.5/10. This is a must see movie for everybody and not only for those who love Westerns.</fullReview>

The casting is suburb, employing the best actors for each role. Clint Eastwood is perfect in his starring role. The supporting cast is exceptional. Morgan Freeman is Eastwood's most credible "partner." Gene Hackman plays the unsavory sheriff. The cinematography is great. Darkness and shadows are superimposed on the beauty of the western landscape.

Jaimz Woolvett, a near-sighted wanna be gunfighter, contacts Will Munny(Eastwood), who gathers Ned Logan(Morgan Freeman) to avenge and collect the reward. The main theme of the movie is to show the fine line between good and evil. Eastwood has his concept, and little Bill(Gene Hackman),sheriff of Big Whiskey ,Wyoming has his. Movie builds to a dramatic climax you will never forget !!! Richard Harris appears as "English Bob", a former acquaintance of Little Bill, and provides the needed subplot.

William Munny decided on the advice of a so called Schofield kid,that he would go on a quest for a thousand dollar reward a bunch of whores were offering for the cowboys who cut up one of their ladies.In the process he employed his old sidekick Ned Logan(Morgam Freeman). He, Ned, and the so called Schofield kid, took off for a town whos name I can't recall, in search of the cowboys responsible for the cutting up of the whore. In order not to give too much away, I'll just say that basically all hell broker loose, and there was an abundant amount of killing, and a lot of rain. William Munny became the vicious killer that he had vowed to his dead wife he would never be again. But sometimes circumstances seem to over ride even the most solomn of promises. This is one of the best westerns you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Cowboys of the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is are certain aspects of Westerns that are given. One of the givens is that the cowboys who go around shooting each other are emotionally detached from the work they are in. The movie Unforgiven uses this expectation, then turns it on it's head to make for a fun and introspective look at the classic spaghetti Western that Clint Eastwood made so famous. Eastwood stars, directs, and produced this, the Oscar winner for best picture and best direction. Gene Hackman was also honored for best supporting actor for his role as the tough sheriff of a lonely Wyoming town. Eastwood plays a former gunslinging robber who has retired to become a father and run the family farm. His struggles on the farm, most notably with his pigs, sends him on a job where the pay has him coming out of retirement, teaming up with his former partner in crime, played by Morgan Freeman. One of the joys of this film is how it does not go for the easy social commentary, and Freeman's race is never mentioned in the story. The Eastwood character is a good man who does the right thing, even if it means being tough and nasty. The end of the movie was the biggest surprise, as conflicts within the mind of a want-to-be cowboy comes to the surface, and a real character emerges. These are the Sergio Leone cowboys made famous in the 60s with the Eastwood vehicles, these are old, experienced, moral cowboys who still know how to get the job done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest westerns of all time since "Shane" and "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" remains moving and beautiful after you've seen it. Clint Eastwood is at his best. It is my favorite Eastwood film of all time. The film goes a bit rough at times. Eastwood is retired killer named William Munny who is asked by the Schofield Kid(Jaimz Woolvett) to go on a bounty to kill two men who cut up a prostitute in a quiet town with a corrupted sheriff(Gene Hackman) who happens to be on the killers side. Their are very beautiful images like the one at the tree which kind of looks like the shot from "Gone With The Wind." Filmed in Alberta. Eastwood won his two Oscars for the Picture as a producer and for his Direction but he failed to receive his nomination for Best Actor. It also won for Editing and Hackman for supporting actor. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Especially the last 20-30 minutes. It has to be one of the best done, climatic shootouts ever...little details of this movie go unnoticed but have impact such as the scene in which Munny and the kid are waiting outside of town for their pay...it starts off by giving you a visual of the town and an indistinguishable figure riding toward them in the distance...the following dialog between Munny and the kid (a classic dialog in and of itself) takes place within the time it takes for who turns out to be one of the whores with the money (and the sad news) to ride from town to them...from time to time during the dialog, it shows the figure getting closer and closer...i think that this scene puts you into the pace of the life back then and adds to the overall realism this film tries to capture...yes, at times it is "slow-paced" as some here complain...but then, life was actually that way...unlike the action-packed, fast-paced, never-a-dull-moment life many westerns would have us believe life to be back then...life was hard, filthy, untamed, boring, and slow-paced with moments of total mayhem. Wyoming, a beautifully picturesque place, especially as depicted by most travelogues, was also shown to be a real place with nasty unpredictable weather to balance the majestic beauty it also offers...The recurring question to Beuchamps claim to be a writer: "of letters and such?" is another little example to detail this movie pays to the time and place of this movie--people's only reason to write back then would be to write letters and such--that was something probably everyone did back then, much like everyone talks on the phone now...it was the only thing they could relate writing to...probably the first writer of books and magazines any of them ever met...who had time to write books? Survival took up all their time...loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moral ambiguity is the theme of this picture. None of the characters are really likable. They all have their flaws and moral failings. In the end, the main character achieves his goal, but at such a price as to make the reward meaningless. The viewer is left with a somewhat incomplete feeling, as if there is no closure to the story. And I think this is the overall sense that Writer David Webb Peoples and Producer-Director-Star Clint Eastwood were striving for.Eastwood's performance as anti-hero William Munny is, of course, the film's feature. He is a changed man as a result of the love of a good woman, and sets out on his quest to achieve some measure of security for his children, who are the only other legacy of his late wife, but it is a mission of brutality and revenge. We know he is a killer who has a past of savagery and brutality that is somewhat legendary. But we know his quest is driven by unselfish motives.The supporting cast is quite exceptional. Gene Hackman's portrayal of frontier town lawman "Little Bill" Daggett presents another dimension of the moral ambiguity that underlies the story. On the one hand, he presents a facade of tough-minded fairness and a desire to keep the peace in his backwater pioneer town, but does so with a brutal, thuggish, sadistic manner that blunts any redeeming traits. Morgan Freeman as Eastwood's partner is also a past killer who would just as soon stay home on the farm, but signs on to ride one last time as Muny's partner in the reward offered to kill the assaulter of a saloon whore. The group of saloon call girls themselves, while perhaps being the ones the viewer would most empathize with, have no qualms about upping their "quota" of customers to hoard cash to offer as the reward for someone to kill the brutalizers of one of their group.This movie does the viewing public a service by portraying the darker and arduous side of the early American West, in contrast to the more romantic visions often offered by the movie industry. In actual life, it was a hostile, forbidding, often brutal and unforgiving environment. The price to tame this continent was very high, often paid in ways other than monetary. It often was often paid at the cost of the soul of a person.Because of its exceptional cast and carefully crafted story, this film rates very high on my list. Eastwood fans will appreciate his effort in a different kind of role and in a story of some complexity. Give it a viewing and then a fair amount of time for contemplation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But Not a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think The Outlaw Josey Wales is probably at least as good as The Unforgiven amongst the Eastwood westerns. My opinion of The Unforgiven started out on a bad note with Clint's extremely uninspired performance playing the father around his character's children. There were other such moments, though not of the same duration as those early ones. Oddly, I think Morgan Freeman might have given the best performance, but as a black man I doubt he would have fit into the Old West like he did without nary a word spoken about color. But as far as Eastwood's William Munny character, I think another "aging" actor would have given it more emotional depth. My mind goes to Robert Duvall. The film was a little slow in spots but was well-photographed. What makes the film unusual is that the characters are revolted by killing. But perhaps the best scenes and the most inspired performances seem to come in the last twenty minutes of the film, which is probably a good place for them to be. The viewer leaves the theater, or now likely the television, impressed, albeit not overly impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark insight into killing a person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is truly a great movie. It is also a dark movie. It seemed as if it was raining heavily through three-quarters of the film, especially during the scenes in the town of Little Whiskey. That little mud hole is where Gene Hackman plays the sadistic sheriff who will kick the hell out of anyone who enters his town without leaving his gun with him first (there's a sign on the way into town that no ones seemingly takes seriously until it's too late). But this is not your ordinary western. The movie's greatness stems from the fact that it realistically shows how hard it is for an ordinary person to actually kill a man. Clint Eastwood, playing the legendary killer William Munny, tells the shaken kid wanting to be his protege "it's a hell of a thing to kill a man. You take away everything he has and everything he would have." It's not like most movies where people shoot and get shot as simply as eating a ham sandwich. This movie shows the wrenching impact of killing from the perspective of the people with a gun in their hand: the shaking hands, the quivering jaw, the terror. It also shows that the "good" killer is not the fastest, or the strongest, he's the one who is steady as other men blink in fear. The ending showdown will leave you watching the credits and thinking, yes, this is how the gun fights in the wild west must have really been. It is also how killing is today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I don't typically describe myself as a fan of Western flicks, mostly due to the fact that I simply haven't seen most of the greats yet, I truly loved and enjoyed this film. Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, the baddest and meanest son of a bitch ever to walk the Earth...and killer of women and children. It's simply amazing that Eastwood not only starred in this, but also directed and produced it. One of the few examples of this that can be given. Mel Gibson also did a decent job in his Braveheart. I think that if you have seen all of the Western Eastwood classics that this movie might even be more enjoyable for you, as it's rumored that Munny is simply an extension of some character he's played in the past. After finally getting around to seeing this one, I will most definitely go out and educate myself in this genre.Let's face it, Eastwood is William Munny...he just is. It's hard to even fathom anyone else in this part simply because Eastwood is so damn convincing and undoubtedly helped by the immense experience he's gained over the years playing similar parts. The audience needs no convincing of his character. Although simple, a very powerful performance from an actor that holds enormous screen presence. Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman also deserve recognition for their performances. Overall, a great cast.The true strength in the film, besides Eastwood's character and acting, is the story. Quite simple, it is, but also extremely effective. A old, bad man comes out of the woodwork to do one last job to help his kids get a good start by snatching some much needed cash. And haunted by the memory of his late wife, Munny questions his actions, knowing all too well that his wife would not approve if she were still alive. His deeds from the past have come back to haunt him, as he hears his reputation is still quite alive and well and is the entire reason he gets involved in the job in the first place. I loved hearing the stories of the man he used to be, giving glimpses of what we may get to see later in the film as his character progresses. It is also particularly humorous that Munny's memory of the past isn't all that great either, even though some of the events seem unforgettable. All because he was a drunk badass. As the story progresses towards it's climax, we get more and more hints that the satanically bad man Munny used to be is still somewhere under the surface, and is undoubtedly going to rise like a phoenix straight out of the ashes of Hell if he's pushed too far. And while the film progresses like the journey itself, slowly moving along establishing it's themes and characters, it all leads up to one hell of a climax. One for the history books. When it finally was all about to go down, chills literally went down my spine. But I don't want to spoil it for anyone.As a fellow reviewer previously mentioned, Unforgiven succeeds as a film and story because it does not try to preach a message or convey one about morality. The characters are who they are, and do things for their own reasons and ask no forgiveness. Whether it's right or wrong ain't got nothing to do with it, just like deserve ain't got nothing to do with it.Very highly recommended. A truly great film worthy of it's recognition. Bravo, Mr. Munny...errr Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>random thoughts on why you should watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler I recently saw mystic river and was struck by the similarity between these 2 films in terms of style. In unforgiven morality, good and bad, right and wrong, etc may be issues that are explored, but morality never impinges on the plot. The characters are oblivious. No Hollywood endings here. No moralising. Are the whores right to demand a killing ? Is Little Bill right to treat harshly anybody he suspects of acting on the whores' request ? The film doesn't make any decisions, it just narrates. The same for mystic river. Eastwood portrays (brilliantly, in both films) simply what actually happens, and leaves us to think about the 'issues' ourselves - if we must ! William Munny isn't necessarily right to kill (all) of his victims in this film, (they didn't all kill morgan freeman!) but he's going to do it anyway. Eastwood doesn't patronise us by over-labouring any of the themes or using obvious labels (in case we hadn't figured things out). When William Munny kills an already dying Little Bill, who pleads that he doesn't deserve this ending, Eastwood responds, "deserve ain't got nothing to do with it". Brilliant ! The film has a realism lacking from many other westerns, and from many modern 'action' films, in terms of death / killing. The Schofield Kid is clearly reluctant to kill, and when he does it is rather undiginified, and in his best scene after the shooting he is clearly shaken up by the whole incident and not interested in further gunfights. The film lacks some of the tension / suspense of the usual western shoot-out scenes. Everything happens like it should, quickly and naturally, without close ups or slow-mo. Brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid film with a classic western feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually have kind of a funny history with the film `Unforgiven'. I was in film school when this film was released and I had absolutely no interest in seeing it because I wasn't a Clint Eastwood fan, and I definitely wasn't a fan of the Western genre. Then when it was nominated for several Oscars, being the pretentious film snob I was at the time, I was so disgusted and later so outraged when it won the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars that I ceremoniously burned the toy Oscar statuette I had after the broadcast. Of course, I look back on the contenders for Best Picture now and think, `Well? it probably WAS the best choice' although I firmly believe that Altman deserved the award for `The Player'. -Possible Spoilers-Having dropped the art house pretensions of my youth, I embraced seeing `Unforgiven' the other day, especially after having watched `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' recently, and I discovered that it indeed is a good film. One of the main reasons I feel it is a good film is that one cannot classify `Unforgiven' as a revenge flick, or an action flick, just as one cannot definitively say who is good and who is bad. There is not one character that is completely good, or completely bad ? rather we as an audience are forced to vacillate between our determinations. Characters you think are sympathetic and noble turn out to be anything but. Even the character of the law cannot be easily determined ? even after the film has ended. The atmosphere has the feel of a classic western film, and there was not one point where I felt like I had to suspend disbelief in order to get through the film without an eye roll or two. The cinematography was very good ? sharp and beautiful. The only true complaint I had about the film was that it was pretty slow for the first half hour to forty-five minutes, but when the climax and ultimate conclusion is revealed, it's apparent that this was an intentional thing. Some of the dialogue was kind of lame and pedestrian, but if that's the only thing I have to complain about a film it's doing pretty well. I'm glad that as maturity settles in, I discover films that I have passed over for reasons I thought were valid at the time, but the older I get the more unreasonable they seem. `Unforgiven' is one of those films that I have missed out on for the past twelve years and while I don't think my life would have been altered had I seen it earlier, I can say that I'm glad that I finally saw it, and would recommend it to most.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented Unforgiven last week on DVD because surely a film that won best picture and best director has something going for it. I was surprised that this wasn't a blockbuster type of film, it was more of a simple story in a classic Western setting. It is a well executed film, the only real flaw seemed to be Clint Eastwood's acting in a few scenes. I'm guessing that if I was of the same vintage as people who grew up watching westerns this would seem like a tour-de-force, but as I've only seen a few here and there Unforgiven didn't particularly stand out for me.I liked it but I was a little surprised it has such a big reputation, and recieved the amount of awards it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a beautiful story this turned out to be. Taken that Unforgiven is the last Western that Clint Eastwood has done so far and is one of the best that he has ever made. As there has been a shortage of Westerns since the seventies it was good to see Unforgiven when it came along in 92 and much more rewarding that it was directed by Eastwood himself as well as starring in it also. I think this was really a goodbye message to all the Eastwood and western fans saying that I'm to old for this and this is me hanging my boots up. The story is about retired gunfighter William Munny who has a bigger reputation in the West than Hitler, as everyone who comes across his name had something to say about his past and not a bit of it was good. It felt that William Munny was really The Man with No Name who has now settled down and wanted to live his life peacefully as a pig farmer. I don't know whether these were really hidden messages or I am just talking a load of old tosh but when you watch it makes you think and I am really talking about the ending of the film where Gene Hackman who plays Bill is celebrating with his cowboy friends on the eve of them going out to find Eastwood and his men already remembering already that he has tortured and killed his friend Ned played by Morgan Freeman. When William Munny strolls into the bar and everybody begins to notice him you have this tingling feeling that The Man with No Name has just come in and is about to wage war like he did in his previous films. Obviously this is a different character and when Eastwood does make an appearance unannounced we get to see the William Munny everybody talks about throughout the film. It is an intense moment and he just does it with pure action hero written all over it. The Scene where Bill is lying on the floor and looking up to Munny with a gun pointing at his face and he says `I don't deserve this, I was building a house'. You see the don't care look in Munny's eyes and Bill says `I'll see you in Hell William Munny' and in classic Clint Eastwood style he just replies `Yeah' and I was just amazed and felt like I was watching him all over again the Spaghetti Western trilogy. It was just breath taking to see him like that again.The music score which was written by Eastwood himself is as beautiful as any film score is going to get and the cinematography and direction is just remarkable. This is the last great western made so far and everybody can try and persuade themselves that Tombstone and Open Range hold that title but I think Unforgiven is a brutal bittersweet western which was missing from the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not a work of genius. It is, instead, a very good genre-pic that has some outstanding acting. Eastwood does his thing, and the climactic shootout at the saloon is vintage stuff. Gene Hackman is brilliant, especially in the much-discussed scenes with Saul Rubinek and Richard Harris: Hackman segues from easy-going to murderous and back again effortlessly. The plot is simple, and takes its time, but every second is a treat. This film is not simplistic: one of the villains deserved to die perhaps, but the other certainly didn't, and the film conveys that to illustrate how indiscriminate death can be. Hackman's character is marvelously complex: a tough-as-nails sheriff who is nevertheless an inept carpenter. While capable of brutality, Little Bill also believes in law and order, and doesn't relish meting out punishment. Great acting, great writing, great score equals a classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could Clint go wrong the way he rounded up Richard Harris, Gene Hackman and Freeman Morgan to appear in his movie. A great cast to be sure. However it is not the best western ever made. A good movie but I would not put The Unforgiven in the same company with High Noon, Winchester 73, Stagecoash, The Shootist, Bend Of The River, True Grit, Duel In The Sun and other great westerns too numerous to mention. Apparently the moral of the story is it is not good to shoot Gene Hackman evem if he isn't nice.Child Protective Services would have hauled Clint off to the hoosgow for up and leaving his motherless younguns to fend for themselves as he rode off in his quest to right a wrong.Thank goodness for space age DVD technology and the blessing of quickplay that got me through the excessively long scenes of inaction and long moments of sparse dialogue in this motion picture.While I didn't find it necessary to forgive myself for renting The Unforgiven there is no danger it will be back for an encore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How difficult it must be to live and work as a nihilist, as the makers of 'Unforgiven' did. The Coen brothers, cognizant of the inherent ridiculousness of almost everything, ridiculed this idea in the Big Lebowski. "It must be exhausting!" the Dude comments in reply to being told that another gentleman was a nihilist. At any rate, what the Coens said in jest is also true in all seriousness. Nihilism is like a negative flow system, any addition (a person, for instance) to the system tends to be lost. In this light, that man is like the dying, evil robot in an action movie who triggers the self-destruct mechanism in his computer as the hero looms over his fallen prey. This is what makes them so rare, not even Nietzche was a true nihilist. But this movie is a definite example of nihilism, and this film's very popular exposition of that very unpopular philosophy is what makes it so remarkable.In the case of Unforgiven, the first comparison that springs to mind is the other great anti-Western of the day, Heaven's Gate. The lesson of Unforgiven, and its ultimate superiority to HG, is that audiences seek a simple and disciplined mode of storytelling. HG was overlong, overly ambitious and just plain over when it should be still been relevant.Unforgiven's simplicity lies in the constancy of its devastated landscapes, replete with ongoing violence and the threat of violence. In addition, at least one of its battles is a wholesale departure from conventional cinema gun battles, demonstrating realism and angry impulses in its dialogue as the battling gunmen trade barbs and even negotiate with one another through the fog of war.This is the second best Western I've seen (after Dead Man), the best Eastwood film on offer, and the only mainstream cinematic portrayal of nihilism that I've yet seen. You will not be pardoned for missing Unforgiven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent vision of revenge violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood directed, produced, and starred in this 1992's Best Picture Oscar winner, a western, to put it simply, about human nature in response to violence. The genre has served Eastwood and those filmmakers he has worked with in the past well for such themes.Oh yeah, PLOT SPOILERS AHEADThe film's climactic encounter is simply amazing to watch as a viewer, but also has a lot going on in regards to the achievement of Munny's revenge. The lighting, pacing, and dialogue, of which I would love to quote the entire scene right here, are brilliant. Then you have William Munny, seeking revenge, who has become the feared man he once was as soon as he silently steps into the saloon. He now has, in contrast to the rest of the entire film, poise and presence - he is ice cold, remorseless, and moves with purpose. How does he succeed in such a disproportionate act of revenge (6 deaths for 1)? According to Peter French, an admirer of the western genre and author I learned a lot from, he has achieved a sort of self-conferred state of grace, resulting from the combination of whiskey, ruthlessness, and the willingness to uphold the honor of his good friend, now on display in front of the building. I saw Munny as almost superhuman in this scene due to his level of luck and skill. Beauchamp, after witnessing the kind of scene he had only imagined with his own literary liberties, tries to document every detail of what has just happened.It is true that Munny's actions in the scene are similar to what he was capable of 20 years earlier, but there is a significant difference. He is not simply the vicious murderer who had `killed just about everything that walks or crawls at one time or another.' A virtuous, moral avenger has emerged - a side of himself that perhaps only his wife had ever known, and loved him for. Of the three scenes involving Munny and death in the film, this revenge for Ned is his only virtuous, heroic act. The first cowboy was killed in an ambush. The second, even more ingloriously, while sitting in an outhouse. In a way, Munny sees, or perhaps we can see, what happens to him throughout the film as relatively karmic. Before meeting his wife, Munny lived a different life as a different person. He tells his children early in the film when unable to even keep a horse still enough to get on that this is a punishment for `the sins of my youth.' He used to be quite cruel to an animal such as a horse. Later, while recovering from illness and Little Bill's attack, he claims to have seen the angel of death, and becomes scared of dying. His good friend is the one who ends up dying. Maybe, after taking up a job he thought may have been just, and helping The Schofield Kid realize how unfit he was to be an outlaw, and even after his vengeance at the end, William Munny is still `unforgiven' for all of his sins in his previous life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first viewing, your Hollywood conditioned mind will most likely try to see this as an 'stock-off-the-shelf' western. You might even think it is 'unremarkable'.Well, it just plain ain't. Clint Eastwood paints himself, (exceeding well at that) as a reformed, but still cold and conscienceless gunslinger, who seems to be in a struggle, keeping his evil side suppressed. You might even wonder, who the real William Munny is : The sober reformed farmer, or the kill-for-money gunslinger. Eastwood makes this Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation with absolute brilliance!Morgan Freeman (Ned Logan) plays his former partner and reluctant, unwitting tempter whose conscience is not so 'unbothered' by his past.Jaimz Wollvett is the Scholfield Kid, a determined wannabe gunslinger, of whom, Eastwood and Freeman are 'unfooled'. Freeman's performance in his instrument-of-the-devil role, equals the performance by Eastwood, in his role and pairs perfectly.Clint Eastwood directed this 'Brothers Kamarazov' like trio to perfection. The interaction between the three will draw your thinking in, with the mind set of the two experienced killers, and the naive, 'kid' whom they use. Gene Hackman earned his Academy for supporting role as the ruthless sheriff of a small Wyoming town, now on the lookout for hired killers coming to 'make good' on a contract. Paired off with a (terrific) Richard Harris performance ('English Bob'), with (Saul Rubinek) his personal, sidekick-western-romance-writer, whose comic-book type novel parallels the dialog of the film, forcing you to see how well this all star cast brings this western fiction to a living, breathing, heart pounding life of its' own.Unforgiven may be taken on the surface as a great Clint Eastwood western, if you let it. But see it more than once, and you'll see Clint Eastwood, the Academy Award winning director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One to watch for anyone who likes a good, solid western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For someone who isn't usually behind the camera, it seems that Clint Eastwood has directed one of the best westerns in years. Unforgiven begins as a remarkable look into the life of ruthless cowboy William Munny (Eastwood) . For most of the duration of the film, we can see that Munny's sorry life and resentful anger is leading to something, and by God it does. After over an hour of character development, Munny and his partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) set off with The 'Schofield Kid' too assassinate two petty thugs, who soon find themselves under the wrath of the three cowboys. While all goes well, and Munny and The 'Schofield Kid' collect the money from the assassination, Ned Logan is caught as he heads south, and killed by the local towns sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman). Munny soon finds out about the death of his partner, and sets off back to the town to take vengeance on the lawman. The ending of coarse, being the thrilling highlight of the film. If you're expecting a true western, with lots of gun slinging and Clint Eastwood's original cliché cowboy, then this should be one to watch for anyone who likes a good, solid western.Unforgiven won the 'Best Picture' award of 1992, and after you've seen it, you'll understand why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie AGAIN and it reminded me just how good it is. This week, I watched Once upon a time in the west, the wild bunch, hang'em high, and the magnificent seven. I gues I was on a western kick. Then I watched Unforgiven and it is so high above these movies. The only reason I'm making this post is because of the people who discredit this movie because of the so-called "Hollywood Ending". This movie ended perfectly!!! Those of you who think otherwise have missed something HUGE about this movie and possibly many other westerns. The end is about the myth, the stigma, the aura, and the legend of a notorious cowboy/gunslinger who reverted back to the drink and to his old ways to slay the men who killed his friend. He is supposed to come away unscathed!!!!! The whole movie talks about how he was and how his wife cured him of his old ways, etc.. Then there is a reason for him to SHOW us who he was. It's not like they just threw in the ending for the hell of it.......................those who criticize this need to re-think their point-of-view. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically it's not but metaphorically speaking it is. Look at it this way, this movie takes place in 1880 almost 20 years after the civil war had began and this movie was released a little more then 20 years after "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly." The movie is about a retired gunslinger who is brought back into action. In his performance Clint Eastwood combines a little bit of all his famous western characters but perhaps the most notable is The Man with No Name.Look at it this way: In this movie William Munny is a bad farmer.Hint #1-It can't be Josey Wales cause Josey was a farmer to begin with.Hint #2-It can't be the high plains drifter because that guy was a ghost or something.Hint #3-I doubt it's the pale riderHint #4-Chronically For A Few Dollars more is the last picture and in that movie The Man with No Name said he was going to retire once he captured Indio.BINGO!RETIRE?!?! William Munny is A RETIRED GUNSLINGER!Anyway, this movie falls into the same category as Josey Wales and Pale Rider as the UN-traditional Clint Eastwood western. Still while this is a great movie Josey Wales is still ahead of the game in the UN-traditional category.***out of****starsA little side note: Like me, the academy obviously noticed that metaphorically this is the fourth installment in the Man with No Name series. So I guess the academy was so ashamed of not even nominating The Good, The Bad, and The ugly back in `67 that 3 out of 4 categories that this movie won for are three categories that The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly deserved.Best PictureBest Director (Sergio Leone)Best Supporting Actor (Eli Wallach)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Gothic western masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea how many times I've seen the outstanding and fantastic classic "Unforgiven" during my life but I can assure this is a film I've watched over and over again and surprisingly - even though it's nowadays more than a familiar movie - it gives me something new and fresh to chew on every time I see it again. It clearly is a flawless film in every way so it's interesting to observe how it's illogically always getting better! Western was already a dead genre in the 80's so the strange fact that western movie won Academy Award for the best picture in the 90's was miraculous. It meant that only one man could be responsible for it: my favorite actor/director Clint Eastwood who's practically been in all the greatest westerns of every decade. He was the stylish star of Sergio Leone's phenomenal Dollars trilogy of the 60's, he directed breathtaking classics "High plains drifter" and "The Outlaw Josey Wales" in the 70's and ruled in the role of the preacher in the magnificent "Pale rider" in mid-80's. And finally there's the wonderful "Unforgiven" of 1992 - the last true western.Actors are dazzling. Of course aged Eastwood playing one of the greatest roles of his career as William Munny ("I've killed women and children. I've killed everything that walks or crawls at one time or another. And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill") as well as Gene Hackman who's excellent performance as sadistic Little Bill Daggett gave him his inevitable Oscar. Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris are splendid too but Jaimz Woolvett's fabulous Schofield Kid ("I'm a damn killer myself except I ain't killed as many as you because of my youth") is unquestionably one of "Unforgiven's" most memorable characters. He's so marvelous in the role (I have no idea how Munny and Logan can be so bloody patient with him since his such a dumb and infuriating pain in the ass!) I really wonder why didn't he turn out to be a bigger name. Even the actors in a smaller roles are great. (Saul Rubinek as terrific Beauchamp...) Violent, dark, cruel and even Gothic western that shows the beauty of ugliness. Definitely a spectacular, timeless masterpiece worth 10 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>Traditional?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersWhen I first saw this film, I was disappointed. I kept hearing about a new addition to the long list of great Westerns. Well of course I was less than satisfied because this is not a traditional Old West flick. There are no clear-cut bad guys or good guys, or the usual stock characters. So when I was channel surfing one day there was nothing else on, so I gave it another chance. Good thing, because now I understand where this movie is coming from. It's not traditional at all, and that's a good thing.Don't get me wrong. I love the old Westerns in all their glory and predictability. They really hit the spot when you want to see the good guy (or even an anti-hero) win. But this film is more realistic than those beloved, heroic, tales of frontier justice. Here the violence is real, dirty and cheap. (SPOILER) I mean how far away from the usual Western can you get than a Clint Eastwood played character killing a wounded man as he lies helpless on the floor? But it is this lack of stereotypes that makes these characters so interesting. There is an underlying turmoil to almost all of them, from the obvious conflicts of Will and Ned, to the more subtle. The head prostitute sublimates her rancor for men through this mission of `justice'. Compare her to the actual victim of the slicing and you see a more subdued portrait, especially in the scene where one of the cowboys brings a horse for her. The scene is important because it brings to the forefront the nature of violence. The cowboy is the friend of the knife-wielding culprit, but (even though he is implicated) really had little to do with the actual crime and it's patent that he feels badly about the incident. He can't fully condemn his friend, because he must still live and work with him, but he does what he can. The look on the victim's face, and the volatile reaction of the angry head whore, bring out the inevitable fact that they will be unwillingly dragged into the realm of violence.It is easy to consider Sheriff Little Bill as the antagonist, but is he really? He is draconian for sure, but he does seemed focused on maintaining law and order in his town. The fact that his methods are skewed aren't the problem, it is his own understanding of morality. The fact that he does comprehend justice, makes him all the more invidious and subsequently all the more complex. English Bob does more than provide a display for Little Bill's ruthlessness, he provides a contrast to the reluctant killer that is Will (cautiously made so by showing his kids and a clearly presented embellishment of the actual crime). He also provides much of the film's best dialogue, including an acidulous account of American culture culminating in the irony of his `goodbye to savages' speech. Excellent work by Harris.Turning the traditional Western is not new, as was demonstrated years earlier in `The Wild Bunch', but that doesn't mean that it can't be done well. This is a movie for the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant film, surely the best work of director Clint Eastwood. "Unforgiven" makes us question not only the natures of good and evil, but whether those terms are even relevant in explaining human actions. There is not one character in this film who is truly good, so where should our sympathies lie. Who's the "good guy". All of the major characters are shown in a more of less sympathetic light. Little Bill, who is in some ways the most evil character in the film, can also be seen as the one character who is most consistently on the right side of right and wrong. I don't see any real villains here ... nor any heroes, just an existential landscape in which all of the characters seem propelled by forces larger than themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the final gunfight occurs in *Unforgiven*, the audience "gets what they wanted." The brilliant psychological twist of this film is that Eastwood's character resists the simple solution guns offer, while the audience is increasingly anxious to see him kill. We are as implicated in the violence as in Hitchcock's masterpieces exploring the same audience ethics, *Psycho* and *Rear Window.*One of the ten great westerns, with *The Wild Bunch*, *Jeremiah Johnson*, and *The Searchers*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never was a big fan of westerns. I watch these kind of movies rather rarely, actually the last western i saw was about half year ago, The Quick and the Dead. So i wasn't looking forward to this as i usually do with other movies. The only reason i wanted to see it was because it got a few Oscars, and i am always interested in award winning movies, and because of Gene Hackman, a great actor.In the end i was surprised to discover a movie different than i expected. It's not actually a real western, it just happens in the West and in the past, but that's it.William Munny, played by Clint Eastwood, used to be one of the most feared killers in the West. After he got married he managed to change, and now he's living peacefully at his house, together with his 2 kids. But with no wife - she passed away. The plot: 2 guys cut a hooker in a small western town, and the prostitutes decide to offer 1000 dollars for the ones who will kill the agressors. Munny, together with his old partner Ned, played by Morgan Freeman, and along with a "kid" who also wants the reward, decide to kill the 2 guys.It's not a classic western, as i said, although it happends in the west and it's with cowboys and small towns and shootings and rewards. Many elemnets are missing. The honor doesn't worth anything. There isn't such thing, you don't get to see guys who don't shoot somebody because that somebody doesn't have a gun. It doesn't matter: you want somebody dead, you kill him, no matter how. You don't get to see duels with 2 gunmen taking a few steps back and taking their guns out in the same time. You don't get to see races or rides on horses or stuff like that.The movie is about William Munny and his struggling with the "old" him, the cold blooded killer. He decides to do one more bad thing, the final one, just because he needs the money to offer his kids a better future. A good premise to do a bad deed. Once he's on the road, he starts changing back to the way he used to be. I liked this movie especially because there are no good guys. Everybody's a killer, everybody has cruel intentions, and did some bad things in their lives. The intrigue is set by some hookers, who offer the reward to kill the 2 agressors. Munny and Ned are old killers. The sheriff, Little Bill (Gene Hackman) is a bad cruel man who doesn't care about anything. And with all this line-up of crooks the movie manages to hold on and not show us any murder til the final minutes. Good surprising performance.You can never escape from what you are. That is a fact and that's proven through William Munny. Three quarters of the film we are introduced to this character and although we KNOW he's a bad guy, who used to kill people for nothing, we get to see him as the good guy. Despite his unexplainable horrifying deeds we support him, and we fully understand him at the end of the movie. When he returns to the monster he used to be.Another strong point of this film is the great acting. Clint Eastwood is great, but Gene Hackman is better. He totally deserves his Oscar. Here it's a paradox. The script for UNFORGIVEN was written in the 70s. Many production companies turned it down. Even Gene Hackman originally refused any contact with this movie. And in the end he won an Oscar for it.All in all this is a MUST for all movie lovers out there, whether you like westerns or not. Just don't do the stupid thing of missing this one.</fullReview>

My favorite part about this movie is the fact that there are no heros. little bill and william munny are very similiar, both have a ruthless streak. The only thing that separates them is the fact that Little Bill happens to be a law man and the fact that Eastwood's character is a step more evil than little bill. Little Bill is more evil than the duke of death and eastwood's character raises it up a notch from there. When he grabs the whiskey bottle, you know that he has just snapped. I can find few flaws with this film and can find something new to appreciate ever time I watch it, although the morality of the kid realizing killing is a bad thing was laid on a little thick. The entire film builds up to the last 10 minutes. During that last 10 minutes you will see the most purely evil, dangerous and frightful cowboy ever put to film. On a scale of one to ten on the evil/dangerous index: duck of death : 6 Little Bill: 8 William Munny: 11</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, I haven't seen every western out there, but I wouldn't expect to find one better than Unforgiven. I even prefer it to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.The movie is incredibly literate and character driven, qualities most westerns lack. Rather than focusing on action and gunfights, the movie concentrates on the motivations of its major characters - and to good effect. The result is probably a more accurate representation of the Old West than that portrayed in other westerns. In addition, the movie features fantastic performances from Eastwood, Hackman, and Freeman.Out of the close to 300 films I've reviewed at the IMDB thus far, I've only given eight films a 10 rating. Unforgiven is one of those films. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, even people who don't normally like westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has always been really good with a gun. We saw him in westerns like "The good,the bad, and the ugly", "For a few dollars more" and many other westerns in which his roles as the man with no name was incredibly quick with a gun. He also played in the five "Dirty Harry" movies in which he was a cold-blooded cop and was once again pretty good with his gun. Yes, we could say that in addition to being a good shooter, Eastwood has always delivered strong performances. However, he has recently shown himself as being an excellent director as well. "Unforgiven" is his masterpiece. After a prostitute are badly beaten at the bordello of Big Whisky city, the two men involved in the crime are let free by the town's sheriff, Little Bill (Gene Hackman), with the obligation to bring a certain number of ponies for the prostitute in a certain amount of time to compensate for their crime. The other prostitutes are incredibly mad when they hear that the men are free as birds, that they get to walk without even getting a whipping for what they did to the prostitute. So the women decide to put a bounty on the men's head. 1000 dollars to whoever kills them both.  Money has always excited a lot of people and when the Schofield kid (Jaimz Woolvett) hears about it, he definitely wants to go after those two men. But he figures he might need a little help. So he goes to William Munny (Clint Eastwood), an ex-murderer who now lives on a little ranch with his daughter and son. William tells him he'll think it over but as soon as the kid leaves, he packs a few things, kisses his children goodbye, and goes over to his best friend's house, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). The two men decide to catch up to the Schofield kid and all three of them leave on the job.  In the meantime, at Big Whisky, a man named English Bob (Richard Harris) arrives in town ignoring the board at the entrance of the town that says you must leave your firearms at the sheriff's office as you arrive. Ignoring the sign, English Bob just walks into the city carrying. However he is caught red-handed by the evil Little Bill who gives him a severe beating for this and then locks him up behind bars. Little Bill did all this for he believed English Bob was there to kill the two men on which there was a bounty. I won't say anymore about the story so that you can have some surprises when you watch it. Eastwood, Freeman, Harris, even Jaimz Woolvett, all deliver strong performance in this violent western. But Hackman steals the show in his beautiful performance as the evil Little Bill Daggett and took home a well deserved best supporting actor Oscar. The cinematography is exceptional as well and Eastwood's excellent directing won a best director Oscar. The whole movie is one true gem and won the 1992 best picture Oscar but really deserved it. This is a movie that ranks up there with the best all-time movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie by Clint Eastwood. It is a classic Eastwood western, where there is no real good or bad people. They all have a varying degree of both in them. It starts off a little slowly but the story line keeps it altogether. In my opinion it is an anti-hero type film, meaning that the so called hero here is an ex-killer, that had been tamed by a woman that he fell in love with. Unfortunately she died a few years before, which leaves Eastwood to bring up his children on a farm that doesn't make enough money for them to live on. Circumstances force him to take a final job. This is where the movie really gets going. Great Directorship from Eastwood, he just brings the movie together.</fullReview>

Sounds like real life, sounds like a good movie... one problem, IT STINKS. Its NO fun to watch and it is just WAY too frustrating. Ninety percent (absolutely no exaggeration, ask anyone who's seen it) of the whole movie is devoted to showing how pathetic Clint Eastwood (and Morgan Freeman's) characters are. I got the idea in the first 10 minutes! I don't need another hour and half of clint eastwood falling of his horse and nearly dying because he was kicked on the ground a few times. How do movies like this and Dances with Wolves win oscars when all they do is feature their star getting his butt TOTALLY kicked for 3 hours, its SOOOOOO annoying! Give me Braveheart, Shakespeare in Love or Godfather Part II, those are real Best Pictures, this movie aspired for a lot, but it is just completely un-enjoyable to watch. **1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are about a million other reviews here. Sheesh.William Munny's name once rang through townfolk's ears like a lunch bell, echoing fear and panic. The William Munny of old was ruthless, drunk, and not afraid to break the taboo of killing women and children. But that was a long time ago, and William Munny was a very different man then. Fast forward eleven years, and Will Munny is a sobered, no-killin' hog farmer, trying to scrape together income day by day to put food in his lovely kids' mouths. One day, a feller by the name of The Schofield Kid comes riding up to him, asking if he is indeed the fabled William Munny. He mentions a US$500 bounty on the head of two no-good-sagnefragent-sons-of-guns who cut up a jezebel in the town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming. For the first time in God knows how long, his reputation is acknowledged by other men to his face, and That Old Feeling starts to come back. Willie starts to wonder if he's still "got it", which he discovers after a few missteps that he does, and off he goes to find some food money in the way of taking those two no-good-sagnefragent-sons-of-guns out with the aid of his friend of years prior, Some Black Guy played by Morgan Freeman. Those two have The Schofield Kid tag along on their journey on the Yellow Brick Road as they look for some cash and a little adventure.Meanwhile...English Bob is played by Richard Davis MacArthur. He comes arrogantly strolling into Big Whiskey (a town that doesn't allow firearms) with firearms. Bob isn't in the film for any other reason but to be shown as a notch in the belt of Little Bill, the town sherriff. It is established that Bob is damn good with a gun and is quite sure of himself but when confronted against Bill, he basically gets his ass Pony Expressed to him. This is supposed to get Bill over as a tough guy, a suitable challenge for the impending Munny.2 hours (not Real Time) later...William's oath that he is simply doing this bounty huntin' gig for the money is disavowed when his Black Friend is killed. He goes in to find the no-good-sagnefragent-son-of-a-gun who did this for the ultimate act of vengeance: shot in the head by a Spencer rifle. OUCH!I'm trying not to diagram the movie too much, but lemme tell you: I loved this film. And not for the killing, and not for Clint (although, Clint is alright), and not for the *GREAT* directing. This film works for the same reason The Godfather worked: when scraped to the core, it's simply the story of man who's personality and way of thinking does a backflip for the price of avenging a death. Bill wasn't vicious until His Black Companion was killed so needlessly. While shooting beside Schofield on the hill, the always-wincing Clint looked especially peaked when having to take out a struggling and wounded young man. At the Bathroom Incident, Munney Munney Munney Munney, MUH-NAY was reluctant to open fire on the unsuspecting. But when his Afrian American Chum was dead, this man, this simple man, this man so capable of absolute terror let go of his eleven year fasting. He unleashed the fire on the small town of Big Whiskey and went guns ablazin' into the night. His anguish for his beloved wife's death, his hatred of his former self, his despair concerning his family's near-poverty, all of his conflicting emotions gave up their fight, and The Beast Of William Munney was unleashed. While Little Bill Daggett may have not been Satan Himself, the act of using a human life (The Black Guy) as bait cannot be excused in any context. He was baiting Willie to come to his town, and he got Willie. What he did not expect was to be killed dead while laying on his back, begging for his life. He got what he killed for, but in William's case, no amount of bloodshed could have murdered his demons, and without closure for the killer, The Killings Of William Munney were unforgiven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As close to authentic 1800 drama as you can get.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films give viewers a chance to see multiple perspectives on the same issue. The Unforgiven was one of the few that did. It was quite violent and authentic in many ways. The terror and intimidation that is commonplace in law enforcement until just ten years ago can trace it's roots back into the era when frontier expansion was monitored with brutal behavior. Clint Eastwoods' role as a reformed outlaw turned bounty hunter give a chilling example of how the world just seems to be turned up-side-down when a single act of violence occurs. The values of the 1800 society portrayed in this film gave viewers the impression that terror was not the exception, it was the rule. Before public education was born in the 1900's to solve social problems like high crime and skilled labor shortages, one gets a fairly accurate glimpse of the 1800's reality of what type of conditions existed. Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman played their parts very well. Few could really criticize the way the film's director defines barbarian. Our frontier expansions of the 1800's were filled with brutal characters in every segment of that society. This film helps me celebrate how much this country has advanced since then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as "Saving Private Ryan" is the war movie to end all war movies, "Unforgiven" is the western to end all westerns. In the history of film, the "western" film genre has been one of the most violent. Senseless violence to say it more truthfully. Usually, there are bands renegades, a solo gunslinger, and a countless number of innocent fatalities. Some would say a western is filmed for violence for violence sake. The typical "western" usually represents the moral conflict of good vs. evil. Pushing further, the brother-genre of the "western" is the epic war film, which in moral terms is validated by the soldiers fighting for a certain philosophy, i.e. freedom, tyranny, religion. What has usually lacked in the "western", is a script that goes beyond the anarchic confines of the great plains, where a man or family is tested to fight for survival. That is until "Unforgiven" was filmed. I can only praise this films intention on a philosophical level. Clint Eastwood, who stared in and directed this film, has taken a moral standpoint against the type of films that brought him into fame. The beauty of this film and the reason it is potent is that there are no good guys or heroes present. It's intent is to show, through realism, the absurdity of glorifying the life of a gunfighter in the wild west. All the main characters are bad guys: the hit men, the rapists, the law enforcement. As a viewer, it is only by habit that one would side with Clint Eastwood, for in the characters actions they are all morally bankrupt. This film topples the pedestal that Clint Eastwood has stood on throughout his career. Conceptually, this film is a treatise on the consequences of pulling a trigger with the intent to kill for killings' sake. Of course, in the situations that surrounds these men, it is either kill or be killed, backed by the idea of self-defense. But this film has Clint in the role he has played so many times before, which is the roving hitman. Only this time we see the thoughts and reactions of a man who has killed more men on film than is imaginable. This time we also see his friends, his children, we know his history. All these things, which are usually left out of the plot, when considered helps us to dramatically understand the motives and react to the consequences that face a premeditated killer. What a courageous statement filmed by Eastwood!This film was decorated by the Academy Awards for it's wonderful performances by Hackman, Freeman, Eastwood,..the cinematography, screenplay, sets, and of course direction. This film has a vision. In my eyes it is Clint Eastwood's reflection on the genre he took to the heights and solidified his career. The western gunslinger seeks no forgiveness by giving death to another man because they all know that they have it coming,...kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and sad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that really stands out in my mind from when I went to see this movie was the two morons two rows in front of me. These guys started cheering when William started blowing away the lawmen of Big Whiskey. To me, this was the sad and sobering part of the movie: the Killer was pushed over the edge to relive his past despite what his dead loving wife had made him realize. His past 11 years meant nothing. He had not changed. He was the same as he ever was despite what the brilliant ray of goodness that was his wife had shown him.These idiots just didn't get it. It was not a time to cheer, it was a time to mourn.I also couldn't see Little Bill as the "bad guy." This was a person who was going to do whatever it took to keep law in his town. Should we look down upon someone who would punish others who came to town just to kill? I don't think so. Little Bill was right, he didn't deserve to die like that. Face it, if William and Ned hadn't come to town for the purpose of killing for money, Ned wouldn't have died. But, don't get me wrong, I didn't see Little Bill as the "good guy" either. There were no "good guys" in this movie.I guess thats what I like about it. It was different. I think maybe the only people you could cheer for were Anna (she seemed to rebound from being made into a jigsaw puzzle and maybe doesn't see herself as a monster) and the Kid (he was the only one who learned something). This wasn't a good vs. evil movie. It was what it was.Too bad those idiots in the theater didn't understand.</fullReview>

I think that "Unforgiven" has clearly earned a place in that select list, but I also think that NO movie will ever claim that oxymoronic title. Someday, somewhere, somehow someone (someone whose name is spelled M-E-G-A-S-T-A-R, just as all of his predecessors' have been) will revisit the genre and add another entry.

		<shortDescription>Elevates the western genre, and deconstructs it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven raises the Western genre to a new level of excellence. It shows that westerns are still a viable genre at the box office and that they will always hold a place in the hearts of the American public. Unforgiven also decontructs the western and shows that not all shootouts were honorable standoffs at high noon in the street. Most shootouts occurred in a bar with someone's back to the street and another guy shooting at him from a safe distance, or at point blank range. The heroes of the west were violent, drunk and vengeful men that would be looked upon with disgust today. Unforgiven shows us that the life of an bounty hunter was not a glorious one. When they kill the first cowboy, Morgan Freeman can't bring himself to do the deed. He's a changed man. He looks at Eastwood, the professional to finish the job. As the cowboy lays dying, we hear him shouting to his friends, and we see the looks on Munny and Logan. They've just regressed to a time in their lives that they don't want to revisit. Ultimately, Munny returns to his former way of life, in order to avenge the death of Ned. As he has Little Bill laying there, bleeding on the floor, we see just how cold blooded Munny is. "I don't deserve this, to die like this." says Little Bill. "Deserves got nothing to do with it." replies Munny. "I'll see you in hell." Munny just reloads the rifle and fires. He's already in hell. His dead wife changed him but it was to easy for him to return to his former ways. No heroics, no shootouts. Just men killing men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is a masterpiece, the achievement of Eastwood's career as director. I doubt anyone can direct a real western after this one.The whole American mythology created around the 1830-1890 period is visited by Eastwood and exorcised.Heroes are no more than lousy story-tellers, gunfighters must have glasses to shoot right and there aren't good guys and bad guys anymore : there are only human beings like you and me who kill for money or revenge.If the hero does survive in a fight, it's only because he's lucky and not because he's the good one.Eastwood created a crepuscular world much more impressive than Robert Altman's movie about Buffalo Bill (with Paul Newman).If you should have only one western in your DVD collection, buy "Unforgiven".And, of course, the other Eastwood movies as well !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing realism in a western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven distinguishes itself from the typical John Wayne-esque cinema that the past generation has adored for its romantic portrayals of rustic nobility. It instead offers us a totally enchanting story with developed, flawed characters. In Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the sadistic-turned-repentant William Munny, we see an aged family man withering away on a pig farm, widowed and emotionally barren. Through various techniques introduced quite intriguingly in the storyline, we find that he was once a cold-blooded killer, fueled by an alcoholic rage and disregard for human life. Instead of attempting to make us believe that he killed only bad men, the story characterizes him as a slaughterer of the innocent. Munny is haunted by demons with which he will certainly meet once he sheds his mortal coil. He knows it will come, but attempts to sidetrack his mind with busy work. When Munny again finds himself in a position to kill, he is reluctant, but then succumbs again to his alcoholic madness. This movie is loaded with dynamite performances, which gives the fabulous story an even greater appeal. Eastwood settles himself comfortably into the role of Munny, allowing us to travel with him in his trials of hopeful redemption and ultimate failure. Gene Hackman is utterly brilliant in his portrayal of Little Bill, the professional albeit evil sheriff of Big Whiskey. The added talent of Morgan Freeman make this an on-the-mark masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Great Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what has been hailed as the last great Western that will ever be made (though I recommend the recent "Tombstone" as well), Clint Eastwood proved that he is capable of creating a masterpiece. The amazing script, which slowly turns from what looks like any other decent western into an intricate study of morality and mortality and eventually, a message arises of the horrors of violence. Yet, it is Eastwood who truly does take this film up to the next level and then up several levels more. His bold, stylish camera work makes this film pristine and conveys every mood he wants to convey in every scene so that you could watch it with the sound turned off and still feel every emotion intended with every scene. Also, in front of the camera, Eastwood's performance is his greatest to date. He embodies William Munny perfectly. You see that he is a good man, a reformed and repented man. You sense the good that his former wife did him. And at the same time, you can almost feel those demons that used to rule him. The carries with him a brooding presence and you just know that this man has seen evil... he has been a part of it. The greatest struggle in this film, the suppression of carnal instincts, occurs within this man. And you watch that happen throughout the entire film, occurring all within him. Also, stellar performances by Gene Hackman (for which he won an Oscar), Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris maintain this films excellence. Also, Jaimz Woolvett delivers an emotionally dynamic performance as a naive young man, trying to prove his self-worth and maturity by trying to become the kind of killer Munny used to be, though the message is eventually delivered... what William Munny used to be is the opposite of self-worth and maturity. It was an animalistic and berserk nature that everyone harbors, and it is only through determination and courage that they can be overcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't get how this movie got so much praise. I get what they were going for, it's a throwback to the spaghetti western genre that Clint Eastwood became associated with, and it's out of his friendship with long time collaborator, Sergio Leone, but I think Clint tried a little to hard to match the genre. I can watch a spaghetti western at any time, and be entertained by the filming techniques used and macho attitudes of the stars, but with this movie, I watch it and find myself being bored stupid by it.So it seems like a good story, we've got a washed up criminal, played by Clint, trying to get back in the game along with a whiny little bitch trying to prove himself, and Clint's old partner, played by Morgan Freeman, who is undoubtedly the best part of this movie. Morgan can take a bad movie and make it watchable. Unfortunately, his characters death washed that down the crapper. The only real good part in this movie is the bar shootout at the end. That scene felt the closest to a spaghetti western, and was well executed. I also like how this movie was dedicated to Sergio LeoneMy beef with this movie comes with the cast. Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman are terrible in this movie, and all the female cast members are annoying as hell, and the fact that Richard Harris has 20 minutes of screen time. Also the grittiness of the genre has been replaced with sympathy, apparently, and that is not a good trade in a western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies and highly re-watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then you come across a film that you watch and at the end your jaw just drops and sits there in awe of what you just experienced. This is one such film.The story is not deep. A guy does some damage to a prostitute, which goes insufficiently punished and brings on the bounty that some people try to collect. The story is not that central to the movie, it is more like the canvas upon which the characters are painted and this movie is all about them.I wonder what if anyone else could have directed Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris besides Clint Eastwood himself. Well, either way, he did a hell of a job because this one of the best acted movies of all time. If acting was food, this would be a yummy cake made by angels, which only makes you want to eat more of it the more you eat it. Even the extras in this film are also really good, all of them.It is not just the actors but the characters they play that makes this film really interesting. Unofrgiven is the Western for the modern age with an accent on gritty realism. There is no hero or villain in a traditional sense. It is not about who can shoot well and therefore call themselves cool. Characters are not archetypes but people with realistic behavior and depth of character, with their own special quirks and weaknesses, especially the weaknesses. In fact, people's weaknesses is a theme this movie explores a lot: and strengths and how neither of those are what they may seem.The acting is great, the characters are great and the dialogue for them is great. The film has a few memorable quotes for the ages.My only issue is that Richard Harris does not get nearly enough screen time. He plays a clean guy with British civility on the outside and a deadly criminal core on the inside. The movie spends some time developing this character and in the end the guys does not do anything and is sent away shortly after his appearance.There is something really freeing about watching a movie like this where there are no bad or good guys but characters. Something about everyone just being human is just makes it easier.The movie is excellently shot. Being a western, it takes you to the pretty outdoors: the grassy plains and the snowy highlands. It feels quite cold and sobering. Having said that, there is nothing particularly innovative about the way it is shot, just good old quality and sense brought in by the experienced Eastwood.As for music, there is not much of it. There is some tension music, but the one memorable tune is a heartfelt central theme consisting of a lonesome guitar tune in memory of a character's dead wife.In short, I cannot find any real flaws about this film. This is rightfully seen by many as one of the greatest movies of all time and is highly re-watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven is perhaps Clint Eastwood's finest film. In this western, Eastwood plays the role of a once murderous outlaw named William Munny. Will is partnered by his old friend, Ned Logan, played by Morgan Freeman and The Schofield Kid, portrayed by Jaimz Woolvett. In a typical Wild West setting, these three set off to collect on a payment being offered by prostitutes in the remote town of Big Whiskey. To receive this payment, Will has to break a promise to his deceased wife of not returning to the man he used to be. Standing in Will's way is the law of Big Whiskey, led by the Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman). The Sheriff was a notorious lawman from Kansas who has experienced life, and has settled down in this quiet town to build a home. This movie is laid out brilliantly by the editor, and tells a story of corruption in this small town, and the history behind the man headed to Big Whiskey to make wrongs right. Unforgiven is based on the truth that a person will eventually get what they deserve. Set in a time were women are poorly represented by the law, the prostitutes in Big Whiskey are forced to take the law into their own hands after violence is brought to them. Unable to fight the corruption on their own, they put a bounty on those responsible for the crime. This brings assassins, killers, and lowlifes from all over to this quiet town. As the plot continues to thicken and crimes are committed, Little Bill is up against a wall to save his town from these assassins. Little Bill returns to the notorious lawman he once was, leaving the audience unsure of which side of the law he represents. Seeking desperate measures to rid his town of these outlaws, Little Bill captures one and uses torture to get information. This leaves no option for William, except to ignore his promises to his wife and return to the man he once was, leading this film into one of the most dramatic climaxes I have ever witnessed. These scenes, portrayed by the beautiful technique of this screen writer, added elements into the climax that audiences are not accustomed to witnessing. A dark, rainy, and quiet atmosphere leads the viewer into a heart pounding finale. Clint Eastwood is remarkable, as usual, and Gene Hackman plays a character we love to hate. With two brilliant lead actors this film, Morgan Freeman plays an awesome supporting role making his character, and this movie, unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listed as one of the best western films ever, unforgiven boast of a barrel of actors all making sure that their screen time is not wasted, Clint Eastwood is going to go down in the record books as one great movie maker because of this flick, the timing of the movie is just right at every turn, the movie plot is rich with enough events to keep you glued. The movie also boast of fine shots, I liked the cinematography of this movie and the thought of a bunch of washed out old men, just trying to get a wiz of victory again was just too much fun to want to pass off.It is third western to win a Best Picture award in the Oscars, and it is ranked fourth in the best American film in the western genre in the American Film Institute's "AFI's 10 Top 10" list.The initial concept of this film was conceived in 1976 but Eastwood delayed the project, partly because he wanted to wait till he was old enough to play his character. This was Eastwood's last western and it was a critical and box office success.The movie plot is about a town where the Sheriff 'Little Bill' (Gene Hackman) is trying to make sure that all is well and peace reigns, then some notorious cowboys go to a whore house and cut a prostitute.Little Bill implements justice in the way he felt best, but the prostitutes wanted to deal with the cowboys as they felt revenge is the best way to deal with the situation. Putting money together they placed a bounty on the cowboy's head, aging gunslinger and murderer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) heard about the bounty and decided to give killing one more go. Munny was a reformed man, who left the murdering life behind all because of the love he has for his young wife. But his wife is dead and Munny is struggling with farm life and the raisin of two children, so chasing after the bounty was a good idea to him so he called his old comrade Ned (Morgan Freeman) and they go after the cowboys.Unforgiven won four Academy Awards in its year, these awards were Best Picture (Clint Eastwood), Best Director (Clint Eastwood), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Gene Hackman), and Best Film Editing. Clint Eastwood himself was nominated for Best Actor, but he lost to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman.If you have not gotten a taste of this classic movie, maybe it is high time you did, Unforgiven is a wonderful movie to have in your DVD collection, the acting was second to known and the script was both funny as it was thrilling.www,lagsreview.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matchless Movie Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've given 'Unforgiven' ten stars because its comprehensive excellence in terms of directing, acting, screenplay, imagery, score, etc. all warrant this maximum rating. Director Clint Eastwood has throughout his career consistently been top-notch as both star and director, and he really accomplishes greatness with this film.The movie is set during a transitional time when the Old West is rapidly turning into the modern world, but this isn't the only transition it examines. Its main character William Munny, played by Eastwood, is an aging man desperately trying to lead a life that's worlds apart from the one he did in his youth. The film opens showing him struggling to do his best as a pig farmer in Kansas, a widowed father of two small children. His wife has been dead for years. We learn early on through what he tells his children and best friend Ned Logan, (played by Morgan Freeman), that she was the reason he turned from his old, destructive ways as a whiskey drinker and killer. But things are not going well, and when the snot-nose 'Schofield Kid' (self-named on account of his Schofield Smith and Wesson revolver), shows up to enlist Will's help to kill a couple of cowboys for money for cutting up a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey, he's faced with a decision. At first Will tells the kid that he can't do it, because he's not like that anymore; he's not the kind of man he used to be. The kid tells him that if he changes his mind, to catch up with him, and he sets off riding north. Will does his change his mind and leaves his two children at the farm, telling his young son, "You kill a few chickens if you have to; I'll be back in a couple of weeks. If you run into any problems, go see Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's." Ned goes with him, they meet up with the kid, and for the next hour we're shown painfully thoughtful examples of William Munny dealing as best he can with his increasingly disturbing inner conflict as he remembers the promise he made to his wife while facing the imminent reality of his agreeing to kill again. As the film approaches its wonderfully balanced climax of brutal poetic justice, we learn a great deal about the darker side of the human psyche, the bad even good people are capable of, and how the ugliness of self-realized hypocrisy affects different kinds of people. Morals, hopes, memories, dreams are all masterfully woven together into a tapestry of personal journey that's made all the more colorful by its eventual display of paradoxes, simple truths, ugliness and beauty. Gene Hackman is unforgettable as Big Whiskey's sheriff, Richard Harris shines once again in a brief but necessary role, and the other characters are just what they need to be. Nothing is wasted in this movie, and certainly neither was my time by deciding to watch it. In fact, I've enjoyed it 'Unforgiven' dozens of times, and each time I find myself amazed and delighted at how I'm able to appreciate something new about its simultaneously familiar and frontier-like genius. If you love good movies, I'm sure you'll agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one critically acclaimed film that deserves all of the awards it received. Unforgiven also put Eastwood back on top after a few not so well received pictures that came out previous to this . This is not a typical western as the western period is not really romanticised here. There are no good guys ( at least in the traditional sense) either . This movie has a lot to say about violence and its lasting effects . Clint Eastwood does not play his usual man with no name type, but a flawed, complex character. This is rounded out with a powerhouse supporting cast with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris .The tone of the film is dark and the direction and acting is rock solid. David Webb Peoples wrote a fantastic , original script and Eastwood made it work . Movies of this quality don't come along often and in my opinion William Munny is the character Clint was born to play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a kind of movie that is building up till the last five minutes. The present condition of will munny contradicts to the talked about past of him which is considered a fabrication by most of them in the movie except a few who has really known him.And even us sometimes. As you can never accept those stories of will's past life because it seems quite impossible for a man to do and yet become something like that how he appears. He never talks about his bravery nor confirms his acts of courageousness. He is not sure of what he has done. Yet when he is really challenged he shows them what devil of death he is. This kind of story puts you on hold till the last five minutes and as those minutes starts and what you get to see as climax your mind keeps saying awesome every second of it. I am really out of my words to praise for this movie and the kind of act everybody has put on. The film says the person who praises himself to be great is not great but the person who is praised by people is actually great. This is a must watch movie for everybody. I don't think there is or would be any movie like it.Clint Eastwood is always excellent in doing this kinda of underdog roles where he is always under estimated. I will happily give this movie 10/10 and more if anyway possible. A must watch. And when you have seen this want to see more of Clint Eastwood go watch Gran Torino. He never lets us down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven: An Entertaining, Enthralling and Essential Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood, the man famed for taking the western genre and claiming it as his own both before and behind camera, bows out with Unforgiven, the multi-award winning film which leaves a legacy that all who follow must answer to.It follows the journey of William Munny, a murdering thieving outlaw turned farmer brought back to his wicked ways by the prospect of a hefty payoff. He and two others set out to kill the men responsible for the mutilation of a whore, unaware of the peace-desiring sheriff struggling to retain order in a lawless world.A short text intro tells us that Munny's wife has died, her mother having disapproved of her marriage to an infamous bandit and cold- blooded killer. We next see Munny, an honest farmer eking out a living for his two children and himself, reformed from his ways by the purifying influence of his angelic wife. This establishes immediately Eastwood's character's devotion to the ideals inspired by this woman, ideals which run clear and present throughout the film. The incredible cast lends a superb advantage to the movie, Eastwood teaming with Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris (in a performance that, whilst amusing, seems rather irrelevant and overly delving for an ultimately insignificant character). Our three leads are on top form, each portraying an aging veteran of this rough life. The film is abound with morality: the questioning thereof; the ambiguity of its implementation; the justification of its subjugation. Eastwood's Munny is a torn character, divided between upholding the essence of betterment instilled by his influential wife and returning himself to his previous manners to allow the completion of his inevitably violent task. The burden of this upon him is entirely believable, and the sagacious lines and rueful phraseology serve to remind us of his inner torment. Hackman's sheriff is an equally interesting character, undergoing in many ways the same type of transition as Munny, the end result a wonderful finale to an entertaining, enthralling and essential film.Carrying all the positives of great dialogue, incomparable acting, Eastwood's direction, and a few laughs thrown in for good measure, Unforgiven is a fitting peak in a distinguished career of westerns. Deconstructing and reevaluating much of the gunslinging stoic masculinity postulated by its forebears, this is an incredible film, and an important one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>General Critique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is often the case when movies are made which reflect an earlier time, little attention is given to the ways of speech of the time being presented. In this case, for instance, several references are similar to the comment by one of the prostitutes where she says, Little Bill "kicked the s**t out of" your partner. This phraseology did not gain popularity until well after WWII, coming into use in the early 1950's.Note also that Eastwood's performance early in the movie leaves much to be desired when he attempts to show his incompetence at catching and sorting pigs, and in mounting a horse which had grown wary of riders. That is, his apparent clumsiness is an example of amateurish and unbelievable "acting."Overall, the movie is absorbing and amazingly different with wonderful cinematography and splendid acting by both Freeman and Hackman. Thank goodness Eastwood's "nose for a good story" didn't involve any writing by him since we've seen how inept he can be in such movies as "Gran Turino."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clintwood's Final Western 'Saga'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 'Unforgiven' Eastwood bids farewell to the Western genre and how does he do it? With a bang, by making what has become one of the finest films of its genre. Yet, 'Unforgiven' is much more than a Western film.There are plenty of subtle layers and while it has all the 'Western' ingredients it goes against formula by portraying more depth in both story and character. These men were killers but no formulaic hero. They did experience fear, confusion, doubt and sometimes were even sloppy in aiming their targets. It also shows what killing does to the killer. For example, The Schofield Kid initially sees it as something cool and heroic and he looks up to Munny but once he has blood on his hands, the burden of it sinks in and he would rather be 'blind and in rags'. Meanwhile, we also see Munny struggling not to go back, not to give in to temptation in order to honour his wife's memory but at the same time worry about how to provide for his children. Then there's Ned Logan who joins Munny to provide support but once they're on the mountains, he hesitates and backs out because he did not want to return to that. 'Unforgiven' allows the viewer to sympathize for both the killer and the dead.Eastwood finally gives solace to David Webb Peoples's long ignored screenplay. The dialogues are simple yet deeply philosophical and lyrical. The film does not move at the usual fast pace but that works in its favour and allows the viewer to enjoy the captivating landscape while accompany the three men on their mission. The subtle cinematography and score also work beautifully.All the performances are topnotch. Eastwood and Hackman perform with all guns blazing. Hackman always has managed to successfully play the villain and here he alters from being easy-going to cold-blooded and keep the viewer in suspense with his unpredictability. While on the one hand we want Eastwood's Munny to go back to his kids but at the same time kill the scum who cut the woman. He handles his scenes very well and then in the end the viewer finally sees that ruthless frightening killer rise to kill. Of the supporting cast, Richard Harris provides interesting comic relief, Jaimz Woolvett does a wonderful job as the Kid and Frances Fisher has a strong presence as the protective 'leader'.'Unforgiven' is simply a remarkable watch and this is not only restricted to lovers of western films. Eastwood has since made different kinds of cinema and has done a superb job especially with his recent movies. If he were to make another western today then I'll be ready to go and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real western that is anti-western at the same time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is of course a true western-legend and with this movie he is paying tribute to the genre, as well as saying goodbye to it. Westerns now days are just not as popular anymore and besides, Eastwood was of course also an aging actor already at the time. This movie got made at the right time and is a great swansong for Eastwood within the genre that made him star. What "The Shootist" was for John Wayne, "Unforgiven" is for Clint Eastwood.Besides playing the main character, the movie also got directed by Eastwood himself. It was the movie that really launched his directing career and he even won an Oscar for it. He had already directed multiple movies prior to this one and also some quite good ones as well but for some reason he was never really taken serious enough as a director by the main-stream audience.Eastwood made this movie in the 'old fashioned' way, which no doubt he learned to do from working with Sergio Leone, to which this movie got also dedicated. The movie has all of the usual and right required western ingredients present in it but yet it also manage to give the movie a more of a fresh feeling and look over it.It's also really due to its approach and concept that this movie works out as a refreshing one. Even though it has lots of the westerns clichés present in it, the movie actually succeeds in it to turn things around. The line between the good and bad guys are being blurred and no one is a true gunslinging hero in this one, who blasts his way through town. It makes the characters of the movie work out outstandingly. The movie chooses to be more realistic but not without staying truthful to its genre. It's a western as well as an anti-western at the same time because it debunks so many of the usual western traditions.It's not necessarily a spectacular or exciting movie but the movie is being carried by its characters and its perfectly cast actors. Because of this the movie becomes a real compelling one. As expected, Clint Eastwood is really in his element as a reformed, aging, former tough gunslinger. He is being accompanied by actors such as Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris. Hackman also won an Oscar for his role in this movie, that is being regarded by some as one of the definitive Hackman roles.The movie got only shot in 39 days but this doesn't prevent the movie from being a good looking one, with nice cinematography, sets and costumes, which all fits the genre and time period it got set in. It's a truly fine crafted movie, that also features a nice little musical score, partly composed by Eastwood himself as well.A fine good bye for Eastwood to the genre, to which he owes basically his entire career.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notoriously Vicious And Intemperate Disposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the fine westerns that have come out in the history of film, Unforgiven is only the third one to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Following in the steps of Cimarron and Dances With Wolves, Unforgiven finally got Clint Eastwood the Oscar recognition for one of film's great icons. It's also one nasty and uncompromising look at the old west with people neither all good or all bad, usually reacting to the time and circumstances they're in. And the reputations they've had built for them by the various dime novelists whose work littered the land during the last half of the 19th century.A former border raider back in the wild days of the Civil War, Clint Eastwood's William Munny is our protagonist. He gave all that up and got married, fathered two kids and has been living peaceful and quiet as a farmer. He's also given up the drink, because it was demon rum which helped him overcome a whole lot of inhibitions about violence.But a few states over, a cowboy being told about his shortcomings from one of the town tarts, decided to cut her up. After doing so, he fled to the safety of the ranch he works for. Town Marshal Gene Hackman, also a violent man in the past tries to play the whole thing down. But the women raise a bounty in the only way they know how to take vengeance on behalf of a colleague. One of the great examples of women's liberation in the old west.News of it is carried to Eastwood by old friend Morgan Freeman. Reluctantly because he does need the money, Eastwood, Freeman and young gun Jaimz Woolvett decide to go after it.Gene Hackman won his second Oscar to go with his one for Best Actor in The French Connection. His town marshal is another uncommonly vicious man who now that he is on the side of 'law and order' has some grand pretensions about himself. It's also a fascinating look inside the character of someone like Wild Bill Hickok or Wyatt Earp and what it probably took to keep 'law and order' in frontier towns. It was a well earned Best Supporting Actor performance.Part of the reason some folks in frontier America have the legendary reputations they do is the fact of those dime novels I mentioned before. Ned Buntline, the leading purveyor of this literature made the reputations that so many frontier icons have today. One of the most interesting roles in the film is that of Saul Rubinek who is such a novelist.When we first meet Rubinek he's traveling with English Bob, played by Richard Harris in another fine performance. Hackman who knows of him and knows he killed a friend of his way back when, takes it on himself to expose and thoroughly humiliate Harris. He then takes on Rubinek as his scribe because he fancies the kind of reputation that Earp, Hickok, and Bill Cody et al are now enjoying.Of course in the end when Clint delivers a bloody reprisal to one and all, Rubinek who now has seen such a scene of death and destruction that is having a lot of second thoughts about his profession. It's my favorite role in Unforgiven.Unforgiven in addition to Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Hackman got Clint Eastwood his first Oscar in the Best Director category. He's won two of them now also for Million Dollar Baby. He was up in the Best Actor category, but lost to Al Pacino for Scent Of Mystery. Unforgiven won its fourth Oscar in the Editing category.Unforgiven isn't John Wayne's kind of west, but it's a fitting climax for Clint Eastwood in the genre that launched his career. I don't think it's an accident he's not done another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective debunking of the western myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is one of those films that garnered a lot of hype and critical praise when originally released. However, it really deserved it. Its a powerful and intelligently written "anti-western", possibly the most effective one since the heyday of Sam Peckinpah. Ironically, for a film that debunks much of the western myth, its much more faithful to what the so-called "Wild West" was originally like - occasionally violent and exciting, but more so uneventful and desperate. I can see John Wayne hating this film, which is exactly why its a masterpiece. Even if you don't like westerns, you'll enjoy this one.One of the reasons why it works so well is because of the cast. Clint Eastwood is always a compulsively watchable screen presence, but hes given a really complex character to work with. Its possibly his best acting job. Gene Hackman, an actor who hadn't been truly great in many years, also does great work as the sheriff. Even Morgan Freeman, an actor I usually have little time for (since this, hes played the exact same character in every film it seems), impressed me with a more quiet and subdued role. Eastwood is a director I often don't care for (his films are usually too moralistic and manipulative), but he does a really good job here, probably because of the powerful screenplay. "Unforgiven" is considered a masterpiece for the simple reason that it really is one. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my Top 5 Favorite Movies Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is such an amazing film! First of all let me just say I am still pretty young, so you will probably laugh at what I'm about to say, but I consider Unforgiven to be Clint Eastwood's best movie! It's truly a masterpiece, and when you add Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman into the mix, you know it's gonna be a good film! I look at Unforgiven simply as this, A man who has turned away from a life of Violence, and he is looking to raise his kids and remember his wife who has passed away... When a Gentleman known as the Schofield Kid shows up and offers Munny (Eastwood) a chance to split the reward of a violent act, he decides to go, but only if he can bring his best friend Ned (Freeman). Well in a dramatic turn of events, Munny is forced to once again become the man from his past, who he swore he would never become again!My favorite scene of the movie is when Munny goes to see Ned and tells him about what they will be doing and why, when Eastwood rides up on that horse, and Freeman sees him, I get goosebumps...I totally recommend Unforgiven if you've never seen it! 10 of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curse of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Munny (Clint Eastwood), a former violent gunslinger, has turn his back to his former life after he married his young wife. But his wife is now dead and, struggling for a leaving in his two children, he accepts, along with his former partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) to follow the Schofield kid to the town of Big Whiskey to kill two cowboys. They have assaulted a prostitute but the sheriff, Little Bill (Gene Hackman), let them go and the prostitutes have put a bounty on their head. Among other killers heading to Big Whiskey is English Bob (Richard Harris), a legendary gunslinger, followed by his biographer Beauchamp.Often described as an anti-violence western because it depicts it realistically (see the vicious beating of English Bob and then Munny by Little Bil or the long agony of the first cow-boy shot by Munny), "Unforgiven" also examines the consequences of violence, both at the societal and individual level. Just like so many other small towns in so many other westerns, Big Whiskey symbolizes the transition between the Wild West and Civilization with Little Bill as the main civilizing force. He is a violent man but he uses violence for what he considers a greater cause, the civilizing of Big Whiskey. But who lives by the sword dies by the sword and Little Bill's violence only generates more violence. The central metaphor there is the house that Little Bill is trying to build but that is all crooked and leaks from everywhere every times it rains. The same way, a civilization build on violence is bound to fail. When Little Bill is killed by Munny, this is a fate he has called upon himself.The movie makes clear that Little Bill is the rule, not the exception, and that a whole culture of violence impregnates the young America. The action takes place a few day after the assassination of president Garfield. English Bob used to work for the railroad companies, the great symbol of civilization in many westerns, to kill Chinese workers working on the track. The Schofield kid is so obsessed with violence, adoring ruthless killers like Munny, that he named himself after his gun and pretends he has killed many men.At the individual level, violence has totally destroyed Munny. He keeps repeating that he has changed since he married his wife, but he is too insistent, like he is trying to convince himself. He is the one shooting the first cow-boy. By contrast, Ned could not do it and the kid gets sick after his first kill. "I'm not like you", he tells Munny. When Munny comes to the town to avenge Ned's death, we have the sense that we are seeing the real William Munny, a cold-blooded killer without remorse nor pity shaped, possessed and forever doomed by violence.Another theme of "Unforgiven" is the deconstruction of the western myths, often build around the idolizing of violent characters like English Bob. His biographer, Beauchamp, just like Hollywood later, is writing his legend through a romantic account of Bob's life. None of that is true as Beauchamp is astonished to learn through Little Bill. Yet, Eastwood resuscitates those myths for the climax: when Munny comes to town for revenge, it is Eastwood playing the Man with No Name one last time, the invincible gunslinger with almost supernatural abilities. It is an evil version of it, a malevolent half-god that nobody even dares to shoot out, yet, even after all the movie has told us about violence, instead of being repulsed, we're in awe: this is Eastwood addressing our own fascination with violence.Served by uniformly strong and by Eastwood's wonderfully understated direction in the grand tradition of Hollywood golden era directors such as John Ford or Howard Hawks, "Unforgiven" is a powerful coda to the western genre, Clint Eastwood's definitive masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautifully photographed, exquisitely staged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not a western, it's a folk-story. It's not about a legendary outlaw, its about how legends are made.Eastwood is very careful to photograph the story as naturalistically and as highly detailed as possible. With the intentional exception of Richard Harris as the would-be-legend English Bob, he has carefully directed the actors to avoid traditional cowboy movie posing. The people here walk as people would, they fall down as people would, they die as people would, anywhere, anytime.There is one exceptional moment to this, when the outlaw rides out of town at the end (I won't reveal how or why he gets to this point). He rides off into a foggy rain, face obscured by hat, hunched over, gun in hand, while an ominous minor-key melody plays softly on the soundtrack. It doesn't remind us of a '50s Western so much as of a '50s monster movie, like "Beast from 20,000 Fanthoms"; and that's as it should be, because we are here reminded that the exceptional situation that the town citizens have allowed to develop has fomented, to their minds, an incomprehensible experience with violence; and for them, the outlaw has indeed acquired the stature and force of some monster, something wholly other than the drunken cowpokes who started the whole fiasco, or the brute of a sheriff trying to outlive his own violent past. Neighborhood bullies just do make sense in a sad way, they allow themselves to use our own virtues and weaknesses against us. Mass-murderers remain beyond the ken of the everyday, even when they make such a poignant effort at reform as the outlaw does at the beginning of this film. (We are reminded three times that the outlaw's worst crime in the past was a killing spree during a train heist resulting in the deaths of women and children.) Who is this guy? is he simply a cold-blooded killer? why was he willing to reform for the woman who loved him? Is he simply out for revenge, or is he sincerely trying to right a wrong? We'll never know, of course; and in that lies our own tragedy. We want the world to be simple; but it is we who are so impossibly complicated.A beautifully photographed, exquisitely staged remark on the source of all myth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch Unforgiven I am struck again by the quality of the film. Lists of things or arguments about the "best-evers" can get tedious, so call this a personal matter: this is the best Western I've ever seen, the best Clint Eastwood film I've ever seen and, frankly, the best film out of Hollywood I've ever seen. Why? Because in Unforgiven, Eastwood takes what was by then the very tired old genre of the Western and re-invigorates it, bringing back the spirit of Shane and Stage Coach and Rio Bravo and even, of course, his own earlier work like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and High Plains Drifter. Except that, in a film as naturalistic and sophisticated in its thinking as Unforgiven, it gets raised, in my opinion, to a level it had not reach before.Eastwood manages this by a comprehensive process of deconstruction and re-creation: of the myth of Clint Eastwood as a hard man; of the myth of the gunfighter; of the myth of good and bad guys and the hats they wear; and of the myth that either your heroes are perfect and good or they aren't heroes at all.I will not spoil the film for those yet to see it, suffice to say that the action is happy to move over vast distances, with beautiful shots of the great American country, and is yet focused primarily on one small community. And this community includes cowboys and prostitutes, sherriffs and gunmen, bartenders and bounty hunters in a humane mix of attitudes, emotions and principles that is richer than anything, I believe, that the genre has attempted or achieved before.It is a film that makes you think it has deconstructed the genre and yet, at the end, leaves you with that peculiar walking-on-air feeling that you only ever got as a youngster when you walked out of the theatre. It isn't always easy viewing, but it's always great viewing, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last masterpiece of a dying art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Western' was dead. Then came "Unforgiven". A genre came back from extinction. Now it's dying again... and I don't think even the brilliant "Open Range" can stop it. Sometimes it's better to let go.In "Unforgiven", Clint Eastwood let this go for the last time by making one of the greatest films in the 90s. He used all his experiences, repertoiré and passion for Western movies while making this. It turned out to be his best work to date, offering a beautiful insight and thought-provoking philosophy that no other Western did before. His film is not only about skillful and indomitable gunslingers and entertaining gun-fighting sequences, its also a gripping character drama... about revenge, redemption, righteousness and humanity. It even asks us why we take pleasure in watching Westerns."Were you scared sometimes, Will?" "Can't remember; I was drunk most of the times." Sometimes the screenplay just pierces you. All the characters... Will Munney, Little Bill, Ned Logan, Schoeffield Kid, spoke some simple yet brilliant words that one can easily relate to. The characters were written with mastery, especially of course Will Munney. And Eastwood delivers his ultimate passion for the character. Somehow it seemed like his portrayal of Munney is just an aged reprise of all the celebrated Western gunslingers he ever did. Gene Hackman won his much deserved Oscar for his multi-dimensional role of Little Bill. And I say once again, Morgan Freeman remained once again the quiet performer... his Ned Logan too deserved much honour.'Westerns', once again, are not a relevant movie genre today. There are excellent new styles constantly being developed, why look back? But "Unforgiven" is a brilliant Western and a brilliant drama. Now character dramas, I hope, will never be a dying art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transformation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film because you can look at it in two ways.In one way you have William Munny, trying to be a changed man escaping his past, doing one last killing just to get out of the gutter, but just because he's doing this killing doesn't mean that he's the same as he used to be. Eventually he reverts back to his old self and becomes the bad-ass he once was.The other way of looking at it is, Clint Eastwood, trying to make one last western, but just because he's making one last western doesn't mean he's going to make it like the old Sergio films. The first 3/4 of Unforgiven is totally different from other westerns, most of the dialog is about how you can't walk into a room and kill five people, it is an anti western, but slowly it transforms back into an old school western, Eastwood even starts to move like the old Eastwood: Crawling away after a beating, the no look kill of a groaning guy on the floor, spinning around and putting his foot on the gun of Little Bill.Watch the movie like this and you will see that the transformation of William Munny into his old self is paralleled by the transformation of Eastwood into his old self.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good western starring Clint Eastwood who plays William Munny, an ex-robber, murderer, drunk and a few other wicked things that we could call a man. It starts off great. In the beginning we see the act that triggered the story's course of action. As it evolves we get to meet William Munny. We get to know who he is, who he was, who changed him.Then we get to know the town of Big Whiskey and it's rigorous boss. The parts of the film I found best were the actors that played along the side. Gene Hackman was great. One of my favorite parts of the film is the disarmament of "English Bob". It looked incredibly smooth. The hard boiled nature of Little Bill was shown very well in that scene.My joy was troubled by some of the dry dialog and the loss of the excitement and tension that gathered from watching Little Bill show off. What can I say, I enjoy elegant teasing instead the movie turned out more serious than I hoped it would.Generally it's a great movie with a lot of good scenes. My personal favorite is the one where William Munny comes back to Big Whiskey and whips the crap out of the towns cream once and for all......... +4/5 ........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is William Munny a man that was a killer, but changed drastically after getting married. Now that his wife has died and wanting to give a better life to his children,he goes in for his last stand.Even though he goes to kill because he needs the money being offered, he is a changed man. He is bitter, worn out, but does not hate because he is a redeemed man now in spite of a beating up from Little Bill (Gene Hackman). Morgan Freeman is his friend and there is a young man that calls himself 'The Schofield Kid' that rides along with them. Eastwood brings the somber mood of the spaghetti westerns and that is the problem I find with this film: too dark, after all even in tragic situations people find a way of laughing, remember "The Wild Bunch" all the guys laughing at the end. A very good western, but not on my list of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film simultaneously deconstructs the Western myth and reasserts our need to believe it. I think we have to be very conscious of our emotions as Munny walks into Greeley's for the last time. Look at the wonderful shot of his gun barrel entering the frame from the bottom of the screen. Listen to the thunder boom when we see him standing there. Notice how the unarmed man he shoots, Skinny, is the most detestable character in the film, and how we have no emotional investment in any of the deputies he shoots. Little Bill has tortured to death Will's best friend, an innocent man not capable of violence anymore. Everything is set up to either justify Will's rampage or for us to say, "Man, that's cool." I used to feel like Will left part of his soul in Greeley's, but now I think he was just doing what he did best. W.W. Beauchamp is a stand-in for the audience of all Westerns with his slavish hero-worship. He's just seen what was thought to be only mythical brought to life, and he couldn't be happier. And I think we'd be lying to ourselves if we didn't feel some of what W.W. does, too. Our fascination with violence, after all, is one reason Westerns became the trademark of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven...A Brilliant, Triumphant Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, this is the only Clint Eastwood western I've seen without the direction of Sergio Leone. But I am impressed with Eastwood's directing of this film. He took all of his experience as western figures and came up with an incredible western film, so incredible that he became an Academy Award®-Winner for Best Director &amp; Best Picture. Eastwood's age caused no problem for the film. The acting was inspiring and the gunfights couldn't have been better. Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood make a great team together, but Eastwood going solo proves himself to be unpredictable and is making me looking forward to future films with him as director and perhaps an actor, as well. Just as impressive as the Sergio Leone films and I wish Eastwood good luck in the future. We all can't wait for his next western. Bravo, Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest western ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Clint Eastwood masterpiece is most likely the most enjoyable and thoughtful western ever made.A conflicted ex-gunslinger takes one last job to aid his poor family. This film is not as action-packed as most westerns, but there is still the quiet and effective tension that is Clint Eastwood's directorial trademark. Gene Hackman makes an absolutely stellar performance as the hard-nosed but morally compromised sheriff, and Morgan Freeman is also solid as Clint Eastwood's conflicted former partner. All other actors are far above average as well. This film has a few very well done shootouts and a great deal of excellent low-key dialogue. It is also streamlined skillfully; if you view it, you will only see scenes that are absolutely relevant to the narrative.If you are a fan of the western genre, this film gets a 10.0 If you are not, this film gets a 9.0. Watch it either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plotting and directing set up the final act. A gunfighter who doesn't care about his life can concentrate on killing. It is rather easy to kill those who are scared, those who want to live. The character of the Schofield Kid was both overacted and not too realistic. I don't believe that his act of killing would have changed him forever. Also, if goofs are relevant, the Schofield S&amp;W revolver does not have a swing out cylinder. (Bill Munny swung the cylinder out to reload it). There are a lot of Westerns that are as good, but they have nowhere near the cinematic quality, and they do not feature other fine actors in vignettes (Richard Harris) and (Gene Hackman). My favorites included El Dorado, Rio Bravo, Stagecoach, True Grit, The Shootist, The original Gunfight at the OK Corral (Lancaster-Douglas), High Noon, The Outlaw Josie Wales, Cat Ballou, A Fistful of Dollars, Pale Rider, Treasure of the Sierra Madre,Ride the High Country, Any Hopalong Cassidy Movie, Any Roy Rogers Movie. I do not lock for excessive moralizing, just honest characters with moral standards appropriate to their position, very much like real rural life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my humble opinion, "Unforgiven" is not only Clint Eastwood's best film ever, but the best western ever made. It is unlike any previous western (you never saw John Wayne riding into town and killing almost the whole population!) except for maybe "The Wild Bunch". This is the only western I have ever seen (and I think I've seen them all) that shows the real consequences of violence. I think for that reason alone it deserves to be the greatest western ever.The scene toward the end of the film where "The Kid" and Will Munny are just outside of town, and Clint delivers his "It's a hell of a thing killin' a man" speech is without doubt, the finest and most dramatic moment ever seen in a western film. Clint's finest moment ever.I am delighted that the film received several Academy Awards. Clint deserved it. Clint Eastwood, in my opinion is an actor that has a body of work that is without equal in all of Hollywood. He has more classic films than any actor I can think of. And what else matters? Mr. D.

		<shortDescription>Well-done Clint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Shane," it's a rehash of the old reformed-gunslinger-tries-to-live-in-peaceful- retirement-but-is-finally-drawn-into-violence story. Clint has dabbled in "Shane". In "Pale Rider" he used the mysterious stranger, in which he saves a working community by means that are practically supernatural. He's even got a kid at the end yelling for him to come back as he rides into the sunset. Clint's character is superhuman, like Hercules, and it's a boring movie. Here, he deals with the other chief feature of "Shane," the frustrated attempt to keep his guns on the wall. The difference is all in the details. "Unforgiven" is a very good film. First, there is an effectively melancholy score, replaced during moments of suspense by an ominous rumble from distant thunder. Then, too, the photography is subdued, maybe too much so at times, but dazzling in an outside scene shot in the snowy mountains. The script gives the performers something to sink their teeth into, with only a few epigrams too many. But this is more than compensated for by some unexpectedly striking lines the characters are given -- "Seen her, Ned. The Angel of Death. She's got snake eyes!" (What a nightmarish image.) The characters themselves are -- all of them -- humanized. There isn't a truly bad person in the lot, just misguided ones, people whose judgments are sometimes wrong or wrong-headed. The Schofield Kid is a callow braggart who in the end learns that it's difficult to kill and gives away his pistol, which is an overly nice ending, too much like Gillam's in "The Shootist." Morgan Freeman, an excellent actor, one of the best on the screen today, is more than simply the kind of sidekick that Albert Popwell used to provide for Clint. He has screen time, develops a personality, and the moment when he discovers he can't kill a helpless man is crucial. Clint is better here than he's ever been or is likely to be. He can no longer shoot a pistol accurately at any distance. Caught in an icy rainstorm he comes down with a debilitating condition that leaves him sitting alone at a saloon table, feverish and hallucinating. He hardly knows where he is, and is unable to organize his speech. He actually gives us a suffering protagonist whose misery we can believe, as he did not, for instance, in "Beguiled" or any of the decreasingly interesting Dirty Harry movies. And Little Bill kicks the crap out of him nevertheless. Clint has a couple of good scenes in this movie, and the barroom sequence is one of them. Again, as he slowly recovers in a snowbound shed, he experiences hair-raising visions, of a man "with his head all busted open" and his deceased wife "covered with worms." Shuddering under the blanket, he rasps, "I'm scared of dyin'." (Let's see The Man With No Name pull that off.) Not that his character is entirely flawless or heroic. He manages to shoot at least three helpless, unarmed men for reasons that seem to satisfy him. I never thought I'd finding myself thinking, "You know, Eastwood is a good actor." As Little Bill, Gene Hackman is equally good. The script gives him a bit too much dialog debunking the old heroic myths of the West. But it's hard to imagine anyone doing it better than Hackman. His character is by no means made of total villainy. He has a wry sense of humor. And he's continually trying to finish his house on the outskirts of town, but ineptly. We have to believe that he built the sheriff's office too because it leaks constantly. And when, Beauchamp, the journalist, remarks that "They should hang the carpenter," Little Bill whirls around and glowers. His role isn't merely that of chief bad guy. He's more like a benevolent dictator. And his character illustrates the point that there probably shouldn't be dictators, no matter how well meaning, because they, like the rest of us, can act on mistaken judgments. Little Bill tries to be fair. But he makes a mistake when he takes Clint for a show-off "assassin" low life who hangs around in saloons and brags. And his judgment is off when he beats Morgan Freeman so badly that not only does the victim tell everything he knows but dies as well. Of course there is a climactic shootout. How could it be otherwise? It's called "catharsis." Perhaps it is a mistake to leave Clint unscathed at the end, but it allows him a couple of great exit lines: "Anybody takes a shot at me, I'll kill him -- and I'll kill his friends and his wife, and I'll burn his goddam house down. And don't any of you go cuttin' up anymore whores or I'll kill all you sons of bitches." He handles this dialog while slowly trying to mount his horse in darkness, veiled by sheets of rain, and his horse splashes uncomfortably around in a circle, before they slosh off into the night. Beauchamp, the writer, is lifted out of "The Left Handed Gun," and provides comic relief and a chance for Little Bill to tell funny, revisionist stories about the real West. Richard Harris also provides comic relief, despite the awful beating he takes from Little Bill. He is forced to exit town on a stage and leaves shouting insults to the savages who live in Big Whiskey -- "Do you know why you whores are here? Because they wouldn't let you live in England!" I've seen this movie several times now. Each time I begin by thinking my last positive impression of it was wrong. But no, each time it seems better than the last. Yes, it's an olla podrida of ancient clichés. There is nothing new under the Wyoming sun. But much of Mozart's music is made up of previously well established elements too. It was the way he put them together that counted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last of the Man with No Name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fitting epitaph to Clint's Western Legacy. A lot has been already said about the plot, the karmic violence and their meanings all points I agree with.But I've always regarded Unforgiven as the logical extension of the "Man with No Name" series assuming he wasn't killed and decided to retire. The problem is in his retirement he develops a conscience.Muny tries to go legit (like the old gangsters always tried to do) and fails because fate has it in for him. Not everyone can be the archetype gunman Muny is (as we see as the movie develops) but according to fate/karma/whatever there has to be one and Muny cannot escape his destiny no matter how old he is, what kind of penance he serves or how well he tries to establish himself as a "normal" person.Muny is slowly transformed back into his old self which he despises but is quite comfortable being. The gunfighter is his true self and is also his punishment for past sins of killing with impunity for so many years.There are actually a ton of themes going on including Little Bill who's really an outlaw with a badge but who is trying to also settle down. Little Bill can also be viewed as an extension of Clint's "Dirty Harry" character who's fascist tendencies cannot be controlled in his old age either. The writer character shows us the East Coast/modern world fascination with the horror of the West, the whores epitomize frontier justice at any cost and English Bob who represents the idealized gunfighter who in real-life is just a coward who'd rather shoot a man in the back than face him in a fair fight. Really not a truly likable, good guy character in the movie which probably makes this film a lot closer to real life than any toher Western to date. I've always wanted to see the look on the children's faces when Munny got back home after his transformation.Obviously for me a film that can perform on multiple levels, develop it's characters and remain solid gets very high praise. In my personal Top 10 of the 90's and probably in the Top 50 of all-time. I am a big fan of the modern western genre though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many of these reviews for these great movies miss the point. Violence is not a bad thing in movies IF it is used properly. Unforgiven is a character study of how the wild west truly was. It was a very brutal and violent world. In Unforgiven, EVERY act of violence has consequences, and that is the key. The movie doesn't use violence just to use it. It uses violence to make a point. This is without a doubt Clint's best movie. The DVD version of it is really good too. It has both a widescreen and a regular tv screen sized version. It is most certainly worth a purchase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent enough western. Unforgiven is a classic study of characters, life, man and the real west. The whole cast pretty much shines. Gene Hackman steals the show though as Sheriff "Little Bill". He got an Oscar for the best supporting actor for this movie. Morgan Freeman does his little part with such an ease. The town of Big Whiskey also unfolds slowly as a character. The movie did have a Sergio Leone touch though I loved all Sergio movies better than this. Leone has perhaps set a different height and discovered a new formula for Westerns. The sound &amp; music did not appeal me that much. Leone Westerns are always characterized by typical sound effects that leaves a thrilling effect and we would hardly find light- hearted characters. Clint Eastwood definitely not at his best as a director. Though as an actor, he has been brilliant always. Unforgiven is a great movie but definitely not one of the bests. It would definitely excite and entertain you. Though the movie is a bit overrated. I don't think it deserved the award for the best picture. Good one time watch...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mock if you must, but I like Singing Cowboys with Wonder Horses and white lariats.I don't want to de - mythologise the West or bring real life anywhere near the Western;surely that's why we go to see them,to get away from real life which seems to consist mainly of full - on nutters like Little Bill,killers seething with self - hatred like Will Munny,wannabe gangsters like The Schofield Kid and cowardly pathological liars like English Bob. I don't need to go to the cinema to see the likes of them,just step out into the High Street for heaven's sake. I would far rather nestle down round the campfire under the stars with Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes than Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman - at least I'd stand a fair chance of enjoying my coffee and beans next morning. "Unforgiven" is a bit too clever for me.And perhaps a tad too self - regarding.After ten minutes it's clear that Little Bill is a complete loony under his facade of reasonability,I don't need to be shown the same thing by metaphor with his house that looks OK from a distance but is in fact falling apart.As for English Bob and his Boswell - well I doubt if any moviegoer over the age of 10 ever believed all those tales of straight - shooting good guys,that's not the point of them,they're just great yarns to be enjoyed by wide - eyed boys reading "Captain Billy's Whizzbang". It's obviously a well - made movie by an actor/director totally familiar with the genre and as such it deserves respect if not affection. If the West really was like this, I am glad my childhood wish to be transported back to the days of the wagon trains was not granted. It's vicious,dangerous,lawless and deeply unpleasant - and not a Wonder Horse or white lariat in sight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Unforgiven" is considered to be one of the top 100 films in the history of the American Cinema, I totally concur with this verdict!! The emotions and pathetic despair that was depicted in this movie were sensational!! This is not a typical western whereby the setting is very polished, the rough and tumble days of Wyoming in 1890 were illustrated with a raw and undaunted rugged individualism!! The acting in "Unforgiven" was fantastic!! Gene Hackman was a despicable character, I hated him, but, at the same time, that was the idea!! Morgan Freeman was very believable in his delivery of the role he was assigned to!! Clint Eastwood made everything look second nature, as his experience with westerns is so adept, and it shows over and over again with this film!! Clint Eastwood directs this movie, he does a marvelous job at executing the tumultuous genre of this cut throat western!! I got an empathetic state of plausibility with all of the characters in the film "Unforgiven" as I could see how everything in the old west was honed in at survivalist mode, a defensive mechanism would be for me to hate everyone!! We are products of our environment!! This movie points this out time and time again!! "Unforgiven" won for best picture in 1992, I feel it is one of the best films ever made!! It is on my top 50!! See "Unforgiven" it is definitely up there with the best films ever to hit the silver screen!! Guaranteed!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did it deserve the Best Picture Oscar?! Probably not--but it still is a very dandy picture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this film but can't see exactly why it won the Oscar for Best Picture, though I gotta admit that none of the nominated films really stand out in my mind. In a way, it would have been interesting if they'd given out no award in that category, though that will never happen.Now I am not saying I disliked the film. It was exceptional--just not exactly "great"--especially when there were other Clint Eastwood Westerns before this that were about as good or better. Maybe this is a lot like the film TRUE GRIT. Not a super Western, but John Wayne got the Best Actor Oscar more because of his amazing body of work BEFORE this film than the film itself.What the movie does excel at is creating an aura of an "anti-hero" style Western. Not one where you exactly hated all the characters, but one that calls their motivations and actions to question and asks a lot of questions about what makes a hero. And, in this light, several of the characters really stand out in my mind.The most intriguing is Gene Hackman as the sheriff, Little Bill. He is not the typical sheriff-type character. He is neither the consummate hero or an inept jerk that looks the other way when trouble comes--the two most common types of sheriffs in film. Instead, he is a very pragmatic sadist. Pragmatic because he NEVER faces his enemies alone, but always has a well-trained gang to support him--like most bullies. And, with this gang giving him the upper hand, he show that down deep he is a sick and twisted man who takes pleasure in torment.I also liked the young punk gunman (Jaimz Woolvett). At first, he was very annoying and brash, but that really helped in the development of his character. He reminded me a lot of the guy Richard Jaekel played in THE GUNMAN--a young punk trying to prove his masculinity with a gun (wow, Freud would have LOVED that symbolism). But, unlike Jaekel, he eventually showed a very likable and believable bit of humanity.Clint Eastwood was also not the same typical character he usually played. Not "the man with no name" like so many Spaghetti-Westerns, but a complex and cold man who used to be a drunken #@$%!&amp; but had reformed when he met the right woman. Then, years later, when he strapped his guns on again, it was pretty unusual and refreshing to see what a bad shot he initially was and how much trouble this old man had getting on the horse. This old and somewhat broken-down tough-guy was also reminiscent of John Wayne's last film, THE SHOOTIST, in that although the body is achy and tired, there is still a lot of man hidden underneath.Morgan Freeman's role was very ordinary and he shows once again that he is a supremely capable actor. The best part about the role was that not once did anyone mention that he was a black man--a bold move in many ways. Instead, he and his quiet dignity was what was front and center.Richard Harris and the rest of the cast did fine jobs and I have no complaints about the acting. In fact, I have no real complaints at all about the film.The movie deserves its R-rating for graphic language and a lot of extreme violence, though it is not as graphic or offensive as many similarly rated films. With a parent, this might be appropriate for some teens, though you should think twice before letting them watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven's truthful depiction of killing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is very correct and logical when depicting killing, which is why i consider it to be a masterpiece. Most other westerns/action flicks depict their characters shooting/killing one another as if it where a mundane thing that requires no will power and has no psychological ramifications, where as in reality, it is a very difficult thing to do.I have never shot or killed another person, but I would believe that it would take a very strong will on my part to muster up the courage to make an conscience decision to take someone else's life. And Unforgiven clearly depicts this moral/psychological dilemma: Ned couldn't do it anymore. Also, The kid, who lied about killing five men, after his first kill, was psychologically maimed and full of regret. Furthermore, Lil Bill demonstrates this psychological inhibition during the cell scene with English Bob, when he tells the writer to go ahead and shoot him and the writer ultimately lacks the will to do it. Afterwards, Bill reiterates this in a speech in which he states that it takes a very resolute man to actually pull the trigger, or something to that effect.A sane, sober, person will not easily make an conscience decision to kill a man. That is why only under the influence of alcohol, adrenaline/anger, would one maybe even go through with it. Unforgiven reiterates this many times throughout the movie in which the characters need alcohol to aid them in their killings and to console them afterwards.I recall having a dream in which I shoot a friend for no apparent reason, and my friend is laying their crying, yelling he is going to die. His mother was also present, and she was hysterically bawling asking me:"WHY?! Why did you kill my son?" I was completely torn up inside; I felt like throwing up (in the dream). The scene in which William shoots the first cowboy bounty and the cowboy is bawling that he has been hit and is in pain, reminded me of this dream. And I clearly saw that Munny also felt the same guilt and remorse as I did, even so much that he yells out for them to get the kid some water.Killing is not an easy thing as most movies will have you believe, and I admire Unforgiven for truthfully representing this in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that could be a realistic one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard about unforgiven as an 'unexpected classic' and with those comments in my mind I watched the film few days back. It turned out to be a classic at the end unexpectedly.The greatness comes from the story. Not the story lines. But the story that could be felt inside by the viewer. The morale of the story is as simple as that of 'how much you tame your instinct and violence, it sure would come out at sometime'. The story is unpredictable because of its strange characters.William Munny(Eastwood) was indeed once a notorious thief, murderer, gun-man. He shot and killed many of them such that he lost their count. But he was loved by a rich, good woman. She marries him off coming out from her wealthiest mom (why! how come?!). She turns him out into a noble man who never touches drinks and the gun thereafter. They have two kids. Even her death (by smallpox) makes him even nobler ("Claudia, watching up from heaven.."). He, driven by situation, picks up the $1000 reward offer for killing the two who cuts of a night-girl's face out of arrogance. Why these night-girls instead of running off from that worst place and worst boss, announce bounty for those lads who cut them. They wanted to punish the evil young men, in spite of who they are and what they are and their inability to fight against their owner and the sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman).The sheriff who was actually strict in holding up the law and order in the town, is not the hero. Because all the goodness he talks does not make one think he is good. Instead he sounds cynical, indirectly supporting the owner of that bar-cum-brothel house. He even punishes those lads not for justice but in favor of the bar-owner.And Ned Logan(Morgan Freeman), who was Munny's ex-partner, married to an red-Indian woman who regards Munny always as a bad person, plays a good friend of Munny and turns Munny finally to be 'unforgiven'.There are lot more characters adding strangeness to the story (schofield kid, Beauchamp, the cut-woman etc). The story at the end stands for Munny; He has a conscience of his own; he has crossed its boundaries for a long time; then retreats to a normal man who strives to live a good-life (to the extent of monogamy); and then flares back but this time his conscience itself crossed the boundaries set by itself, defining new boundaries of his life for one time. One sample for the strangeness of Munny character is this: When they hit the first boy he puts-off the gun fire and ask the other boy to give him water (knowing he might die soon). No matter what I do, good or bad; it is important that my conscience allows me to do it. It is not the external world that decides my goods and bads but my conscience. That is why we see very bad people having very good characters and very good-looking people having very bad characters. Even you did good it is not good enough until your conscience tells you good. And bad things are not bad enough as long as the conscience is OK with it. The movie contains lots of such characters wandering around the story. In real life we see such characters a lot.That is why it is unexpectedly classical in nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong revisionist western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's much-ballyhooed revisionist western became the first western in decades to win a Best Picture Oscar, but most viewers will probably wonder why. The film is beautifully photographed, but over-rated, overwrought and over-populated with extraneous characters that pad out the film's already questionable running time given its flimsy story. The film opens with a puzzling on screen typescript that ultimately becomes laughable as it has nothing whatsoever to do with the story and discusses a woman that never appears in the film or is really even discussed. Eastwood trots out his old stock character of the tired gunslinger prodded back into action by young whippersnapper Jaimz Woolvet to accept the commission set out by a group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey to avenge the disfigurement of one of their own by a local ruffian. Corrupt sheriff Gene Hackman is not too keen on the idea of cavalcades of gunslingers parading through town and naturally becomes an obstacle for Eastwood. Truthfully, this story has been done to death, and the only thing Eastwood really brings to the table is making his character aged and the entire tone of the film melancholy to the point of inducing sleep. None of the "action" scenes are especially suspenseful and there are so many characters that are just simply not needed. I enjoy Richard Harris, but his participation in this film is pointless. Morgan Freeman seems on hand only because Eastwood likes to stack the cast with older actors and because someone needs to die in order for him to go all "man with no name" on everyone. The women - who one would think should hold some sway over the film - are relatively interchangeable and given little screen time. Woolvett is little more than an irritant and is given short shrift. Eastwood looks and acts pale and decrepit. Only Hackman seems aware that he is in a film and there needs to be some energy or life to resuscitate the audience watching. The conclusion is predictable and most viewers will have little, if any, emotional stake in the outcome. A beautiful looking waxwork of a film, which copped Eastwood his first of two completely undeserved director Oscars. With all due respect McCabe and Mrs. Miller did this revisionist western thing much better more than a decade earlier and Eastwood's film merely comes across as a poor copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mangy scoundrels, shaky gunslingers, and one vicious sheriff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning western "Unforgiven" is said by some to be an elegy to the genre, an honest and probing examination of killing. The murders in the film spring from injustice and lawlessness, and while the picture certainly has a deep texture and rich performances, it isn't always graceful--nor original--though still one of the finest westerns of the last twenty years. Two cowboys in a small Wyoming town in the 1880s are responsible for the slashing of a young prostitute; they're let off easy by the corrupt, power-mad sheriff, causing the ladies of the brothel to pull their resources and put up a bounty on the men. Eastwood plays an ex-gunslinger turned pig-rancher who, along with an aged partner and a cocky, nearsighted kid, takes up the task of killing the men for the money, not counting on crossing paths with the town sheriff and his dedicated deputies. The film isn't multi-layered, and it isn't an allegory exactly, although Eastwood and screenwriter David Webb Peoples do tease the moral issue, as well as showing us how strenuous (physically and mentally) it is to kill another human being. The resulting picture is intriguing, absorbing (after a somewhat rocky start) and, finally, cathartic. The weak dialogue is an obstacle: Peoples has come up with an arresting narrative, but his trash talk is flabby--and things gets even worse with the buddy-isms (Morgan Freeman to widower Eastwood: "Do you use your hand?"). As another mercenary, Richard Harris has a strong supporting bit, yet it's his entrance (and exit) that allows sheriff Gene Hackman to really flourish as the villain of the piece. Oscar-winner Hackman gets down to grit of this cold-hearted man (with the meanest steely eyes), yet this sheriff is also a clod, a fool living in a leaky house. As director, Clint Eastwood doesn't do much out of the ordinary (and one has to wonder about those two youngsters left alone back at the ranch), but visually the picture looks adept and is paced well (but I could have done without the heart-to-hearts around the campfire, as well as all the rain). As the winner of the Best Picture Oscar, it revitalized the craving for new-fangled, hard-bitten westerns...and its individual success bears the brunt of many painful imitations. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nope, I won't forgive this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, the true "Unforgiven" here is me. Because I'll never forgive this movie for disappointing me so badly. Actually, completely disappointed is not even beginning to express what I feel. I mean, I watched this movie because: - it's Clint Eastwood..enough said! - it's ranked among the top 100 movies on IMDb - it got like 4 OscarsSo there I was all excited to see it and prepared for a fantastic movie, with great acting and a deep message to think about...boy, was this a let down! seriously, maybe I watched the wrong movie or something, it's so so so so bad. And what makes it worst is the fact that it has gotten such high praise, awards and reviews! UN-BELIEVABLE!Hands down worst Clint Eastwood movie (and I truly admire him as a director and an actor,it's so frustrating so see how bad this is when you like the director!)! The plot is full of inconsistencies, as other reviewers mentioned before (he can't ride - how did he go to town?? on foot? for miles and miles?how did he go visit his friend?; he leaves his kids behind all alone - hello, it's the wild west, you don't let kids alone even in our day and age), but the main problem is that it does not have any message at all. He was a bad man, he reformed for his wife, then when she's gone and things go bad on his farm, he returns to his old ways. What does that mean? That he actually never changed? That sometimes there are plausible reasons for killing someone? That he does not have a choice, because he's forced by the situation? Shoot me if you want, but I did not like it one bit, it's not a true western, and it's not a psychological movie either. The only scenes I liked was that cowboy trying to give Delilah the pony, and Munny in delirium afraid of dying. Oh, and "The Duck of death" was funny. The rest is....just unforgivably bad!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Weirdly ambivalent, slightly incoherent 1992 story. Looked at from one point of view, it seems to have been patched together using a wide selection of stereotypes from earlier Westerns: the Silly, the Unreal, and the Ugly. Bits and pieces from "Liberty Valance", "A Fistful of Dollars", "Ride the High Country", "Lawman", "Young Guns", even a touch of "Badlands" and "Cat Ballou", no less. A jug of whiskey greatly improves your target-shooting. A mash-up. One of the silly scenes happens early on, when Clint flounders around in his pig pen; and then can't get on his horse. What's he been doing for the last eleven years, since he stopped gunslinging? How has he been getting into town, or anywhere, except on horseback? Has he just been sitting in his shack with his two kids, for the last three years, since his wife died? There's a try at explaining it away. In any case, it's very badly shot and performed.A second silly scene is inserted to show that the Kid is seriously short-sighted. He starts shooting with his rifle "all over creation" because he thinks Ned and Munny are two unknown characters following him (why would they?). How did he see them in the first place? He can't handle a rifle anyway. OK, so he's an unusually stupid little git. The part was excellently well-acted by an actor completely unknown to me.Third silly scene: "Little" (in the original script he's supposed to be unusually large --- like Robin Hood's "Little" John Little) Bill Daggett and his house-building. His incompetence, especially as demonstrated during his rainy night-time session with Mr Beecham, is as madly exaggerated as the Kid's semi-blindness. Then there's another scene, perhaps more puzzling than silly, where one of the girl billiard-markers, Little Sue, delivers the $1,000 (equals $110,000 today) bounty pay-off to Munny and The Kid: how did she know where to find them? Perhaps that was the old oak, a pre-arranged meeting-place between Munny and Little Sue. The script makes this fairly clear, but it's not obvious from the screen. Was she psychic? Could be. Hints of supernatural forces at work in this film. Mr Beecham suggests hanging the carpenter, but mightn't that be crucify the carpenter? Hendershot lives again.(NB Wikipedia: "? assigning the title "little" typically relates to a person who expresses kindness, compassion, empathy, and a certain level of optimism and joy toward life and other people." Huh? --- not always!) A lot of this film seems unreal. One reviewer reckons it's "unbelievably real"; but if something is real, it's not unbelievable. From another point of view, it is compelling entertainment. It makes you want to know what happens next, and it stimulates thought. There are scenes which are powerful, well-paced, and tense, probably because they are also brutal and ugly, involving sadistic violence and merciless cold killing, giving many people a thrill. Contrary to some opinions, much of the dialogue is sharp, and well-delivered. The acting is pretty good in most scenes. Woolvett is very good. But Saul Rubinek has a deeply comic persona, which seems out-of-place here. He was much better, in fact really funny, in "True Romance", a comedy. The scene with English Bob where Saul wets himself is a bit silly. English Bob makes a number of good points, but he's far too old for this sort of life.The writer is D.W.Peoples, who also had a big hand in "Blade Runner", 1982. There are situational similarities. Both settings feature cold, inhuman, functional communities entirely devoid of families. Big Whiskey's population seems to consist solely of a few merchants, whores and gambling, drinking, cowboys. "The town of Big Whiskey is full of normal people trying to lead quiet lives". You could have fooled me. One short 5 or 10 second shot shows what looks like a man and his wife entering the place together on a buggy. There is a long catalogue of goofs and anachronisms listed on this site, which is one reason why "Blade Runner" (rated 117 on the IMDb list) is a much greater film than "Unforgiven" (rated 99). Ridley Scott is a compulsive perfectionist, and Eastwood isn't; but there are many other reasons for Blade Runner's vast superiority, including theme, conception and execution.There's quite a good scene where Hackman delivers a short lecture on how to be a successful gunfighter, by staying cool, calm and collected, as well as aiming carefully, but not necessarily fast. This is pretty well a rip-off of a similar lesson given by Burt Lancaster to Richard Jordan in "Lawman", 1971. "Lawman" is also a much better film than "Unforgiven", though criminally under-rated. Lancaster fills the roles combined by Munny and Hackman, as law enforcer, judge, jury and executioner, and he is also a greater actor, and a far more powerfully charismatic personality, than either. Moreover, "Lawman" expresses the judicial dilemmas of the mythic Old West more cleanly than "Unforgiven".The message of "Unforgiven" is even more confusing than that in Duck Wayne's 1962 movie, which ends with the line: "Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance". The point being that it was the old-fashioned gunslinging pioneer who shot Liberty. Is the moral, in spite of everything, simply that Might is Right? Nothing really matters, so long as you can survive by shooting down the other guy(s)? Extermination silences opposition.I'm truly not sure who is "unforgiven" in this story. The girls (well, the Head Girl anyway) were definitely unforgiving. An alternative title might be "Hitman Makes Good". San Francisco dry goods put Munny in the money. Marxist subtext? Probably worth more than 4 stars, but so over-rated on this site that some balance needs to be restored. Four Oscars --- I ask you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this really a ground-breaking Western?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like individual scenes in Unforgiven, but I'm not sure that I like the movie as a whole. It's got a good cast and good intentions, but ultimately I find it a little too preachy, and I'm not sure that its moral compass is pointing in exactly the right direction.Also, I just can't agree with critics who call this film a "ground-breaking" Western that "broke the mold" by condemning violence instead of glorifying it. I can think of many anti-violence Westerns that are years or even decades older than Unforgiven -- The Ox-Bow Incident springs to mind, and even Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West showed the horrible consequences of violence without getting on a soapbox about it.On a similar note, I'd like to point out that The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance had already explored the idea of "debunking" mythological Western figures, while The Wild Bunch exposed an aging gunslinger's fallibility by showing him slip and fall while trying to mount a horse. My general point -- I do have one, I think -- is that everything allegedly "groundbreaking" about Unforgiven had appeared in Westerns before 1992. This film is not some radical break with Western tradition; it owes its predecessors in a big way.Indeed, I think Unforgiven's rather obvious moralizing is vintage Western stuff. The film's anti-violence message is well-intentioned, of course, and I almost feel like a jerk for pointing out that it's hammered home with no subtlety and sometimes hokey dialog.I don't want to bury this movie, because I think some of the performances are great, the locations are perfect, and even the melancholy theme tune is well-chosen. But I do want to challenge the notion that this is some kind of totally original, really deep piece of art. It's really not that deep; it raises old questions in old ways, and doesn't necessarily suggest interesting answers or provide too much food for thought. Maybe it's thoughtful by movie standards, but it's hardly literature, is it? Unforgiven also has some problems that have nothing to do with its message. For instance, I find it a little problematic that Gene Hackman sort of steals the movie from Eastwood. Perhaps I'm being harsh, but I find Eastwood's stoic acting boring, and I frequently think that his co-stars trump him (see also Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef). Even Richard Harris makes more of an impression than Eastwood with just a cameo, I think. Morgan Freeman, meanwhile, is so typecast as a sagely mellow guy that I feel sorry for him.However, as I said, there are individual great scenes. The "Duck of Death" confrontation, the exchanges between Eastwood's character and the prostitute, and the various brutal killings are all extremely memorable. But I just don't think the whole thing hangs together, and I get the uncomfortable feeling that the film ends up glorifying violence anyway despite trying to do exactly the opposite. Who knows?Ultimately, I feel very little guilt in proclaiming that a fun/violent Western like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is actually a lot better than Unforgiven, even if it isn't as self-consciously PC. I have no immediate plans to go out and shoot anybody myself, therefore I don't really need Unforgiven to dissuade me from committing murder, do I? So, I'd rather be entertained by my Westerns than preached at by them. Know what I mean?</fullReview>

This movie doesn't. Its just a story that is being told with many sequences where u just get bored as a viewer. Its a typical average movie.I wouldn't have rated it even 6/10 if it wasn't for those actors, they did a good job, especially Gene Hackman.Giving the Oscar for best Picture to this movie, makes those Hollywood suckers look even worse.

		<shortDescription>Not a revisionist Western, but a Western with a reverse and manipulative classicism ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** There was a scene in the beginning of "The Godfather", where Bonasera, the undertaker, came to ask Don Corleone for an act of vengeance. His daughter had been severely beaten by two young men, her jaw was broken and she would "never be beautiful again". Don Corleone objected, saying that what he was asked for was murder, the undertaker retorts that it's an act of justice. Then Corleone has this words that I perfectly remember: "It wouldn't be justice, your daughter is still alive" *** This brief exchange illustrates the 'eye for an eye' notion, and constitutes the primal basis of my personal contempt for "Unforgiven", Clint Eastwood's 'masterpiece' of revisionist western, and the Best Picture of 1992.Basically, I have a philosophical problem with "Unforgiven" from the start of the plot. A group of prostitutes offers a $1,000 reward for the killing of the two men who 'disfigured' one of their own. The premise is fallacious from the start as it deliberately condemns even the younger and more sympathetic one who tried to stop his friend from attacking the girl. Secondly, considering the small scars she would carry after that, the line "she ain't go face left" has absolutely no meaning at all, as you would expect to see her without an eye or a part of her nose. She's still good looking, and the movie fails to emphasize the gravity of her wounds.The prostitutes' reaction was out of proportion and I don't buy the whole "Those were the times" comment. Either you kill for money or for revenge and this could apply to any era, but the contract put on these two dudes wasn't even an "eye for an eye", it was basically "two lives for a face" And it's even sadder when you consider that the younger one tried to give the girl a horse to say he's sorry, the hysterical burst of hostility he faced showed that he had already signed his own death warrant and these women, supposedly weak and powerless, didn't know at all the meaning of forgiveness. I guess "those were the times" and we have to accept that the two guys "had it coming" This is why the movie couldn't emotionally engage me. It was all wrong, the whole premise of killing two men for a face, is philosophically unacceptable. Did Munny have a choice? Yes. If you're supposed to be a retired gunslinger, it should take more than a 'disfigured' face to get back on the road. Yes, but it was all about money. Then, William Munny is no better, no worse than Little Bill Daggett, Gene Hackman as the official villain, and just because his best friend is Morgan Freeman doesn't make him any good. Even as an antihero, he's not a 'vigilante', not even a 'punisher', except if he really considered the two guys deserved death, but then we're back to the same problem.I understand that Munny is not necessarily sympathetic, that "Unforgiven" is about a redemption's failure. But the manipulative aspect of the film is to make us believe that Munny became a bad man, when he learned about the death of his friend and came to avenge him. Ta-da! Here comes the bad Eastwood, the killer, who'll 'pull a Dirty Harry' on the whole town. No, he was a bad man from the start because he killed for money, and the climax highlights the true motive of the film, to work as a patient build-up to a bloody massacre, to show the calm and wise Munny to better emphasize the incarnation of the Devil he became.And again, I didn't even expect him to be the kind of noble-hearted antihero who was going to protest : "Hey come on, these guys didn't kill anyone?! What's the matter with you sisters, you ain't foolin' no one !", he did it as a job, for money, fine. But then the whole "Hell of a thing killin' a man" was probably the most disgustingly hypocritical cinematic speech ever. Munny was talking as if he had no choice killing the man, as if he couldn't use his free will to realize that what he was doing was wrong, that he could refuse the job. No, he had to terminate that guy's life because he didn't deserve a second chance... and we were supposed to be ecstatic toward that blatant lack of justice, even Dirty Harry never got that philosophical.No revisionist western ever featured cold-blooded killers even as antiheroic protagonists, and "Unforgiven"'s depiction of Munny in a positive light is one unforgivable case of narrative manipulation, something that apparently fooled the Academy. I guess all it takes is a great cinematography, a fine editing, these kind of introspective moments and of course, some twists like the kid admitting he never killed anyone. I saw that one coming by one mile, he was so cocky, so un-Eastwood, it was obvious he never did the 'hell of thing' thing.*** And speaking of the 'hell of a thing' I'll end up like I started, with another movie reference. There was a scene in "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller" where John McCabe was chased by three ruthless killers, he had no chance. What did he do? He chickened out and tried to escape, the movie doesn't end here, but I just want to highlight that this man was the 'hero' of the film, and his reaction doesn't need words or a a pseudo meditative speech about life's value to make you get the point. *** This is true realism, real revisionist western, "Unforgiven" is just a Western with a reverse and manipulative classicism. And if one movie about a character legitimating a certain form of violence should have been the real winner that year, it was "Malcolm X". But I guess, a bad-ass 'cow-boy' killer is more cinematically acceptable than a Black Muslim leader preaching self-defense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed and starring Clint Eastwood, this classical Western is a plot that we've all seen many times over. Clint Eastwood's character William "Bill" Munny is a killer/ alcoholic cured of his sins by his deceased wife. His old partner in crime and recently re-united Ned Logan is played by Morgan Freeman.The film begins when a young new hotshot shows up at Bill's farm with a proposition. Hearing of Munny's reputation as the worst gunslinger of them all, The Schofield Kid, played by Jaimz Woolvett, asks Munny for his help in a well paid job to kill two men. The men the Kid was hired to kill, cut up a hooker in another town. Munny at first says no, even when the Kid agrees to split the money with Munny. However, soon Munny is on his way to catch up with the Schofield Kid and even stops along the way to pick up his old partner in crime.While this movie is conventional in its plot, setting, and every other way, it's ending is everything but conventional. The ending of Unforgiven is not a typical ending where everyone is happy in the end, and all is perfect. I really liked the fact that this movie took a chance and didn't go for the predictable happy ending.Though the ending wasn't the usual conclusion to a film and took a risk, it also left the viewer unsatisfied. It wasn't really much of an ending at all. One minute guns are blazing, shots are firing and the next nothing. I really think that a better ending could have been written, conventional or not. Another thing that really bothered me the entire movie, the hooker whose face got cut up "so badly" wasn't even cut up that badly. The movie was made in 1992; they absolutely could have done a better job on making her wounds look worse.Unforgiven definitely had an all-star cast with actors like Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. However I don't think that the roles that the actors were in were interesting or showed any talent whatsoever. Bill Munny, Clint Eastwood's character doesn't speak much of the movie and has the same snarling ho-hum demeanor the entire film. Eastwood also displays the same facial expression regardless if he is sick, sad, happy or excited. Ned Logan, Morgan Freeman's character, is a typical Morgan Freeman character. The character is calm, wise and unable to hurt a fly. When push comes to shove the ex-killer is unable to pull the trigger; surprise, surprise.The film isn't horrible, it is just not memorable. The plot is the same as most other western movies you have seen and the acting isn't that great either. Unforgiven's unusual ending makes the movie somewhat stand out of the pack, but in the end it leaves the audience confused. I would recommend not wasting the 2 hours this movie takes to watch in its entirety. All in all I would rate this movie a 4 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Im-Morality Tale Posing as Heavy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never understood why this film was billed as and considered by so many to be a morality tale. It is about a bad man, 'Bill' Munny, a killer, who settled down for a few years when he got married, had a couple of kids and tried to lead a normal farmers life in the 1880's West. Then his wife died. One day, one of his old buddies, Ned Logan, comes to him with a proposition. A couple of cowboys beat up and scarred a whore in some remote archetypal western town. Even then, one of the cowboys was almost a spectator to the crime and even tried to restrain his friend. The local sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, then brutally horse whipped the two men in public and made them pay compensation to the whore. But that was not good enough for the other whores, who chipped in to hire a hit man to do the two in. Natch, this was an attraction to Mr. Muney, who promptly abandons his farm and two kids to go out and resume his murderous ways with his old fellow criminal, Ned Logan, and a wanna-be Billy the Kid, The Schofield Kid.Where is the morality in having an unrepentant killer kill someone in cold blood for money? He might of had the motive of defending a helpless woman's honor, but so what? Somewhow, since William 'Bill' Munny was still loyal to his dead wife and had flashbacks about some of the men he killed, he has repented. This really lowers the bar for repentance a bit, to say the least. It's like some Mafia guy acting like he is respectable because he has other men do his dirty work, goes to church, and supports his family. It seems that his ten year vacation from murder and mayhem, in his vain attempt to lead an honest life, is Clint's idea of amends. This is what ruins the film the most, an immorality tale masquerading as something deep and moral. For all the negativity he experienced as Dirty Harry from the critics, at least Harry was always a cop and defended good people from bad guys. Gene Hackman was the best in this one, as the Sheriff, a complicated man, but more good than bad. Saul Rubinek, as W.W. Beauchamp, has the most interesting role as a writer who chronicles, no mythologizes, these cowboy killers as the prototype Louis L'Amour, while his main source of info, the sheriff, tells it like it was; anything but good and romantic. Needless to say, he ends up killing a whole bunch of people, most of them not 1/10th as bad as him, gets away and becomes a success. It reminds me of some right wing Bush loving theocon whose religion mandates punishing the sinners, starting wars, hating the enemy and neglecting the poor. This movie could serve as a template for Bush ll and Iraq, made ten years before Iraq.I am not a Clint basher, I loved his Dirty Harry series and think his biggest mistake was putting his old girlfriend, Sondra Locke, in his movies. In his spaghetti western movies, he played an amoral character who was only smarter and braver than his criminal cohorts. His characters had a rougish sensibility that endeared them to a large cross section of America, hip and straight. They never idealized his character, but simply posited a cynical world where there are no really good people. This movie had a sense of heaviness and seriousness that just isn't warranted. By making this killer into some standout person, Clint really lowered the bar for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not worth 4 Oscars,if any..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really know where to begin. I was disappointed in this one,maybe because I expect the very best from nineties cinema,maybe because it was rated 8.3 which I think it doesn't really deserve. I was checking for old stuff I missed and this one popped out,with 4 Oscars and pretty satisfying cast.The story was just so very naive and predictable. I mean,who leaves his children at home to go bounty hunting with some rag tag teenager,especially if you've been straight for 11 years,it just doesn't add up in my mind. I can understand that money is a powerful motivator,but at least Eastwood should have stayed a mean guy made to live the way he did,possibly waiting for something like this to come up. From what we can see in the movie,there was absolutely no temptation on Eastwood part to actually go do it,no nostalgia for the old days,he just went as if he was made to. Conversation are badly done,most of them are shallow and actually quite boring to listen to. I found characters very uninteresting and poorly developed. The story,the characters,the things that movie is revolving about,just way to insignificant to captivate.Don't know what else to say really,go and see it if you're up for some western movie,but don't expect much because this one fails to deliver. After the movie just felt 2 hours older,and thats about it.And for people saying this is the best Eastwoods movie,do actually see another Eastwood movie before claiming something so untrue..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Charismatic Actors Elevate Hard-Edged Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like westerns and I like this film but I admit this is a bit hard-edged for me. It took me a couple of viewings to appreciate it. It's a tough movie with a good cast and no nonsense. The characters in here aren't the talk-now-shoot-later variety. There are a few memorable and very tense scenes in this film, and a fair share of profanity, too, including too many usages of the Lord's name in vain.Watching the likes of Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman as the three main stars, however, is pretty entertaining. How often are those charismatic actors NOT entertaining? Eastwood ("Bill Munny") plays his normal type character, so you know what to expect with him. Hackman plays the bad-guy sheriff, "Little Bill Daggett." Authority figures are almost bad people to Hollywood. Morgan Freeman plays Eastwood's lower-key old partner, "Ned Logan." In the minor roles, Jaimz Woolvett, who played "The Schofield Kid," reminded me of a young David Arquette but I haven't heard Woolvett's name since this movie.Overall, a rough film but a pretty solid western which would have been better and accepted by the public better had the language been toned down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but far too safe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a disappointingly safe yet simultaneously above average film. The film falls short of the expectations one would have for a film which the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences considered the "Best Picture" of 1993. It is worth noting that Clint Eastwood also was awarded Best Director, Gene Hackman won Best Supporting Actor, and Joel Cox won Best Film Editing for their respective work on Unforgiven. These awards certainly had a positive influence on my expectations, but I remained cautiously optimistic as I also had preexisting expectations as a result of the films cast both in front of and behind the camera. I expected Clint Eastwood to put forward what would most likely be an acceptable display of directing and, if I was lucky, he would churn out a great film. As I think Eastwood is a notably better actor than director, I hoped for a strong performance in the lead role on his part and an equally strong performance by the rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman. My predictions seemed to mostly come true as nearly every aspect of Eastwood's western. Everything from directing and acting to set design was average at worst and good at best. Eastwood's directing in this film stands out to me as his most bland and by-the-numbers performance in comparison to the other films I have seen with him behind the camera. These other films such as Gran Torino, American Sniper, and even Jersey Boys all have noticeably more character and life to them in regards to his direction regardless of whether the direction itself was even good in its technical aspects. An observant viewer can often see the inspiration, voice, and personality of the director in their work but in this particular outing from Eastwood, all I can seem to see is a lack thereof. Despite this, I don't have many, if any, objective criticisms of the direction. It may feel riskless and average, but Eastwood does not make any easily noticeable missteps. This sentiment carries over into the acting as no particular performance stands out to me any more than the rest as being necessarily great but I am left with no real complaints. The first truly above average aspect of Unforgiven is its costume and set design. Ever costume and location depicted in the film feels very authentic. There is never a moment in the films runtime in which I wasn't completely sold on the authenticity of and justice done to the setting and time period. The remainder of my praise lies with the plot, as does the first of my real complaints. The film as a whole, and more specifically in regards to the plot, seems to be stuck in a balancing act as it struggles to maintain its status as slightly above average movie. For each of the films handful of lapse in logic and moments that leave us questioning or doubting a character's motivations, there is another, equally rare, moment that leaves the viewer feeling satisfied. The most notable of these instances in which I found myself finding a characters motivations questionable or weak are when Eastwood leaves behind his very young children alone of his remote farmstead for what we can only assume is around a few weeks as well as when Freeman's character decides to also up and leave his own life and spouse with little to no need for any convincing or negotiating. One could argue against these complaints by saying that perhaps Eastwood's children were taught and excel in their independence and don't need much assistance as they live on a self-sustaining farm that it is established they assist Eastwood in tending to. It could also be argued that Freeman agreed to join Eastwood due to their understood and occasionally referenced past together but I would retort that these explanations are both primarily rooted in assumptions and that the film would have benefited, even if only scarcely, by making the motivations behind these actions more clear. Although I stand by these complaints, they are obviously in short supply and had a nearly nonexistent effect on my opinion on the film and wouldn't warrant in any notable deviation on my rating of the film. My complaints are also matched in number and impact by the moments in which I feel the film excels. These moments include two surprisingly tense scenes that I feel exceed the quality of the rest of the film. The first being when English Bob refused to give up his gun to Bill Dagget and the second being in the jail when Bill Dagget offers Beauchamp and the then imprisoned English Bob a loaded gun. In addition to these two scenes, I felt that the films conclusion and climax was overall satisfying and served its purpose well. Despite being a mostly average and generally okay film, when viewed with the knowledge of the films numerous awards and praise, I can't help but feel underwhelmed and unimpressed. Unforgiven often meets the expectations of a generic and mediocre western film but rarely exceeds them. Overall, the film is solid and mostly watertight but there is essentially nothing to it that warrants a second viewing and hardly anything to warrant an initial viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, boring and a typical Academy winner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just a pure sleeping potion. In the last 30 years, there has been a few movies deserving of their Oscar wins. This isn't one of them. It is slow, boring and it's supposed message is so obscure, only a person that would be clued in before the movie can decipher its message of non-violence. You can't show violence and then say the movie is anti-violence. This isn't history. The scenery is good. Morgan Freeman is outstanding as always. I think in some ways they gave this an award just to make sure Clint Eastwood got one. They did the same with On Golden Pond, a horrible bore of a movie. This does have a few redeeming qualities that save it from being just a one star movie in my book and those are the few scenes that develop the plot in between excruciatingly boring character development. Gene Hackman always does well as a really mean bad guy, this is no exception. This plot isn't very original, it's predictable poorly developed and poorly executed. It should have been a 90 minute movie which would have been a more appropriate pace. I've watched it twice now and it just didn't get any better the second time. I am placing it just one star above that Oscar winning train wreck called Shakespeare in Love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Hackman especially shines in Eastwood's slightly flawed but enjoyable Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has made some glorious films in his time, and his original Oscar-winning Unforgiven lands somewhere in the middle for me. It doesn't have the emotional resonance or deep characters of Million Dollar Baby, but I found it a lot more powerful than his admirable misfire Mystic River.After two cowboys carve up a prostitute for laughing at one's lack of virility, the prostitutes pool their money for a bounty. Enter Clint Eastwood's Will Munny, a retired bounty hunter who comes back in order to sustain his family's farm. Munny is a great character - undyingly loyal to the memory of his late wife, who set him straight after so many years, he swears off alcohol, violence and even cussing around his young children. He can't fire a gun and he can't even mount his horse. But as we soon discover, his incompetence ends with his sobriety when grief and anger drag him back into his old ways. Munny draws on Eastwood's formidable acting chops to display him believably as a sickly incompetent, a prime, fear inducing bounty hunter, and everything in between.At the first whiff of money, in what is probably the most ludicrous scene of the film, Munny leaves his home in the wilderness and tells his very young children to "just kill a chicken if you need anything". The children are quickly dropped as a plot point - Munny frequently mentions his late wife, but doesn't seem to care about his living, breathing children who could probably use some supervision back home. Will gathers his old friend Ned (Morgan Freeman in forgettable entrance on that man's resume) and The Schofield Kid (a decent Jaimz Woolvert) and the chase is on. Finding the cowboys is actually remarkably easy - despite taking three days to heal Munny's fever, they seem to be within riding distance of the town. You would think a price on your head would be enough motivation to clear out, but don't focus too much on that. With minimal effort by both the bounty hunters and screenwriters, the trio finish off both cowboys in a hastily edited couple of scenes that feel as if we've stumbled in halfway through. The pacing for the most part is excellent, but its definitely questionable in places.I said before that Eastwood was excellent, and I felt that Frances Fisher as head prostitute Strawberry Alice stole more than a few scenes. But Unforgiven's strongest asset is the terrific Gene Hackman as law man Little Bill Daggett. He's meant to be the good guy upholding good laws, he's even a wannabe carpenter (a beautiful little quirk on what could have been a one- dimensional character), but boy do we dread him. The best direction that Peoples and Eastwood took the film in was by introducing English Bob (a wonderful Richard Harris) and building him into this titanic figure, only to have Little Bill completely destroy him in front of the town. The conversations in the jail, where Bill picks apart Bob's entire reputation was beautifully written, sensationally directed and even better acted by Hackman. I know that I wouldn't dare pick up a gun in his presence.Eastwood's directorial skill is renowned in this film, as there are quite a number of terrific scenes that quiet down after the action and display beautifully the aftermath. The death of Bunting in particular is well done, as we completely forget the horrible crime for which he is being killed and just see a sobbing young man pleading for water whilst the jaded old bounty hunters take pity on him. That being said, there were a few points where I felt the script and direction made big and inexplicable choices. Why does Ned suddenly lose all of his mojo? Because he couldn't kill Bunting in one shot? Next thing we know he's quitting and going home. Don't question it, the film seems to say.I might have also taken issue with the final scene where Munny guns down the bar without a scratch had it not been for Daggett's conversations in jail about men who miss from fear. It turned what should have been the weakest scene into one of the strongest. How easy is it to address these stupid mistakes by just including one element into the script. That's why Eastwood is a master filmmaker, and that's why Unforgiven is a pretty darn good watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Directed and Acted,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a great movie with a very well developed storyline with an outstanding cast. It is very professionally directed by Clint Eastwood, who is, at this stage in his career, a professional with westerns, he adds a lot of depth to them, there is more emotion and character development here than you would find in any other western. However, Eastwood's character, despite receiving the most screen time, is the one we learn the least about, which disappointed me, we are aware of his past but there is little detail on it, I felt like we could have learned much more by the end. The performances are stellar, Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are terrific as always, but Gene Hackman steals the show, delivering a very intimidating, somewhat frightening performance, a well deserved Oscar win. Emotional, intense and a top notch cast, Unforgiven is certainly worth the watch, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good western or drama. A retired assassin decides to take on one last job with some help from two other men. Best Performance: Gene Hackman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morally gray characters in a morally gray time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two cowboys disfigure a prostitute and get off scottfree in the town of Big Whiskey, the other prostitutes pool together their money to hire outlaws to kill the cowboys. The Schofield Kid, convinces a retired outlaw named William Munny to help him with the bounty, and Munny brings his former partner Ned as well. Big Whiskey's sheriff Little Bill goes to brutal measures to keep them away.Clint Eastwood is fantastic as William Munny. The character is introduced to us as a reformed man who was once a notorious outlaw. When he accepts this final job, he begins to go back to the way he was, and it reaches its pinnacle when he declares that he will not only kill those who cross him, but also to kill their family and friends. His decent back into his murderous ways is very compelling, and Eastwood plays it perfectly.This movie is all about the differing morals of the characters, from the vengeful hookers to Little Bill, who beats and kills innocent people to keep his town safe, while at the same time he lets the violent cowboys go with only minor consequences. As Munny gets worse, the Schofield Kid realizes that the life of an outlaw is far more ugly than he expected, and gets very squeamish after making his first genuine kill. Munny accepts himself for what he is, simply saying "Yeah" after Little Bill tells Munny he'll see him in hell.Simply put, one of the greatest westerns ever made, and Eastwood's best directorial work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Wild Western Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is solidly Wild Western. With William Muddy performed by Clint Eastman as the archetypical Assassin for hire. He plays the part perfectly. It starts with him having become a reformed pig farmer having left his days as a gun totting maniac, thanks to his beloved wife. When news comes that a particularly savage attack took place on a women he gets back on the saddle to join the young kid who informed him of the assault. The story then proceeds to show him Brooding,dying and finally regressing to a vengeance seeking psychopath. He is joined by his partner Ned Logan performed by Morgan Freeman in another fine part. Meanwhile in the Town of Big Whiskey Little big Daggett the characteristic Law enforcer performed by Gene Hackman does an excellent job in dispensing with Justice as he sees it. Keeping an eye on the Brothel. Beating up the Bounty Hunter English Bob performed by Richard Harris in order to send a message to any other would be assassin to steer clear of the town. His viciousness is ultimately his downfall as he tortures Ned Logan to death following the Schoefield Kid's successful hit job. Only W.W. Beauchamp the aspiring author manages to stay alive and make an account of the entire tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Masterpiece in Ambiguity and Regret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those who believe in karma, "Unforgiven" is not for you. It is a film that depicts the world as being a place in which who you are and what you do bring about consequences that are in no way commensurate. Delilah, the young and inexperienced prostitute, indiscreetly giggles at the size - or lack of it - of a client's penis.She has her face brutally slashed by an enraged cowhand and this injustice sets off the train of further over-reactions and injustices. The client's companion who has caused Delilah no harm and who displays true remorse and a genuine willingness to make amends by offering her his best pony, is gut shot and dies in dread and agony whilst pleading for water. Ned, who finally cannot bring himself to murder for money, is brutally tortured and his corpse displayed as a warning to other would-be assassins. Little Bill, incomparably played by Gene Hackman, obviously believes that by portraying himself as a public avenger and as an upholder of mainstream attitudes, values and morality he will be somehow cosmically protected. He protests,"I was building a house" as if pleading his case to a more just and higher court as he contemplates what he considers is an unjust death. He builds a house not only as a place to stay but as a bulwark against the bad men such as assassins and the merely dissolute drifters and teamsters who he has been called upon to deal with in the western towns as they transitioned from wild and lawless to relatively civilized. Bill wants to be part of the transition but he has been part of the wildness for too long and his righteous tirades cannot completely mask the sadistic pleasure he takes as he brutally beats real or potential wrong doers. In fact, Bill's righteous talk always seems like he is protesting too much. Bill's inability as a carpenter is symbolic of his inability to make it back from the dark side. He says that he wants to sit on his porch and watch the sunset as he smokes his pipe and drinks his coffee and we believe him. He does not want to deal with bad men anymore and is slow to respond when called upon but, like an addict, when he becomes involved he cannot resist one more kick than necessary. William Munny is another who is trying to transition from the wild west to civilization. He has done the worst of crimes, killing women and children and murdering men without due cause. Do we cheer him as hero because he is now murdering in the name of giving his children a better future? The reflective theme music as the epilogue is printed over a silhouette of Munny's final farewell to the wife who changed his evil and dissolute ways leaves us at odds with how to feel about what has happened throughout the film. Are we pleased that Munny went to San Fransisco and prospered in dry goods? Munny regrets his past and everything that has happened in the film is a source of regret. Delilah was a nice enough young girl in a regrettable situation. Even the "Schofield Kid" is a nice enough if insecure and none ?too-bright boy who finds that he will now have to live with the regret of taking another young man's life. Ned has been brought out of a relatively contented life to suffer a brutal death. None really deserve their fate. Life is just not as simple as deserve and that is what makes it interesting. "Unforgiven" is lifted above many of Eastwood's attempts at making morality plays out of westerns because in this film morality is examined in the light of a genuinely unjust and ambiguous world. Eastwood finally hit the jackpot and created art as well as an interesting story and rewarding character study. And he was finally supplied with a catchphrase that went beyond the glib and sardonic when he informs Little Bill : "Deserve has nothing to do with it." Munny can say this with authority because few if any people he has killed have really deserved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood first MASTERPIECE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After three decades as an actor and one as a director, Clint Eastwood had already received bad critics after bad critics. It was a matter of time until in 1992, Eastwood joined his director skills and his long career in Western movies, and finally had the deserved respect in perhaps his ultimate masterpiece."Unforgiven" begins in a dark cold night in the small town of Big Whisky, when suddenly it's heard screams coming from the cabaret with two clients cutting the face of a young prostitute. The sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is called and his men manage to catch the two criminals, but Little Bill doesn't condemn the two deadly, instead they have to deliver 5 horses to the owner of the cabaret as the price for the poor young woman. The other prostitutes are dissatisfied with the justice posed by Bill, and join all their money putting a bounty of $ 500 for the death of the two cowboys. The rumor of the bounty reaches the ears of a young cocky that call himself The "Schofield Kid" (Jaimz Woolvett). Kid decides to go after the cowboys, but not to face them alone he seeks the help of Will Munny (Clint Eastwood), a former cowboy known for cruel and terrible crimes from the past with his gang, who Kid heard through his uncle. Will hesitates at the beginning because it is now a family man and left his murdering live in the past after the death of his wife, but his farm is dying and his children are starving. Then decides to take up arms one last time, also asking for help to its former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). Now the three men ride to fulfill the job and claim their money, but they barely know the naive and sadistic man that Little Bill is.Let stepwise, Eastwood worked with two masters of Western, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, both ensured the career success of Eastwood. Sergio with the masterpiece trilogy "The Man With No Name" and Don in "Dirty Harry" (come on, full of western elements) and other westerns. So we can almost say that the entire career of Eastwood was based on Western movies. "Unforgiven" is not only the homage he does to both Sergio and Don (right after the credits this seems obvious), but also revolutionizes the Western genre forever.It all begins again with Eastwood, none of his characters from old westerns never missed a shot and always were the badass gunslinger from start to finish. In this movie, he misses the shot, falls off from his horse, gets beat up A LOT. And how this can be any good? Mainly because this had never happened to any Western hero, and tries to take the film also lead to a more realistic and human tone (years without using weapons is completely normal to happen).Thanks to David Webb's script, the film flows with a superb storytelling, giving the movie human characters who are facing the cruelty of the Old West. And also make use of the cliché of the Old West legends and turns it into simple rumors. For example, in Western movies there was a time when they mentioned a legend of the west, cowboys that never missed a shot and always killed the bad guy. This is demonstrated in the film when the British cowboy English Bob (Richard Harris) appears in town (also behind the bounty) honoring himself for his legendary past, and suddenly everything turns into nothing when Little Bill imposes its concept of justice.But while the film turns clichés into anything and humanizes his characters, even at the beginning with a humoristic tone. Eastwood never wrote the scripts of his films, but he always changed something them by adding their genius in history, giving the film a dark and violent tone as well. Also showing to the story, several times where a concept of what is violence and what is killing appears. They come from both words and epic scenes with the stylish direction of Eastwood, and thanks also to an explosive and gloomy 3rd act where everything comes together and makes up a chill in your bones.Eastwood shines behind the cameras, but also in front of her along with a exuberant cast: Eastwood, as I said shines; Morgan Freeman with one of his best performances; Gene Hackman who already had played the arch-rival of Superman proves to be one of the best villains ever put on a western movie (if you can call him villain, I would call him a sheriff very naive with a terrible bad-temper, building his beautiful home on the hills).The film that many consider the best western ever made (which is not, "The Good The Bad and The Ugly" is, dah). Well, surely one of them, with Eastwood paying tribute not only to his western-movies-career but to the long years of Leone and Siegel movies. Giving the story realistic and gloomy touches thanks to magnificent performances, excellent storytelling and superb direction. Eastwood presented us with his first of the many other masterpieces that he was yet to give us, who showed us the human side of the western mans, but in the end shows that legends will live forever.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Statement By A Western Against Its Own Heritage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defying the entire mythology of the Old Wild West, Unforgiven is unlike any western before or after it for this tale completely strips bare the very culture &amp; legacy that has built itself around the west and, in simple words, marks the end of a bygone era in cinema. And who better than Clint Eastwood to hammer down the final nail on this spent genre's coffin.Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny; a once merciless assassin in the glorifying days of the Wild West who now has retired to a peaceful life with his children. But when a young bloke shows up with an offer to join him for a bounty of $1000, Munny ties up his laces for one last time with the hope of providing a better future to his kids, only to find himself confronting with his violent past.Directed by Clint Eastwood who also stars as William Munny, Unforgiven presents the aging actor-director in commanding form, both in front &amp; behind the camera, and remains one of his most memorable works. Brilliant support also comes from Morgan Freeman playing Will's friend, Ned Logan, who joins him in the bounty but it's Gene Hackman who steals the show with his amazing portrayal of the town's sheriff.Throughout its runtime, the film has an atmosphere of a graveyard. It presents two aging characters who are well past their prime days about which they're not much proud of and presents them deeply filled with remorse &amp; haunted by their past on every corner. And in its pursuit to show the human side of the violence, this just might be a rare western that doesn't glorify the bloodshed.On an overall scale, Unforgiven may not have turned out the western I was expecting it to be but I really have deep admiration for what it tries to do. A superb tale of moral ambiguity that is nicely filmed &amp; firmly executed from start to finish, this swan song for westerns is Eastwood's tribute to his mentors, Sergio Leone &amp; Don Siegel, and is a bold statement against its own heritage. A must for every fan of the Wild West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"'Deserve's Got Nothing To Do With It"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on it its first run. It came out during a unique period in American history, right after the fall of the USSR and the First Gulf War but during a painful Recession. In some ways the US was riding high, but at the same time it was the captive of its own painful vulnerabilities and imperfections. That is the story of "Unforgiven," transmuted to the Old West.A tough man and his companions embark on a journey to right some wrongs. Along the way, we learn something about the man, but we don't get his full measure until the very end. What we learn turns everything upside down and leads to a very satisfying conclusion. This simple tale fits into the pure-Americana mold of "True Grit" and "The Searchers." If you haven't seen those two films, you should before you see this one. "Unforgiven" unmistakably walks in their giant footprints.The key to this film, I believe, is to learn exactly what Clint Eastwood's character, Bill Munny, stands for. At first we don't know what is special about him, or why anyone would approach him for help. He is just a simple farmer, and not a very successful one at that. But he is taken by a story of a prostitute who was unnecessarily and cruelly disfigured in a town called 'Big Whiskey.' While a bounty is involved, it's as insignificant to the quest as the payment in "True Grit." There are much larger issues at stake. There is an underlying air of chivalry that comes straight out of "True Grit": a wronged woman demands justice, vengeance is required, and the worthiness of those involved is irrelevant. Munny thus hooks up with an inexperienced young partner (an obvious commentary on the Glen Campbell role in "True Grit") and his reliable old comrade Ned (Morgan Freeman) and off they go.Gene Hackman is "Little Bill," a pompous windbag of a sheriff who rules Big Whiskey with the proverbial iron fist. He is riding high, and delights in not just beating his victims, but degrading them. Richard Harris ("English Bob"), a phony dime store novel hero, unwisely ventures into town accompanied, improbably, by his very own biographer (Saul Rubinek). Little Bill finds him fascinating but brings English Bob down to earth quickly. It is the rough and tumble old West where only raw power counts, and Little Bill has it.Perceptive and clever despite his own faults, Little Bill knows there are hired guns out to kill him. He captures and interrogates Ned, then kills him. When Munny is told this, he at first appears to simply accept it as something that happens in their line of work. Watch, however, his reaction change when he is told that Little Bill put Ned's corpse on display with a big sign saying "This is What Happens to Assassins Around Here." That reaction, one of the most dramatic in any Clint role, sets in motion the climax of the film. We also learn at this point that Munny himself is not, can never be, and cannot consider himself better than anyone else. That fact is important because it shows the source of his humbleness, the demons that haunt him and why he is driven to drink. His character is not the issue here, though, only what it impels him to do.Right after the 2001 terrorist attacks, I was riding in an airport van back to a hotel after being grounded. Rumors were rife, but everyone knew the world trade center was gone. Nobody knew what to say, but a fellow in the back said simply, "Someone's gonna pay for this." Exactly.It is not giving anything away to say that when Munny and Little Bill finally meet, there is a brief but epic exchange. "I don't deserve to die like this," Little Bill says. "'Deserve's got nothing to do with it," Munny replies. The whole meaning of the Munny character and, indeed, the film is encapsulated in that one line, in the same way that, say, "A Few Good Men" comes down to "You can't handle the truth." Little Bill is pleading his case, as a member in good standing of the community. He thinks his entire life's work should be taken into account before he is sentenced for what both of them know are unpardonable crimes. Munny unhesitatingly rejects that defense out of hand while acknowledging his own fallibility. Little Bill unfortunately had broken a tacit code of tough men: you may kill people that you must, but you don't take pleasure in their humiliation. A whore must not be deprived of the only thing she could be proud of, a harmless visitor should not be unnecessarily disgraced, a dead but honorable foe should not be publicly mocked. There shall be no mitigating factors whatsoever when you cross that line.So, you have America, with all its flaws and weaknesses, finally kicking Saddam Hussein out of his intended conquest, Kuwait, and Gorbachev finally tearing down that wall as Reagan demanded. Bill Munny, vile murderer and failure, rights some simple wrongs, and that is all anyone can do. As he rides out of town, you feel as if something greater than a man is present. It is not Munny riding that horse, but the eternal Avenger of honor and decency in the most humble of human forms. His final words temporarily bring the world back into simple balance. And, in this vale of tears, sometimes that's the best you can hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie to show a different western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are fascinated by Western movies, and young Eastwood dressed in scarves, then you should look at "Unforgiven", because I'm sure, it is different with any one Westerns you ever watched. Of course it is also Westerns, but you will find the same word that can has multiple meanings.What is your impression to the Westerns? Cowboys stand opposite, staring at each other, and suddenly someone move the wrist. Then a lot of people were killed by a hero(although you can not tell what part of the fight in the end). Yes, if you ever watched westerns, then you certainly have seen the above scenario. Very enjoyable, but people easily regard the performance of 19th century firearms too romantic. Fortunately, we have the "unforgivable", which can you tell us a little truth."fast is really not easy, but the most important thing is to stay calm" Little Bill, the sheriff's prison give the summary of the UK which can seems the mockery to the gunman of the entire group in 1960s westerns. The key to success is that you can stay in calm rather than meaningless hurry which hit your opponent, and your gun will not be fired to explosion. If this irony is not specific enough to see the final film shoot, you can probably understand the cowboy shooting in the real world in the end, where there is no fabulous marksmanship, no bizarre tactics, only good mental quality, cool-headed, and luck.One person kills five, (not including the people he gave free away) such a description is often easy to generate a lot of fantastic associations, but Eastwood tells us that it represents the fact that you can imagine with us far away from romantic, and even very funny,and happened. In this point, the illusion of the western shootout for some viewers will no longer exist.But it seems that Eastwood's ambition is far more than that, it is cruel to structural shootout of the survival of the Westerns trademark .He was not satisfied, he wanted to challenge the entire basis of the emotional Westerns. the cowboy heroism smash was a hit for the audience who saw their hero to be "bad" pain and who may be very depressed, but suddenly they found that compared with so-called "heroes", this point depressed is nothing, "Unforgiven" stripped of the illusion of fairy tale of Westerns and told us the real life state of cowboys who do not head all day long in the waistband belt to shoot and to kill, told us that "heroism " which get rid of justice of such a concept in their proportion of total world how limited.A total of eight people died in the film, which one is "bad guys", what a damn? Even if one of the worst, a momentary impulse to violence against prostitutes, farmers, small-damn Bill? A western legal system in the absence of peace efforts to ensure the town, prohibit access to all police officers who wear guns? Not honest, but at least he was not a bad guy? Or take the initiative to ask for forgiveness of another farmer guy? If you ask such questions, then you can not find the answer in the film, as the Will said: "This is not damn thing with this matter", what is justice, what is good and evil, where there is only a simple revenge in a world of violence, there is no point talking about the moral significance,no only the cowboy in U.S., and outlaw in China.If you understand this layer, you'll understand why such an old-fashioned westerns in the subject matter can win four Oscars in 1993, "Unforgiven" is beyond Westerns, but also summarized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the direction of this film is different compared to the western trilogy "Man with No Name". Since this movie is more of a brutal and realistic western, but it can be what came next for the "Man with No Name". Of what it came down to it all and the end of it all. What this western is, is a revelation of a western film and when it comes down to it, is a western that is most definitely worth seeing. Especially for any western fans, it would be a blasphemy not to watch this movie. This movie is a gritty western down to the bone, the portrayal of the characters is very well done as well. And a realistic portrayal at that. Clint Eastwood did not only do a amazing job of starring in this amazing movie but also proved again that he is indeed a great director even while starring in his own movie. This film is a atonement film for Clint's past work in the western genre since it deals with a person in the west trying to escape with his violent past. When I was younger I just couldn't see the greatness of this film, well I just enjoyed seeing stuff blow up and cool fight sequences back than. But seeing it now, it now I should have appreciated this movie sooner. I mean Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman in the same movie, that is all I need to say. Now I ain't saying just because a movie has phenomenal actors or actresses make it a phenomenal film but this film doesn't only have two phenomenal actors but it's a great film at that. Gene Hackman also puts on a powerful performance here as well. This movie shows a realistic gritty western and the worth of life and what it comes down to when killing a man, and how when it comes to killing there is no going back. Unforgiven is a unforgettable western, not the most entertaining western I seen but unforgettable never the less.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty Harry Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The meaning of a film is not contained in its declaration of intent." - V. F. Perkins "Unforgiven" finds actor/director Clint Eastwood seeking atonement for some of his past films. "I wanted to show the consequences of violence," he'd say in early promotional interviews, before claiming that "Unforgiven" is staunchly "anti violence".Screenwriter David Peoples wrote "Unforgiven" in the early seventies, amidst the Vietnam War and a slew of revisionist Westerns. Alongside this came the formation of the Cint persona, a persona embraced by the world but viewed with suspicion by some; surely Clint's characters were just walking, reactionary, right wing fantasies. Proto-fascist authoritarians who got their hands dirty and used a little tough-love and lawless violence, but only for the benign restoration of civil law and order. It's the old fascist con-job: give them the option of either total chaos or a "good fascist" like Clint, and let them choose. This echoes both the false dichotomy of Vietnam and our own, current era (choose between a post 9/11 world filled with "savages", or allow governments various extra-judicial privileges).But the traditional Western has itself always embodied an ideology of redemptive and purgative violence. Of this, historian Richard Slotkin says: "the Western myth portrays the redemption of the American spirit or fortune as something to be achieved by playing through a scenario of separation from 'civilization', temporary regression to a more primitive or 'natural' state, and regeneration through violence." In short, the Western myth hinges on ritualised, purgative violence, which in turn cleanses society of all that is wrong or savage. In many of his Westerns (and "Dirty Harry" movies), Eastwood himself upholds this idea of purgative violence. They're fantasies which encourage our allegiance to a skilled, Gothic avenger, who coolly blazes a path to cultural and personal restoration. "Unforgiven" hopes to reverse this trend.And so "Unforgiven", which somewhat resembles Peoples' "Blade Runner" screenplay, stars Eastwood as Will Munny, a reformed alcoholic who is hired to kill the cowboys responsible for cutting a prostitute. The prostitute lives in Big Whiskey, a town which represents a corrupt version of American society driven by a burgeoning capitalism. Here, the Law, as represented by Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman, the corruption of his town represented through his shortcomings as a carpenter), protects private property at the expense of human rights. Yes the prostitutes ? themselves property - were cut up, and Daggett sympathises with them, but to arrest the men responsible for the crime would be to drive away business. And so blind eyes are turned.Interestingly, the film's cycle of revenge and retribution is initiated when the cut woman, Delilah, giggles at the diminutive penis of the man, Quick Mike, who will soon assault her. Just as the Delilah of the Old Testament persuades Samson to cut his long hair (and in so doing saps his strength), Delilah's giggle also functions as a kind of emasculation; an affront to Mike's manhood. All of "Unforgiven's" violence stems from threats to male potency.The film introduces several ancillary characters, all of whom question various genre conventions. And so we're subjected to young gunslingers who "talk the talk" but are blind and inept, black sidekicks who are promptly slaughtered and characters who are drawn to violence solely because of a culture which mythologises/romanticises killing. Clint is himself not a "spectral hero", but a fleshy human, poor shot (he adapts by using a shotgun), hates horses, hates the outdoors, and owes his life to getting lucky in the film's climactic showdown. Another character, W. W. Beauchamp, is a walking myth-maker who prints the tall tales orated to him whilst overlooking messier truths (see Ford's "Liberty Valance" and Altman's "Buffalo Bill"). Another character, English Bob, alludes to American's monarchist roots, and serves as a means of exploration the various heroic myths which Westerns routinely perpetuate. Bob is himself a figure of pomp and pageantry, until Little Bill stomps his face in (and twists his gun, emasculating him). From here on, Bob's accent shifts from high class English to a working class, Cockney accent. "You're all lawless savages!" he yells. Clint's point: none of these characters have any law, honour or conform to genre expectations.But of course even the "traditional" westerns of the 1950s did this. Only the most simplistic Westerns drew on unproblematic distinctions between the hero's "good violence" and the villain's "bad", or encouraged a naive allegiance to the Western hero. Many of the genre's supposed "classics" ("High Noon", "Searchers", "The Far Country", "Rancho Notorious", "Ox Bow Incident", any western by Wellman or Anthony Mann) are distinctive precisely for their examination of the hero's motives and/or his use of violence. And while "Unforgiven" takes a subversive approach to violence throughout most of its running time (most notably a protracted, subversive hill-top shoot out), it depends almost entirely on countercliches, before eventually conforming wholesale to genre with its "Shane" (1953) inspired climax.As Slotkin writes, the Western myth assigns a supreme value to the climactic gunfight: "specific versions of the myth may vary in their ideological rationale, but they do not vary in their representation of a consummatory act of violence - whatever its motivation - as the necessary and sufficient resolution of all the issues the tale has raised." "Unforgiven" is no different. It can't extricate itself from the violence it supposedly critiques (and the expectations of an audience raised on both genre and the satisfying release afforded by dramatic, violent purges). Clint is himself still Dirty Harry, the outsider who takes upon himself the White Man's Burden, nobly (but fraudulently) absorbing sin and scorn in order to keep your town clean. You sympathise with him, and accept his bullets as being the only choice.8/10 ? See "Shotgun Stories", "Hud" and "Hombre".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of a new Eastwood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best picture winner of 1992 was Unforgiven, a western that, in my opinion, really started the career of actor/director Clint Eastwood. Before Unforgiven he had done the Dirty Harry series, some war movies, and some westerns. Unforgiven was the first time he won an Oscar, and it wasn't the last. And I hope it still isn't the last. ' Here's the plot: After a woman is beaten and not delivered justice, two cowboys(Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeeman) become vigilantes and try to deliver justice to the town. The justice that the evil town sheriff(the brilliant Gene Hackman) fails to deliver.Unforgiven is among the many great westerns ever made. There is a lot of action, a lot of thrills, and explosive acting, especially from Gene Hackman, who has never been more evil. You feel real evil whenever he's on screen.It's not quite my favorite western. To be honest, my favorite has got to be the Christian Bale/ Russell Crowe western, 3:10 to Yuma. But Unforgiven is an excellent western that grips you the whole way through. I am not a fan of westerns and I still really enjoyed Unforgiven.I must say that the performances here are the movie. Eastwood and Freeman are lovable characters, though I felt that Richard Harris's performance as English Bob was unnecessary, he was great also, but the best scenes are with Gene Hackman. You couldn't find a more corrupt law man in Internal affairs.Unforgiven isn't perfect, but its a very good film that I believe kicked off the career of Clint Eastwood. And in that sense, the film is a miracle. Hollywood needs Clint Eastwood, and though the man is ancient, I hope he's around for a long time.A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Eastwood's finest!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As those who have read my stuff before will know, I'm not really big on Westerns; I guess I watched too many of them when I was growing up (they were just about the only films on TV). The Spaghetti Westerns peeked my interest for a while, but there have been very few in recent years that have caught my curiosity. This, however, is a different kettle of fish altogether. This is one of the few that I could watch several times over and still get something out of. Clint Eastwood really knows how to tell a story; I suppose while working with the likes of Sergio Leone, something had to rub off. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.When a whore is cut up by a couple of ranch hands and the local law, Little Bill Daggett, does little or nothing a bout it, the other whores pool their resources in order to get retribution. Word is put out that a bounty of One Thousand Dollars has been put up for the lives of the two perpetrators. A young man calling himself The 'Schofield Kid' hears about it but decides he might need some help. He calls on Bill Munny, a former gunfighter and asks him to come out of retirement. Bill is a reformed character, having married and raised a family, but with his wife recently deceased, he is tempted. He sends the kid on his way, but can't help thinking about it. Eventually he decides to follow and leaves his children to fend for themselves while he's away. He calls on his old partner, Ned Logan, and persuades him to join them. Meanwhile, back in the town, another gunslinger, English Bob, arrives and is given short shrift by Little Bill, who makes an example of him and sends him on his way. The trio finally arrive in town with Munny suffering from a fever. He is badly beaten up by Little Bill but not before the other two make contact with the whores. They manage to find a hideout where Munny can recover. The question is, will they still have the stomach to do what they came for? I'll leave it there as I'm sure there are many out there that haven't seen this and I don't want a show-down with the spoiler police in my local saloon.As with many Eastwood-directed films, this has quite a slow and deliberate pace, but it is always interesting. I love the way he allows the story to evolve. As usual, an excellent performance from Clint Eastwood himself as Bill Munny. Also great were Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggett, Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan and Richard Harris as English Bob? but why they picked an Irish actor for the part I'll never know! Also worthy of note was Jaimz Woolvett as The 'Schofield Kid'.As I've already said, the storytelling is excellent and the characters are interesting and hold your attention. I get the impression they were looking for realism in the look of this picture and it does look like what I imagine the Wild West really was like. I just wish they had made the interior shots a little brighter, much of the action takes place at night or indoors and you can believe they are shooting by candle-light in some scenes, it's so dark! This is the thing that let this one down for me, I was struggling to see who was shooting who in some situations. But that aside, it's a very fine piece of work and fully deserved it's 4 Oscars (including best picture) and five other Oscar nominations. This one comes highly RECOMMENDED.My Score: 8.7/10 IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (116,751 votes when this review was written) Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (56 reviews counted when this review was written)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ode to all westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would try to explain why I love Clint Eastwood so damn much, but luckily Sergio Leone already did it for me: "I like Clint Eastwood because he has only two facial expressions: one with the hat, and one without it". Very true, but the great thing is that he doesn't need any more. Clint Eastwood standing on an overly sunny hilltop and squinting to see nothing in particular, is there any shot in the cinema universe more effective than that? "Unforgiven" might be his masterpiece when it comes to the western genre, his pain has never been so intense and all his co-stars are in great shape as well. It's a beautiful introvert story filled with regret and lost memories, riveting from the first minute until the last. There isn't even that much of the classic gun action, nor does there need to be. Rarely has an Oscar winner been so deserving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely beautifully shot Western - classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly my favourite Western of all time. Can't believe it's nearly 20 years old. Beautifully framed and shot by Eastwood. The morality is grey and unclear - who are the 'good' guys and who are the 'bad' guys? Hackman, Freeman, and Eastwood - a true power team. All three are mesmerising on the screen, in particular Hackman. You almost wish there was a prequel movie showing you more of the background for English Bob and Bill Dagget. This is one movie that truly shows you the consequences of violence and how it affects each of the characters. Watching it on an HD TV with digital remastered special edition DVD with surround headphones - wow, just wow. It's like you're in the West with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Deserve's Got Nothing To Do With It"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed to me that English Bob was only in the area of Big Whiskey to rest, have a drink..and have a game of billiards. But Bob brought two items with him. His biographer, and English Bob's attitude. Being an enforcer for the railroads was not a crime. But bounty hunting, well, that was a crime, too. I suppose. Most of the dirty jobs of gunning down "assassins" and making the sheriff's own policies belonged to Little Bill Baggett. Bill the Sheriff was not wrong about a lot of things and policies, but Baggett had a violent way of dealing with "problems". So English Bob was interested in a game of billiards, but he also deliberately ignored the gun law in Baggett's town. Much like Wyatt Earp's towns in the Old West. With the apparent difference that Earp was trying to stop outlaws. Were English Bob and William Munny outlaws? Yes, I suppose they were. But they were not riding in gangs like Jesse James or red-legs. And for all I know bounty killing was not a crime. Except maybe in Big Whiskey, Montana.Little Bill may have believed English Bob was a bounty hunter for the prostitutes, that part was never very clear. Later it becomes clear that The Kid has a healthy appetite for "billiards", and this has a major influence on the way things go later on. In the beginning, the prostitute Delilah has an infraction against her. At least according to the men involved. And so, the prostitutes don't have much recourse except to accept Bill Baggett's decision about the assault on Delilah. Except for Strawberry Alice. She is angry and she thinks the whole decision is a raw deal. The Kid, also known as the Scofield Kid, brings William Munny into the drama. Clint Eastwood plays a pig farmer who can barely mount his horse. Who is not used to being rode, but it is sort of funny. Munny is at first not too good with a pistol. He practices there at the farm using an old tobacco can. Munny is better with a rifle. The reformed outlaw loves his two young ones, and is true to his wife, who has been dead near a decade. And William Munny has not had a drink. Not for a long, long, time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A last kick at the can for El Manco.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A prostitute is cut in the face by two cowboys and her peers put a $1000 price on their heads. Great movie. Great story. And what a send off for the Man With No Name! And I don't care what the critics say of the dark, melancholic mood of the film, or the excessive violence, the unrealistic ending and so on. As a devoted fan of El Manco since the early days of his celluloid life, during the 60s, when as a young student used to go with my teenage friends, after school, see each one of his instalments, and even followed him later in his reincarnation as Dirty Harry, I think I deserved it. We deserved it, me and all those lunatics who recognized true value in what most great film experts had discarded as useless. Eastwood owed this to us. Because I'm talking of a time when "Leone/Eastwood" was no more than a two--word punch line in Hollywood; when what that nutty Italian fellow was doing to the western was something to snicker at it, never to consider seriously. But by then already we, the fans, had come to realize that such a couple was the best thing ever happening to the genre. That's why I believe that this Leone-inspired final shootout in the bar was dedicated to us, the fans of the first hour; those who cheered at a time when the "serious movie people", the experts, Hollywood, were all too busy laughing.Of course, for the purists, this is not an older MWNN--he was a bounty hunter, while Munny is an outlaw--and this is not an appendix to the Leone trilogy. On the other hand, if UF ends up in such an explosion of violence it's precisely because that's the way a Leone western must end, with El Manco mowing down the opposition and then riding away. The problem there was how to include such an epic, intense, yet unrealistic conclusion into an otherwise realistic plot. To this, the answer for most seems to be simply that Munny is still the reckless SOB he always was?but we, the old fans, know better: there was no other possible way for CE's western persona to go but doing it "? la Leone", the rest is excuse. So, those reviewers who worried about his kids' future may rest assured; everything is okay, Munny is not an out of control psycho. There was just the need for the spaghetti ending there.Then again, Leone's westerns never pretended to be realistic, that's why the violence in them flows freely, abundantly, to the point of exaggeration. More than anything else, they are Verdian Operas, they were meant to be enjoyed by their visuals, their atmosphere and their music. On the other hand, Unforgiven is more of Shakespearean drama, more akin to reality than to art itself. That's why we see here how people really suffer when abused, wounded, killed. That's the reason why its conclusion appears so amplified in its violence and brutality. Eastwood knew this and he also knew that he had to make the two sub-genres fit, merge, somehow--the obvious answer, as I said, was making of Munny an enduring SOAG of a killer. Now, as for the moral ambiguity to which everyone keep referring in these reviews, maybe so; but nobody can deny that the bloody end to Little Bill's little fascist regime was a good thing to happen after all, something to applaud rather than to regret. So El Manco fades away with still another good deed in his log. Good for him.Maybe IMDb doesn't look too kindly on this, but I have to mention the inordinate amount of nonsensical criticism I have seen in many negative reviews of the film. For ex., some complain that some of the English spoken here is post WWII. Gimme a break! Do they speak Old Latin in Shakespeare's Julius Cesar, by any chance? Or about the misanthropy of it: the only women portrayed are prostitutes. GMAB again! At that time there were only two kinds of women in the West: whores....and Claudias. Women who had already died by disease, giving birth or by fatigue; or who were too busy trying to survive, trying to raise the few surviving children they had left, to have time to appear in a saga like this. Some say also that the characters are one-dimensional, that they lack complexity. GMAB for a 3rd time! How that could have been otherwise when their lives were one-dimensional! The life of a prostitute was all about getting laid and getting paid. For the people working from dawn to dusk in the farms, well, that was their life. And so on. That's how rich and complex their lives were. The truth is, ordinary people have never had much time for philosophizing or for pondering about complex ideas. Ever since Antiquity the task of questioning the meaning of life, of wondering about God's existence and purposes, has been left to the affluent, real of fictional as they may be. People who don't have to worry about scratching a living each day. Socrates, Kant, Hamlet, Quixote were all affluent people. So, if you want to see people behaving in Unforgiven as they would do in Bonanza, tormentingly pondering on the ethics of collecting a debt from a poor widow or agonizing about how to say something to someone without hurting his feelings, then you have come to the wrong place. Finally, for the criticism about too much violence in the film, I'll just recall: half a million dead, in a very real, just ended, civil war.A great movie and perhaps an enduring classic. Great acting all across the board. But I think that the best actors here were those two kids, who managed to keep perfectly straight faces while Munny was doing his Curly-tries-to-get-on-horseback number.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I shot the sheriff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dang me if I know why this film was called "Unforgiven" - "God-forsaken" would have been nearer to the truth in Clint Eastwood's final word on the western genre, a genre in which he's arguably been one of the two most iconic figures (along with Wayne, of course). Duke would never have taken on this gig however as director Eastwood portrays a west more wasted than wild, with all the main characters exhibiting at different times weakness and cowardice, often covered by that sort of macho toughness only usually seen in, well, John Wayne movies. How the principals face up to their fears defines the impact of the movie.Eastwood himself is a retired gunslinger gone to seed, bringing up his two young kids alone, now his younger wife has died, sought out by young "cry-wolf" aspirant Jamiz Woolvett's "The Schofield Kid", to join him on the trail of two bandits, let off lightly by omnipotent local sheriff "Little Billy", (played with relish by Gene Hackman) after they ruthlessly cut a local prostitute for impugning their manhood. The prostitutes themselves send out word that they'll pay a $100 reward for the wanted men, which initially attracts Richard Harris's unusual character "English Bob" (why not Irish Bob?), who's promptly sent packing in a scene set up to showcase Hackman's brutality and the size of the task ahead. Initially reluctant to follow, Eastwood, despite demonstrating how out of condition he is at both riding and shooting, can't resist the lure of the money and/or the nobility of the cause and pausing briefly to recruit his old-time friend, a miscast Morgan Freeman en-route, it's not long before they meet up with Hackman and the prostitutes and the action really starts.Guilty as ever of dialogue and camera - movements as slow and deliberate as his own drawl, Eastwood eases us into the film, defining each character carefully and clearly, setting up the premise and providing a satisfying climax, when, inspired by Hackman's barbaric slaying of Freeman, who himself conquers under pain of death the cowardice that forced him to abandon the initial quest, he returns alone to the fray where the old reflexes kick in and his Willie character delivers the goods and rights the wrongs of the evil-doers.I haven't seen every Eastwood western from his younger days, but even I got the nods to the Man With No Name character, who Willie Munny might just be, 40 years down the line. This time though, Eastwood de-mythologises the genre's trademark heroism and bravery as it's only under severe provocation that he overcomes his demons and gives Hackman his just desserts. There's a few (only a few mind), humorous touches - Hackman's attempts at carpentry and Eastwood turning down a "free-one" from the prostitutes, but in the main it's bleak, gripping stuff.As I indicated above, I'm not sure Harris' presence added much to the film, while Freeman seems to be there just because he's Clint's real-life mate, but then I suppose Wayne wasn't short of favourites either. The cinematography is superb, however, all dark and autumnal, a fitting backdrop to the lives of the characters depicted here chasing the light into their old age, the background music is likewise muted and understated. Eastwood was later to debunk his other great screen persona - the vigilante cop, in the equally worthy "Gran Torino" and you have to admire the integrity and daring of the elderly director there as here, big enough and brave enough, in his twilight years, to underscore the very clichés on which he initially made his own name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, fine. I'll admit Westerns are my least favorite genre. I chose to review this one, Unforgiven, as my final of my "I Love the 90s!" special review series as not only did I love this movie and that it made a huge impact on me, but it opened my eyes to the world of the Western. It taught me?they, too, can be well made.I always like to get what I don't like about movies out of the way first. Only two this time, thankfully. The PACING is sooo?.slow. And the line "I ain't going back to the way I was," or the like, was used roughly 12+ times.I will both criticize these two bothersome attributes and defend them. I didn't like how the pacing was at a snail's speed?yet, I think it was necessary for the time it was portraying. In the movie's defense, this is how time was. It wasn't paced with the current I-Phone or the Droid X. It was in tune with the dust devils and people liked it that way back then. Heck, I might like it toned down to finally enjoy life.#2: that line by William Munny (Eastwood) was repeated multiple times, both by Munny and his peers. Obviously, it's done as a "premeditation." Fine, that might be a spoiler, but it's an obvious conclusion as whether Bella will choose Jacob or Edward. (I promised myself I'll never use a Twilight reference, but I thought it fit here.)Okay, on with the movie. Unforgiven is NOT my favorite Western, but it's damn near close. It has awesome acting, superior cinematography, fantastic lines (aside from the aforementioned "ain't" line repeated) and an incredible story with excellent characters. Take the sheriff, Little Bill (Hackman) who's bad, but has reasoning behind his badness. And Munny, himself, who was bad, and must make money (no coincidence there in reference to his name) to support his post-killer lifestyle and his (now) motherless children.Here's the synopsis: a female prostitute is cut up bad and is aided by her slutty peers in a reward to murder her attackers. Sheriff Little Bill actually does try to make amends, but it isn't good enough for either the "owner" of the whore, or the scandalous ladies so they seek revenge.Ex-Murderers Munny and ex-partner Ned Logan (Freeman) join thrill-seeking Schofield Kid (Woolvett) to gain more in their pocket book with the "right motives" this time. But, Little Bill has plans of domination of the town and a travelling writer.There's a lot more and I would encourage everyone to be as surprised as I was while watching this, time and again.The scenery is crisp, gorgeous, in fact, and it's a wonderful reunion of the Western and Mr. Eastwood that has long since abandoned both the genre and his career. If this wasn't the career rebirth (i.e. Travolta in Pulp Fiction) of the century ? SEE: all of his accomplishments since, I don't know what one is.Everyone acted extraordinary in this piece, but Freeman and Hackman stood out. Even though, I'm not a follower of the genre, I loved this movie. SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winner examines the mythic violence of the Western, taking on the ghosts of his own star past.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hired gunman (Clint Eastwood), now eking out a living as a farmer, is tempted back for one last job - to collect a reward for the thugs who carved up a prostitute. The film was inducted into the United States National Film Registry in 2004.Unforgiven is one of the all-time great Westerns, a film aware of the historical tradition in which it operates, and one that finds something new to say within its genre. Eastwood is superb as William Munny, weary of life and especially weary of violence. He is buttressed by a wonderful supporting cast, notably Gene Hackman as a callous sheriff and Morgan Freeman as his former partner. At a point when it was widely assumed Westerns were film-making history, Eastwood proved them spectacularly wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last of a Genre....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" is, in many ways, Clint Eastwood's magnum opus on westerns. We won't be seeing many more like this one, and there have not been many made since that come close to this one. It's like Clint himself saw the writing on the wall for the western, and composed a cinematic opus that would stand on its own, and which incorporated a number of themes and elements that would not have been allowed on screen during the heyday of the "spaghetti" westerns. Morgan Freeman's presence breaks ground in the movie, as he is not playing a cook or a servant or some other stereotypical role. Clintwood casts him as an equal, and as a past partner in crime, and the chemistry between the two is part of what makes the film work so well. Gene Hackman is sufficiently oily as Little Bill, the sadistic sheriff, and the late Richard Harris as English Bob gives us plenty of the foreign perspective on the goings-on in the wild west. I have wondered what might have happened if Clint had decided to cast Harris as Little Bill. It seemed plausible to me...but second guessing Eastwood at this point serves no useful purpose...the film went on to critical acclaim and commercial success...and it's one of the films that I would not just want to watch, but would also want as part of my collection. Two old style gunslingers go out on a final fling to collect reward money if and when they catch up to a bunch of yahoo cow-pokes who cut up a whore in a brothel. The other whores do not feel that she has gotten justice, and they pool their resources to put out the reward to have the culprits done in. Eastwood as Munny plays a dangerous killer who has turned his life around and put his guns away. He has become a hog farmer, and it is getting the best of him. With two kids to support he has to think about the future...at least for the welfare of his progeny. When this opportunity comes his way, he turns his back on it at first...but then reconsiders. The money he stands to make is a temptation he cannot afford to pass up, and he wants to give his kids a fresh start at something other than sod-farming. He changes his mind, recruits Morgan Freeman ( as Ned, his old running buddy from the gun-slinging days), and the situations and people they encounter on the journey are what fills the screen in this very engaging drama of the old west as it was fading. I have a few caveats as far as sexual situations and language...as well as some gratuitous violence. But the film is terrific, and it is definitely a worthwhile watch. The last of a genre...yes...but it is a movie that is very nearly a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How a Western should be made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Unforgiven Clint Eastwood was more famous as an actor, his most famous roles being the Man with No Name and Inspector Harry Callahan. He started directing in the 70s and developed a good reputation, but it was Unforgiven that propelled Eastwood into category of a great director. He won his first best director Oscar and reinvented the Western genre.Eastwood plays William Munnay, a retired outlaw, living as a widower, father and a farmer. He sets out to live a peaceful live, but is struggling financially. He gets an offer from The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a young outlaw saying that in a small town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming there is the bounty of $1000 for two men who cut up a woman played by Anna Levine. Will and The Schofield Kid team up and bring in Will's former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and set off to claim the reward. But the town sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) claims the debt for the crime has already been settled and would violently uphold his law and keep peace in his town.Eastwood, along with John Warne is considered on of the greatest icons of the Western genre. With The Name with no Name Trilogy Sergio Leone and Eastwood were able to reinvent the genre by increasing the level of violence and bringing more adult tones. With Unforgiven Eastwood reinvented the genre once again, making the violence more realistic and gave the genre a more Earthy, gritty tone. Eastwood's direction was excellent, setting a sombre tone throughout with light music and with his cinematography Jack N. Green filmed in a darker tone, reflected the film. Eastwood set out to let the audience find out about the characters and sets out to make a film with depth. You could fill the dirt of the Old West. It was also interesting move that most of the characters, the outlaws and the sheriff being older men, showing that there was an old guard who were men of violence. But these were men who were also wanted to change themselves but still in their 50s and 60s.There is a great cast in this film: Eastwood, Freeman and Hackman are all great actors and are on top form in this film. Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever in a film and Freeman is always good. Hackman really shows his ruthless side and talent throughout, and that he was one tough mother! But it wasn't just a show for the acting veterans, Woolvett showed that he was a promising acting, having a wide range as an actor. It was a shame that he did not get to live up to his potential. Levine too gives a powerful performance the scarred prostitute.David Peoples wrote an excellent screenplay. The story is simple and down-to-Earth, but he was able to bring about complex backstories to his characters and there are wider themes. The film looks at the issue of hero worship and that there was no glory in the world of violence. There is a dark morality throughout the film, but these were characters living in a violence world. Peoples shows his talent as a writer. Peoples also set out to show some historical details like the rise of pulp western fiction and how some outlaws became popular. But whilst the film was good, one small criticism was the inclusion of English Bob (Richard Harris). His character was really a stock character to show Little Bill's ruthless nation. It also felt artificial that the character was English, showing a stereotypical side of a posh English person. It would have been more realistic and had more impact if the character was from America, from a state like Texas or Arizona.Overall Unforgiven is an essential film to watch and was deserving of the awards it got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myths, Debunked And Reinvented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like one out of every two reviews of Unforgiven congratulate it on it's breaking down of the mythology of the old west.However, it takes the void left by throwing out and dancing on the grave of all the old clichés and fills it with it's own brand of pessimistic mythology, in which the west is unrelentingly portrayed as a vast, unforgiving (no pun intended) wasteland of violence, injustice, hypocrisy, and hate, where no one is really innocent and redemption another myth to be discarded.In other words, it takes on the trappings of a yarn, in spite of itself, especially during it's (intentionally?) ironic, pulp-fiction inspired climax, in which Clint Eastwood walks in the front door of a saloon and takes on a roomful of armed men, walking away without a scratch.Overall, it's a great film and a superior western drama. Gene Hackman runs away with the entire show, as well as a much-deserved Oscar, Golden Globe, and just about every other major award that can be bestowed upon an actor in a supporting role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western where things are not black/white...a lot of gray in this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This western is not your typical one, it is about a couple of guys who cut up a prostitute and the prostitutes in return offer a reward for killing these guys as they do not think the guys got enough punishment from the local sheriff. Well a man who was apparently a really bad outlaw and is now a man of the lord raising his two children as his wife has passed on is recruited by a young gun wanting to get the reward for killing the two guys. Well the old gunslinger gets his old friend to come along and the three of them are now after the bounty. The movie though poses a lot of questions like who exactly is the bad guy in this piece and who are the good guys? The answer is there really are no bad guys and good guys. Clint's character and the other two assassins as they are called are just in need of work and actually show regret over the ones they killed at points in the movie. The sheriff seems to have a short fuse and he does go over the line from time to time especially in his handling of Richard Harris' character and especially Morgan Freeman's character. Still, he is the lawman and he is trying to do the best he can for the town he is in as he does not want people coming in to collect bounties and killing. I have to say the worst people in this one are the prostitutes as they are the ones who invite all the trouble and misery in town. Sure the woman got cut up, but why did they feel the need to kill both men, the younger one was sort of bullied into helping his friend cut up the gal who survived the attack. If the older prostitute cared so much for the younger one perhaps she could have explained the dos and don'ts of being a call girl. Still, it is a movie of interpretations as I am sure people could argue that the assassins are bad, Hackman's character the sheriff is bad and all sorts of ways to put it. The acting is really good, I kind of wish the Richard Harris character was in it a bit more. If there is fault in the movie it is that it tends to move slowly in areas and while I sort of like the interpretations I sort of like a movie a bit more cut and dry, however seeing as there are plenty of those movies this one looks more unique and so that minus can also be a plus. So while I am not normally into westerns this one is actually rather good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgiveness: Internal/ External?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie, and well deserving of its accolades. Eastwood deals with the subtleties of perception and reality better than anyone in Hollywood today. He is not afraid to show himself as a troubled figure with scars, afflictions, demons, and chronic shortcomings. The fact that the audience cares so deeply about the central characters is testament to a master at work.This is not a film without flaws. Eastwood's character is off-screen far too long during the English Bob sequence, and Beauchamp's contribution needs to be edited. These two flaws give the film a somewhat uneven tone, but thankfully do not spoil the legacy of this film.In 'Unforgiven', Eastwood is credited as 'director and producer', a key switch on the usual Tinseltown priorities. Eastwood's direction is raw, unflinching, brutal, and tender. Eastwood deserved a Best Director award for 'The Outlaw Josey Wales', and Hollywood seriously erred by not recognizing that; 'Unforgiven' is a satisfying denouement to a directorial career and the Western genre. This is a film that you remember long after it ends- and one that gets better with each viewing.Best quote: "It's a hell of a thing to kill a man. Take away all he's got.......and all he's ever gonna have."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak and Brilliant (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an Anti Western or perhaps, I should more accurately call it a Anti-Hollywood Western. William Munny, a reformed killer, with an African American gunslinger for a buddy (original if unlikely), abandons his young family to chase after some revenge money offered by the hookers of Big Whiskey. One of whom has been scarred by the knife of a young foolhardy cowboy. For most of the movie, Munny appears to be too old, too inept and "past it" to menace anybody and upon reaching his destination he is severely thrashed by the sadistic self righteous sheriff, Little Bill, who had already demonstrated to us,his vicious and cruel streak when ridding his town of another bounty hunter English Bob, whose humiliation is hard to watch. When his buddy, Ned, recognises that his (Ned) nerve has gone and decides to go home, Munny, accompanied by a young, wannabe killer continues with his intention of claiming the "reward" Ned, meanwhile, is unfortunate enough to fall into the none too tender hands of Little Bill who mercilessly tortures him to death. This transforms the previously none too impressive Munny into an "Angel of Death". (One of Satan's friends, not The Lord's) This terrifying monstrosity of a human being, avenges his buddy and intimidates the folks of Big Whiskey. His execution of the sheriff is cold-blooded and conscience free. No niceties exist when William Munny gets really mad. The casting of an African American as a gunslinger apart, this is a well written and directed movie. The old adage that "a leopard does not change it's spots" is well realised and the landscape around Big Whiskey is captured, by the camera, in a way that helps create an atmosphere of bleakness. This is not Clint as the western hero of yore. The kindest description of Mr.William Munny is............... GRIM.................9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven... Deserve has nothing to do with it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven: 8 out of 10: Winner of four Oscars including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Gene Hackman) Unforgiven is one of those movies that are just about perfect.Story is Clint Eastwood sat on the script for years until he was old enough to play the lead role. Much as Gran Torino was a revisionist ride into the sunset for his Dirty Harry Character, Unforgiven is a revisionist ride into the sunset for The Man With No Name.Eastwood plays a recent widower. He used to be a right bastard but his wife of ten years healed his soul and bore him two children. He no longer drinks, takes Gods name in vain and beats his horse. He also no longer kills.Things are bad for Eastwood, struggling as a pig farmer with no money and sick pigs. Temptation comes in the form of a young gunslinger (Jaimz Woolvett) who is after a thousand dollar bounty for killing two cowboys who cut up a prostitute.The film is about Eastwood trying to keep hold of the good man he had become while suppressing the demons inside.The film, shot in Alberta, is deliberately paced and beautiful. Eastwood (who also directed) uses natural light indoors and large expanses outside. It truly feels at the proper time and place (One 50 star US flag goof notwithstanding.) In many ways, this is Gene Hackman&#x2019;s film as much as Eastwood&#x2019;s. Hackman plays the sheriff in the town where the prostitute was cut. He wants to keep the peace and has no qualms of being brutal in his enforcement. However, he also is a guy finishing his house down at the river and looking towards retirement. The Wild West is aging and people are looking to settle down in peace.The rest of the supporting cast is spot on with Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris giving strong support. The film is brutal in both its action and the psychology of the men involved. The story works as both a real tale and epic allegory. A fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sickness and Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just felt awful after seeing this film. I had that same feeling after watching Taxi Driver and Deliverance. There is never a bright light anywhere. We begin with Eastwood's character visiting his wife's grave. He is a sad, defeated man. His life has been given over to violence and the one person who has salvaged some of it is now dead. Enter a young gunslinger who doesn't know anything about killing and what is involved in it. He is on his way to kill a couple cowboys who were responsible for the maiming of a prostitute. Eastwood falls to the need to feed his little children because his hogs are sick and bad times are on the way. He engages his old friend played by Morgan Freeman and get the bunch of them in way over their heads. If there is a more complete villain than Gene Hackman in all of film, I'm not sure who it is. He is killing machine who is in control of his empire. He lives on the fear of others. He brutalizes people and then grins. He is working on a house, hoping to sit down and enjoy the sunsets at some point. But you don't mess with him. Everyone understands that and they fall in line. Ultimately this movie is about the price of killing. Despite his declining years, Eastwood has had a stomach full of it and when his friend is brutalized by Hackman, well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. It's just that it brings on the darkest feelings in the soul. Maybe that's the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wyoming, Big Whiskey, in 1880.Cowboy Quick Mike slashes the face of a prostitute, Delilah Fitzgerald.His fellow Davey Bunting attempts to stop him.The local sheriff, Little Bill Daggett fines the two cowboys seven ponies, payable to the prostitute's pimp and saloon owner, Skinny Dubois.The other prostitutes, led by their madam Strawberry Alice, are furious over the small punishment those men got.They decide to offer a $ 1000 reward to anyone who kills the two.In western Kansas The Schofield Kid arrives to the farm of William Munny.He lives there with his two kids, his wife has deceased a few years earlier.The Kid knows of his past, that he was an infamous gunfighter, murderer and bandit.But he doesn't know that he has left all that behind him.But he gets him to grab on his rifle one more time.But he won't go on the journey without his former partner, Ned Logan.In Wyoming we see how the sheriff runs the city.English Bob and his biographer, W.W. Beauchamp get off the train and ride into Big Whiskey.There is a no firearms policy in town, and English Bob doesn't believe in that.Little Bill ruthlessly beats him up and puts him in jail.His author pal stays in town and chronicles Little Bill's stories.Later, on a stormy night, Little Bill also beats the feverish and sick William Munny.But they still have a task that needs to be finished.Unforgiven (1992) is a Clint Eastwood movie.This earned him two Oscars, and for Gene Hackman and Joel Cox for editing.David Webb Peoples wrote the screenplay in the 1970's.First it was going to be a Francis Ford Coppola movie.Then Clint found it, and waited for the right time to shoot it.He wanted to play the part himself, and in the early 90's he was just the right age to play the part of William Munny.And he is good, he is real good.There is a lot of depth in his character.He's a man who doesn't feel proud of his past, the man he was.And now he has to go and be that man again.Morgan Freeman is something else as his former partner.Gene Hackman as the villainous sheriff is unforgettable.And the fact, that he's building a house, badly, makes his somewhat a human.Jaimz Woolvett as The Kid is terrific.I can't believe he didn't become a bigger star after that.Richard Harris is marvelous as English Bob.Saul Rubinek as the nervous Beauchamp is brilliant.Anna Levine plays the part of Delilah really well.And so does Frances Fisher as Alice.This is a grand modern western, that shows us the way of the west.To kill those cowboys is something that just needs to be done.More than anything this is a movie about the nature of violence.You kill because you have to, but there's nothing glorious in killing.There's no beauty there, it's plain ugly.There are two great scenes, where that all comes out.One is where those three are firing at each other from behind rocks.Davey is wounded badly, and Munny has to finish him since Ned can't do that.They wound The other is where The Kid does his first killing, shooting the man while he's sitting in the outhouse.He doesn't feel great about it, even though he had it coming.This is also a movie about the western mythology.The ending is superb, something you can't forget.There the man becomes a myth.Munny goes into the saloon and shoots everyone, except the author who witnesses the whole thing.He rides off and becomes the legend of the west.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Deserve's got nothing to do with it."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" is regarded as one of the best Westerns of all time and easily the best Western in recent decades. The film is a revisionist Western, eschewing 'good guys' and 'bad guys' in favour of a more realistic approach rife with moral ambiguity.The story concerns a retired gunslinger (Eastwood) taking on a last job in order to help support his family. With his seasoned buddy Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the unproven Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) he sets out to kill a couple of men accused of cutting up a prostitute. However, the local sheriff (Gene Hackman) is prepared to use any and all means necessary to prevent would-be bounty hunters from taking the law into their own hands.The script by David Webb Peoples steers clear of the usual Western clichés and instead dissects the mythology of the old West. The Schofield Kid idolizes Eastwood's character but he's haunted by his past misdeeds. Richard Harris's English Bob is a man who's all myth and no substance. Little Bill's uncompromising brand of law and order makes him arguably the 'villain' of the film. In this story nothing is clear-cut and when it comes to dying, "deserve's got nothing to do with it".The acting is fairly solid all around with a few standout performances. Eastwood got an Oscar nomination but I don't think that he really deserved it. Gene Hackman, on the other hand, made a strong case for his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Morgan Freeman also delivered a typically fine performance while Jaimz Woolvett was the unsung hero of the cast. And let's not forget the inestimable Richard Harris.On the technical side, Eastwood's Oscar-winning direction is tasteful and the Oscar-nominated cinematography is often striking. The score (what little of it there is) is good as well. Overall, the film's presentation shows considerable care.So, if you're looking for a Western that goes beyond the usual clearly defined 'good guys' and 'bad guys' this is one of the best in that vein. It was a worthy Best Picture winner and has since graduated to the status of bona fide classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many elements, especially psychological!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is not the western film I was ready to sit down and watch. I expected a typical shoot down, damsel in distress, and a cowboy riding off into the sunset. What I got was a whirlwind action packed plot far from the simple stereotypes I just mentioned. Clint Eastwood once again proves he is a blessing to the film industry in this film that captivates you from start to finish. The film begins with a prologue about a woman who married the murderous William Munny, played by Clint Eastwood. Once a notorious killer and thief, he has retired his ways as influenced by his late wife, the one mentioned in the prologue. Now, a single father trying to raise his children, Munny's morality and faithfulness to his late wife are tested when the opportunity to make some quick and large cash is offered to him by the Schofield Kid played by Jaimz Woolvett. Just in time of Munny's financial crisis, a bounty has been offered by the madam of a brothel in the town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming. The reward money is to be claimed by anyone who takes out two cowboys responsible for the disfiguring of one of the madam's prostitutes. Desperate for the money, Munny is tempted back to his old ways, but not before asking his old partner in crime and current neighbor Ned Logan, played by Morgan Freeman, to accompany him and the Kid on the bounty hunt.Once again, I strongly believe Eastwood to be a blessing to the film industry. Before I sat through this film, the last thing I wanted to watch was drunk cowboys taking rifle shots at each other, but Eastwood was able to deliver a film that only used the cowboy western genre as a sheer coat of the film's true message of evil's nature. The scene that most hits this statement comes after Ned is murdered and Munny and the Kid seek his revenge. Kid kills one of the cowboys with just three shots and while he has previously claimed to have killed five men, he breaks down to Munny and confesses this is the first murder he has committed. The Kid's naive ness contrasts greatly with Munny's cold hearted attitude in which he can't seem to remember what remorse was since he fell back to his old ways. In many ways this film highlights the idea that you can change a person's way of being but without the constant monitoring, one is always prone of falling back to their nature instincts. From a psychological perspective, this film proves the most argued subject in psychology to be true, nurture can overcome nature, but in the end nature is always capable of out beating it. Being a psychology major, I really focused on this aspect of Eastwood's character. Once again Eastwood masters the portrayal of a complex character that is the subject of everything from scrutiny to empathetic feelings of pity. Had his wife lived on, he might not have gone back to his killing streak.Eastwood isn't the only contribution to this film. Unfogiven could not have been carried out by a better cast. Morgan Freeman's character represents the counterpart to Eastwood. Unlike Munny, Logan has been able to repent himself. His retirement from a life of crime has changed him in ways that it hasn't for Munny and it is shown clearly when he is unable to kill the cowboys, leaving it to the Kid who was ignorant to the impact a murder can have on one's conscious. These actions prove that unlike Munny, Logan actually had a change of nature, for there was no outside force that pushed him to give up killing for a second time, whereas the lack of outside influence pushed Munny towards it with no remorse. Logan's murder was essential to the plot and the suspenseful end. Gene Heckman as the venomous sheriff Little Bill is at his best portraying the corrupt law enforcement that wants it his way, or no way, his way being to get rid of Munny and his gang. This stirs up the rest of the film's plot as the race for top gunman comes down between Munny and Little Bill.Overall, Unforgiven is simply a film that has two many elements and themes to summarize in one saying.. For those who are still skeptical of this Oscar winning Western, I recommend you forget that this film is considered a western and watch it with an open mind without any expectations of what westerns have offered in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you have an old school bad ass, an African American side kick, and a young kid who is nearly blind? You get the Clint Eastwood spaghetti western called "Unforgiven." Not bad at all if you ask me. One lady gets badly disrespected by two good for nothing cowboys. The friends of the poor, helpless lady band together to try to teach those punks a lesson. They call for the assassination of the men and put out a reward for their lives.From the beginning of the movie two men looking for a good time find themselves in a whore house. One of the whores laughs at one of the men for not being to "impressive." That sends the man over the edge. He grabs for his knife and starts taking swipes at the poor lady. After nearly gutting her face off the owner of the place puts a gun to the cowboys head and demands he leaves. So her whore friends band together and try to take a stand for what little respect they get. They put out a word that 1000 dollars goes to whoever kills the men that nearly killed their friend. Eastwood plays Bill, who is an ex assassin. One of the roughest, toughest men ever in all of the mid-west. Struggling to put his dark past behind him he needs the money to help his family get by. The large reward really sounds tempting and leads him to become a killer again, but this time for a good cause.For the most part I really enjoyed this move. I understand that it was a low budget film so I wasn't expecting too much as far as effects or cast. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman make a great team. They click very well on screen and off. I really think that Freeman did a great job as a supporting character. He did well playing Eastwood's right hand man. The setting was very good as well. I could never be able to tell that his movie was filmed over seas.I'm not usually a fan of western films but this one I happened to enjoy. Partly because I am a fan of the two main actors but none the less if you like western movies then this is a good one for you. Clint and Morgan do amazing jobs as usual. They capture the characters just as you would expect from Oscar winning actors. Job well done on the movie "Unforgiven."</fullReview>

It is not surprising that the movie was so interesting, mainly because of the actors. Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are top notch performers which surely reflects in this film. My personal opinion is that Gene Hackman is one of the best actors when it comes to playing bad guys. He is tough, cool and gives an impression that he doesn't really care for anything. He is the law and that is it. If you don't like it, turn around or suffer the consequences. The story was pretty much a revenge flick positioned in the old West so it wasn't something new and not one of the best features of the film. The direction was OK I guess, I can't think of anything bad, or good for that matter, to say about it. The story wasn't intriguing so I think it doesn't deserve a 9 or a 10, but considering everything, I give the movie an 8 and for conclusion I recommend the movie to all western fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that's Eastwood at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood aka the cinematic legend... Good, Bad And The Ugly, For A Few Dollars More, and many more western entertainers... Eastwood is a trend setter, a personality who has made western films famous, and when it came to direction in 1992 he made a film called 'Unforgiven'.When I am introduced to a film like this, people tell "you know it won the Best Picture Award, that too Oscar"... I was then narrated the storyline, and my reaction was that's paper-thin, but with a history behind it, and legendary actors appearing in it... I couldn't control myself and I saw this film. I've seen 'Unforgiven' long ago, but even today the film haunts me. A brilliant film! Eastwood takes a paper-thin plot, with 3-4 heroes and one menace. 'Unforgiven' is one of the finest films from the 90's, easily a cult classic. I was stunned by the genius of the filmmaker, and I've been in the awe of this legend ever since then. Lets talk about the performances: Clint Eastwood not only stuns you with his brilliant direction and his command in the script, but even delivers a bravura performance. Morgan Freeman is excellent, his character is very well penned. Gene Hackman, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his work here, undoubtedly deserved it. He's terrific. Late actor Richard Harris is simply superb. 'Unforgiven' took home 4 Oscars Best Picture, Director, Editor and Supporting Actor. More than its unforgettable history... 'Unforgiven' is a solid film, which keeps you gripped and thrilled from start to end. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but not Eastwood's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is quite a change from Eastwood's previous westerns.In his old westerns, Eastwood was always on top of things, always the moral good guy, always a perfect shot, and always got his way. This movie seems to be much different.Here, Eastwood plays William Munny, a former killer who: can't shoot too well, never seems to be on top of things, not very moral, and never gets his way. It's strange to see Clint this way. Gene Hackman gave an outstanding performance as Sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett, a slightly deranged, determined sheriff who has it out for Munny and his gang. Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan, Munny's old partner in crime who seems to have lost a taste for killing as well. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, a young, cocky, self-proclaimed gunfighter who tags along with William and Ned. Richard Harris portrays English Bob, a proclaimed gunfighter who gets caught in the middle of Little Bill's town at the wrong time.The scenery was a bit too dark at times and hard to tell what was happening, but it set the mood of the movie quite well. The music score also helped out quite a bit.The plot was simple yet complicated and I personally was thrown off a few times by small elements within the plot. However, it was still enjoyable.Over all, a great ending to Eastwood's western career, but not his strongest movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clear Picture of the Real West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the film Unforgiven, my general opinion about western movies changed because is not just about cowboys, cops and guns, or the hero that kills the bad guy at the end. Unforgiven supports a nice story that is garnished with a little bit of everything that represents the real west, where the problems were solved at a gunpoint. There was not only violence in the film. There are also touching scenes that show regrets, compassion, loyalty and a great sense of friendship.William Munny, performed by Clint Eastwood, is a pig farmer struggling to bring up his children after the death of his beloved wife, the person that saved him from alcohol, and from being a murderer and a thief in the past. But, when The Scofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) showed up one day and offered Munny half of the money that a group of prostitutes from the Big Whisky town were offering as a reward for the capture of a cowboy who cut up one of their member's face, he got tempted to go back to his old days. In despite of the promises made to his deceased wife, Munny decided to go after the criminal and the money, but first, he went to see his old friend Ned and asked him to be his partner like in the old times, when they went through a lot of things together. Ned (Morgan Freeman) did not say no; so the three of them rode their horses with their guns and rifles to do justice and to bring the money back home.Meanwhile, the sheriff of the Big Whisky town, Little Bill (Gene Hackman) was using the most brutal methods to maintain the order and to preserve the law. He wanted his town free of gunmen and he hated reward chasers. He was totally against the reward that the prostitutes were offering, but he let the criminal go unpunished, and the girls were thirsty of revenge. When Little Bill heard about Munny coming to town after the cowboy, he got determined to put end to his life and to the legend around his name. Is there where the action of the movie starts. Is there where guns go crazy and blood runs everywhere in Big Whisky.The film is fantastic because it grips the audience attention since the very beginning. However, is not until the final twenty minutes when the real action takes place. It is definitely a portrayal of the real western, where the meaning of the word honor is unknown, and where taking people's life is made with ease and without hesitations. There were a couple of scenes in the film that I liked the most. The chat that Munny had with the prostitute whose face was cut up, was very touching. He kind of demonstrated compassion for her, and I admired the way he refused to accept any sexual favor from her because he was still respecting the memory of his deceased wife. I also enjoyed the scenes where The Scofield Kid wanted to impress Munny and Ned claiming that he had killed five men; but when he actually made use of his gun to kill a man, his nerves broke down and he told them his truth: he had never killed anybody. The cast in Unforgiven could not have been stronger. The direction and performance of Clint East Eastwood, in my opinion is outstanding. Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors, once again did an amazing job. Gene Hackman, whose brutality I hated, did it great as a supporting actor. The movie is a success in its totality. It has a strong cast, awesome pictures, effects and sound. It is a worth seeing film: definitely a clear picture of the real west. I would give the film a rate of ten out of ten. Do not miss this movie, and do not forget the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And so life goes on?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie Unforgiven Clint Eastwood stars as the retired ex-outlaw William Munny. William Munny gave up his life as a cold-hearted murderer when he married Claudia Feathers. Apparently she tamed him to become a loving and caring person. William Munny had a horrible whiskey addiction and during his youth he went into drunken rages and would set out on a killing spree. He didn't care who he killed; men, women, children, when he was sober again he forgot about these killing sprees. The whiskey was poison to William and his wife Claudia knew this so she made him give up drinking whiskey.After a couple of years being together Claudia suffered a pre-mature death when she caught smallpox. She left her husband William with two young children, a boy and girl. William lived alone with his children on his small farm, he was no longer an outlaw but was now a farmer and father. One day a young man approached his home and told him the story that a prostitute had been cut up by some cowboy and there was a reward for that cowboy to be killed. This stirred up something within William and he began to think of his young family and how much he wanted them to have a good life. The reward money was appealing to him because it would help him get his family out of the farm life and maybe into a better life in a city. So he teamed up with his old friend Ned Logan and was on his way to getting his hands on the reward money. Even though it meant going back to his past life as a killer one last time.I liked the way the story was told. Each character had their own past and they kept remembering how they used to live throughout the film. Also subtle movements, expressions, and speech gave clues to the characters' past. Like in one scene Ned's wife sees William arrive and gives him a very dirty look as if to foreshadow a tragedy that was going to happen because he had arrived.The music was effective in creating a sense of sadness because it was sad that an old man like William had to face his past one last time before moving on with the rest of his life. Although I found it annoying because it seemed that only one track was being played all through the movie. I'm the kind of person who only sees the protagonist in the movie. I really like to see how the protagonist develops and I think that Clint Eastwood played the part of William Munny quite well. I felt that in a way William's story was his own story. Almost to say that in part this part was away to say farewell to his life in western films and to playing the cowboy. He was a very believable character. And also him being the director of this film was even more powerful because he was both the main actor and director. He played both parts extremely well. I think that all cowboys or at least those who were aging cowboys could relate to William Munny in many ways not just him being a retired outlaw.This film to me was very curious. I really didn't see myself watching a western film but this film really changed my view towards this genre. It made me think how sad it must have been for cowboys to realize that they had to give up their life to the new modern world. I could really understand this through this film.I would give this film a 5 out of 5 because I really could see strong emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent film that seeks to dispel the myth of the Hollywood Western. The lightning fast shootouts, bar room brawls and sleeping under the stars are portrayed in a more realistic way. The film isn't that harsh for violence (we are not talking Hostel here) but the hard life of the frontier is shown in a more gritty way than a traditional Western. An outstanding film, an excellent performance from Gene Hackman who I usually detest. The storyline is simple but its simplicity adds to the realism, the danger feels very real. The characters are well developed, especially Eastwood's. I would recommend this even if you hate Westerns. There has been a lot of hype about this movie that has been re-ignited with Eastwood's new movie, but it is all well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is proof that the western isn't dead. Clint Eastwood has taken the normal western hero and turned him into nothing but someone who kills for money. There are no hero's in this movie, only people who are trying to survive. It blends the old western with the new era of movies and passes with flying colors. Eastwood's and Freedman's portrayal of their characters is some of their best, but the person that makes this movie is Gene Hackman, who gives a flawless performance as the sheriff who seem's nice but show any criminal he catches no mercy. From the beginning where it shows a father trying to run a farm while raising his children to the end where he shows his true colors, this movie constantly keeps you entertained and wanting more. If you are a western fan this is one movie you cannot miss. It is a true testament to the fact that the western is not dead.</fullReview>

Both his acting and directing made this film go together with another great western legendary director, Sergio Leone, which directed some of his classic western films. The story is about a retired murderer (bounty hunter) who has now changed his life, but needing money. So he's back with his old partner, but not like the old days, they just need some money, but something goes terribly wrong, when he's partner is killed by a local enforcer in another town while leaving them cause he can't do some more killings. He came back for vengeance, like the old days. A terrific story for a great western movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Brought Eastwood Hollywood Street Cred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of being relegated to the world of pulp genre films, Clint Eastwood established himself as a major Hollywood filmmaker with this throwback to John Ford, an honor he continues to enjoy to this day.I haven't seen "Unforgiven" since it originally appeared in 1992, and to be honest I was probably too young then to fully appreciate it. I do remember it being bleak and unsettling in ways I didn't completely comprehend, but now I realize that it was unsettling in the way many classic westerns are, when they deal with some of those existential themes like life and death and what it means to be a man.Eastwood himself gives a good performance, while Gene Hackman won just about every acting award under the sun that year for playing a sadistic sheriff. Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris also appear in supporting roles. One scene that sticks in my mind to this day is the one in which Hackman's sheriff graphically kicks the crap out of Harris.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie About Bad People Doing Bad Things for Bad Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this after a self-imposed boycott of CE's movies, starting right after Firefox. Unforgiven is a good western and a good movie. I don't see it as "Great," though. But... who am I? No body.With that out of the way...With the climax, when Will clearly - and perhaps more in control of who he used to be - states that he will kill any man who shots at him, then the man's family and subsequently will burn down the man's house, the title of my comment flashed through my mind.None of the characters has any good in them whatsoever. How's the movie start? Rough sex in a whore house. Next scene, violence against a woman consisting of a knife to the face... and so on.Nevertheless, the film is all about this event and what it drives people - BAD people - to do. BAD people set out to assassinate them boys what cut up that whore - for money, because the whore's friends (also whores) put up the reward.What makes this a good movie, for me, is that none of the characters show any goodness: they stick to how bad they are, how weak they may be, and how afraid of death, in fact, they are, too. Courage is gained through hard liquor, money is gained through murder for hire. No one apologizes.What puzzled me was Morgan Freeman's character. Perhaps this is one of the "redeeming" things about this "anti-violence" movie (it is not, no matter what anyone says - it is a move about violent people and the violence of their lives)... See: there is no racial angle at all to the story. Yet the Civil War is not such a distant memory and it's not at all unreasonable that some of the characters would be veterans of either side. A black man in the 1880's, with property, married to an Indian (let's call her that for continuity with the genre) would raise a lot of racist eyebrows - yet this doesn't occur at all and built around Freeman's character is a total color-blindness. It didn't wash with me - not that I want to see racists in film, but maybe it took away from what was otherwise a very real picture.Again, as an older fan of Clint Eastwood's, I'm glad I saw "Unforgiven" but I see the credit it's been given as hyperbolic: "High Plains Drifter" is superior (and my favorite) - but that's a movie about bad people who did bad things to a good man who came back to do bad things to a bad town for good reasons. And Sergio Leone and Don Seigel both make it into that film - in name - too.</fullReview>

But forgiveness gives the human mind another chance while the heart still aches - the essence of this great western tale.According to civil law, punishment is valid if the judgment is rational. Unforgiven is the judgment when civil law is forbidden.It is very rare to find movies of this nature.

		<shortDescription>The real west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the old west had to be portrayed, not in a idyllic or epic way, but more attached to a historical reality, then we could say that Eastwood was able to create a classic of what might have been that time in that part of the United States close to its border with Mexico. That's because this film succeeds completely remove the image of the mythical west full of ruthless murderers and men that were seeking how to impose justice ... and only shows us a reality where good and evil coexist within each person. There isn't a character who is not worth its appearance in this story, from the group of prostitutes who seek revenge claiming their status through the mythical murderers incapable of doing harm, bad guys converted into good ones and a sheriff whose sense of justice in his magnanimity. This whole gallery of characters are combined in a story that is spectacularly well told through an accurate direction and editing that combines all the elements for an ending that gives rise to a legend. But the value of Unforgiven is that from that moment we can consider Eastwood as a major film director, which unlike other actors-directors (Costner, Gibson, etc.) this is the only one who really has proved been prolific in his career and today stands as an artisan of the best dramas of recent years in Hollywood. So in Unforgiven we realize that the years not spend on free to Munny but we also see that on the contrary, thanks to those same years, this great actor has become one of the best icons of what is cinema by excellence. I can't say anything else that this is the best and unbeatable western of all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..didn't impress me..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...maybe it was because I wasn't aware that "Unforgiven" was supposed to be Eastwood's swansong for westerns........does anyone care? Some folk seem to think it is the end of an era. If the script were flying-around Hollywood for so many years with no takers, maybe Eastwood just realized it would make money and give him a vehicle to say "no more". I'm not really an Eastwood fan, but remember "Play Misty" for me as one of the best movies he's done. Is that a western? I guess David Webb Peoples was certainly happy his script had been taken-up by a major star to be filmed. I'm not really sure what the story is; I was confused at the beginning, before I knew it was supposed to be the end of westerns. I didn't know whether to laugh or just turn it off. I suppose - having been enlightened by others' comments - I'd have to agree that Eastwood ("Bill Munny") did a good job directing. BUT - wasn't it apparent that he would eventually return to his old "self" by the end of the movie. Didn't surprise ME. As for it being a classic, I'm still wondering - after watching it closely again - how that can be.Gene Hackman as "Little Bill Daggert", I guess, did deserve his Oscar. The comparison of home-builder and sadistic sheriff was clearly made, and his acting was very good. His brutality toward Richard Harris ("English Bob") and Morgan Freeman ("Ned Logan") made me wonder if he were an elected sheriff, or was just a dictator. I'm still not sure if we were supposed to be familiar with "English Bob"; never heard of him, nor was I aware that he ALSO was out to collect the bounty. How in the world did the prostitutes rake-up $1000 in those days, in such an out-of-the-way town like "Big Whiskey"? Jaimz Woolvert ("Schofield Kid") didn't impress me in any direction. I guess there had to be someone to tackle the job of killing the cowboys who cut-up the prostitute (whom "Munny" should have married, for a good twist in the plot). That "Ned" couldn't shoot anyone after all those years was a good twist, but his death was really unnecessary. BUT - there had to be SOME reason for "Munny" to make the final leap back into his former life. "Beauchamp's" character wasn't important to me, although it did give Hackman a chance to emote. As for it being one of the greatest scenes ever filmed, who's kidding whom? I'm glad so many people loved "Unforgiven" - it's just not my kind of film. I guess there WAS a story, but it took some real imagination to find it. I gave it a "10" because all of the actors-actresses played their roles convincingly, even if I didn't understand why. I am all for seeing another good western - there DOES seem to be a shortage of them, since all of the popular shoot-'em-up films have moved-on to the current genre - lots of action. If it's your cup of tea, enjoy.......I certainly enjoyed the cinematography - beautiful scenes of the killers riding through fields of grain, even then?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood at his best in spaghetti westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last western that can ever come to life on the silver screen. After it there will only be placebo westerns. The ultimate episode of the western wilderness just before it turned so sour that your blood would curdle in your veins and your brain would either calcify into a heartless stone or liquefy into a tasteless brew. The solitary cowboy is the real judge and executioner, in one word that last fatal justice maker that represents the final fate of all crooked minds that meet with their destiny in front of the barrels of his guns just before he shoots them dead with no remission, no suspension, no parole, ever and never. Fatal lethal fateful fate of a big bang death of a few trashy men who thought their violence was god's law to all others. And God came down from his heaven in the shape of Clint Eastwood and he struck them dead with the flashes of lightning of his anger. Just before these hooligans learned that women had to be respected, that plain justice, fairness and humanity require strength, righteousness and forwardness. With only one star in sight guiding their steps, the star that leads to Bethlehem and the birth of a really humane world founded on the salvation of the innocent and the damnation of the guilty, and not the reverse. Probably the acme of western films, the final touch to be able to close a long line of inspiration that has to come to its end since the audience has now lost their innocence. When justified violence is the angry redeeming tool of gratuitous and pleasurable cruelty. But that's also the end of a myth, the myth that there is a salvation of the innocent and the weak in this savage world that could not even think of existing if it were not brutal.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris I Panthéon Sorbonne, University Paris Dauphine, Université Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines.</fullReview>

It has an amazing photography, the landscapes shown in the film are simply a delightfulness. The direction is awesome, the way Clint Eastwood communicates in this movie is just perfect with a slow rhythm that you really enjoy. Unforgiven has one of the best cast I've ever seen, Clint Eastwood doing what he knows best, a role as a bad guy who wants to redeem himself but that is still haunted by his past. Morgan Freeman again with a great performance, Gene Hackman excellent as always and Richard Harris with a brief appearance but also a very convincing supporting role.

		<fullReview>Even the cold blood killer can have a heart and a conscience and appear to be a man of integrity. Clint Eastwood brought the western into somewhat new territory with this film about cowboys with serious misgivings about how they've chosen to live their lives in the past when they were murderous gunslingers. Even still in their new lives when things turn difficult with hardship down on the homestead they cease an opportunity to do perceived justice by reverting to old ways for a profit, although with some hesitation. This is much in the vein of the Eastwood mold that has developed where the line between good and bad characters is blurred and qualities of both show up in the main characters, you know, more like real people. Eastwood seems to be fascinated with presenting hero's with flaws and here it's especially effective in a genre that was well known for presenting well defined good and bad guys. Everything works about this film, casting is spot on with great performances from all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dramatic story about an old cowboy who is under oath for erasing his past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman make you go to the world of two old cowboys. Clint Eastwood as William Munny and Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan display a fascinating performance in Unforgiven. The story starts with in a brothel where a cowboy from other state chops a prostitute's body while having sex. The man who are shocked because of his partner's laughing at his penis' lenghth goes crazy and chops the prostitute's all organs except the private point. Upon this fact, the sheriff Little Bill who is known with his discipline is called to the brothel by Skinny who is the manager of Greely brothel. Little Bill investigates two men one of whom attacks the prostitute and decides to whip them in spite of the objections of the prostitutes. After that Bill gives up this decision and replaces the decision as like that:Two men will bring totally seven ponies to the end of time that is given by Bill.Then the time goes and ponies are brought by two men.But the prostitutes aren't pleased with this decision of Bill and of course ponies. The prostitutes aren't satisfied and send news by the men who have sex with them about a reward which will be given to the man who kills two men. Skinny learns this fact and wants the help of Bill who should prevent such kind of fact. Even English Bob hears the award corresponds to 1.000 dollar and goes to the town. But Bill is determined to prevent "blood money" and so he beats famous English Bob in front of the people and wants that to be an example the men who intend for winning award.An adventurer man whose name is Kid hears the fame of William Munny and goes to the his farm. Kid wants to win that award. At first, Munny doesn't accept because of his deceased wife and then he decides to with a little hesitate because of his children's future. Munny finds his old partner Ned Logan and persuades him. After that the story becomes colourful.The whole people in film makes their bests. Especially I should state that Skinny is the most impressive character. There is not too much words about Freeman and Eastwood double. Whenever these two genius come together, a masterpiece appears willy-nilly. These master's performance is crowned with a good direction and scenarios' sensitive points. The advance joke that mistreated prostitute told to Munny make me laughed even if I predict it.Unforgiven can not be terminated just these words. Lastly the story writing upon not to forgive the attacker points out the idea that is "The place where justice isn't available, everyone looks for their justice". This was of course for Little Bill or the man who thinks or treats to people like him.</fullReview>

Mystic River, Million-Dollar Baby and Flags of Our Fathers are all really great, insightful and in depth, poignant films. (I still have yet to experience Letters From Iwo Jima, which I here is one of, if not considered his best film to date.) As for the vintage Eastwood thrills and when I state "vintage", I mean his director/starring roles, and though it may be cliché, for me it's Unforgiven. Josey Wales is just a notch bellow, but there's just something about this film that stirred me, emotionally, showed a certain side of human violence which was more realistic and above all, existentialistic amidst a western. It may not be my favorite western, but it is most certainly my favorite of Eastwood's Films next to Mystic River.I place Mystic River, however, under my own, "My Favorite Directed/Non-Starred" film of Eastwood's. Personally,it was hard to grasp it all in the first go around, yet upon the second viewing I found something worth treasuring.

		<fullReview>I see many approving reviews of the film and read the disapproving ones for a good laugh. Since pretty much all has been said of the film, I will give my own input, for ...whomever. (little English Bob there)Many of the complaints I hear (really for all movies I consider great) are that they are too slow paced , sorry for all with attention deficit who cant bear witnessing shots coming at you 100 mph like all the blockbuster "hits" nowdays, the timing lets the emotion of the characters soak in and really take hold. Another thing that seems to annoy the critics of Unforgiven is the overtly simple dialog (with the exception of Eng. Bob). I guess we all should think that rural folk in late nineteenth century Wyoming should speak with Shakespearean complexity. I enjoy the simple language and think it lends more to the characters and makes them very real. As for the violence goes; people who wont see films beyond the violent scenes should continue watching family fun movies with their kids and quit judging people for enjoying film with so-called "glorified violence". violence is by no means glorified in this movie and is used to express a point along with "foul language". If you really want to complain about overused violence, go see any of the shock "horror" movies that have come out in the past few years. nothing in this movie should make one cringe, and if it does you probably shouldn't be watching television or movies at all.Anyhow, this is one of the most simplistic, unique, visually moving films I have ever known, love it and watch it frequently, and another example of how intense a movie can be without overused violence or special effects.maybe someone will get something out of reading this for a few seconds, maybe not. I put the spoiler thing on because I don't know what considers it a spoiler, and I may have "spoiled" somebody's fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at the time i watched this movie,i hadn't been very interested in Western movies.but because this one was directed by Clint Eastwood and had a star studded cast,i decided to give it a try.boy,i'm glad i did.i really enjoyed the movie.Eastwood also stars in the movie,along with Morgan freeman,Gene Hackman,Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek,to name just a few.each of these A one actors are at the top of their game here.Eastwood crafts a gritty,dark version of the old west during a harsh and unforgiving time.the movie is brutally violent and unflinching in its portrayal of the time.some may find it depressing,and it does have that air to it,but i wasn't bothered by that aspect of it.i got caught up in the story and action.i also liked the dialogue.i thought it was well written.this movie definitely has epic written all over it.after watching this movie was responsible for my becoming interested in the Western genre.no small feat,believe me."Unforgiven" is a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film-making but Eastwood's not the star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood isn't the star of this film but the film is directed extremely well. Eastwood is as wooden and unemotional as he always is. The ones that carry this movie are Gene Hackman, English Bob, Morgan Freeman and the Scofield Kid. The storyline is that one of the prostitutes in the saloon is slashed in the face and ends up with permanent scars. The Scofield Kid (an over-cocky young kid who winds up not being able to see two feet in front of his face) shows up at Eastwood's place and tries to recruit him to avenge the man who slashed this girl. One gripe I have is that in these Westerns all the characters are made out to be stupid like they never got past the fifth grade: they can't talk correctly (which includes Eastwood's character) and all the men are about are slinging a gun and sleeping with prostitutes. "Yessum", "I reckon", "I spose so" and "I don't do that no more, kid" are standard lines in this movie. Even the prostitutes are extremely stupid. I won't say anymore and ruin it but this is an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint's Triumphant Return</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,In a small town in Wyoming, a couple of cowboys decide to have a little 'fun' with some ladies of a less reputable nature. In layman's terms, they decide to have sex with prostitutes. One of them gets laughed at and he slices up the prostitutes face something nasty. Instead of arresting them, whipping them, or even fining them, Sheriff Little Bill decides to have them run errands for him and run some horses to sell at the local livery. Enraged, the prostitutes put together their money they earned and post a reward for killing the two men. In the mean time, ex-gunman William Munny and his friend Ned are approached by a young gunman who calls himself The Schofield Kid because of his weapon, A Schofield Smith and Wesson Revolver. The three head up north to Wyoming to battle Little Bill and kill the two men. But they aren't the only ones after the bounty.Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite actors and directors. His latest films have impressed me. Space Cowboys, Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Million Dollar Baby, and Mystic River, they're all his best work. However, the Western is where Clint truly is at home. From his early days acting in Spaghetti Westerns as The Man with No Name to his directing days of The Outlaw Josey Wales and Pale Rider, Clint has kicked butt throughout the years. Now he's back, probably for one final ride, in Unforgiven.Unforgiven is an awesome western if you like Clint Eastwood's directing or his westerns, or just westerns in general. Eastwood, as usual, is pure awesome, proving why he's one of the best actors alive. His direction is simple yet hearkens back to the old days. His usual gruff charm oozes everywhere and he and Morgan Freeman have wonderful chemistry. Speaking of Freeman, he's great in this movie too. He also plays an ex-gunman who isn't sure if he can kill people again. His usual charm and calm voice goes great with Clint Eastwood's gruffness. Gene Hackman plays a brutal villain that, like Commodus in Gladiator, has no redeemable features. He is twisted, he is a monster, and you just want Eastwood, Freeman, and/or Richard Harris to just shoot him dead. Richard Harris has a small role in this film as English Bob, a hired-gunman who is arrested by Hackman and beaten savagely then run out of town. Seeing as I'm a fan of the late Richard Harris and have been impressed with his performances in Harry Potter and Gladiator, I was disappointed of what happened to him. He could've at least been given a duel with Hackman. Still, great film. Check it out along with Pale Rider and Tombstone.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Duck of Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Duck of Death: Unforgiven Exposes the Fraudulent WestThe Wild West is a cornerstone of American mythology and the Western film genre is perhaps it's most powerful outlet. Westerns tend to glorify the period of American westward expansion with tales of heroic gun-slinging cowboys and deadly sharp-shooting villains; classic tales of good versus evil. Unforgiven , directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, aims to expose the darker, and perhaps more accurate, side of the story. In this film William Munny (Clint Eastwood), a repenting ex-killer, teams up with his old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the hilariously inexperienced Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet) to hunt down two prostitute-abusing cowboys for a bounty. Although William is well-known as a cold and savage killer, he can barely remember how to fire a pistol or mount a horse and spends much of the film beat up and flu-stricken. In contrast, The Schofield Kid, named after the revolver he caries, insists constantly that he is a weathered killer, although it becomes apparent that he can barely see or shoot. This setup is the starting point of a film that seeks to dispel the myths of the West.A potent strike on the old mythology takes place during a scene set in a jail, where the villain, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), reads the writings of young author W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), who is writing the biography of legendary killer and cell-mate English Bob (Richard Harris). The book, titled The Duke of Death?"duke" pronounced "duck" by Little Bill?describes the heroic revenge English Bob had purportedly taken on a woman-beating cowboy Two Gun Parker. Bill then reveals that he was there the night of the murder and describes the even as it truly occurred. Two Gun Parker only actually carried one proper gun, which blew up in his hand, after which a drunken English Bob approached him slowly, "because he was drunk", and shot him in the liver; not before several inebriated missed shots. In this way, the film begins to disassemble the romantic facade of the old West and of the Western film genre as well. In Unforgiven, the battle is not so much between good and evil as it is between romance and tragedy, which is wrapped up nicely and ironically in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood drives the final nail in the coffin of the Western mythos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is one of those movies that demands close analysis. Sure it pushes all the time-tested Hollywood buttons: its beautifully filmed, it has great acting, a compelling story and the payoff is very satisfying. Yet Unforgiven does much more, in that it wears its deeper themes on its sleeve; it doesn't take a master critic to explore the meaning below the story.Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, an unrepentant killer who has abandoned his outlaw ways and has married and settled down on a hardscrabble farm. After the death of his wife, Munny gets word from a young whippersnapper that there is a reward on the head of man from the town of Big Whiskey because he has savaged and maimed a prostitute and the local sheriff, Little Bill (Gene Hackman) has essentially given the perpetrator a slap on the wrist.So Munny summons his old sidekick, Ned (Morgan Freeman) and heads off to Big Whiskey along with the young man, who goes by the handle "the Scofield Kid", to kill the man who cut the whore, along with his cohorts. In the meantime, Little Bill has gotten wind of the reward, and savages one potential mercenary, English Bob (Richard Harris) who while handy with a gun in the "Wild West Show" sense, ultimately lacks the heart and mettle of a true killer.English Bob is accompanied by a callow young writer of dime novels, who has swallowed the whole white hat/black hat mythos whole cloth, and stays behind as Bob is sent unceremoniously packing. Munny arrives in a driving rainstorm and misses a sign demanding that visitors relinquish their firearms to the sheriff. When he is discovered, armed, in Big Whiskey's saloon by Little Bill and his minions, Munny is savagely beaten, almost to death.That set me to thinking. Now Eastwood's famous Man With No Name took his share of beatings, but unlike Munney, he recovered quickly. Munney's old body felt every blow, and he spends a lengthy period convalescing.Yet Munney is relentless, and once he is able he gathers up his crew and gets back to the business of killing.One by one, all of the standard clichés that populate the typical Gene Autry type film are exploded. Munney doesn't wear a white hat; while his cause is just, he is a mercenary. Little Bill certainly doesn't wear the white hat either, he is a brutal sadist, essentially the head of his own fascist dictatorship. His minions weren't good guys, nor were they truly hard men like Munny and Little Bill. Rather than a brave posse of old, they remind me of and old picture of a lynching; Little Bill might be holding the rope, but they were the smiling faces in the background.Ned is ultimately a victim of his own loyalty to Munney, he lacks the heart to be a killer. English Bob and The Scofield Kid are full of bluster and stories, but they are essentially poseurs.Even the so-called "modern" westerns are skewered. During a critical scene, Little Bill accuses Munney of being a "killer of women and children" during a train robbery where explosives are used. I immediately thought back to the scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where they use "too much dynamite" and blow up a train's safe, including its contents. That scene was played for comic relief, yet one couldn't help imagining hot shrapnel from the safe spinning its way through the wooden passenger cars and killing innocents.In Munney's world innocents died.And finally, in a slap to all of the antihero movies of the 70s, Munny doesn't meet his end as comity demands, rather he quietly lives out his life as a purveyor of dry goods in San Francisco.As I understand it, Eastwood wore his Rowdy Yates boots from Rawhide in Unforgiven. It is fitting that he chose to give birth and kill off his career in Westerns wearing the same boots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much is made of this film's ending. All praise it is due. However, the film is a sumptuous feast of larger-than-life tragedy by one of cinema's all time masters; Mr. Clint Eastwood. He's earned his spot in the Director's Hall of Fame since, but few films will ever achieve the perfection displayed on-screen in UNFORGIVEN. Reviewers, critics and fans describe the film as haunting and it certainly is. Eastwood and Broyles have crafted a Western that might have officially ended the genre, but if only by so masterfully stating its purpose.As the years have gone by since I've seen this film and appreciated it more and more, I have increasingly grown aware of its timeless significance. Plainly put; it is due all the hyperbole in the English language. You'll wonder, perhaps, whether any film can be that good. This one is.</fullReview>

Clint Eastwood has a gift from the word go in all his films you are rooting for one guy then your rooting for another, until there only guy wort rooting for is Clint himself by which time he is a psychotic killer. Gene Hakeman gives a fantastic performance along with the always brilliant Morgan Freeman and the late great Richard Harris. We thought we new the story heartless killer goes and collects a bounty for an evil villain who kills women and children. What if the evil villain who kills women and children is Clint, well hell who gives a damn. Clint is given a heart here and keeps it all the way through the film, avenging friends and helping women not to forget his own two kids he has left back home. Unforgiven is a masterpiece of the Western genre and I don't know one man who'd forgive you if you missed out on this exciting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has done it again. As Producer and Director, you know this movie is going to out perform and entertain. I doubt that there is anyone in Hollywood or any other movie makers that has the experience with Westerns than Clint Eastwood.Unforgiven, a masterful and powerful Western who's title alone captures the curiosity and intrigues the movie going public. I for one was hooked as soon as I heard the brilliant opening music score in the first scene, which I believe was also written by Mr. Eastwood. The movie, told in modern day language and not the campy format of the fifties and sixties Westerns is also another reason this movie will go down as one of the best. With a superb cast and creative story line, you'll want to watch this movie again and again. I just hope that Clint Eastwood has at least one more western in him before he retires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Think I May Have Been Converted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I would have said that westerns are not worth my time and that, for the most part, Clint Eastwood's career is not something I have much interest in. You've seen one cowboy shoots Indian picture and you've seen them all. But this is all changed when you see "Unforgiven".Will Munny, a notorious criminal and murderer, has been retired for years - no longer an alcoholic and now a devoted father and husband. But when confronted with one last opportunity to kill for money, he saddles his horse and heads north.Eastwood's character (Munny) is actually a relatively uninteresting one until the final scenes. Old, sick and beaten he seems more concerned with reminding the audience a handful of times how he loves his wife and gave up drinking. He seems more of a burden than anything (though it would be fair to say this setup is important for later). Morgan Freeman does alright as Ned Logan, though his character is largely disposable and could have been played by anyone.Gene Hackman and Richard Harris are the real ones to watch. Hackman, in his best evil role ever, is the sheriff who knows no mercy when his town is threatened with mercenaries. Shooting, beating and whipping are not beneath him. And his speeches are as self-assured and pompous as anything Lex Luthor would have ever said.Harris, as English Bob, is the real novelty character. A liar, a swindler and a man who loves the queen above all else. His diatribe about how presidents get shot and monarchs do not is classic gold and probably the most memorable part of the film for me. Along with his trusty patsy Beauchamp, he really makes the film carry until Eastwood is ready to pick up the slack.The music and scenery were great. The directing was fine (it was Eastwood again). As I said in the beginning, I am converted. If this is what westerns are capable of, maybe there's a place in my heart for a few more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This western is absolutely astonishing, and extremely under-rated. It is a film of many high qualities and the overall affect of seeing Clint Eastwood act like a god and direct like the supreme talent that he is is overwhelming. It stars Clint as William Munny. An ex killer and traveller who went around killing "everything that walked or crawled from on time to another" yet after years of being a drunk and in his sheer evil way, he found his salvation and comfort through finding his new wife, who sadly is set to have died from smallpox. Yet her soul keeps him from doing the killing and drinking. Yet as he travels to Wyoming with two other friends to assassinate two criminals who cut up a whore, for a reward laid on by the prostitutes that inhabit Greely's whorehouse in the town of Big Whiskey.Yet as he eventually kills the two, one of his friends he is travelling, Ned (played well by Morgan Freeman) is killed by the ruthless humanitarian of Big Whiskey (played brilliantly by Gene Hackman). And as this act is done, the old William Munny decides to take his revenge in the coldest way, and so sets back to drinking, so he can finish things off once and for all. As his other companion leaves, not ready for killing, he goes to see the killers of his friend and ends it all in a blaze of glory. This film just goes to show that to kill and be killed is hard to come terms with, and makes this story of the desire for peace a truly memorable production that will live forever through time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven (1992) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/Actor Clint Eastwood revived much-needed life into a dying western genre with this dubious winner for Best Picture (I wouldn't take its appeal quite that far) and though I'd stop short of handing it the coveted Oscar, it is indeed one of the best westerns I've seen of this type.Clint essays the role of a reformed aging widower named William Munny, who was once a notorious murderer and miscreant in his prime but has settled down to the mellow life of a gentile pig farmer with his two motherless children. When he learns of a reward being offered by a group of prostitutes who want to get even with two customers who brutally slashed up one of their whore friends, the rusty old Munny cannot resist the urge to get back in the saddle and hunt the vermin down for the cash payoff. He is accompanied by his old friend Ned Logan (a fine performance by Morgan Freeman) and a young loudmouth wannabe (Jaimz Woolvett). But what this trio doesn't count on is that the town in question they're traveling to doesn't much welcome gun touting assassins, and the head tough guy sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) has no bones about beating up or killing anyone who brandishes a weapon on his turf.Hackman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and he's very deserving of it. Also very good is Richard Harris as English Bob, another competing vigilante who arrives on the scene before Eastwood and his buddies do, and lives to regret it.Like many modern films that are supposed to take place in older times, it seems some of the dialogue comes off as a little too 20th Century-like for the period. While I have no doubt that old cowboys probably cussed up a storm, some of the chosen obscenity clichés displayed here (which I won't bother repeating) sound more like they came out of the 1990's rather than the 1880's. In contrast, some of the language we'd probably have expected to hear way back then (like the bigoted use of the "N" word) is curiously glossed over. There are instances where you can definitely tell that UNFORGIVEN is the product of a much more Politically Correct era. But all that aside, this is a very involving western with welcome fleshed out characters who we can sink our teeth into. It's got something to say about violence and the effect that killing can have, even on the most hardened of men. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the last of the great westerns?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers...Clint Eastwood, one of the biggest figureheads in American cinema is a film-maker with several faces who by undertaking various plans developed an undeniable expertise. Either by shooting films with a strong commercial potential, "a Perfect World" (1993), either by adapting a best-seller for the screen , "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" (1997) or either by making a movie aiming at destroying a film type like the western and "Unforgiven" (1992) belongs to this third category. With "Unforgiven", Eastwood made a major work in a type he illustrated better than any other film-maker of his generation.The movie ends on a beautiful picture. It depicts Eastwood in the role of the main character who is going and meditating at his wife's grave. The sequence is shot at a quite long distance and it is sufficient to hear a few guitar notes to feel moved. More important, the time of the day when this sequence takes place (the twilight) speaks volume about the atmosphere that reigns in Eastwood' work. The latter declared that he wanted to bury the western. He certainly had good reasons for this. Be that as it may, if we look into the film's contents, we realize that this western introduces elements we aren't used to seeing in this genre. It is particularly true for the main character, acted by Eastwood himself. He acts an aging and disillusioned anti-hero, a former killer who decided to retire and to try to breed pigs with a lot of difficulty. When he accepts the contract a young killer offers him, his past catches him up, a past which haunts him and he seems to regret not getting rid of it. He will discover than there's nothing heroic in killing a man and he won't even die which might have enabled him to be forgiven for his sins. All these features show that Eastwood isn't afraid of taking chances (he is a little ridiculous when he tries to ride his horse) and reveal his exemplary courage to erase the image of valiant cow-boy he earned himself. His flawless performance deserves the admiration and the respect.But the rest of the cast is impressive of sobriety. Gene Hackman in a ruthless and sadistic sheriff finds one of the most terrifying roles in his career. He is particularly fearsome when he humiliates English Bob and there's a small detail that speaks volume about his power. He's got a young and colorless assistant who has difficulty to impose his authority. One sequence clearly shows it when English Bob and the writer arrive in the town, they refuse to leave their weapons. Hackman must recall this to the visitors and the consequences are dramatic for them. In another hand, due to his cruel personality, it's nearly natural that he handles roughly Eastwood when he arrives in town but as a director, the latter doesn't hesitate in mocking at him since Hackman can't manage in finishing to make the roof of his house.Apart from this, with "Unforgiven", the big events of the legend of the West related by credulous writers belong to the past (Eastwood makes fun of the writer who goes with English Bob and it is an efficient means to wipe out some of the commonplaces of the western). It reigns a bleak and dark atmosphere in this western which is however not devoid of humor. Otherwise the movie would be of a total blackness. There's also an ounce of tenderness from Eastwood towards the children at the beginning of the movie. All this has been carefully concocted with an expert hand to bury the western. But probably without intending it, Eastwood with this iconoclastic and crepuscular western, very far from the usual clichés, has given the genre a new lease of life. A wide worldwide success and four Oscars including Best Director in 1993 crowned it all.An admirable western and you can count on the fingers of one hand, the movies from the same category equally successful as "Unforgiven".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's best (directed) film (MYSTIC RIVER is 2nd)that was a nice surprise for The Oscar crowd eleven years ago. It was also his his most heart-felt performance as an actor, with a sublime supporting crew of dangerous thugs. Hackman, as always, was too credible for words and I wish Richard Harris had had more scenes to play and shoot with. Morgan - high class. Frances Fisher should have been up for a supporting award, and the young blonde woman should have gotten more work after this.A 9 out of 10. Best Film of '92 (deserving it's Gold). This may be the death-knell of the Western, but...some people will live. A classic that turned things on it's head for the genre. Superb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but vastly overrated and over slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opinions obviously vary according to each of us but several viewings of this film have left me pretty cold. I like westerns where you can identify immediately who are the goodies and who are the baddies so to speak. I like the magnificent views of Monument Valley, the sunsets, a good love story etc, shoot-outs with the indians etc etc.The epitomy of Westerns for me are the good John Wayne films. Wayne was a man of traditional values, values to which I adhere totally.There is some of all that in this film but the script isn't really spicy. There isn't really much action. There isn't really much to the story and the film seems excessively slow. Also there is a lot of bad language ( totally unnecessary, adds nothing to the film, and many Westerns have been previously made without bad language with no dire results ).The character portrayed by Richard Harris is totally incongruous and out of place and has nothing to do in this kind of a story.Gene Hackman's performance nevertheless is excellent, and it is always a pleasure to see Morgan Freeman on the screen.In spite of all this, one get's the impression that the director is trying to make "a different kind of western", like an experiment in cinematography. Whilst experimentation of this type is laudable and necessary, in this case, it adds nothing to the Western genre except extra crudeness ( why kill a man while he's sitting on the toilet seat - this may be taxed as realism but doesn't really add to the film except to say........this is the first time we see a man killed in that position ). This desire for the innovative is all well and good, but you need a more active and spicy plot to get it across to the spectator.I don't want to be overly negative as there are some good moments but couldn't we have had a romantic interlude in the film if only to offset some of its crudeness and bad language - I mean there's no point in boring the spectator to death in the name of realism..........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a great film as much for what it says about the Western genre as for the action that occurs on screen. Key to this examination of the genre is the interplay between myth and reality - the journalist fuels other characters' stories and exagerations with enthusiasm, but flinches at seeing these events actually happen.The film does start out slowly, but picks up pace as William Munny (Clint Eastwood) inevitably moves towards his destiny and past of being a stone-cold killer. Unforgiven also skirts other issues prevalent in Westerns, such as the victim not necessarily being the one who seeks justice, the place of women in frontier towns and that sometimes the bad guy is an ordinary person who did something stupid.An incredibly solid film with a fine cast, Unforgiven is possibly the best Western ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really closer to ANTI-Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who believe that this is Clint's last Western, I agree. It seems to me that he intends it to be. If you have watched a few of his older Westerns, you will understand that he essentially played the same role in most of them - that of the tough guy, not a lot to say, shoot first ask questions later, "I really don't care what THEY think of me", etc... and oh yeah, he drinks. In unforgiven, Eastwood's role is very different. All of the elements ascribed to the tough guy seem to have been present in the character's past. IMHO, William Munny's past is a representation of what we, the audience expect a gunfighter to be (from watching Clint Eastwood films, heh) When he discovers that Ned was murdered he can't handle his proximity to all these elements from his past. He starts drinking right then and there, and his past returns. My longwinded point is that the film itself seems to be a sign-off role for Eastwood. The film is really an ANTI-Western. Eastwood's role gives us the realistic side of what it means to be a lifelong murderer AKA gunfighter. That stuff catches up with a man, I guess. I can't think of a better way for Eastwood to pay homage to his own past as a spaghetti Western actor. And BTW, this is amongst my favorite titles of all time. I think a person would have to have watched a few of Clint's Westerns to fully appreciate how brilliantly dynamic a film Unforgiven is. I understand that some of the other folks who have posted have a similar perspective as me, but disagree. That is perplexing. I suppose that if you were not in awe of the uniqueness of the film, you may find the self-agrandizing scenes a bit much. "...hell of thing to kill a man, to take away all he's got..." and "You were right not to take it, Bob. I would have killed ya", etc. But I smile at these scenes. They are what I will remember my whole life. Did anyone else catch that all the younger gunfighters were actually caricatures of gunfighters? Especially the kid, naturally - but they all were. Oh, and Beauchamp. This guy is like a detective, albeit a blithering fool of one. He keeps getting closer to what Eastwood wants us to see, like a running commentary. With the Duck of Death, he has pure drivel for his material. He would have us believe that Honor makes a man a good gunfighter. With Bill Dagget, he gets some good truth. But even there, the stuff is tainted because Little Bill likes the attention too. He would have us believe that a cool head wins the day. Finally, at the end, we see the fact that principle, practice, honor, etc. None of that matters. Will Munny does 'em all in with a strong dose of luck. No honor, training, or morals to get in the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1940s and '50s my uncle wrote Westerns for a living. Some were made into movies. I was born too late to know my uncle but I knew my aunt who had helped edit his books. She was of a very set mind when it came to Western writing and Western movies: "Cowboys were basically good, hard-working people who didn't swear, kill others or cheat on their wives. They also didn't cheat at cards or spit on the sidewalks." Only the evil "bogus" cowboys (not to mention gamblers, ranch owners and businessmen) got drunk, killed people, used whores and cussed. This was very much the outlook of the genre of the Western in the time of my uncle's books and for many years afterward.Yes, as a kid, I read my uncle's books and went to the movies to watch horse operas. By the time I was 15 or so, the world was changing and Westerns, with their glorified myths and their very strict morality, were going out of vogue. I was also quite saturated with the whole Western thing and happy to turn to other things.I forgot about Westerns and then came "Unforgiven"--a movie that would certainly have both my aunt and uncle doing a few flip-flops in the grave! At the time of its release, I watched it and was quite struck by its script and acting. However, I was also unsettled by it and didn't care to watch it again.Through the years, it has continued to gnaw at the back of my mind though--until I finally bought the Blue Ray and popped it in the player.Wow! This movie is an eye-popper! Its production and dialog hold up today without seeming the least bit dated. Every actor is perfect in their roll and all their rolls are beautifully nuanced No one is entirely good or bad in this film. Everyones' motives are mixed and there is no clear path to righteousness. That isn't to say that good and evil don't exist in this movie; it is just to say that the characters behave as real humans do and that real humans seldom tread a straight line.The movie is deliberately paced yet there is not one incident or stretch of dialog that is not important. Every character in the movie has something of a story to tell... something that will shed a deeper light into their true soul.The movie is not light though, it is dark and sombre. It reminds us that a period of near lawlessness in our history was not some kind of a rootin' tootin' good time but rather a time of fear and oppression when strongmen ruled and there was little difference between lawmen and outlaws.If you are looking for a Western to watch to escape, perhaps see some happy "bar girls" dancing with cowpokes and, maybe, one of them will toss a shot of whiskey in the face of the hero only to fall in love with him later--well, this isn't the movie for you. If you want a movie that will make you think, perhaps upset you a bit and then rattle around in the back of your brain for 20 years until you have to watch it again, you have found it. I for one, don't plan to wait anywhere near that long for another viewing! My aunt would not have approved of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turns the Western on its head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Munny was once a murderous gunman, redeemed from his wicked ways by the love of a good woman. After her death he is struggling to bring up their children on a played out farm. A young man calling himself the Schofield Kid comes to recruit Munny to help claim a bounty placed by some prostitutes on the head of two cowmen, one of whom drunkenly cut up the face of one of the women but received no real punishment for it because Sheriff Little Bill runs the town according to his own twisted morality. Picking up Munny's friend Ned, the three men head off to do some killing.Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning western - his final western as an actor - is as iconic, in its own way, as the spaghetti westerns with which he made his name. It is particularly interesting because, despite being an absolutely traditional western in terms of setting and events, it plays fast and loose with one major element of westerns, namely morality.Westerns were always strongly drawn in terms of rigid and absolute morality, even to the use of visual shorthand: goodies wore white hats and rode white horses, while baddies favoured a black colour scheme. In Unforgiven, everyone and everything is morally compromised. Munny himself is a bad man turned good, doing a bad thing for a good reason. Little Bill is a wicked man, doing good things (keeping his town free of violence by enforcing a No Guns law) in a bad way, and enjoying the freedom this gives him to be sadistically violent. The cowman who gets painfully shot with a lingering death is the one who tried to stop his companion's violence. Ned does little wrong and is tortured to death. The prostitutes incite murder, but only because there was no justice in respect of the crime inflicted on one of their number. The film ends with a satisfying resolution, but no-one comes out of it with credit: one is used to westerns being drawn in black and white, but Unforgiven remains resolutely grey from start to finish.Unforgiven is an excellent film, but don't expect any moral certitude in it, because you won't find any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small town in the middle of nowhere where the famous and infamous meet portraits a world much bigger than the one we see in the images. The characters leading the action (the assassins, the whores and the pimp, the sheriff, the English man and the writer), all live by an honor code of their own and share different sides of justice. We as the audience are able to identify with all these characters at one point or another, even the sheriff who uses violence to impose the law, but also refrains from having blood spilled when other means are viable. One of my favorite 'slow' movies for it's subtle grandiosity, well developed characters and expert manner of delivering the audience this simple yet very deep story.

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant,Powerful Western Film Masterpiece From Clint Eastwood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is simply a Masterpiece it is not only one of the greatest Westerns ever but one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with excellent direction,powerful performances and a wonderful screenplay,Unforgiven is not only one of my favorite Western films,but one of my favorite films in general and Clint Eastwood's greatest film as a director.Set in the Western town of Big Whiskey,Wyoming in 1880,Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny(Clint Eastwood),a retired gunslinger who is now a farmer who has been asked to come out of retirement to collect a reward of 1,000$ to get two cowboys who cut and assaulted a prostitute. With the help from his old partner Ned Logan(Morgan Freeman)and a young gunslinger named The Schofield Kid(Jaimz Woolvett),William has to deal with trying to get the bounty as well as dealing with the town sheriff Little Bill(Gene Hackman).Unforgiven is a powerful masterpiece that came out during the time of the Western film revival that lasted from the mid-80s to the mid-90s. During the Western revival Westerns such as Tombstone(which is my second favorite Western during the revival),Best Picture Oscar Winner Dances With Wolves,Silverado,Pale Rider and the Young Guns films,just to name a few. The reason I think Unforgiven was the greatest Western during the revival is because Unforgiven was a film that offered something bigger and deeper. One of the reasons I love Unforgiven is because of the way Eastwood strips away the romantic view of the West and portrays the Old West as it really was:a violent,dark and dangerous world where there was dust, lawmen,outlaws in a sometimes lawless land where things like killings,blood and money were in the dust and where the West was ugly. Another thing that I love about Unforgiven is the film's dark Film Noir atmosphere and the way the film is shot. During the night and even the daytime scenes the film is surrounded by darkness and harsh light where there is rain and muddy streets on a constant basis with a sense of dread where you feel like you're in a nightmare and nothing is going to turn out all right. The film's visual style is one of the things that separates Unforgiven from other Westerns and what makes it stand out from other films of the genre. The film is also a study about violence,the way it's shown and how the characters react to the violence. The violence in the film is how violence is in real life it's horrible,ugly and unsettling and when characters are killed there no smiles,laughs or glee when a person is killed,but anger,sadness and regret. The film shows that even good and vicious human beings can be affected by violent acts. The screenplay by David Webb Peoples is excellent with Peoples giving the film great scenes and wonderful dialog that can be sometimes haunting and powerful. What's also great about Peoples screenplay is the moral ambiguity that the main characters have especially the two characters William Munny and Little Bill Daggett because while both characters are on opposite sides of the law with Munny being a gunslinger and Bill being a sheriff,but both characters are not shown in a right or wrong or black and white but a gray area. Munny was a vicious killer and can be seen as "bad",but is shown to care about his family and the people he is with while Little Bill is a lawman and is supposed to be "good" he does vicious things yet at the same time has likable qualities. I love that both characters are not shown as all the way good or all the way bad and that with the two characters there is something deeper and underneath the surface and much more complex than one might think. Unforgiven is a film that moves at such an amazing pace and will keep you glued to the screen trying to guess what happens next and the film never slows down. Although Unforgiven is not an Action film,the Action is great and intense and but like I said before the violence is ugly and horrible. The ending of this film is one of the best endings in film history and is so suspenseful,intense,unforgettable and iconic. The ending is so powerful and haunting and is one of the things that make this film a brilliant masterpiece.The whole cast in the film is excellent. Clint Eastwood is excellent and at his best as William Munny,with Eastwood bringing an intensity,grit and toughness as he does to his other roles. Gene Hackman is brilliant as Little Bill Daggett,with Hackman bringing depth and power to the performance. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Ned,Munny's old partner. Richard Harris is amazing as English Bob a gunslinger and old rival of Little Bill. Jaimz Woolvett is great as The Schofield kid,Munny's other partner. Saul Rubinek does a terrific job as W.W Beauchamp,English Bob's biographer. Francis Fisher is fantastic as prostitute Stawberry Alice. Anna Levine is wonderful and brings great depth to role as Delilah,a prostitute. Anthony James is memorable as Skinny a bar owner.The direction by Clint Eastwood is Excellent and Masterful,with Eastwood using simple,yet great camera movements and giving the film a haunting and dark visual style. Great direction by Eastwood.The score by Lennie Niehaus is great,melodic,haunting and intense at the same time and one of the things that adds to the greatness of the film. A powerful score by Niehaus.In final word,if you love Clint Eastwood,Western films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Unforgiven,a timeless Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By no means the masterpiece all declare it to be - too many clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear, everyone says how fantastic Unforgiven is, what a superb swansong for Clint Eastwood now in the twilight of his career, how Eastwood has redefined the western and undercut is clichés, and generally what a marvellous film it is, and I'm about to disagree. In some ways doing so is rather like breaking wind at a wedding, but I must be honest. I'll admit it: Unforgiven is a good Western and better than some, but in this reviewer's view it isn't the masterpiece some seem inclined to make of it. More than that, I can't quite even begin to understand why some people claim that it is. I have never thought Eastwood was much of an actor: he has the Man With No Name down to a T, but over and above that, even in the fabled Dirty Harry films, I've often felt him to be one-dimensional at best, and here I remain unconvinced by his character, William Munny. Munny, we are told, was at one time the meanest, most cold-blooded and most ruthless killer in the West but who was then - handkerchiefs at the ready girls and boys - tamed by the love of a good women. She transformed him and made him see the error of his ways. So when he is recruited by a self-styled young killer - who, it turns out, has never killed anyone despite his boasting and is horribly short-sighted to boot - to murder two cowboys in revenge for what they did to a whore, he agrees to do one last job only very reluctantly because his hogs have caught swine flu and he needs the money. Yet a few years on after his Damascene conversion to righteousness he is now such a good egg that he has forgotten how to mount a horse and can't shoot straight for toffee. Well, pull the other one. Just why the young would-be killer would come to the back of beyond to seek out Munny to enlist him is never made clear and - call me cynical - but the young shaver has 'plot device' written all over him. Munny sends him off with a flea in his ear, but has second thoughts and seeks out Morgan Freeman, another reformed killer and his former partner in crime, and the two of them head off from Missouri to Wyoming to catch up with the would-be killer to do the deed and collect the money. Freeman is another problem. He is a great actor but far too avuncular to convince as a man who had previously killed in cold blood. So far so clichéd, so what's all this talk about Unforgiven actually undermining clichés? Eastwood continues to be utterly useless, catching pneumonia and allowing himself to be beaten up by Gene Hackman's rather unpleasant sheriff, until the Moment Of Truth: his good friend and partner Morgan Freeman is caught and beaten to death by Hackman, so Eastwood Takes Revenge. Instantly, he is transformed from that wheezy old has-been into the ruthless gunman of yore, corners the sheriff and 20 of his deputies and sidekicks in the saloon and dispatches a great deal of them. Naturally, as is the way of films, he is lucky enough not to catch a bullet even though all 20 are shooting at him. Well, my response to all that is yet again: pull the other one. OK, Unforgiven is nicely shot (although it includes that post-modern cliché that it rained almost all the time in the West despite what earlier films showed us) and generally does the business, but outstanding it ain't. Sorry. In many ways it is cobbled together: what was the point of introducing English Bob, another notorious gunman who, presumably, also arrived in town to kill the cowboys and claim the reward? None as far as I can see except to introduce the unusual sight of an English gunman and give a turn to Richard Harris. Then there is the curious portrayal of the sheriff: it seems we are supposed to regard him as the baddie, yet all he does is insist that everyone should observe the town ordinance that no guns should be carried in town. Admittedly, he enforces that ordinance rather ruthlessly, but then he isn't exactly dealing with choirboys, as the case of two cowboys cutting up a whore only because she laughed at how small he was in the man department surely demonstrates. Incidentally, Hackman provides one of the better performances of the film. Saul Rubinek's itinerant writer of dime novels is included to demonstrate how the old West's is passing and is already being mythologised, but little more comes of him. So forgive me if I don't join in the general chorus of 'what a masterpiece this is'. As I say, it's entertaining enough and better than some but don't get carried away. I first saw this when it was released and remember coming away feeling vaguely disappointed, although I could never quite remember why. Now I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first scene of this masterpiece is a shocking, violent scene in which two cowboys cut up the face of a young, beautiful prostitute. That isn't the most pleasant opening to a film which has been referred to as beautiful. However, once the plot develops, the real beauty shows up.The premise behind the film is that the ruthless Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), sheriff of the town, merely punishes the two cowboys by requesting horses of them (this implies that Little Bill Daggett didn't in fact care about their punishment, but merely saw an opportunity to get some new horses). However, the colleagues of the harmed prostitute are not satisfied. They decide to put out a bounty for the cowboys' lives.A young boy, calling himself The Schoefield Kid, is drawn into hunting for the bounty, and decides to find himself the best partner he can - William Munny, a retired ruthless gunslinger. Munny (Clint Eastwood), reluctantly accepts to hunt down the bounty, but, much to The Schoefield Kid's surprise, brings along his old partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), a black man. Naturally, like many were in the Old West, The Schoefield Kid is a racist and doesn't approve.The story progresses similar to the ways in which most westerns do from there, including a subplot with Richard Harris as English Bob, an old killer who lands on Little Bill Daggett's grounds and gets treated brutally. However, unlike most westerns, there is a hidden element of beauty beyond the surface, the element that makes Unforgiven into one of the most critically acclaimed, mature westerns ever to be filmed.Many main characters turn out to be beautiful people on the inside, though they may not appear to be at first. The script has been beautifully written, each scene has been perfected. As well, Clint Eastwood did a spectacular job not just directing the film, but directing himself in it.Overall, this masterpiece is one of the greatest films of the nineties, and one of the greatest westerns of the twentieth century. This masterpiece is destined to be remembered as a classic for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Best Western ever they said. Clint Eastwoods masterpiece and the last real western ever made they said. Did they..did they really. I think THEY were talking through they're cowboy hats. Good movie sure..top notch performances and very well directed but not anything we haven't seen a thousand times before. The outlaw Josey Wales was a much better western and mirrored the same sentiment of a mans past catching up with him. Violent yes but we are lead to believe that they were violent times..cannot comment on that because I wasn't there.Gene Hackman is great as the violent sheriff trying to keep order in violent times and of course Clint makes a great cowboy but this movie lacks a little something for me. I also think that the men portrayed in this would worry too much about a prostitute who had a few scars on her face either..but that's irrelevant. At times the music goes off and you expect Clint Eastwood to start singing . All in all a few hours of a good western but I don't for one second believe it was Oscar material..I think they thought Mr Eastwood deserved one before he died.</fullReview>

Clint performance as Munny is bad all around. This is no Pale Rider or anything like that. Same for Morgan Freeman as Ned. Very stiff and artificial acting. Just about the only thing going for it is the story. The narrative with the whore being cut up and then the law doesn't do much about it, so the whores have to hire their own killer to get the bad guys... that part was good. But just something about the way it was done make the whole thing seem not real. For real good Eastwood western movies see Pale Rider or Two Mules for Sister sara. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood can be forgiven - but only just!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I will say I like this film. Its well produced with excellent acting from the main cast and supporting actors. The cinematography is at times overwhelming, the plot line intriguing.So why only a 7? Its not the masterpiece its made out to be, its been grossly over-hyped as Eastwood's Western swan song. Too much left to heavy sentiment. This three hour plus film is saved from the realms of mediocrity by the final brutal, vintage 20 minutes where William Muny is transformed again from grieving widow to brutal murderer. And its a long long wait but when it gets there, any thoughts of asking for a cinema ticket refund are long gone.The problem up until this point is the drawn out way in which the plot is painstakingly unravelled to reach this bloody conclusion . Granted Eastwood, Hackman, Harris and Freeman all act as if their reputations depend on it but this cannot gloss over the fact that for a good two hours, the viewer is left thinking where on earth is this going. Maybe this was a deliberate ploy by Eastwood as the finale certainly is one of the best in the last 20 years and the contrast couldn't be greater. Its just a shame that the audience has to be taken through this process in such a dull and plodding fashion.And just when you think all is lost, the film is plucked from the ashes of DVD oblivion with what can only be described as Eastwood at his very best. Tough, uncompromising, brutal and wonderfully sinister. A chilling, gripping, sensational and glorious end to what had been up to that point, an average if uninspiring yarn.Yes it might be an anti-western, and yes it won a bucket load of Oscars. It could even be classed as groundbreaking. But a masterpiece - I think these views owes more to the reality that a Hollywood Superstar is coming to the end of a glittering career rather than the film being 'that special'. And for this reason alone, I think everyone can be forgiven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Western-style movie by Eastwood shows that Eastwood still is a master in portraying Western-characters. Even more he knows how to create the classic-western feeling even when his plot and story are up to modern standards. He builds up his character carefully, till the glorious moment which in fact means also his downfall from the standards and moral he has set for himself. A good performance by Morgan Freeman, the most sympathetic character in this movie, and a violent and annoying as almost always Gene Hackman combined with a appearance of Richard Harris give the movie a strong foundation when it comes to acting-talents. The main disappointment is the predictability and simplicity of the story. In fact the story is not much more than a background to the character-development of Eastwood and thus falls a bit short of a 5-star or even a 4-star movie, in my opinion. Nonetheless a movie worth watching for Eastwood fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally westerns depict lawbreakers vs. law enforcers although the lines are blurred in some cases. Unforgiven wipes those lines away while failing to replace them with character or overview of anything but slaughter. People are driven by money, revenge, power, sadistic impulse and hero worship, never by love, beauty, hope or clarity. It is very well made but left me feeling empty. The movies that claim my top rating are repeatedly watchable, and that means they have an understandable human drive toward the better in some form. Even Goodfellas has an overview of humanity that offers insight into what makes those gangsters that way they are, presenting them as people caught up in a part that they can't see themselves playing. Unforgiven lacks a heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood directs what many feel to be his masterpiece, a Western which tries to be lyrical, which tries to be more real in the shadow of many that have gone before but retaining the violence of those films. Eastwood stars as a retired killer Munney, one of the most notorious and deadly bounty hunters ever. He met a woman who changed his ways, and they settled down and had kids. However, she died soon after, leaving him with the kids and some pigs. When a young prostitute is beaten, her and her friends look to their sheriff for justice. Hackman plays Little Bill, the Sheriif who wants peace in his town but will go to any lengths to achieve it. The justice he dishes out is minimal, so the women place a bounty on the heads of the two men who hurt the girl. The word spreads and young, ambitious man who calls himself the Schofield kid decides to collect. He needs a second man though, and goes to Munny who at first declines. However, he is getting old, is no good at farm work and decides to join the kid, bringing along old partner Ned to the displeasure of the kid. When they get to the town they realise what breed of men they are, and how justice is rare. Munny is caught by Bill and beaten. Later they kill one of the men in a reluctant shoot-out, and Ned leaves seeing what he is. The Kid kills the second man while he sits on a toilet. After the initial high he sees what he has done, vowing to never kill again, and leaves. Munny prepares to collect the bounty, but hears that Bill captured, tortured and killed Ned. This awakens his old spirit, and he goes for revenge.Eastwood, Freeman and Hackman are all good, but at times it seems they have little to do apart from look awkward. The film looks great, and there is good use of lighting, and sets, but it is overlong and at times too slow. Even though it is not meant to be a violence-fest, it does not compensate for this by having too many scenes which do not add anything to the plot. The sequences with Little Bill, English Bob and W.W Beauchamp are too long and only there to show Bill's supposed sadistic nature. Bill though does not appear to be particularly evil though meaning that we fail to feel much when he and Munney have their stand-off. Although it is true that the lines between good and evil, that Munney and Bill are not that different, are being blurred, this takes away much emotion. We have seen discussions on these themes in countless other westerns and it seems this film is only respected more because of its big names and budget. It is though-provoking, but not greatly so, it has a few good scenes, but many that seem like fillers, there are some funny moments and quotable dialogue, but the script is nowhere near as good as any of Leone's. A good revival of the Western which tries to offer more wisdom than is usually found in the genre, but which has become vastly overrated, and is not as good even as some of the earlier westerns that Eastwood directed.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Best Pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that grows on you the more times you watch it. The movie is quite slowly paced, so anybody looking for non stop action should look elsewhere. Anybody looking for a nicely played film spiced with well rounded characterisation and moments of tension will be well rewarded.A couple of cowboys turn on the ladies at the local brothel. Not happy with the "punishment" handed out by Little Bill (Hackman) the ladies band together and offer a reward for slaying the cowboys. Little Bill in turn decides to tighten up on the cowboys who try to claim the reward including English Bob (Harris) and Bill Munny (Eastwood). All the leads put in fine performances with the possible exception of Morgan Freeman who seems to be freewheeling. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest right now, I am not the biggest fan of Westerns, although there are a couple that I like which I won't go into.I personally thought this was a very over rated film. The reason for this is because there is another Western which was said to have influened Unforgiven, which was Tom Horn. Anyone who hasn't seen Tom Horn should do so. If you believe the reviews that Tom Horn got from it's 1st realise then you would be very naive. I can honestly say that Unforgiven was given the credit that Tom Horn didn't.I don't have too many complaints about Unforgiven, the plot wasn't bad, the acting was pretty good but I didn't think it was the classic that I was meant to belive it was. I can only really give it 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good film, don't get me wrong but I'm surprised it ranks so highly amongst Westerns. I wouldn't have it anywhere near the standard of Young Guns or Tombstone, or of the older Westerns, The Magnificent Seven.The great &amp; high profile cast is partly responsible for the high acclaim it's got. While they act the roles brilliantly, they all seemed a little past their prime for it to have the necessary action.It was good to see more character insight &amp; emotion in this than your standard John Wayne film &amp; good that it was also devoid of pointless shootings but it nonetheless lacked that tension &amp; excitement of the aforementioned Westerns and didn't cover a great deal of ground in the story.I'm not Clint's biggest fan and I never really connected with Munny or any of them here, it just needed a bit more younger blood amongst the cast and a little less dialogue.Still a good film though &amp; well worth a watch.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After almost thirty years in movies, Clint Eastwood took home an Oscar for "Unforgiven". In it, he plays ex-killer William Munny, who has given up his violent ways. Then, some unexpected events force him to have to decide whether to continue his non-violent life or return to violence.It seems to me that "Malcolm X" deserved Best Picture more than this one did, but Eastwood certainly turns in a captivating performance, as do Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris. Some people may have trouble watching this due to some of the things that happen in it, but if you can stomach it, then you should check it out. As Munny notes: "It's a hell of a thing killing a man. Taking away everything he's got".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie With A Great Cast, But A Bit Slow-Paced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a great fan of the western genre, I still have to concede that "Unforgiven" is a good movie that's well worth watching. It has a good and consistent storyline, some intriguing characters and a bit of humour thrown in for good measure. It is also, however, quite slow-paced and probably could have been shortened a fair bit without really impacting on the storyline.Clint Eastwood directed and starred as Will Munny, a man haunted by his past as a murderer (of women and children, as he freely admits) who gets caught up in a plan to claim a $1000 reward for killing a man who viciously assaulted a prostitute, leaving her permanently scarred. His chief adversary is the local Sheriff of Big Whiskey, Wyoming, known as Little Bill (Gene Hackman.) Bill knows that the reward has been offered and is determined to prevent anyone from claiming it. Hackman was very good in this role, dead serious when he needed to be (no pun intended) but also the source of much of the humour in the movie. Munny's co-horts Ned and "The Schofield Kid" were portrayed by Morgan Freeman and Jaimz Woolvett, respectively. Woolvett was quite good as the young gunfighter full of bravado who finds out what murder is really like, but I thought Freeman was underused.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Were I a big fan of westerns I'd probably rate it higher; as it is, I'd give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never understand the Academy's reason for giving this wretched western any attention, let alone a Best Picture Oscar. For Eastwood, we've seen this character before and it was done much better in The Outlaw Josey Wales. Freeman's dialogue was just downright stupid. Hackman and Harris are the only shining spots within the film. Hackman's Little Bill is Popeye Doyle with an even lesser regard for humanity and compassion. Harris is showy in his brief role as English Bob. This is not the worst westerns ever made, but it's certainly not worthy of an Academy Award.</fullReview>

But while i was watching this one i always expected something to happen, but was always disappointed when nothing did. Maybe its because this was one of my first western movies and i was expecting more action, or maybe its because it was hard for me to feel sympathy for the main character, but i still feel like there was something missing in this movie. So besides the strong ending i took most interest in the character development of Clint Eastwood, who, i have to admit, plays his role quite convincingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin slating and ranting against The Unforgiven, let me make a few points clear. I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and have seen most of his movies. I even like some under-appreciated ones, like The Eiger Sanction. I do not mind lack of morals. A Clockwork Orange is one of my all time favorites. I do not mind cruelty. I am one of the few, who can stand Pasolini's Salo.But I don't get this one. I simply don't get it, neither the first time nor the second one. Why does Munny leave his house? He leaves his kids alone and betrays his deceased wife. Why does Ned Logan leave his house and his wife? I do understand, why sheriff Daggett ignores the prostitutes initially. As Munny and Logan have heard about the reward, he must have too. So why doesn't he just chase the prostitutes away from the town? Why doesn't he take their money? Then why does he get involved, when the bounty hunters show up? Again, I don't get why he risks - and loses - his life for a couple of whore-hoppers.My inevitable conclusion is, that the story s*cks. The characters simply act irrationally. Sure it is beautifully shot - kudos to Leone. Acting is good. So I give it 5/10. But by far Unforgiven does not deserve all those awards. They should have gone to In the line of fire or A perfect World. Probably Eastwood and co were awarded, because the committee felt guilty. Much better movies like Dirty Harry and The outlaw Josey Whales did not receive anything. Alas, two wrongs do not make one right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Anti-Revisionist Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some critics refer to this movie as a revisionist western, but it is actually anti-revisionist: it says that the reality was more glorious and heroic than the myth. The Schofield Kid, having heard fantastic stories about what a killer Bill Munny was in the old days, talks him into helping him collect a reward on two men, one of whom sliced up a prostitute. Bill gets his old friend Ned to come along as well, and the three head for the town of Big Whiskey.Along the way, the Kid asks Bill if the story about the two deputies having the drop on him was true, that he pulled his gun out and killed them both. Bill's answer is evasive. Later, Ned says to Bill that he remembers that it was actually three deputies. In other words, the reality was more incredible than the story that had been told to the Kid, suggesting that the story had to be downplayed, reducing the number of deputies from three to two, in order for people to believe it.At the same time, English Bob, who has also heard about the reward, arrives in Big Whiskey with his biographer Beauchamp. Beauchamp has written about Bob's exploits in "The Duke of Death," which we are a little suspicious of because Bob is British. Being a heroic gunfighter is an American preserve. Sheriff Daggett does not approve of the reward put out by the women in the whorehouse, and so he arrests Bob for not turning in his pistol when he got to town. After reading some of "The Duke of Death," Daggett belittles the stories in that book, which he refers to as "The Duck of Death," telling Beauchamp how it really happened, giving a revisionist account that renders the story unheroic and farcical, as ridiculous as the house he is building (the deputies laugh behind his back about what a lousy carpenter Daggett is, with hardly a right-angle to be found in it).After the two men with the price on their head are killed, Ned is captured and tortured to death. When Bill finds out, he is determined to avenge his friend. Finding Ned's body displayed in front of the saloon that also functions as the whorehouse, where Daggett and his deputies are having a party, Bill walks in for the showdown. Beauchamp witnesses what happens next, which is far more astounding than the sensationalized stories he wrote about English Bob in "The Duke of Death."Though Bill's last name is Munny, a homonym for "money," and though he originally set out to make money by collecting the reward, yet this final act is for revenge, which is the motive most congenial to the mythology of the Old West. And when Bill kills Sheriff Daggett, whose last thoughts are about that ugly house he was building, this is a metaphor for killing his revisionism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Western Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody's favourite western is "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly." But mine is Unforgiven: the gritty, brutal, hellacious western that has not yet been topped by any that has come after. Plus, GBU dragged on, so I'd say that is my only good excuse for it being inferior. Plus the traits I mentioned earlier come at such a high degree that sets it apart from other westerns. Maybe GBU is better, Unforgiven is America's best western.In the corrupt town of Big Whiskey in Wyoming, low-lives badly cut up a prostitute. The Sheriff (Gene Hackman) barely gives a punishment. So the call-girls set up a bounty against the men out of revenge. William Munney (Eastwood) hears about it and gets his old buddy (Freeman) to come with him to Big Whiskey to help him out. Munney used to be the meanest, best gunslinger, but now wants a normal life for him and his kids. As the Sheriff grows more brutal, Big Whiskey becomes a war zone, with Munney being the only hope.Collecting a bounty is the most common story for a western, but this isn't about a bounty. Well, it is, but that's just what's being dealt with. Plus, the movie is brilliantly made, from its characters to the set. Big Whiskey is a dark place that is shown lots at night. Eastwood and Freeman's journey to Big Whiskey is usually shown in the daytime. Nice things happen outside of Big Whiskey, brutality and gore happen in Big Whiskey. Gene Hackman is so evil, he is devilish. Eastwood fights off all evil. The bar in Big Whiskey looks like the fiery pits of hell. So basically, Gene Hackman is the devil, Big Whiskey is hell, Clint Eastwood is God, and the war between the two is the constant battle between good and evil, so the movie is allegorical. Sounds stupid? Watch it and you will see where I'm coming from!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a western, directed by Clint Eastwood, starring him as Bill Munny, an ex killer whose life has changed to the better after marriage, along with Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan, a friend and old partner of Bill and Gene Hackman as Little Bill Dagget, a cruel and savage sheriff, who tries to keep the peace in his town by any means.The story is about Bill starting a journey, in order to make some money by killing two men who hurt a prostitute and her friends want them dead. Along with him, there is Ned Logan and the "Schofield Kid", a boy who told Bill about these men and the reward. In their path they find Little Bill Dagget, who tries to keep away all the assassins who come to his town for the same purpose as Munny. That brings a conflict between the two men.I have never been a fan of westerns, but I loved this one. First of all, there is some great storyline, maybe a classic one for this genre, but still very good. The direction was really good, a perfect mix of slow but steady scenes and action scenes, that's why Eastwood won an Oscar for it. Also, the screenplay was very realistic, I mean, I appreciated the fact that it wasn't about cowboys who fight crime and they kill the bad guys and we have a happy ending. It reflected the true nature of people in a time when people didn't need a good reason to kill each other.The cast was perfect, Eastwood gave a great performance, maybe the best of his (at least for me). Munny was a sad man with regrets about his past and also grateful to his wife for making him change. He now struggles to make a living for him and his children instead of returning to his old habits, but he only takes the chance to kill the two men, for his children. And all of this was portrayed perfectly by Eastwood.Hackman's performance was flawless as well. He is the perfect bad sheriff with his unique sense of justice, who kills with no hesitation anyone who will disturb the town's peace. So the man who doesn't want guns in his town, kills whoever he thinks is necessary and sometimes for vengeance or pleasure too.The supporting cast was really good as well. Morgan freeman, Jaimz Woolvitt (the "Schofield Kid") and the girls who portrayed the prostitutes were all very good.It was interesting watching Munny fighting against his old nature as a killer. And the difficulty with which he decides to hunt the two men, for the good of his children this time. I think it was smart to give depth only to this character as he is the most important in the movie.I didn't like the appearance of "English Bob", I was expecting him to be some kind of key character and then I understood I was wrong, it was like the producer owed him a favor or something. The same thing happens with the biography guy.To sum up, it was a great movie, with memorable performances, still not perfect. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen just about every movie in this genre, and when I saw this film I felt like I had a cathartic moment at the ending sequence that I have never had in a western. If you grew up on things like "The Magnificent Seven", "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", and "Once upon a time in the west", you are in for a real treat. And if you are like me and watched all of John Wayne's garbage, you are about to see what a real actor and director can do among the tumbleweeds.Clint has always been able to act without saying a whole lot, the expressions on his face and the amazing interaction between him and Freeman show you what these guys can really do. It is unfortunate that he later starred in "Dreamcatcher" - I can't believe these are the same person.Enjoy the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect Western homage in that it shuns and honors glorification of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of Westerns, they don't get much more gun-slinging than Clint Eastwood, the face of the great Sergio Leone Westerns that inspired generations of filmmakers. How fitting, then, that Eastwood should produce, direct and star in "Unforgiven," a film that honors yet challenges everything those and other classic Westerns stand for. Gritty and, well, unforgiving, the film skeptically examines the creation of the Western tall-tale while providing us one of its own, a masterful homage and commentary all in one.Once you understand just what "Unforgiven" is doing, the gates open and the film becomes a powerful Western. Eastwood stars as William Munny, a former gun-for-hire and now a widowed pig farmer caring for his two children who stopped killing and drinking years ago. When a young thrill-seeker by the name of "The Schofield Kid" (Jaimz Woolvett) tells him of a $1,000 reward for the heads of two cowboys that cut up a whore in Big Whisky, Wyoming, he goes against his better judgment and rounds up his friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) for a last job of sorts.But Big Whisky is no average small town; it's run by a sheriff named Little Bill (Gene Hackman)&nbsp;who lays down the law and lets everyone ? especially guests toting guns ? know it. Trouble brews when the whores pool their money together to offer the reward, as it draws some crooked folks into the town such as English Bob (Richard Harris) and his book-writing cohort. Little Bill makes short order of English Bob and begins to tell the novelist the "real" take on the Wild West. Hackman's portrayal of this ruthless simpleton who likes to feed the mythos behind the Western tall-tales is a cutthroat and honest one. Little Bill's a contradiction in that he serves as proof that the West isn't glamorous but that's how he tells it.A similar dynamic develops between Will, Ned and The Schofield Kid. The Kid asks Will about the stories he's heard of how he took out two men that had him dead to rights and so on. He talks a mean game including the five men he's killed. Old Will and Ned have clearly seen worse in their day, but they remain silent. With their past kept a mystery in David Webb People's brilliant script, we just see them as two experienced but rusty gunslingers with thick character and a time-tested way of doing things. Despite their plan to kill for money, we like them, which the film tests in its powerful last act.Eastwood's performance isn't tremendous here, at least in the beginning, but the script calls for him to be a bit reserved. Instead, the first act benefits from Hackman's performance, which comes on quickly once English Bob gets in town. Harris is also excellent with some sinister nuance, although we're left wanting more from his character in terms of screen time.The film manages to not only work in terms of story as both classic and gritty Western, but also in terms of the feel. The tone is largely subdued at first to serve as a sign that life in the West isn't as glorious as the stories make it out to be, but the film turns into one of those legends in its own way. Thus, "Unforgiven" film exposes its genre as fantasy while also affirming it for being such. The lesson ends up being "it is what it is" in the sense that life ain't pretty, but there's right, there's wrong and there's people who do something about it. The message gets amplified by Eastwood's late one-liner, "deserve's got nothing to do with it." If nothing else, Eastwood beautifully caps off a long career of Westerns with this perfect ending film for any actor.</fullReview>

I waited many years to get this film and the wait is worth it. I was blown away(for the most part) about how great this movie is. I'm not surprised because Clint Eastwood is the one of the best directors/actors Hollywood has ever seen.This is about two older guys who team up with a younger guy to kill two cowboys for a large sum of money.The acting is fabulous. I was intrigued by Hackman's character. He is what made this movie so good. I'm not gonna say anything bad about Eastwood and Freeman because they play great characters as usual. I didn't like that Schoefield kid though.Overall, this is a great western that deserves to win Best Picture. However, I did like Dance with Wolves a little better. But this is the last, true western. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I've ever hated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 97Unforgiven wraps up my Western week, preceded by the Searchers and the Dollars trilogy. (I've reviewed all of them). In this story, Clint Eastwood sets out to kill two men who slashed up a woman, with his friends Morgan Freeman and the Kid. Also receiving their names on the box are Gene Hackman, the bipolar sheriff and Richard Harris, a British patriot.A lot of this film is great. The script is tight and the stories are masterfully interwoven, the music fits the bill, and the acting is very good across the board. On paper, this is an absolute masterpiece of a film.A major success of Unforgiven is its characters. Will, the 'protaganist', is a retired gunslinger, and he reminds everyone of that throughout the film. He's also given up drinking, because of his deceased wife's memory. He needs money for his kids, and since pigs can't cut it, he picks up his guns to catch a bounty.Morgan Freeman is his friend, also a retired gunslinger. He has handled dealing with the past much better, as he is calm and content. However I didn't like Freeman's character, Ned. We never found out much about his past, so we don't really care about him. Ned simply isn't the kind of character Freeman should play. It seems he was only there for star billing.And speaking of star billing, Richard Harris. He plays a 'killer', and a very proud Brit, a true nationalist. He is EXCELLENT. Which is why it's a shame and a waste that he arrive 40 minutes into the movie, and leaves as Clint and Morgan show up. Yet, he receives star billing, his picture on the front of the box, and a write-up on the back. Silly.The Kid is unlikable. If he were alive today, he'd be a textbook redneck. But we find out his faults, and the truth, and in the end I liked his act.Lastly, the sheriff. Two-Face himself. I'm not sure of the direction that was taken with Little Bill. He is nice, jolly, brutal and cruel throughout the movie. Is he a bad guy? Or Clint's adversary? Or are we supposed to like his justice, which is his job? It's very grey.My main issue is the ending, so spoilers be here. It's simply wrong, what they did with Will Munny. We see his descent into his old ways, but for it to end like that is sickening. He extracts revenge on Bill, which is fine for him to do in my opinion because of how he treated Ned. Munny then has to kill every other armed man in the bar. But the real kick is when he drinks at the bar. He's returned to his old self, and threatens to kill everyone unless proper treatment was given to Ned. But maybe he could've dealt with that himself? Then to top it off, we're given the sad music and told he's moved. How can we find that ending satisfying? A better ending, Scarface style, would involve Will killing the second slasher, being informed of Ned's fate, killing everyone in a rage with the Kid watching, and then the Kid shooting Will to end his wickedness, and have a first kill that had a justified purpose.One other issue: the movie is really dark. At night, the screen is almost entirely black. I've never had this problem with any other movie.Technically, Unforgiven is a great film with solid characters and messages to ponder. Unfortunately, a bungled ending leaves a very sour taste in your mouth. Hence, Unforgiven is the worst movie I've every liked. 8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is how a western should be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll make this short and sweet: I will admit that I'm not too much a fan of westerns, but the best ones I've ever seen have always featured Clint Eastwood in them. My father knows more about western movies than I do, but it was because of my father's influence that I was drawn especially to the works of Clint Eastwood (like his Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns" and his 1985 self-directed western-comeback feature "Pale Rider"). I'd also love to throw in the late Sam Peckinpah's 1969 landmark bloodbath "The Wild Bunch" for good measure. Then came in Eastwood's swan song to the genre, 1992's "Unforgiven." The Best Picture Oscar-winner of 1992, it stars an aged, then-62 Eastwood as William "Will" Munny, a retired gunslinger now trying to make ends meet as a pig farmer and widower with two young children on an isolated farm in Kansas. One day, he's approached by a young bounty hunter named The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who wants his assistance in tracking down the cowboys who mutilated a prostitute miles away in Big Whiskey, Wyoming. After some initial reluctance and deep soul-searching and contemplation, that's when Munny decides to take on the bounty with The Schofield Kid. Eastwood used his age here to great effect: one of the more dishearteningly realistic and poignant scenes in this film is when Munny tries to mount his horse and because he's gotten older and been out of the game for so long, it takes him a couple tries to get back on the saddle. He contacts an old friend named Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the three make their way to Big Whiskey, where they eventually butt heads with the town's brutal sheriff, Little Bill (Best Supporting Actor Oscar-winner Gene Hackman). "Unforgiven" is undoubtedly the greatest western I've ever seen; it would probably rank the same as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1967), it's that good. What makes this film so especially great is what it doesn't do. "Unforgiven" is not all about cowboys, guns, gunfights, and easy women. No. While it has those, it doesn't glamorize them. This is a dark, depressing, violent, and angry film with one of its main concerns being to turn many well-known western-genre conventions (like what I just mentioned) on their head. That is why the Academy saw fit to give this film and Eastwood so many awards in 1992, and why it is commonly referred to as an "anti-western" feature.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiery and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am more and more impressed by the capabilities of Eastwoods directing. This movie is on a very high level of perfection. I barely have anything to complain about. The pretty much only gripe for me has been the ending. It seemed a bit exaggerated. But that only made the whole thing even more fiery and disturbing. It is one of the rare movies that makes you think. The script was quite smart. I rarely saw a movie that had so well drawn characters. Actors fit perfectly. Especially Clint and Gene Hackman impressed me. Seeing those two in their role, i am absolutely sure, that no one could have substituted them. They fit perfectly into their roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this film for the first time on DVD I was frankly completely underwhelmed by the whole two and a bit hours. Maybe my original expectations for the film were unrealistic or just simply wrong because when I watched it again years later I must have been in the right mood because I was blown away by its innovative approach. For me it simply doesn't fit any convenient criteria and when you watch it the story doesn't unfold in some reasonably predictable way. It is continuously changing and evolving and whenever you think you have it figured it goes down a less worn path and I was drawn back to it all the more because by this point you are watching to see where it is going to go. It isn't really just a western its a fine study of hard times for virtually everybody concerned and the lengths each will consider to survive. I would recommend anyone watch this film as it is genuinely interesting and makes the viewer think about what is important in life and it doesn't preach a message but simply lays it out for opinion. Please be patient when watching this film and in my opinion you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Essay on Killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not too bad, but it's not really that good either. It reminded me of Lawman, made 20 years earlier, in 1971. Both films are heavy on what it takes to kill a man, in what you might call the everyday run of things, that is, outside a national war situation. Eastwood looks good, but he has only one persona, one expression, one tone of voice; hard, laconic, matter-of-fact. Both films focus on the killer instinct, the man who doesn't think twice about ending another man's life. Lancaster's lawman kills because it's his legitimate job; Munny kills for money, and for revenge. Lancaster ends up with nothing, but Munny ends up prospering in dry goods. Both films make you think. However, Lawman is the better film, with a better plot and script; and Lancaster is the better actor. My feeling is that Unforgiven's ratings will drop over time, whereas Lawman's will rise. See them back to back.Thinking about Unforgiven (what does the title mean?) again, I realise I've given it at least two too many stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to get something out of the way, I am a Clint fan-boy. From a young age I've thoroughly enjoyed his films (even the films made before I was born like the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and Dirty Harry), however, this I hope will not sound biased because I have watched this film dozens of times. In my opinion, it stands only second to "A Clockwork Orange," my all-time favorite film. Even now, I'm in still awe about it. The incredible cast(Eastwood himself, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, etc.)mixed with an amazingly simple story and yet still have an in-depth look on the consequences of violence as well as the spreading of legends (both exaggerating and desecrating them) makes one heck of a story. The "character with regrettable past" is also put into play (as with other Clint classics like Mystic River and Gran Torino). Clint presents us with unforgettable characters that the cast helps portray (particularly Hackman, who makes a very intriguing character). Whatever I say does not give this film even remotely enough justice. For those who haven't seen it, go out and rent it right now, for few will be disappointed. Some of the only films that are to come close are: Braveheart, No Country for Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption and few others. These movies don't quite beat it though. Never will a movie will like this be made again, which almost saddens me. As a final statement, go give this movie a shot for, again, those who haven't seen it and those who saw it, but didn't like it. You may find something you may cherish that you didn't notice before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixture of Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiving is a four Oscar winner, western film with many great actors like Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and the living legend Clint Eastwood as start, director and producer. This film tells the story of retire; alcoholic, and bounty hunter cow boy name William Munny. He change his way of life, because of his wife. At the present, William Munny is a widower, father of two children making a living as a farmer. One of my favorite performances was done by Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggett. He is the sheriff of the town, Big Wisky. He is the law and the law said "no guns allowed in town". The peace of his slow town got disturbed one night when two cowboys that were enjoying themselves in the local bar got offended when the hooker jiggles at the size of his male anatomy. Suddenly one of the cowboy's whips out his knife and slashes the face of a prostitute he's with. Little Bill Dagget the sheriff, instead of arresting the cowboys, allows them to get off with the understanding that they hand over six horses to the saloon owner as a payment for damage to his property "the whore". Bill's decision got the victim's best friends furious. The victim's friends pool their savings and offer a bounty of $1000 to anybody who will murder the cowboys. This reward money brought a lot of bounty hunter to town with their guns, including Clint Eastwood. Little Bill beaded the hell out of each bounty hunter who stepped into town breaking his laws. Combinations of feelings, about Little Bill Dagget views of justice take you over when he takes law into his own hands. I think movies are a great entertainment. However, at least for my taste, western movies are far from it. I can't have a good time when I see people falling down death like pieces of domino every five minutes. But, for the gun's lover here is plenty of shooting and good acting.</fullReview>

Unforgiven is a well done film, its not really a bloodbath of cowboys like most of the westerns, sure there are a few action scenes, but the drama history its what really takes most part of the film.The characters are complex and develop a lot of issues that add a good contribution to the history. The actings are really good... well that's something you could predict whitout any effort, just by reading the cast member's names.The part that was really missed in this film was the music, it is something that you simply don't notice at all.

Even with the great thespians of Eastwood and Gene Hackman, I certainly believe that Morgan Freeman plays one of his best roles in this movie. He didn't have the great amount of lines in the film, but who did with this movie bouncing between many actors. Morgan "oh andy" Freeman, showed that he is one of the best actors in the business. This movie should be watched by all Freeman fans, even if they are not western genre lovers. I think that the casting for this movie was on the money again.

		<fullReview>I'm an action film buff, and frankly I don't care much for the subtleties of art films. I can't fault great acting or storytelling, but I get bored during melodramas ("Forrest Gump") and don't have the refinement or art appreciation to love the music and settings when the story is horrid and the characters uninteresting ("The Piano").So Westerns are confusing for me because they're always dusty grim arty tales trying to say something about the Wild West and manhood. Bleah. But there's plenty of shootin' and hollerin', as a good action film should have.Unforgiven came out on top. There's a real story, with real characters, and the film has something to say. But it's intelligent without getting in-your-face arty (blam!) or too subtle arty (huh?), and you've gotta love Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman. It's fascinating how rather than try to ignore the issue of age (as Sean Connery has done), Eastwood works it into his characters, here and in the films "Space Cowboys" and "In the Line of Fire".Who should see this film:-- drama / art lovers who've seen Westerns all look the samecan dare to see this one -- it's quite an original take-- action film buffs on a rainy day, or who don't mind a littledrama mixed in with the stuff blowing up constantly-- Western fans -- a must-see!I'll give "Unforgiven" a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny, a retired gunfighter who is now a gentle widower and a farmer who picks up his gun one more time. The thing that amazes me the most about this film is how it is willing to confront the effects of violence on both of who commit it and who suffer it.

		<fullReview>To say that "Unforgiven" is a great movie is to sell it short. "Unforgiven" is a classic of the highest order. I have been a Clint Eastwood fan since childhood and never missed his movies on TV or on the big screen. When I saw this movie for the first time back in 1992, I was on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the screen. I don't think I even blinked for two hours. My favorite scene in any movie is the climax of this film, when Will Munny (Clint) confronts Little Bill (Gene Hackman) in the saloon. With the rain pouring outside and the thunder rolling, he sets the wheels of revenge into motion. That scene is so powerful that it is difficult to watch. The movie ends beautifully, poetically, and perfectly.The actors shine. All of the characters are flawed. The lines between good and bad are quite blurred throughout. Clint is amazing. Gene Hackman is perfect. Morgan Freeman is phenomenal. All of the supporting cast play their roles perfectly. I truly love this film. I am sure that 100 years from now people will still be talking about the brilliance of this film.It moved me then and still does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood, the epitome of the bad old west, brings us "Unforgiven", the story of three would-be assassins who ride North to collect a reward for killing two no good cowboys who cut up a girl.Eastwood's film is very moody, and as director he has created a very convincing atmosphere along with a dark 'feeling' about the film. The characters, created by Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Richard Harris, are also great, and typical of the old west. Yet even with great performances from Eastwood and Hackman, and great production values, the plot is a little too wide open and one feels there is a little left unresolved. The script perhaps needed a fraction more work.Great entertainment, but lacking depth.Friday, February 19, 1993 - Croydon Twin Cinema</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie, for an American western. The reason this movie is so good is that its style and sensibilities come straight from the great European westerns of the 1960's and 70's.The funny/cool dialog, the ultra-violence, the bleak and unclean environment, the over-the-top characters, the deconstruction of the traditional western, the erasing of the line between good and evil, making the protagonist an anti-hero- all of these things have been done before, and quite often done better. This movie owes everything to spaghetti western directors such as Leone, Corbucci, Valerii, Baldi, etc.I don't mean to take anything away from this movie by saying that. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Eastwood should be commended for making it, and showing that American westerns don't have to be stiff and boring. I just want to give credit where credit is due, especially since in the special feature that discusses the movie, Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Gene Hackman fail to even mention the Italian westerns and directors that so heavily influenced this film. Shame on them. If it wasn't for that Euro-western influence, Unforgiven would not have won an Oscar for best picture.Eastwood and Hackman were tremendous in this movie. Clint is as cool as ever here, and Hackman's over-the-top portrayal of "Little Bill" is entertaining as hell. Richard Harris is also great as "English Bob." The music is pretty boring compared to the great spaghetti western scores, but still quite a bit better than average for a Hollywood western.This is one of the very few American westerns worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS SPOILERSThis was essentially a western for those who don't like westerns(the coffee shop and art house crowd). I felt it went way out of it's way to debunk the lore and mythology surrounding the genre. Along with that it was very preachy as it drove home its point about violence having consequences, along with all the other "pc" messages. The biggest problem I had with it though was the Scofield Kid's coming to Jesus about killing someone. In the west, a kid of that kind would have encountered the death of a man before. At the very least he would have gone hunting and killed an animal. Added to that, would a kid who was able to bust someone's leg with a shovel, really be that upset over a first killing? He might be moved by it but i don't think he would've cried. Also, why was he able to walk away from this. I would think it would've been more dramatic to show that once he has killed he can't go back to the way he was before. In closing, as I have said in the title, this was to westerns, what the Dixie chicks are to country music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was so good about this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***There are spoilers in this commentary*** I have disagreed with the Academy on only one other occasion - The year Shakespeare in Love stole the Oscar from Saving Private Ryan. I have seen all of the Oscar winners for Best Picture since the mid-80's and I agree with the choices, but Unforgiven was utterly dissapointing. I believed this was going to be one of the great epics of our time, after having read that it was heralded as the greatest western in many years. But after watching it for the first time, I found that it is one of the reasons why I stay away from Westerns in general. Slow, boring, and typical. The movie started out promisingly enough. A former tough guy coming out of retirement in order to give his kids a chance at a good life. It then proceeded to sputter along at the pace of Clint Eastwood on his horse, and hit all of the expected plot points. The old cowboy comes out of retirement to join in on a bounty hunting expedition, the three complete their task, the cocky guy learns a life lesson about death, the main characters best friend is killed, he revenges his death by killing the fearless villain, and returns to his old life in the end. Getting the plot going could have been done much more interestingly - Cutting up a lady for saying someone has a small dick? Come on Clint. There were a few unexpected parts in the film, though. What exactly was the purpose of the emphasis on the young guys poor vision? Clint not being able to get on his horse? That didn't even cause him to be caught at a pivotal point in the movie. English Bob? I guess he showed Hackman's toughness as the Sherriff character, but they portrayed him in the beginning as if he was to be a major character, when he's on screen for about 10 minutes. I didn't get him entirely, and I don't get what was so good about the movie. Tombstone was certainly a cut above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsuccessful mix of myth debunking and gunfighter Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I should come clean straightaway: I'm a fan of Western movies. The golden age for me was certainly the films of John Ford and, to a lesser extent,those of Howard Hawks and Anthony Mann. But I have always welcomed freshness. And that has included welcoming those wonderfully stylish spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and others such as CorbucciAnd despite being an unashamed John Ford fan who willingly submitted to his clearly over-romantic view of the Old West, I certainly found much to enjoy in such revisionist westerns as "McCabe and Mrs Miller" and "The Culpepper Cattle Company" despite the fact that they set out to debunk many of the myths propagated by Ford. The fact that they did so seamlessly and in the context of the film caused me to welcome them, not least because they helped extend the life of the Western.In giving my verdict of Clint Eastwood's revisionist western "The Unforgiven" perhaps other people might see me as being a blinkered fan and perhaps not. But I can't foresee a time when I'll ever come to like the film. And nobody will ever convince me that this is a better film than such as "The Searchers" which failed to secure a single Oscar nomination.As the first western in years to win a Best Picture Oscar, it certainly has come with a big reputation. And, on the face of it, the story of an ageing gunslinger who has found it hard to adapt to civilian life and returns, despite chronic rustiness, to fight the good fight on behalf of a wronged prostitute seems to have much to recommend it and to provide plenty of opportunity for classic Western fare.But I can't help but feeling that the praise heaped on the film, and that Oscar, was more due to either blinkered critics or long-time Western fans who hoped that by praising it they could revive a genre which had all but spluttered out by the mid 1970's.Clint Eastwood, of course, made his name with Westerns. Firstly with the tv series "Rawhide"; then via Sergio Leone's series of classic spaghetti Westerns. And in previous directing outings he seemed at home with the genre. "The Outlaw Josey Wales" was a fine epic and "High Plains Drifter", though clearly showing an enormous debt to Sergio Leone, was memorable in its own way. But here he seems willing to bite the hand that fed him.In "The Unforgiven" Clint seems determined to hammer us over the head with his revisionist points: the journalist who recounts the sad truth about the gunslingers, the ageing gunfighter who can hardly tie his shoelaces; and then there's the problems of the young would-be gunslinger whose shooting difficulties serves to inform us that people in the Old West were also shortsighted. What's worse is that in each case Clint repeatedly makes these points like a boxer pounding away at the punchbag.Finally having preached all that to us he throws the history lesson-book out the window and proceeds to present us with the classic stereotypical Western where the good but ageing gunslinger finds it in himself to defeat the evil baddie against all the odds.Maybe it's that incongruity that gets me most. He can't make up his mind whether to give us a history lesson or a classic revenge Western.(Or was it the demands of the money men caused him to compromise in the second half of the film?).And make no mistake, there are certainly many good points in this movie: the magnificent use of scenery; the performance of Gene Hackman in another standout role; the showdown between Clint and Gene.But this is one case where the whole is far less than the sum of its parts.The Old Master, John Ford, needed only a few short seconds to give his opinion on revisionism in Westerns. In "The Man who shot Liberty Vallance", not one of his best but then it was made towards the end of his long career, his newspaper editor when confronted with reality states: "When the legend becomes fact, (I'll) print the legend".And that's how it should be with Westerns.Leave the history lessons for the academics, Clint.And maybe next time you'll come back with a deserving Oscar winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, however not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a good movie. Clint Eastwood did a tremendous job in acting and directing this film which had a great supporting cast as well. However, I don't believe that this film is worthy of a Best Picture award or making it on to the AFI's top 100 list.I believe that this movie is an effort by Eastwood to say to everyone that he is finished acting in westerns. The story, just like real life, tells the story a man who has been out of the game for a few years and is making one last triumphant return to his old stompin' grounds. His character, William Munny, is basically a culmination of all the tough guys he has played in other westerns and the Dirty Harry films. Eastwood plays this role to the best of his slightly diminished ability and is perhaps only believable based on what we know of him in his previous films. This film is unlike many other westerns in the fact that it doesn't glorify violence. Rather, it shows its dark side and the after effects that it has on people and their emotions. When Morgan Freeman cannot bear to shoot a man, when the Schofield Kid claims that he will never shoot another after he had killed his first and the reality behind the scene when Eastwood kills the first cowboy all go towards the de-glorification of violence.This film has a great performance from Gene Hackman which isn't because of the character he plays, rather what he did with the character he got. All other supporting cast roles are satisfactory, but even Freeman's performance was somewhat lacking. Eastwood himself did a decent job, but doesn't match any of his earlier western performances. He seems uninterested in this film and it shows.The movement of the film was above average and the film went by quite quickly. I feel that if this element of the film wasn't there, the movie would have been a real dud. The cinematography and locations of the film didn't really add much either. I always got the impression that the surroundings were very cold and this really didn't suit the film that well.I gave this film such a high mark because I felt the story really worked, Hackman's fine performance and the pace and movement of the film were perfect for a western. However, this film ranks low among those I gave a 7.7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite Westerns, and ranks with up there with the Sergio Leone trilogy that Clint Eastwood starred in back in the 60's. It's less about Cowboys And Indians, concentrating more on the realities of pulling the trigger and the effect it has on the psyche, as all the bravado in the world can't prepare you for taking another man's life. Such an unglamourised approach is refreshing to say the least, and gives the characters a lot of depth as we follow their personal journeys towards an unforgettable conclusion. It was the last great genre movie until the remake of True Grit 18 years later. I think we need another one... Fancy another crack at it, Clint?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Unforgiven" (1992) This movie talks about violence and guns. And this movie makes me think about righteousness. Who is right? Who is wrong? Who are the victims? In the midst of moral complexity, how can we judge who is right and who is wrong? While I watched this movie, I felt that not everybody is right, and not everybody is wrong. It is an ambiguous feeling. This movie reminds me of Ecclesiastes and an imperfect world. What are we going to do when we face troubles? I felt for the prostitutes in the movie because they were unfairly treated and they were like slaves who could be sold to others by saloon owners. But are the prostitutes right? Would they have chosen this job? The movie is voyeuristic. Its lawlessness in 1880 makes me feel that I am in Korea in 2007. And about the violence and guns, it echoes the world I live in. Obviously, why can't the American government kick the guns out of this country? I live in one of the most beautiful and most fair countries, but I also live in the country where I can be killed fairly easily because of the violence and guns. It is ironic.This is the country where Christians are influential and Christians are marginalized. It is funny and sad. Vanity. We have one hope: Jesus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie with high hopes. It's supposed to be one of the classic westerns, right? Garth Ennis spends the entire introduction to Preacher: Ancient History talking about how great Unforgiven is. And hey, it has Clint Eastwood in it. Can't go wrong there. I spent the entire time wondering if there was a mix-up I got the DVD for some other movie instead. You see, Unforgiven has a great script. It could have used a little work, yes. In the beginning we get a couple cheap laughs out of Eastwood's kids wondering "Did daddy used to kill people?". I can overlook that. Though the scenes with English Bob, I can't. In any movie, you don't devote that much time to a character that disappears and is never seen again. And in the final fight there's a rather nasty cliche, but I won't spoil it for you. It does have some classic lines in it, and is full of great ideas. But the whole thing feels kinda sloppy, like a first draft. It could have been trimmed down to a ninty-minute movie, easy. The direction is atrocious, though. And the cinematography looks like it was done by Art Wolfe. You see, a movie like Unforgiven needs to be gritty and dark. Instead, our (anti)heroes ride across landscapes out of tourist ads for national parks. It's nauseatingly sappy, which is the exact opposite emotion that we should feel. Not even Clint Eastwood's final speech can save the movie. Oh yeah, and right before the credits, they pull a "Where are they now?" that totally ruins the ending. I hope that someone, somewhere down the line, will have the balls to remake this supposed-classic and find the greatness that's hiding inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can one say about an overrated revisionist western?Why blur the line between bad guys and good guys? I didn't get it. Where is the fun? We all know that those times were wild, uncivilized and brutal, so, I guess, there is no need for movies like Unforgiven, since we have plenty of examples of the darker side of human nature around us.On the plus side I have to admit that there is some good acting, specially Eastwood. Morgan Freeman in his usual kind of role is OK. Hackman, I think, overdid it a little. Needless rough on the sex department, the opening scenes were not necessary, nor the language. May be it is Unforgiven but, on the other hand it is pretty Forgettable; one wonders why it's got an Oscar. Pretty run-of-the-mill film. Nothing special about it.</fullReview>

It is also as misanthropic a movie as one could ever hope to see. Gene Hackman is too over-the-top. Clint is too forced. Freeman is great, but his role is ancillary. Altogether, probably the worst movie to ever win Best Picture of the Year, and that includes Ordinary People and Cimarron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He should have armed himself.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Whisky is full of people trying to lead quiet lives. Cowboys try to make a living. Sheriff 'Little Bill' tries to build a house and keep order. When a couple of cowboys cut up a prostitute and disfigure her, the other prostitutes put a bounty on the cowboys. The bounty attracts The Schofield Kid, and he convinces ageing killer William Munny to join him. Munny reformed for his wife, and has been raising his two children in peace, since his wife passed on. But farm life is hard. And Munny is no good at it. So he calls his old partner Ned, and rides off to kill again, but who is villain, and who is heroic.........Redemption is the order of the day here, and Eastwood has crafted one of, if not the, finest western ever committed to screen.Its clear that the four ageing characters William, Ned, Bob, and Bill have all tried to change their ways. William turning his back on the world. Ned the same. But Bill and Bob are different beasts.Bob tries to sugar coat his past by hiring a writer and putting on a facade, depicting his past crimes as somewhat heroic. Bill on the other hand, is trying to uphold the law, but in a despicable way. Him thinking what he is doing is right because he is doing it for the peace of Big Whiskey isn't just delusional, it's scaring the townsfolk.And it all comes to a head, and Eastwood is trying to explain that you may turn your back on the past, but it's always there, and it will eventually catch up with you.And it does, in an amazing final act, that almost comes across as a horror film, and you find it really difficult to side with anyone at the end, because Munny threatens, and you know he is serious, and at the end of the film, has anybody actually done anything positive?.The only one who is innocent to an extent is The Schofield Kid, but come the end of the film, he is scarred just like every other character, literally and mentally.Its a brilliant movie, deserved of its critical acclaim, and its awards.It's one of my favourite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven Is A Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unforgiven is a Western film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood. The film tells the story of William Munny, an aging outlaw and killer who takes on one more job years after he had hung up his guns and turned to farming. A dark Western that deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence and the myth of the Old West.The film stars Eastwood in the lead role, together with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris.A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, led by Strawberry Alice ,offers a $1,000 reward to whoever can kill Quick Mike and Davey Bunting ,two cowboys who disfigured Delilah Fitzgerald,one of their own. This upsets the local sheriff, a former gunfighter known as Little Bill Daggett,who doesn't allow guns or lowlifes in his town, and had given the two men leniency despite their crime.Miles away in Kansas, the Schofield Kid,a boastful young man, visits the pig farm of William Munny,seeking to recruit him to kill the cowboys. On his way, Munny recruits Ned Logan, another retired gunfighter who reluctantly leaves his wife to go along.Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob and his biographer, W. W. Beauchamp,arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob and Bill savagely beats him, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. The next morning, Bob is ejected from town.Three days later, they ambush a group of cowboys and kill Bunting ? though it becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. While Logan decides to return home, Munny and the Kid head to the cowboys' ranch, where the Kid ambushes Quick Mike in an outhouse and kills him. After they escape, a very distraught Kid confesses he had never killed anyone before. When Little Sue meets the two men to give them the reward, they learn that Logan was captured by Little Bill's men and tortured to death, but not before giving up the identities of his two accomplices. When he learns of his friend's death, Munny takes a swig from the Kid's bottle of whiskey; Munny, whose drinking had led him to commit deplorable acts in the past, had refused alcohol until this point. The Kid heads back to Kansas to deliver the reward money to Munny and Logan's families, while Munny heads into town to get revenge on Bill.The final scene is a bookend shot of Munny's farm, and of Munny paying a final visit to his wife's grave. The epilogue text that follows reads that Munny and his family were rumored to have moved to San Francisco and "prospered in dry goods."The movie breaks from traditional westerns wherein the characters are blurring the lines between heroism and villainy as well as man and myth. It overturns conventions, taking the man who is typically the hero and making him the villain, while transforming the traditional bad guy into a sympathetic protagonist.Aside from that,it was a compelling study of the shame and guilt that attends violence, of the rule of the mighty over the weak and of courage and cowardice which has been what Western movies are all about.In summary,the movie plays a moral balance and it deplores violence.Personally,it tries to break away and established what Western movies should have been all about.But nevertheless,the movie remains a classic entertainment.All did great in expressing the complexities of their characters that borders in between good and evil.In summary,this film is simply a winner and a masterpiece.</fullReview>

A slow-burner is a movie that starts slow but continues to let its momentum build and build before finally reaching a thrilling and satisfying climax. I think that is a very good description of what watching this movie's like.Clint turns in yet another great performance. I can't emphasize enough how good I thought this movie was. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for either a great Clint Eastwood film, a great western or just a great movie in general.

		<fullReview>Not only that but one of the best of the western genre. Unforgiven is simply brilliant. Clint Eastwood's direction is superb, and he is also exemplary in a suitably world-weary role. There is also some brilliant support playing, not only from Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, but also especially from Gene Hackman.Unforgiven is also beautifully shot. The cinematography is wonderfully dark and autumnal, and the scenery and production values are breathtaking. The story is ceaselessly compelling and while Eastwood clearly dedicated the film to the likes of Sergio Leone, he replaces brutality with a greater emphasis on character and cause and effect, and doing that Eastwood successfully redefines the genre.There is also a wonderful script that does a fine job giving credibility to the characters. All in all, this film is brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a little overrated. With all great actors in it, it could have been a lot better, but still managed do be slow and over-dramatic at times. I did like the movie though, with interesting performances by Gene Hackman, Richard Harris, Saul Rubinek and Jaimz Woolvett.In my opinion, if Hackman wasn't in this movie, it would have been a lot less interesting. Hackman captured the villainous, hot-tempered feel of Sheriff Little Bill, and he really makes you like the character, despite how evil he may be. The best kinds of villains are the ones you really like, and the ones you really hate. Little Bill belongs in the former.As I said: good, but nothing special. 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new Western that's branded a new life in a new generation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few remaining Hollywood's Rocks Of Gibraltar, Clint Eastwood, displays new vigor to his familiar old cowboy image in UNFORGIVEN. You may have seen a lot of other Westerns before, but with Eastwood's high-quality directing that enriches the feeling of the Old West, it livens up the genre to 90s standards, showcasing the injustices and brutalities that make up for its tedious flow of action. The crisp photography of the surroundings shows authentic life (better than QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER). If you want a feel-good Western that has a reliable sense of humor, discover Gene Hackman as a colorful villain of sorts who can't pronounce the word "Duke". I hate to be cruel, but the ending is mighty weak, and largely overplayed with slow pacing. Still, there are sky-high merits to brand UNFORGIVEN as a true Western classic for any generation.***There may be more guns &amp; saddle movies coming our way.....IF any new twists or breakthroughs are left to find for them. War movies, which originated back to silent days following WWI, continue to last up until now. Hopefully, our cowpokes won't be left in the dusty old barren terrain. We'll have to wait and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Unforgiven is the story of an ageing outlaw who comes out of retirement for one last job. It has a fairly straightforward plot that is laid out in a superb script that paints a more realistic picture of the 'Old west' than we're used to, without losing any of the drama inherent to a revenge western.Clint Eastwood directs and stars alongside Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman with support from Jaimz Woolvett, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek. All of them are excellent. Harris and Rubinek give what can only be described as a masterclass in the performance of a character study.The film does not set out to either glorify or condemn guns and violence, but the script and performances lead to the impression that 'Unforgiven' is a rather violent "anti-violence" piece. This is compounded by the film's debunking of many of the myths of the old west. The moral and ethical shape of the film is also more interesting, and indeed realistic, than other westerns because there are no goodies and baddies here, just several shades of grey.All of the technical aspects of the film are handled with outstanding skill. Cinematography, lighting, sound, makeup, costumes and set design are all first rate as is the score which includes a contribution from Eastwood.To sum up, 'Unforgiven' is a film that has received a great deal of critical praise and it's deserved every last bit of it. One of those films that everyone should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good Late Western about the End of the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the best Westerns were the last ones created, and the last Westerns created were quite often about the end of the West. Clint Eastwood acts and directs in such a Western where the heroic iconography of the gunslinger is put directly into question.Eastwood plays Munny, the type of infamous anti-hero the West learned to love who rowdied it up, held his own, and is responsible for the death of many tall men. Except at the point at which the story starts, he's mostly a burned out and unsuccessful pig farmer whose only memory of his own iconographic anti-heroic deeds is, "I was drunk most of the time" and, as revealed later, "always real lucky." Munny is, however, brought back into the life of high-falutin' gun-slingin' action excellence when a young, wet-behind-the-ears aspiring criminal comes along and engages Munny to partner with him to hunt down some cowboys that "cut up a woman": a particularly violent and vicious opening scene that is one of many reasons why this movie continually sticks out in people's minds.The problem, however, is that that woman is a prostitute in a town run by bad-guy sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman), who as well as being unfair to the prostitutes who demand fair treatment is also a pretty sadistic authoritarian, though he has his own charms when it comes to telling a pulp writer from the East all about the end of the era of Western heroes (reflecting once again the primary theme of the movie). Eventually Little Bill's aggression and Munny's slow spiral back into his old ways are, of course, going to result in that classic showdown at the end of the movie that the audience is waiting for (and only slightly goes against the whole theme of the movie).However, in the meantime there's some great storytelling to be done by Eastwood, who has proved time and time again to be a master director. Characters are given a lot of space to be fully fleshed out, and the acting is good on many levels, leaving for a very realized image of the community. Landscape photography shows the beauty of the West (ironic because Unforgiven wasn't even shot in the West) while dialog alludes to the trains and barbed-wire fences that will soon end it. And book-shelving intertitles help present a focus on what it is that redeems Munny, if anything at all (besides the fact that he's the hero of the story, of course).--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not much of a fan of westerns to begin with, but Unforgiven is ok. What it has going for it though, is some good acting from some performers. Most notably Gene Hackman as the ruthless sheriff, Jaimz Woolvet as the 'Schofield kid', and Richard Harris as the smug Englishman 'English Bob'.It also has some great cinematography. However, the main characters Clint and Morgan Freeman don't seem all that interesting. Clint who had to show emotion and a complex character instead of some stereotypical cowboy couldn't pull it off. I praise the writers for creating these charactes though cause they are unique. Also the movie was a bit predictable, in that hints were dropped, like Clint doesn't drink thus you know the climax will come when he hits the bottle. I remember in 92 that movies were not that great. I remember that there was so much garbage and I think the only films that I saw that I really liked during that time was Apollo 13, and Malcolm X (which are awesome by the way).Anyway..Rating 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Or going back further, would you rather watch Unforgiven or Outlaw Josey Wales? It is a good movie but no-way near his best works. To me Pale Rider and Outlaw Josey Wales were far superior and showed him at his prime.Eastwood, Freeman and even Hackman did a good job acting...but not great, characters we have seen many times before. Especially Hackman's over played 'Doyle' character. Action was good in it's short spurts...but not great, real action did not pop up until last 5 min of the film. The story was good...but not great, a bit slow at times. And the bad guys were divided between the Stuborn sheriff, Rapist and Eastwoods dark past life.I think it is sad that westerns did not get more respect in their early days (in terms of Oscars that is). I know this movie was pumped up because it finally pays homage to one of the best Big Screen heroes of all time...Clint Eastwood. Do not create fake praise for a not so great new work.If you want to praise Eastwood go buy Outlaw Josey Wales or Pale Rider.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider Eastwood as a top class actor and director. But even he had made some mistakes. Blood Work and this film are two of them.The Unforgiven is really bad directed, which is a surprise because Clint directed it himself and he has done some decent direction work. The plot was below average. Its premise was overused all over the years. The main character reluctantly takes on last job routine is really tiring, and it surprised me that Eastwood used it.As for the acting, it wasn't terrible but still felt forgettable. This is not by any means, a western classic. It is one of the most overrated western films. In the end it gave you nothing to think about. Even the friendship between Clint and Freeman was a little shallow. It had some moments though, but overall it was a bad movie.If you're into western I would recommend any other films. But the top are the last two in "The dollars trilogy", "Duck, you sucker" which is not a pure western, "Once upon a time in the west" or even "Bronco Billy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood with a gun, shooting people, and somehow justifying it. This movie did not capture my attention at all, especially with the first scene being a whore and a client. I don't approve of any form of prostitution so the fact that Eastwood' s character and his cohorts were trying to get revenge for them only sickened me more. You know why this is a classic movie? Because out of the two cohorts, it's the African American one that dies. The only parts I found funny were when the blonde prostitute got her face cut up, and when her assailant gets shot. Scenes that were supposed to be funny but made me want to roll my eyes were when the writer pees his pants, the guy that gets shot while he's in the outhouse, and when Kid cries about his first kill. This film had absolutely no point and a very strange conclusion. There was almost no part of this movie that I actually liked. The fact the Munny comes off as this laid back peaceful kind of guy, while we all know he has a bad past, makes for a very predictable movie. Why else would Eastwood play this role if he didn't get to shoot people and fake an anti-hero? My neck hurt so bad after watching this movie because I couldn't stop shaking my head at the cheesy-ness of it. One question I have is, how do people find these kinds of movies even remotely interesting? The only way I kept from cutting my wrists while watching this movie was from the knowledge that it had an ending. To give the move some credit, the use of the terrain and natural lighting did make the movie easier to watch, other than that I found the acting and plot as a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's a helluva thing - killing a man. You take away all he has ... and all he's gonna have." Say that with as if you're Cecil B. DeMille reciting from the Book of Genesis and as slowly as possible, and you'll have some idea of what "Unforgiven" feels like. It's one self-important speech after another, as Eastwood tries to atone for the sins of much better films like "Pale Rider".It all starts when a prostitute is violently beaten by a client. He had a comically small penis, and she laughed at it ... Yes, that really is what happens. It's not only implausible: it's a forced genuflection towards feminism, and just the first in a long line of forced genuflections. Anyway, the prostitutes are unable to exact legal revenge on the man, so they offer a bounty to anyone who will kill him (and his friends, who have done no wrong and who, more importantly, the prostitutes have no particular reason to even dislike). Word gets around; the country swarms with would-be-assassins; and eventually the men are killed by an aging Clint Eastwood character; except that HE kills them in a way that demonstrates the futility of violence, or some such. On the way we meet a variety of unpleasant characters who walk onto centre stage and then walk off, to pad things out.I'll be honest: I loathe Westerns as a rule, but I'm not incapable of recognising a good story that, for some reason or other, can be appropriately set in 19th-century America. This bloated movie, if it's about anything at all, is about other Westerns. "Look!" it cries. "Other Westerns glorify violence! Other Westerns are ignore the role of blacks! Other Westerns don't admit that prostitutes were mistreated!" At least other Westerns were films in their own right.</fullReview>

The movie tells the story of a former assassin named Will Munny (played by Clint Eastwood)who takes one last job with his good friend Ned Logan (played by Morgan Freeman) and a young man to assassinate people up north. There were a lot of great performances in the movie especially from Eastwood, and Freeman, but there were other good ones as well from Gene Hackman, Richard Harris, and Frances Fisher. writer David Webb Peoples has created a vengeful plot for a great western that is on a par with some of the best western movies ever made. What a great western!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wonder is that once again Mr Clint Eastwood has gotten away with a gratuitously violent movie that some viewers rank among the best westerns made. Why do we permit Squint to do these things to us: dish out extremes that belong in a 1950s comic book rather than in a serious film? We can accept that a good woman has diverted her man from drunken shoot-outs, theft and killings of women and children (though how or in what circumstances the latter occurred, audiences are not told). We conveniently overlook the fact that he leaves his young children, both sub-teens, to feed and look after themselves while he rides from Missouri to Wyoming for one last job. Can anybody seriously imagine those kids would survive by themselves, far from civilization, with no adult supervision? Or that the Eastwood character, Will Munny, and his sidekick in crime, Morgan Freeman as Ned, would not soon discern that their gang member, the Schofield Kid, had never racked up a reputation as a gunslinger? In Big Whiskey, where most of the action occurs, there is far more actual kicking of men when they are down than in any western I can recall. Co-star Gene Hackman is known to have lamented the violence after the movie was released. His character, Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff, was the principal offender. The last shot in the movie is Munny's shotgun blast at an injured man lying moaning on the darkened floor of the hotel. It is aimed straight at the groin, and elicits a shriek of pain. By now, the audience is well used to this kind of thing. How much longer can it go on?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially, I was encouraged by its blackly comic promise (Eastwood as pig farmer, near sighted gun-slinger), but The Unforgiven is eventually overwhelmed by Eastwood's unadorned narcissism (nakedly revealed by the epilogue). Not since Good Will Hunting (which sounds like a western), have I encountered such shameless self-promotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great acting does not outweigh gratuitous violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well done film about some pretty twisted characters. The setting is the old West. The characters are the gritty cowboy / settler types and the hangers on. The quality of the acting and direction are evident in the clear stereotypes portrayed. Even the minor characters like the saloon owner, the madaam and the innocent villain are portrayed with exceptional clarity.The problem I have with the movie is it is difficult to watch. Murders, beatings, cruelty, callousness - a cesspool of human dysfunction - are exquisitely crafted.If you are inspired by the art and insulated from the emotional content - go for it. If you watch films to learn something or feel better when the movie is over then forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unforgiven is Clint Eastwoods last tribute to the once great west. But whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken. Unforgiven, though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwoods worst film to date. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film.All the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially Eastwoods character. The acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. The direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. So overall Unforgiven is not Eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't see why this movie is so much appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see why "Unforgiven" was so widely appreciated by critics and public. In my opinion, this movie has great faults. The very starting point of the story appears rather unbelievable. A prostitute who makes fun of a client with an obscene joke is very unlikely. And the subsequent behavior of her colleagues (offering a bounty to avenge her etc.) is wholly preposterous: from the prehistory through the 21th century, a prostitute showing such a lack of professionalism would be kicked off by the other "girls", with no further comment. I fear that this show of feminine solidarity is just an anachronistic homage to feminists.I think it legitimate Eastwood's way of showing the Old West as the realm of squalor, depression, beastly violence, cowardice. However, I consider this representation as fake as the legends told in classic western movies, without being equally exciting and entertaining. Indeed, the movie is very boring, in spite of the brutality of many scenes. The characters make continuous use of obscene and coarse talk: this is (alas!) the habit of present days. But in the 19th century people, even the assassins, were grown-up in a different way: they all had mustaches, they all wore hats, and they rarely uttered obscenities. In fairness, I don't blame much "Unforgiven" for this: the fashion of trash talk in western movies goes back to Sergio Leone. The character of the marshal (Gene Hackman) is ludicrously bad, and the attempts to show some agreeable sides of his personality fail to be convincing. Moreover Hackman is too histrionic (as he always is, in my opinion, despite his huge celebrity). Another grating and anachronistic aspect of the movie: people wounded or in danger of life keep whining and weeping and screaming like a girl pursued by a serial killer in some cheap horror-movie. This is strongly reminiscent of the hysterical scenes of soldiers dying in Vietnam-war-movies of the 80's. But people were utterly different in the 19th century (and not only in the rough West): they were just too used to accept the idea of death, their own as well as that of others. For instance, the average parents saw four of five of their children die in their prime.Of course, "Unforgiven" has also some merits, which have been already emphasized by other comments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I just don't get Westerns...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, here goes. I didn't particularly enjoy Unforgiven. I'm not bothered or disappointed with myself though, because there are many movies which have across-the-board acclaim which leave me cold; A Beautiful Mind, Goodfellas, Moulin Rouge, The Matrix etc. I just didn't think this would be one of them. But then, maybe I just don't get Westerns...Beautifully shot: yes. Excellent star cast: yes. Impressive sound: Yes. Oscar worthy editing: yup.It's just...flat. The dialogue probably disappointed me the most, we're told from the DVD commentary, that the dialogue was researched thoroughly and is as authentic as possible. Fine. But does that make it any more inspiring? No. I found the dialogue clunky at best; "you ain't like that anymore Will", "always remember, your dear departed mother is watchin' over you", "You think I'm kicking you. Well I'm just talking to you" , "Well you sure killed the hell outta that guy."The whole film has an uneasy air of not knowing what type of Western it wants to be. Is it a tribute to the old tradition, is it a new updated Western for the nineties, is it a dramatic exercise in accurate historical depiction? Also the few moments of comedy really are flattened by the overly earnest dialogue surrounding them, rendering them pointless and awkward. Only Richard Harris seems to treat his dialogue with the derision it often deserves, but in his case it actually adds to his performance since the character is ridiculously flamboyant in the first place.It's hard for me to assess the acting because if I don't like the words the actors are saying then we're off to a bad start straight off.I know for many this will be a ridiculous comparison to make, but for a moment consider Gene Hackman's performance in Unforgiven alongside his (in my opinion) incredibly similar one in The Quick and The Dead. The Quick and the Dead is often written off as a silly popcorn Sharon Stone vehicle, but I got so much more enjoyment from that film. Compare similar scenes; addressing the town's people after violence in the main street in both films. Hackman's sadistic maniac of Unforgiven yells "What ya'll lookin at? Gawn, scoot!" while his sadistic maniac of Quick and the Dead shouts "This is my town! If you live to see the dawn, it is because I allow it." It is highly likely that Unforgiven was a major source of inspiration for the later film, but Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead has better dialogue, better performances, and is for my money generally a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best westerns, from an actor/director made famous by some, Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Clint Eastwood. Basically the normal life in the town of Big Whiskey is being threatened by relentless and vicious Sheriff 'Little Bill' Daggett (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Gene Hackman), and the whores, along with most town people, are trying to get by, but soon are desperate for some form of help after one whore is cut up. The whores put a bounty on the cowboys, i.e. will reward whoever kills them, and this attracts 'The Schofield Kid' (Jaimz Woolvett), and eventually ageing retired assassin William 'Bill' Munny (Eastwood). They also get help from Will's old friend and partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and all three ride off to kill (two for the last time, one for the first). Meanwhile, back in town Bill is still causing distress for people, including (for a while) English Bob (Richard Harris). Eventually Will's gang meet Bill, and this triggers a mini-battle, that will in time end with some deaths of key characters, in this case, first Ned, and finally Bill. Also starring Saul Rubinek as W.W. Beauchamp and Titanic's Frances Fisher as Strawberry Alice. Filled with great battle scenes, interesting chats and a great cast, this is an essential western. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, and it was nominated Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it BAFTA Film Award Best Cinematography, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Gene Hackman was number 42, Morgan Freeman number 27, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Eastwood was also number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Hackman was number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 98 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, folks, we are still looking for a great western after The Wild Bunch. To slap this one in as one of the 250 greatest movies of all time, better the other way as one of the 5 or 6 most overrated movies ever made. Others here have said it with far more detail than I, since I kept fast forwarding through at least half of it. Worse there is not a single moment in the entire film I stopped for any good. What is beyond me, or wait, I think it just hit me why it was so popular, that is above the fact that it has Eastwood in it. It is NOT a western. Actually it is more a kind of Bad Lieutenant on horseback, except not even as good as that twisted morality play. Not that I liked any of Eastwoods other westerns, all derivative to the bone, which this was not, just a lotta nada. If proof was ever necessary that amnesia has set in over the western this one is it.</fullReview>

Excessive violence is everywhere, and every character seems to share Clint's own brooding and laconic nature. The world may be a hard place but this movie is just that much harder to watch. Far from being a seminal western, this mishmash makes Heaven's Gate seem like a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second most overrated film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an attempt to create a "different" style of Western, Clint Eastwood has made a big, boring mess. His characters are ridiculous and two-dimensional, and his plot is non-existent. Other than his "hero-who-doesn't-like-to-kill", every character in the film is a cliche (even Gene Hackman's sheriff, who is one of the bad guys, is just another cliched bad guy).The worst of the cliches are the hooker with a heart of gold and the young gun who is too gung-ho. Of course he dies, prompting Eastwood's wimpy hero to go off on yet another cliche -- the rampage.Eastwood had a good idea here -- a Western that breaks through cliches. Unfortunately, all he manages to do is dress up the same cliches in different color clothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, let's get this straight. I read something about the Oscars, lamenting it's lack of truly great Best Pictures, except for movies like Unforgiven and The Godfather. ...Wait a minute. This movie is mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather? No way. I saw this movie, wondering why it won so many Oscars, and to tell you the truth, I thought it stunk. It's a decent western, but there are so many other better ones. Plus, I don't see the "intellectual" side to this movie. I thought Gene Hackman was horrible, and I thought the ending was against the grain of the whole movie. How does the end make sense, after the message the movie is trying to portray? You could have taken that scene straight out of any other western, even those without a "moral center." I think this movie is like the French Connection and is way way overrated. It's a decent movie in it's genre, but is not near Best Picture caliber. If you want a genre-defining Best Picture nominee, see Saving Private Ryan or The Godfather. But of course, this is just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who ever gave this film an Oscar is unforgivable!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie would not be half as atrocious as it was if it hadn't won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman, and Best Editing. Simply put, this movie is unforgivably bad. It had no umph behind its story, a retard behind the typewriter, and one of the least talented actors of all time manning the helm. The content of the film could've been powerfully put together as a means to expose the horrors of the true old west, as opposed to the many western before who glorified it. But the way Unforgiven is woven together leaves no room for the audience to admit the tragedy of the situations happening on screen or even be entertained and caught up in the magic of a western. Instead the audience is horrified by the tastelessness of the dialog, sexual references and violence. This film has no purpose. It's not entertaining, exciting, compelling, tragic, or even believable. I'm sure something like this did actually happen in the old west, but to tell you the truth, I believe more in the story told in the previous movie I critiqued. The cinematography (which was nominated for an Academy Award, but thankfully didn't win) was a complete atrocity! I believe I saw one good shot in the entire two hours that I suffered through this film. If you're famous and you want to make a movie, I have no problem with that. But when industry praises a film unjustly, while putting brilliant work down or at least putting it in the background, the cruelty of this world surfaces. Such brilliant work as Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men was not even allowed one win, even though it was nominated in 3 of the categories that Unforgiven won (including Gene Hackman winning against Jack Nicholson). Even worse is that Robert Redford's greatest film, A River Runs Through It, wasn't even in the running. I'm remembering back to one of my previous revues of director Clint Eastwood's Bronco Billy (another flop in my book) when I say that again this film isn't dramatic enough to work. I would have given this movie a quarter point higher in my rating if it wasn't held up as something so great, but no more sympathy from me. Clint Eastwood, you do a better job in the cheesy Spaghetti Westerns from Sergio Leone; they at least can entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood is such a BAD director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went through the terrible and horrible experience of watching this "movie". I thought "Spice World" was the worst movie ever, but Clint Eastwood now holds that title with this disgusting "movie". Easily the worst movie my girlfriend or I had ever seen. And between the two of us, we have seen some real winners. I actually enjoyed The Good the Bad and the Ugly. First, a lot of people think this is some kind of grand statement by Eastwood about America just like in The Outlaw Josey Whales. But it's not. It's a mad dash by Eastwood to show you every disgusting image he can think of. Sure it's nasty. But in a nation with G.G. Allin, Eminem, and John Wayne Gacy the shock value is gone. And disgusting for disgusting's sake doesn't make any kind of profound statement. America gives people a wide latitude to be as degenerate as they want. That doesn't make America filthy. Second, the acting is horrible. Half the lines sound like they're being read off the cue cards for the very first time. The other half sound a little better, but they all lack any kind of real inflection or feeling. And the plot... how are these people at a cross road in their life? Somewhere right now, as you're reading this, someone is plotting the torture murder of a child for sexual gratification. How is Clint Eastwood worse off than those people? He's not, and the whores are not even close. The only redeeming quality this movie had was when Daso X starts making his list of wrestling figures. I can't think of a good thing about this movie, except that I've seen it now and won't have to again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Torture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine explained Science Fiction films as torture. He wants to be grounded in reality not dreaming in the clouds. To some torture is a Foreign Language film. For me it is a Western, no other cinema is more painful. So why did I rent Unforgiven? Two reasons, one I am watching all of the Oscar Best Picture winners. Unforgiven was a noticeable hole in list of films in the past 20 years. Secondly maybe I have seen all bad Westerns and if I gave a good Western a chance I would enjoy it. Well that is a big 'no'. I had to fast forward at the half way point, the only reason I did not just turn it off was to see the credits and who have gone on to become stars in the 14 years that have past. No real break outs, Clint Eastwood continues to get accolades for acting and directing as Morgan Freeman continues to get nominated for the next ten years until Million Dollar Baby where he wins for best supporting. Saul Rubinek, a TV actor, most notably goes on to 3 years of 'Fraser' as Daphne Moon's fiancé. Richard Harris does Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series among other roles. Gene Hackman continues a successful career. Frances Fisher goes on to a supporting part in Titanic. Unforginven is the story of Big Whiskey Wyoming. A cattle hand loose it when a green prostitute lets out a little giggles at his manhood's lack of presence. He cuts up her face with a handy knife. The owner of the saloon/ bordello, Skinney Dubios (Anthony James, who quits acting to become an artist after this film) complains to the Sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) about the monetary lost he will incur because 'no one will want to sleep with a cut up whore'. Little Bill decides to fine the cattle hand and his partner (I am not sure why the partner was ever brought in to this he never touched the girl and actually tried to stop his lunatic friend) in horses to be given to Skinney. The women of the brothel are outraged at the lack of substance in the justice. They end up pulling together one thousand dollars for a reward to who ever kills both the cattle hands. This brings all sorts of undesirable characters to Big Whiskey: English Bob (Richard Harris), a gunman that feels obliged to tell everyone that the fault of the U.S. is it's lack of a monarch. Wild Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood), Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and The Scholfield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). All have a problem with Big Whiskey's ordinance of 'no fire arms in town'. Little Bill beats up every one who challenges the ordinance.</fullReview>
