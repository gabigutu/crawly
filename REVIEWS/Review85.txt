		<shortDescription>Wonderfuly done inspiring film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is beautifully shot, and really well acted, seriously the best performance of Jennifer Gardner's career she really lived it! Every one in it did a good job but especially the little girl that is the main character. And its a true story! I really don't understand how anyone could not like this film. I'm an actress and fairly critical because I see film technically as well as story wise, but this one really stands up! The story was wonderful. I loved it! I cried my eyes out, I connected with the characters and cared about their journey and it left me thinking. In the end what more do we want from a film! I really hope Jennifer Gardner gets some recognition for this role she earned it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Immersed In Film About Real Suffering and Strength</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie yesterday and I am a Christian. I think that is important to mention because there will be some people who simply don't like the movie because they don't like Christian films. So here is my honest review: When I first saw the trailer I thought this movie was going to be decent, but not great. I thought it would probably be the formulaic Christian film that most of us have seen over and over again. Most of these films have flat Christian characters put in tough circumstances that never cause them to truly struggle with their faith, which is why most people find Christian films to be unrealistic. This is not the case with Miracles from Heaven. This film has incredible performances by the entire cast, especially Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers. The film perfectly balances the story with aspects of faith. The core of this story is about a mother suffering with her daughter's pain and health. What I was not expecting was to feel as though I was a part of this story. The film immersed me in what it would be like to be going through this struggle. This movie will make you cry in the sad moments and in the happy moments because you will feel as though this is your family. That is why this film transcends other Christian films. The moments where God is mentioned don't feel as though they are forced and preachy. Those moments are carefully woven and important to the family's journey through a terrible illness. It surpassed my expectations. That's why I recommend going to see it. "Miracles are God's way of showing us that He's here." - Miracles from Heaven</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those rare Christian movies that's worth the time to watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A faith-based Christian drama flick, adapted from the memoir (of the same name) by Christy Beam. Beam tells the story of her 10-year-old daughter; who suffered from an incurable disease, and then was suddenly cured from it (after having a near-death experience). The movie deals with Christy's struggles with her faith, while coping with her daughter's tragic illness. Jennifer Garner stars in the film, as Christy Beam, and it costars Kylie Rogers, Martin Henderson, Eugenio Derbez and Queen Latifah. It was directed by Patricia Riggen (who also helmed 'THE 33', last year), and it was scripted by Randy Brown (who also wrote 2012's 'TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE'). The movie only received mixed reviews from critics, but it did surprisingly well at the Box Office (where viewers raved about it). I enjoyed it as well.The story takes place in Burleson, Texas (in 2011). Christy Beam (Garner), and her husband Kevin (Henderson), are devastated to learn that one of their daughters, 10-year-old Anna (Rogers), suffers from pseudo-obstruction motility disorder. The disease makes it so Anna is unable to consume food, without tubes. It's also deadly, and incurable. Christy doesn't understand how this could have happened, to her Christian family (that always goes to church regularly). She struggles to keep her faith, and then is amazed to learn of her daughter's miraculous recovery (possibly because of it).I was raised strictly Catholic, and I always attended church regularly (as a child), so I'm always interested in any movies that deal with religion. I'm not usually that impressed, with the average 'overly preachy' ones (that mostly just 'preach to the choir'), but this one is really well made. Garner's performance is amazing, and Riggen's direction is equally as impressive. The movie seems a little clichéd, and gimmicky, but for the most part it's pretty emotional (I cried multiple times). It's also kind of inspiring. The film is actually one of those rare Christian movies that's worth the time to watch!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very stirring and emotionally moving. It really captures the emotions and the crisis of faith that must be the experience of those who must watch their children suffer in any way.The directing is very good and the cinematography is well done. When I started watching the movie I expected the characters to be somewhat plastic. To my delight, this was not the case. The characters seemed real, human, and relatable.However, it is the performance of Jennifer Garner as Christy Beam (the Mom) and Kylie Rogers as Anna Beam (the daughter) that put it over the top. I very much recommend this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall A Good Film, With A Few Downsides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miracles From Heaven is directed by Patricia Riggen and stars Jennifer Garner as the mother of a sick child named Anna, played by Kylie Rogers. The child is diagnosed with a rare disease that doesn't allow her body to digest food. Stay away from the trailers for this movie if you plan on seeing it; they spoil the entire film. That's all I'm going to say, because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.I was somewhat excited about seeing Miracles From Heaven, but I was expecting the movie to be as the trailers said it would be, and it was a completely different movie, despite it still being pretty good. The marketing team for this movie should really be fired, because the advertisement for Miracles From Heaven was marketing a separate movie. The film does have some flaws, but it was good overall.My favorite thing about Miracles From Heaven was the performances given by the actors that play the little girl's parents, that being Jennifer Garner as the mother and Martin Henderson as the father. These two did pretty great together, and made a very believable married couple that are struggling with their ability to cope with the sickness that their daughter has. Although I wish the film went a bit deeper into their conflicted relationship based on stress and disagreements, both actors did very well, and deserve some recognition by receiving future roles.Having said that about the two parents, and the actors that played them, not many other characters, or actors, stand out. Most of the other actors do fine, and don't really have anything special to do with their screen time, while also not exactly doing bad. Queen Latifah was marketed as playing a big character in this film (her name is on the poster), yet her character was given a good amount of depth, and then forgot about by the script. Her character just disappears from the film entirely, and it was pretty disappointing, to be honest.Kylie Rogers, who plays Anna, the sick little girl, does pretty good. Her performance isn't very distinctive, but she does okay for a little girl. Both of her sisters seem like wasted characters overall. I really wish the film would've dived into the difficulties that the sisters were dealing with, as in having a very sick sister, but it didn't. The sisters, played by Brighton Sharbino and Courtney Fansler, were partially wasted as characters that could've been interesting.The direction was pretty good. No shots really stood out as good or bad, and the overall camera work did what it should've done, it just wasn't as interesting as it could've been. The script was pretty nice, with some very good dialogue at points, and some pretty bland dialogue at others. There were a couple different subplots that really should've been either cut out, or given more attention to, that were kind of stuck in between the two, and those elements are what dragged the story down.The absolute worst thing about Miracles From Heaven is the pacing, particularly with the time jumps. There are more than enough time jumps, yet the film fails to explain how much time has passed. Coming out of the theater, I didn't know whether or not the film's setting lasted 6 months or 6 years. These time jumps really pulled the movie down by an entire letter grade (or so), and was pretty underwhelming.Other than the few complaints I mentioned, I liked just about everything about Miracles From Heaven. It didn't get too preachy, and was constructed as a film pretty well. I'd recommend Miracles From Heaven to anyone who can handle watching something somewhat sad, because there are a couple sentimental moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain movies that are catnip for the American Bible Belt: faith-centered family dramas based on "actual events" that have a thick undercurrent of patriotism (Dolphin Tale, The Blind Side, Simon Birch, Soul Surfer). Miracles from Heaven, an ABC Family movie-of-the-week masquerading as cinema, is the latest in that trend. And while it may be one of the better films aiming for the Christian-demographic, that's like calling a tune the happiest Nickelback song. It's a (mostly) harmlessly bad outing whose most egregious sin is its incessant pandering. This true story is every parent's nightmare: a little girl inexplicably contracts an incurable disorder, and the faith of her family is understandably tested. Rogers, as the sick girl, is actually really good and provides some of the only gravitas in a movie otherwise filled with feather-weight ideas on faith and Christianity. Garner, as the mother, continues to prove she should stick to lighter fare, as her dramatic chops are just plain not there. Even with the shameful yet effective manipulation, her inability to get beyond soap-opera melodrama too often distracts from the tragedy. Not that this is purely a downer of a movie, in either quality or content. Despite knowing (just from the title alone) that something good will change this family's circumstances, director Riggan does a decent enough job of keeping us in the family's mindset, especially during the climactic tree sequence. It even makes up for some of its indulgent tendencies with a message about looking for the little miracles we all experience. Unfortunately, it's all readily shaded by blatant manipulation and unbelievable stupidity in the minor characters, sins that are hard to forgive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why not cut the tree in half?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very much sure cutting the tree in half to save the girl would have taken less than half an hour.Maybe it wouldn't be dramatic enough for Hollywood. The kids acting was okay, the adults, not so much. The cut scenes during the testimony at the church doesn't have any connections to miracles. These movies are just doing the opposite of what it should be doing to Christians. If everything is a miracle, why oversell specific ones. clearly millions of children are suffering against all odds. And 'God' decides to help one out of the many and we call it a miracle. Please make reasonable Christian movies, at least it will leave some 'unbelievers' scratching the back of their heads.Just saying.............Do whatever you want as far as it doesn't affect anyone or anything negatively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Miracles From Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a tearjerker, then you're in the right place. I caution people to not wear makeup when watching this movie because you will be crying by the end. The story is about a Christian family from Texas, whose second daughter becomes seriously ill with an incurable disease. The situation puts a lot of financial stress on the parents because they have to see a specialist out of Boston every month. The journey is about the mother, played by Jennifer Garner, and how she does whatever she can to make sure her daughter gets the best treatment possible. The movie is based on the real- life story of the Beam family and what happened with the middle daughter Anna, played by Kylie Rogers. While there are some religious and spiritual elements of the movie, and it plays an important role, it never comes off as preachy or pushy. It just works with how the story is told. The idea of having faith is an important theme of the characters in the movie. The mother struggles with her faith and questions her belief in God. While Anna, tries to stay positive and even has a conversation with another sick girl, to try and cheer her up. Eventually, Anna wants to give up on living until an accident happens that changes her life. Hence the title of the movie.One of the things that sell the emotion of the movie is the tremendous acting by both Garner and Rogers. They really sell a real connection between a mother and daughter. Rogers is such a delightful little girl that warms your heart when she's happy and saddens it when she's in pain. Garner does an amazing job with the real tears and heartfelt speeches about her daughter. The entire cast is great in this movie. Queen Latifah comes in (for a few scenes) not only to provide some comedy but to bring some hope to the girls when they feel a bit defeated. Even if you are not a fan of faith-based movies, you will still enjoy this film because the focus is on the mother and daughter and the family struggles. If you're looking for a good cry, watch it. If you aren't looking to cry, watch it! This is an amazing movie and sheds great light on people who do have sick children and everything they have to go through. It's a heartbreaking story that ends with a very uplifting message. The idea being that miracles are everywhere, even if it's just someone helping you out in a tough situation. It's the little things in life that make the big things possible. Watch the movie, and get inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Uplifting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter and I found this movie very uplifting. We were not looking for an Oscar worthy film but a movie that is positive and with a big heart. This is much more than a faith based movie but a very basic to goodness movie that we don't showcase anymore in films and we found this very appealing. For me, this is a movie that turned my daughter around as she is struggling with faith and life issues at the moment. That is a miracle by itself.This is a small movie that we enjoyed and it touched our hearts and the acting of Garner and Kylie are commendable. All the actors in this movie are very convincing. The movie was just not all centered in faith but also about how the community, strangers and family rally behind the Beams. There is also the basic kindness that strangers offer without hesitation in our everyday lives are shown here and those are very comforting and should not be overlooked. This movie is not preachy but it is really about an ordinary day to day struggles of each and everyone of us. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TV movie of the week</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie would be cinema worthy, but it's no better than your average TV movie of the week. I was hoping for more. Bad acting all around. Jennifer Garner's facial expressions were distracting, her huge lips and gaunt face bothered me throughout. I think she'd be better suited for TV at this point. There is something missing in her acting and she doesn't seem to be able to carry on with a lead role. Very disappointing. The story line is interesting, but the way this family is portrayed is unbelievably unrealistic, where everyone is perfect, everything is in place throughout the ordeal, everyone gets along like they're on an old episode of Eight is Enough, etc. I believe this film went straight to video, and if not, it should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drag of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen some good Christian movies before (such as fireproof or the encounter) and reading the reviews here on IMDb made me consider watching this one too, but I was misled. I say this with all due respect to the real person behind this story, but this movie is not a good movie. There is too little plot here. You could easily cut the first one and a half hours of the movie down to 10 or 20 minutes. The acting is very mediocre at best, except for the little girls and maybe Queen Latifah. Jennifer Garner has but one facial expression throughout the whole movie and her male counterpart I found rather boring. To be fair, the plot doesn't give Jennifer Garner much to act upon (her child is sick, her child is sick, her child is sick... wait there is hope... no... her child is sick, her child is sick... ). I guess if you are a mother or dad, you might be shaken to tears, because you might feel for the length of a whole movie what it would be like to loose your child. But for me, not having any kids, this movie didn't do that for me.On the upside and why I'd still give this movie 4 stars: The last part of the movie made me think about life and miracles and what it all means to me. And it moved me somehow."There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle." (quote from Albert Einstein; in the movie)This movie made me think of the core message here, which is to me: the true miracle of life is love. It is around us even when we don't see or feel it. People being there for each other, helping each other, not giving up on each other, and forgiving each other when no one expects it. That's not something ordinary. That's something miraculous. Because then things may happen which you never thought possible. Still "Miracles from Heaven" fails at most things which make a good movie. I give it 4 stars for the core message, for making me think, for the girls' acting and for telling a "true" story. The rest is not worth seeing in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Story Wrecked by Need to Explain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know something is fishy when a movie has 27% 10/10 ratings inflating its score tremendously. Here is where "Miracles from Heaven"'s rating is skewed out,and shame on myself for not catching it - I didn't do my due diligence. Luckily, it was a discounted Red-Box rent, and at $0.27 maybe a fair price. The title didn't clue me as it should have as I saw Jennifer Garner headlining, but I really need to do a better job of screening more closely. Fast-forwarding got employed quite a bit on cheery,sappy music montages. The story intrinsically has an interesting core, but the religious need to explain the unexplained saps that interest right out to the point of folly. It may be true that the family themselves are religious, which makes the movie more accurate, but it doesn't matter - the movie is kool-aid for the kool-aid drinkers. By the end of the movie all that matters from the director perspective are that the family are good Christians again with faith stronger than ever. Heck, a Pagan even joins the bus by the very end without his daughter also unexplained, but he's in Church (finally). Had the creators toned down the blaring "faith" horn by a large degree, it might've worked. 4/10 - not recommended for Pagans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A church without Christ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not what I had expected. The story was interesting and kept my attention. The acting was excellent, and I don't understand why some would think that Garner was melodramatic. Everyone in the movie did a believable job of acting. Where I had a problem is that the suffering was overextended to the point that it was difficult to watch. The church was really useless and at no point did I see anyone in that church offer to come over and pray for the sick child. What kind of miracle do you want if you don't even mention the need for a miracle? Actually, the sick child was the one who exhibited more faith than anyone. She was at least clinging to God. Speaking of God, why was the name of Jesus never mentioned in the film? If it's a church, why not give credit for the miracle to Jesus? What's the problem of giving Him some praise and credit? Plus, the doctor seems to indicate that somehow her neurological system was "reset" due to the fall. Really? There is no cure for the child's disease. Heaven was shown so briefly that had you turned your head to sneeze, you probably would have missed most of heaven with the beautiful flowers and butterflies. Heaven is real, Jesus is real, healing happens and miracles happen. Yes, there are many who suffer and die, but miracles do happen. We still are required to pray and intercede for those who need prayer. I never saw any genuine prayer for healing. Sorry, if we are going to make movies where people are part of a church, let's at least not be so politically correct that we can't mention the name of Jesus Christ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Focusing On Motherhood And A Child's Struggling With A Fatal Disease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Garner stars in this film entitled Miracles From Heaven that was based on the memoirs of Christy Beam that tells the story of how her daughter Annabel got miraculously cured from a fatal stomach disease when she accidentally fell head first thirty feet from a tree.Director Patricia Riggen gives us both an interesting and entertaining story that would probably touch many people especially mothers whether they maybe classified either as religious,non-religious,non-Christians,antagonistic non-God believers alike.The screenplay by Randy Brown starts the movie with focus on the Beam family - Christy and husband Kevin together with Annabel and sisters Adelynn and Abbie - living a well-to-do life at Texas and exhibiting characteristics of a great Christian family.Later,we get to see Annabel become gravely ill which was later discovered as pseudo-obstruction motility disorder.We witness Christy's ordeal as a mother as well as the pains and sufferings that Annabel has to go through from her disease being unable to be discovered by Texan doctors until she gets taken under care of Dr. Samuel Nurko of Boston Children's Hospital.Then the miracle takes place when Annabel and Abbie climbs thirty feet high in a tree in the backyard with the former meeting an accident by falling head first and later being discovered to be free of broken bones and scratches as well as her motility disorder.Just like what I have stated in the first paragraph,the film was definitely touching film regardless of how one identifies his/her belief towards God or Christianity.Garner did a wonderful job of portraying the mother Christy as the viewer will definitely cheer for her character as she goes through many struggles in helping her Annabel go through them and finding the best cure for her. Added to that,we also get to feel happy for her in the end after her daughter's miraculous healing. Although I must say that there were some parts of the film that was preachy about faith in God and Jesus as well as melodramatic moments with the amount of tears that Garner had to shed,I felt that they were done in good taste and were less manipulative unlike a typical Christian film or a Hallmark TV movie. Riggen did a good job of highlighting the issue of motherhood as well as the child's fearful experiences having a fatal disease.Finally,it tells us to never lose hope and always remain optimistic no matter what situation one is dealing with in life as "miracles are everywhere" and goodness is everywhere in life.Truly,an inspiring movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little trepid due to the religious undertones of this movie ... but ... I loved it! The casting is excellent, and just because Queen Latifah isn't doing a SNL impression doesn't mean she didn't do a good job in a character role. It's called acting.The actress who played Anna was fantastic too, in fact the whole family was. BUT the stand out star by far was Jennifer Garner. To those critics who condemn her to Alias / Daredevil and other such ilks I say "not any more". Since Dallas Buyers Club she has shown she can adapt and is not only a fantastic character actor but that she is capable of leading a movie.Garner has both warmth and strength, two characteristics I'm sure the real life mother had too. You can't help but buy in to this family and this story and I'm really glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Struck Home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll state right off that I'm a pastor. So I certainly have a bias in favour of faith, God and miracles. I've seen miracles happen - people who recover from illnesses after being told that there's no hope, with doctors who can't really explain why. And in all honestly, the vast majority of the time there is no miracle. People die of diseases after being told they have no hope. And as Christy Beam (played by Jennifer Garner) said as this movie came to a close - I don't really know why one person gets a miracle and so many others don't. I just know that they happen. I'm grateful for them. They do reveal to me that there's more to life than what we can see or touch. There's a dimension beyond anything we can fully understand, and whose workings are a mystery to us. So, in a sense, there's my disclaimer; a clear statement of my bias. And having said that, the strange thing is that I don't usually like these faith- based Christian movies. They're generally too formulaic, with the people of faith trying to convince the people without faith to have faith, and there's always some obnoxious atheist character who has to be convinced. But this movie went beyond the formula. Maybe that's why I liked it.The main characters in this true story are Annabel and Christy Beam. Mom and daughter. When just a little girl, Annabel was diagnosed with a terrible disease that caused her great pain, made her unable to eat, and basically left her slowly dying while she suffered. Annabel was played by a young actress named Kylie Rogers, who was superb. She portrayed Annabel in pain so believably, and yet she also captured a little girl's innocence in the midst of it all. I was extremely impressed. Garner as Christy was also very good. I liked Christy. Bursting out of the normal formula, Christy doesn't just believe that a miracle's coming. She questions faith. She questions God. She gets angry. She gives up on belief. She was real; a genuine person dealing with a horrible situation as best she could and as most people would. Garner has been credited with a great performance. I agree with that assessment - although, frankly, I thought Kylie Rogers was the highlight of the movie.What to make of the miracle? I honestly don't know. Kylie fell down the centre of a hollowed out old tree and landed head first. When she woke up, she was fine. Not only uninjured from the fall, but with her disease gone. While she was unconscious after the fall she says she had some sort of vision - visiting "heaven" and being told by God that she'd be fine. And she was. The specialist she was seeing in Boston said that it was possible that the fall essentially re-booted her central nervous system and got her digestive system working again. Could be. That could also be a miracle in itself. As far as her claims to have spoken with God are concerned? Might have been real; might have been a dream or hallucination. Only Annabel knows. All that really matters is that a little girl who wasn't supposed to get better got better.Researching the story, I found that for the most part the details of the movie are accurate. A few things have been added for dramatic purposes, and perhaps to acclimate the viewer to the possibility of miracles. For example, Christy and Annabel did in fact have an appointment with Dr. Nurko in Boston. They didn't just show up unannounced. But it all still comes down to this - a little girl who wasn't supposed to get better got better. Who can argue with that. How you believe it happened is a matter of faith.This is a decent movie. It drew me into the story and touched a chord with me. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an interesting movie. I enjoy watching films that defy the explanation of medical science. There are those that believe science can solve everything and science can explain anything when neither are true. We've come a long way with medical science, for instance when I had my appendectomy 35 years ago the procedure was very different from the one my buddy went through just a few weeks ago. There are things that can be cured now that couldn't be cured years ago. There are procedures that were very risky years ago that are now a lot safer. I'm thankful for all of the advancements in science. However, we still have a long way to go. And it's always exciting when God intervenes and heals people beyond a medical explanation. This is a movie about such an event.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young girl suffering from a rare digestive disorder finds herself miraculously cured after surviving a terrible accident. If you're an atheist of course you will hate this film and think that it's a dumb fairy tail but it's not it's a very sad and touching film with an amazing performance by Jennifer Garner and the young girl Kylie Rogers. I love how they also mix humor into the film as well because if it was all about drama then the film would have turned in another Southpaw i wish more people could believe in miracles we believe in people dressed as a Bat and a Spider but not this? Is not my god is everyone's god and you know what? we don't see him because he wants it to be like that way he wants us to save ourselves. Miracles from Heaven is an amazing sad true story that really strike me right in the feels and Jennifer Garner is such an amazing actress. Bravo!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Positive Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a very religious person but I must confess I did enjoy "Miracles From Heaven", a film based on true events. Even though the movie's title is its own major spoiler, it doesn't distract you from enjoying this good-feel family movie. The movie deals with the Beam family, specially their daughter Anna, who begins to suffer from a strange illness that prevents her from fully digesting food and nutrients and endangers her life in the short run. Her pain is unbearable and her mother (excellently played by Jennifer Garner) becomes desperate to find a doctor that can put an end to her daughter's illness. Although Anna's illness is not cancer, it is just as life threatening as it slowly turns the perky 10 year old girl into a depressive pre-teenager who sees death as her only way to end her sufferingChristy Beam (Anna's mom) finally find a doctor that could be their ray of hope: Dr Samuel "Nurko" Nurkobel, a gastroenterologist specialized in pediatrics who has his practice at Boston's Children's Hospital. Sadly, there is no cure for Anna's condition and she can only have medication and special care to make her existence more "bearable". I'll wonder off a bit from the story to mention how archaic I find certain medical practices in the U.S. Cisapride (it helps regulate "motilty" or the way intestines make food "move along" its tract), which was one of the few drugs Dr.Nurko could prescribe to Anna, is a medicine that has been withdrawn off the market in the U.S., yet it is widely available elsewhere (Mexico, Latin America). It's so common elsewhere that you don't even need a prescription to buy it, yet god knows how much did Christy Beam had to pay for it to help her daughter. I'm surprised that, coming from a 1st world country like the U.S. such a drug is only reserved for veterinarian use! Not even Cisapride could tone down Anna's problem, so Dr.Nurko was basically useless in helping Anna from her strange disease. Christy Beam, who is a devout Christian just like the rest of her family, becomes angry and starts to drift away from God, her church and faith itself, yet Anna never seems to lose it, even at her most painful moments. It would have to take a bizarre freak accident to turn things around positively, in a way science still cannot explain. We are lead to believe that yes, faith does indeed work in strange ways."Miracles From Heaven" is well written, well paced, well directed. It doesn't break any new ground; it's the type of Sunday morning fare that airs on TV for family viewing, but it eventually cheers you up in the end. It's a feel good movie with a positive message for whoever wants to take it. Me and my family thoroughly enjoyed it!</fullReview>

It was even better than the book because the characters just came to life. And "yes" the movie will make you cry, and cry. My husband didn't want to see this movie, at first, but decided to watch it with us as a family. Well, with tears in his eyes he said "it was one of the best movies I have ever seen". We could relate. Our child is a girl and is 10 years old. She has suffered with one aliment after another. To see a child suffer is so wrong, yet this movie gives us all hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best film I have seen in a very long time. Both Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers made me feel the excruciating pain emotionally and physically that each of these people went through. I feel the Director Patricia Riggen drew out the very best in these two extremely talented actresses who gave such exceptional performances. It did not go unnoticed that the photography was also top shelf being done by Patricia Riggen's husband Checco Varesa. These two make exceptional movies together. Also an excellent pick to play the Boston Children's Hospital Doctor was Eugenio Derbez and Queen Latifah as the Angel/Angela was wonderful. Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers should both get Oscars for their performances but that will never happen in Hollywood since we are waiting and waiting for them "To get there". I do feel bad about so many negative comments by the atheists with so much hatred in their hearts. I am sure they never saw the movie Bambi who had some sage advice from that philosopher Thumper who quoted "If you can't see anything nice ? don't say anything at all". Thank you T. D. Jakes for producing this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is about something that can happen to anyone, a child in a family of 5 got sick and mother do all her best to help. faith is another critical factor, of course</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>just think about how this movie can help those who are in the same situations. like the pastor said you can choose to just stick to it or walk away, give up, but having a faith is better in seem-like- hopeless circumstances.I enjoyed all the usual, everyday stuff in the movie which can touch me just because it happens to me the same way when my loved ones get ill. no matter how broken our life is, we do have some people, or maybe just one, whoever she,he is to you, to give all the care that you just feel and don't try to give. just few things to share. there must be someone who you really care about and it hurts you when bad things happen to them. I personally don't think children should grow up without knowing what is faith and God while they are free to make a choice so this movie might be worth considering for family entertainment. hope you all good health and luck</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religion promotion movie, that makes me just mad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes it made me mad! Even if of course you want the girl to heal, there are some factors, that makes this a total waste of time.This looks like a promotion picture, not for a President candidate, but for religion. I have nothing against religion, when people just try to do good. For me if there is a God, spirit or an unknown force, we have no ability to full understand this.This movie is shallow, because of religious motives. You not see people sweat suffering. You not see living hell on earth in this situation. Everything is clean. The lightening is perfect, not realistic. The people are not of this world. Everything is clean and shining. Well having a sick child in these conditions is not "clean".Having a sick child is going through hell. It are dramas not enough developed here. All around the world, children are sick, parents go through hell, can't pay the bills, and often a child dies in much worse conditions, then the clean environment of this movie.That the girl got better after falling, can be explained other then a miracle of religion. The fall could have said her intestines just where they should have been. The fall has altered her condition, but has that has anything to do with God?How can you state that being so religious, is why she survived? When so many children are dying of cancer and other diseases every day? Why would God choose her to live, and not another poor sick kid? The movie makes you believe, the girl survives because she believes in God. So other children, who would be non believers deserve to die? That is just what we not like about Islam, to think some people are better then others, just because of any religion. I believe in people who want to do good, and not because they are part of a religion. I think of all these children, innocent, who were not raised for believing in a God, but have to suffer, just as children, who parents do believe in some religion and are NOT saved.I hope the family is doing alright, but that they keep</fullReview>

The film has a few powerful messages whether one has any kind of faith or not. I would encourage everyone young and old to take the opportunity to see it as it is a must see. Refreshing to see a movie that holds one's attention without violence, bad language and negative outcomes. On the contrary, this was a message of hope and a wonderful story of a family and their struggles with illness, money and their faith. The acting was AMAZING from every character.

		<fullReview>I was not the intended audience for this movie, I went to see it because I like Jennifer Garner, I enjoy John Carrol Lynch's work and I am a huge Walking Dead fan and this movie had John Carrol Lynch and Brighton Sharbino in it along with Madison Lintz's mother, but I did find this was good entertainment.The movie showed you had to do more then just trust in God for things to be OK, Jennifer Garner demands more test be run in the ER when her daughter goes in in a lot of pain and the ER doctor says it is just severe acid reflux, and then when she isn't getting in to see the specialist she flies to Boston to try to get her in, and does.It is a well, if unevenly acted movie and does a nice job at the end showing how little acts of kindness can turn out to be a miracle to someone else. It could have edited the story down somewhat and told its story better, the part when Anna talks about going to heaven after she falls down a tree I don't think was needed, wouldn't it still be a miracle if a girl with an incurable disease falls three stories down the inside of a tree, doesn't get hurt while her incurable disease is cured, without her going to heaven and talking to God? The bottom like is that if you think you will like this movie, you probably will, and if you think you won't you probably won't, but the movie is an enjoyable feel good story with some nice funny moments and some nice touching family moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Miracles From Heaven", Jennifer Garner-Valentine's Day, Dude,Where's My Car?; Martin Henderson-Everest, The Ring; Queen Latifah- Valentine's Day, What Happens in Vegas and Kylie Rogers-The Whispers_tv, Space Station 76.This movie is based on a true story, from a book written by Christy Beam, who is the mother in the story, portrayed in the movie by Jennifer. The story took place in Burleson, Texas. One of Jennifer's 3 daughters, 10 year old Kylie, gets deathly sick-a parents nightmare-and is taken to doctor after doctor, with no conclusive answer as to why she is sick. Martin plays Jennifer's husband. Finally, a doctor in Boston tells them that Kylie has a rare, incurable intestinal disorder that is a death wish-I did mention it was incurable, didn't I? Queen is a local Bostonian waitress that befriends Jennifer &amp; Kylie when they are in Boston getting treatments. After going back to Texas, Kylie has an accident that should have hurt her pretty bad, but instead, it cures her-I am not giving too much away here because you see this in the trailers. The acting is good, the story is good, and most importantly, the preachy attitude is minimal. There is a nice message at the end about how miracles can be found almost everywhere, if you take the time to look for them. They also show the real Beam family, just as the end credits start. It's rated "PG" for thematic material, accident &amp; medical issues and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 49 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miracles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the day I watched the trailer, I have wanted to watch this movie. It was exactly as I expected it. It reminded me of another movie, "The fireproof," or maybe even "The Vow" The performance of Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers was exceptional. You cry, and you can feel all of their struggles with Kylie's illness and her mom Jennifer's sadness, fighting to help her daughter overcome her illness. In general, it is a very sad movie, with a note of hope given by Queen Latifah. She balanced the movie with some funny scenes and her wonderful, positive personality. I love the music and the artistic development of some of the scenes, like the representation of Heaven, when Kylie described to her parents, after her miraculous recovery, that she was told that everything will be alright. I also liked the closing scene with the song, "Here come the Sun" and the sunflowers. Their visit to the Boston's aquarium was anther good scene. I loved the views of Boston as a city, as well as the country side of Texas. It truly made me cry the scene of Kylie in front of a Monet at the Boston Museum. The movie has some good dialogues. It is a movie about hope, faith, and the value of family. But also the movie have a negative side background, something that make your doubt about your faith. The movie kind of put as a miracle the medical attention that Kylie received at the Boston's hospital. Seem like no anyone can go and receive that exceptional medical attention. I could say more, but in general, it is a good movie to watch with our family and teach them the importance of faith. Miracles happen every day.As Einstein told: "There are only two ways to live your life. One as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only complaint I have about this movie was it did not give you time to "relax" and "recover" from the intense scenes. First I must say that if you have children, you will likely connect more to the movie than someone who is "on the outside, looking in." Second, I am not a frequent movie goer, so I do not have much to add concerning the acting, cinematography, and story line. However, I think the main character should get an academy award. And the rest of the actors were pretty good too. I just saw the movie tonight, so I do not know how long I will contemplate the ideas put forth in this movie. But I think it is a movie I will want to see many more times and will get something different out of it every time. This movie reminds me of another similar movie that I have seen many times called The Ultimate Gift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Miracles from Heaven (Spoiler free) ***1/2 (3.5/5)Cast: Jennifer Garner, Kylie Rogers, Martin Henderson, Brighton Sharbino, Queen Latifa.Plot: A young girl suffering from a rare digestive disorder finds herself miraculously cured after surviving a terrible accident.Films about miracles are very rare to find and sometimes they are not very good however this film is good, sometimes unbearable to this heartwarming drama will make you laugh, cry or even smile with joy. Garner plays Christy Beam just a humble woman living a normal life until the strangest thing happens, when her middle daughter Anna (Rogers) gets a mysterious illness and no amount of medicine can do anything about it.Believe it or not but this is based on true story and is also a book adaptation written by the real Christy Beam, and the film directed by Patricia Riggen. Personally I've never read the book but I did watch this and it is a truly overwhelming story and also the best performance by Garner in a while.Here are some points as to why I think this is drama not to be missed:Story: The story is probably same as it is in the book but I thought was really well written and produced in the film, and I just literally fell in love with it. The story mostly takes place in Texas, it is also when the core performances happen mainly from Garner (Christy) and Rogers (Anna). The story is tear jerking and an absolute joy to behold. I wouldn't normally say this because I am an Atheist but I think this is the story about God-given Miracles I have ever seen.Performances: The performances are incredible in this movie it is Garner at her best just playing normal woman, and worried one at that because she tries to everything for her daughter. The performance from Kylie Rogers who plays Annabelle Beam is just a one in a million performance and is just amazing. Basically Rogers and Garner just steal the show from the other actors. Even Kevin (Henderson) doesn't get much of a say and he plays worried father also trying to help his daughter, his performance is well it could have been better.As I have already said this a very lovable about a family just trying to get by in life even when one of their own is ill. The reason for my initial mark is: Not enough character development: Not a big issue but for a film like this the character development is essential. In the beginning all you know is their names but the real development you just have to guess at because it doesn't how their daughter got ill, all we know is that it is mysterious. Not enough character development.Garner and Rogers are brilliant in this tear jerking drama that will hopefully never be forgotten.Verdict: Overwhelming, if sometimes unbearable to watch this indie film will make you cry even make you laugh. It is just a lovable story about family and love.7/10 recommended watch even if you an Atheist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even the Miracles are bigger in Texas . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . Sony Pictures Corp. informs us with its latest effort to apprise their share-holding owners in Japan of America's Religious Beliefs. The world certainly remembers that earlier Medical Miracle from the Lone Star State, in which an unknown bike rider contracted testicular cancer and nearly died. Yet this American Hero (named Lance Armstrong) was provided with a Miraculous Cure from Heaven and went on to win the world's premier endurance event, The Tour of France bike jaunt, 7 TIMES IN A ROW, something that has never been done before or since. Similarly, MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN (based upon a True Story as debuted on Fox "News") recounts a more recent Act of God, in which 10-year-old Anna Beam fell 30-feet down inside a Heavenly Hollow Cottonwood Tree and suffered a Spontaneous Remission of her genetic Intestinal Pseudoobstruction Disorder. (Kudos to actress Jennifer Garner, for managing to look so grievously pained throughout MIRACLES as Mom Christy Beam that viewers just KNOW that young Anna Beam must be a chip off her genetic block!) Sony's rendition of Anna's Butterfly Heaven featuring Monet's Lilypads is particularly well done. Sony is letting the World know that one needn't go back to the 1800s and stories of golden scrolls deciphered inside Magic Top Hats, or even the 1900s and tales of UFO landing spots to deify the RISKY BUSINESS dancing queen to access America's current Religious Superiority! Also, it's crucial not to overlook the Financial Miracle resulting from Anna's Trip to Heaven, because without it there could NOT have been a book OR a movie, and the Beam family would have been financially ruined due to the cost of Anna's illness. But, as it must say somewhere in the Holy Bible, "Another day, another dollar!"</fullReview>

No words can even remotely describe how heartwarming, emotional (and to some, rather intense) a tale this movie leaves it's viewers. It's not very often I choose to see one that is this way. You'll need a warm heart and more than one box of tissues just the see amount of pain this girl goes through all to lead through a parable-like ending (where even that gets a box of tissues all to it's very own.) Though kids may get some things out of it, they might not pick up some on some of the inside topics this movie deals with that brings most of it's viewers - the adults - to this movie. It seems like the director did the research - maybe even read the book - but seemed like he wanted to focus more on the medical side of the main characters conditions (and not so much on what brings this movie together at the end), whereas opposed to the reverse which the book focuses on.</fullReview>

So she goes to an expert in Boston to try to find out what's wrong with her. But it's what happens when they come home and this girl then gets into an accident that the title is earned...I'll stop there and just say this was quite touching especially when something is revealed at the end involving a reporter who met both the mom and daughter earlier.

There is no end to how blind they are and will do everything they can to trash a beautifully made movie. The acting is phenomenal by Jennifer Garner as well as the girl who plays Anna. The support characters are just so-so. It reveals the crisis in faith that many people go through when they wonder why would a good God allow something seemingly bad to happen to a good person. It also reveals that some so-called Christians are not very helpful to people who are going through such ordeals. Awesome to see that it is based on a true story, understandably dramatized.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/234124-miracles-from-heaven</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Miracles from Heaven" tells a great story, but sends mixed messages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love words. More specifically, I love finding just the right word or combination of words to effectively communicate a very precise thought or even a complex idea. Of course, for words to function as I just described, they each have to carry a consistent meaning ? whenever someone speaks or writes the word and whenever anyone hears or reads the word. Take the word "miracle", for example. Although definitions vary, they can be summed up the way the voice-over does at the beginning of "Miracles from Heaven" (PG, 1:49) ? an event which does not have a natural explanation. One of the problems with this film is that it doesn't stick to its own definition ? and confuses the meanings of other words as well.There's no way to talk about this movie without mentioning how the story comes out, so consider this sentence your spoiler warning. This movie is based on the 2015 book "Miracles from Heaven: A Little Girl, Her Journey to Heaven, and Her Amazing Story of Healing" by Christy Beam. The book and the film (with only minor differences between the two) both tell the story of Beam's 12-year-old daughter, Annabel, who developed an incurable and deadly digestive disorder which suddenly disappeared after she fell 30 feet head-first through the hallowed-out trunk of a dead tree. Christy suffered only minor injuries and says she went to heaven and spoke with Jesus during the hours she lay unconscious before being rescued.Homemaker Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner) and veterinarian Kevin Beam (Martin Henderson) live a happy and quiet life with their oldest daughter, Abbie (Brighton Sharbino), middle daughter, Anna (Kylie Rogers) and youngest daughter, Adelynn (Courtney Fansler) in a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas. They have a good-sized house with a little bit of land and Kevin has just opened up a veterinary hospital, for which Kevin and Christy took out a second mortgage on their home. The family goes to church regularly, as we see in the movie's first big scene (where the band "Third Day" sings). The Beams have close friends in that church, including the kind, funny Pastor Scott (John Carroll Lynch of TV's "American Horror Story").The night after a church picnic, Anna is lying in her bed when she suddenly feels ill and calls out to her mother. Anna remains sick and in pain over a period of weeks, in spite of multiple hospital visits and consultations with several doctors, until Dr. Blyth (Zach Sale) makes the correct diagnosis of Anna's condition ? pseudo-obstruction motility disorder. With Anna's digestive system unable to function properly, she begins a daily routine of feeding tubes, medication and restricted activities. Dr. Blyth says this condition has no known cure and implies that it's often fatal. However, he offers a ray of hope in a referral to world-renown gastroenterologist Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez) at Boston Children's Hospital.Dr. Nurko is very much in demand by desperate patients all over the world and getting an appointment with him is no easy task, but Christy Beam refuses to take "no" for an answer and insists on getting her daughter the best medical help available. As the entire family struggles to cope with emotional stress, family care and serious financial issues, Christy and Anna must make regular trips to Boston where Dr. Nurko uses his talent for medicine (and for dealing with sick children) to do all he can for Anna. Sadly, she continues to suffer, but Anna and Christy receive no small amount of comfort and encouragement from a local Boston waitress (Queen Latifah) who befriends the struggling mother and daughter. It looks like there's nothing more to be done when Anna and her sister are climbing a tree in their yard and Anna experiences that dramatic and terrifying fall, lying deep within that tree trunk needing a miracle.The main problem with "Miracles from Heaven" is that it can't keep its message straight ? or its own vocabulary. The word "miracle", as defined at the beginning of the movie becomes, in the movie's last big scene, a much broader term which is then rendered virtually meaningless. Another word the movie has a problem with is "impossible". It's used on the movie poster and in the film's trailer to describe Anna's healing. But Anna was indeed healed. Her healing was never (and ends up not being) impossible after all ? especially for people of faith ? which is the third word the film uses inconsistently. Is faith really faith if it goes away when prayers aren't answered quickly, but then returns once everything has turned out okay? And if prayers offered in faith led to Anna's healing (as the movie implies) what does that say about the prayers or faith of many parents around the world who have sick children that are never healed? Troubling questions for a movie that asks us to accept an impossible miracle on faith.Some may consider the issues I just raised to be trivial or based on a misunderstanding of the film's message, but I just happen to think that words have meaning and that should count for something. However, I can't evaluate this movie objectively based on its use of words without also giving my subjective and more positive assessment of the film. "Miracles from Heaven" may be flawed in the choice of words in its script and inconsistent in its message, but it also happens to be a very meaningful and even entertaining story. Although the extent to which Anna's suffering is shown seems designed to increase the number of tears that audience members shed later in the film, overall it is a well-told, very well-acted story of the importance of a close family and true friends. I can't quite recommend this movie to a general audience, but the faithful will likely enjoy it. "C+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! WOW!!!! Best Acting I've Seen Yet in a Faith Based Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow . . . WOW!!!! I saw Miracles From Heaven today. The story was moving and the acting was beyond what I have ever seen in a Faith based film. ALL the actors were so believable. I felt as though I were living the story with them . . . like peering into their life and seeing a "real" family with "real" struggles and moments where they questioned God and His goodness. I cried, I laughed . . . I found myself living the story with them . . . something I seldom am able to do in movies these days. I will see this movie again and purchase it when it comes out. Thank you . . . THANK YOU for one of the best films I have seen in my entire 60 years of living!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie you can take your whole family to, or just take your loved one. I didn't view it as a religious as all. Rather a true story that we compelling enough to make it to the screen. The acting was amazing as well as the cinematography. This movie reminded me that there are still movies that can be made that touch your heart while equally entertaining. Its about time for a movie like this to come along. There was a point were I was tearing up and I looked behind me and noticed the reflecting light off of the tears of every single person in the theater. So get ready, it will happen to you too. You won't be able to control your emotions. Doubt it? I dare you. Go see it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming, feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I rate movies on enjoyment. We generally try to see critically acclaimed movies that we hope we will enjoy. Miracles from Heaven, while not critically acclaimed, is a movie that was described as heartwarming and feel good. We like both, so we went to see it, even though we are non-believers.It's a very well done movie with good production values. The filming is outstanding. The two leads, Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers give very credible performances. While the movie didn't convert us, Kylie's discussion of her belief in Jesus to a girl suffering from cancer in the hospital brought tears to my eyes.If you are a believer and like movies, this is the one to go see. That doesn't mean that all others should avoid it. We both were raised Christian and we have many devout Christians in our extended family. This may explained why we are open to movies like this. However, I did come out wondering when all the children suffering in Syria are going to get their miracle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family really enjoyed this movie. Whether you are religious or not, the story is compelling and the acting is solid. Jennifer Garner does a wonderful job at pulling you into their family dynamic, and the tremendous amount of love for her daughter. As a mother, I could relate to her anguish and willingness to stop at nothing to help her child. Kylie Rogers (Anna) is excellent!!! You can truly feel her emotional performance. Her acting range is clearly evident in this movie. She is such a talented young performer. You will walk out of there believing in miracles.This is a feel good movie that will make you want to hug your children tighter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To sum up, it's the most inspirational movie that I ever saw. This is truly the best acting Jennifer Garner has done. Her performance may lead to a nomination for an Academy Award. (We'll see.)Just in case, movie goers do not need to fear any Christian related messages if they happen to be nonbelievers. Those who do not believe may, instead, wonder (from time to time) if there is any kind of destiny after death. For those wanting to maybe avoid this film, on purpose, consider seeing it with an open mind. Then, by the end, determine how you think and feel in relation to everything the Beam family went through. Most especially, ask yourself about the ongoing question of existence. Again, this film is based on a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of 2016 so Far.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion this film is Ms. Garner's best work so far. The cinematography in the film is exceptional. Shooting of clouds with orange skies is wonderful. Images of Boston (Fenway Park). Boston Aquarium scenes were breathtaking. the sea life scenes were wonderful. The scenery in Texas was a joy to see, with so much rich color. Reminded me of a summer day. The scenes between Mother and daughter is raw emotion and painful to experience. I felt that emotion. Queen Latifah was awesome. I wish though, she played a bigger role in the film. Her chemistry with Ms. Garner and Ms. Kylie Rogers made me smile. After seeing Miracles from Heaven, I am hoping all three are friends in real life.Mr. Derbez reminded me of a lot Mr. Robin Williams as Patch Adams. Mr. Martin Henderson played the role of a very caring and wonderful father in every way.The pizza pact made me laugh. The tree always gave me a sense of foreboding. The scene where the family surprises Ms. Kylie Rogers in the hospital was a loving celebration to see. Praying that Mr. Affleck and Ms. Garner will watch the film together, if they have not already./wink I will make sure to recommend Miracles from Heaven to family and friends. Discussing the film with my family over dinner tonight. "They will get there when they get there."

		<fullReview>While I may not be a religious person but the thing that makes the film uplifting is how the film manages to show that any obstacle can be overcome when believing in faith and also having the strength to face life's hardships, the story tells Anna's struggle who has been sick and constantly in pain due to a disease that makes her immune system weak and unable to process food. The journey is rather tough on her mother Chrissy who has her faith tested during the difficult ordeal wondering why her daughter is suffering. I will say that Jennifer garner does a great job playing the role showing the anguish and strength she has. Queen latifah does a decent job in the small role that she has as Angela the waitress that shows Chrissy and Anna kindness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that instills, faith, hope and love in children. To know that this happened not too long ago, and this little girl is the same age as my son, is very moving. Garner and Derbez had great performances. Everyone else did an amazing job. What Anna Beam saw is, after her fall, is beautifully depicted... unfortunately, not everything that was in the book is in the movie. All in all, this is a feel good movie and it makes you appreciate what you have, and how you can lose it all in the blink of an eye. It helps you realize that even God fearing people lose faith and God can bring their faith back if they allow it. We all suffer tragedy, some more than others, but you have to keep your faith in God, even when it seems impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it! Makes you think about the miracles in your own life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! Miracles from Heaven is very inspirational, very religious and all about miracles. It really makes you think about all the miracles that are happening in your life. Miracles from Heaven is about a young girl named Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers) who has a very rare stomach disorder. Her family pulled out all the stops to help her. When an amazing event happens it changes everything. This is a real story and it is very heartwarming. The Beam family's faith in God is undeniable. They are very religious and go to church every Sunday. Even if you are not really religious, I still think that you would enjoy this movie.All of the characters in Miracles from Heaven are likable, but especially Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner). She is very believable and makes you feel really sad when she is sad and happy when she is happy. She is a mom that a lot of people would want to have as their own, because she would never give up and she works very hard. The dad, Kevin Beam (Martin Henderson) is a very good dad and cares a lot about his kids. My favorite character is Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez). He is very funny and he works very hard to make all the kids in the hospital happy. And if I was ever really sick I would want a doctor like him.My favorite scene is at the end of the movie where it is showing all the miracles that happen in their lives. This scene really makes you think about what miracles could be happening to you and it makes you feel great about other people around you.The moral of the story is never to give up on hope. Even though Anna struggles and she ends up in the hospital many times, her family never gives up and tries to help her. You learn to love Anna and root for her along the way. This movie made a lot of people in the audience cry and tear up. I rate Miracles from Heaven five out of five stars because it is very inspirational and it makes you really think about what miracles you could be having in your life. I recommend the ages 7 to 18 because there are some surgical procedures, but they're not that graphic. Go see this movie on March 16 in theaters near you. Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST!

		<shortDescription>Wonderful True Story of a Child's Vision of Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna was diagnosed with an incurable malady of the intestines that prevented her from eating most foods. Bloated and with no medical remedy, her mother took her from their home in Texas to a highly recommended specialist in Boston who prescribed an experimental drug. The results were not what he hoped and Anna returned to Texas where her older sister encouraged her to climb a huge tree. When the branch broke Anna fell head first down a thirty foot hole. It seemed impossible that she could still be alive when she was rescued approximately six hours later, but that's when the miracle occurred.This is a heart warming, family friendly story of faith complete with photos of the actual family at the end. My only criticism is the lack of the name "Jesus." Faith is mentioned. God is mentioned. A cross is shown, but Jesus is avoided and the Bible says, "there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."Acts 4:12I rate it second after "War Room" as my favorite faith film. Superb acting by adults and children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family and i went and saw 'Miracles From Heaven,' and it's obvious that this story wasn't fabricated. Hollywood has the best writers on the planet, but nobody could've written about this story the way the matriarch of the Beam family, Christy wrote about it. Whenever a nonbeliever asks me where's proof that God exist, my answer always comes back, "he's standing right in front of you!" I've had 7 near- misses in my life, and while i was watching this movie: I was watching it, as if it were about me. The last time I left this movie feeling a sense of personal fulfillment, was 3 years ago, after i saw 'Homefront' &amp; 'Dallas Buyers Club.' This time, it only took one movie to make me feel that way again. If you haven't seen it yet, please go see 'Miracles From Heaven,' and even if you don't go see the movie, every time you pass a mirror, i hope you acknowledge the fact that we are all miracles from heaven!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was horrendous. I understand it's based on a true story but it doesn't work for a movie. The most important thing in a movie is character evolution, changing as a character, and this movie doesn't have that. The movie goes from a perfect Christian family to an even more perfect Christian family. On top of that which already makes the movie boring in my mind. The mom (Jennifer Gardner) cries in nearly every scene she is in. They want you to feel so bad for her all the time and it just gets annoying cause all she does is beg for other people's help and constantly being dependent on her husbands support. She doesn't come off as a good protagonist instead more of a needy mom who needs her husband constantly. This movie also has too many useless characters such as Queen Latifah and the little boy who meets the main girl in the story but he never becomes important throughout the whole story. There's a good movie in here somewhere but they never care to show it and the ending annoys the crap out of me. If you want to watch my Video Movie Review on my youtube channel Go ahead here's a link. I do cuss a a lot in the video cause I hated the movie but it has nothing to do with being against Christian films cause I actually really like some of them such as Passion, ten commandments, Prince of Egypt, and etc. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Eq8dcMjUhLWxzlp4cOARAI am going to try to make this into a hobby and any feedback is appreciated as well :) If you don't want to watch it that is also fine. I know this is basically self promotion but at the same time you've got to get yourself out there somehow. I'm stressing that my opinion is not biased because I've received enough comments talking about my language in this one video and enough comments trying to tell me to convert to Christianity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, really? I am sure many people might totally be angry or judgmental now. First of all, I am not much of a religious person. I am from Brazil and many Brazilians say they are catholic or Christian as many times as they get their beers in the fridge, a lot more. And most of the time, they are just afraid to say they don't care about religion at all but that would make them look bad - I guess. So, I happened to be one of those blessed people who live in another country sponsored by the employer. It happened between 2008 and 2013, and I lived in Fort Worth, Texas for almost 5 years. If this story was true it might have happened not far from where I used to live in Keller. Well, no matter what people think or talk, challenging situations like this specially, will always put in you in a position of start asking, seriously and deeply, are we alone on this deal? Are we really in the WYSIWYG world? I doubt it!Faith is not to be explained, never. And you will deeply question life values and beliefs when you bump into the unexpected things, most of the time death-related. That sinking feeling is true, frustration is true but faith can be equally true and maybe the only reason many people are still trying these days.</fullReview>

If you know the title, you know what to expect. So what if there aren't surprises, enjoy the story telling and the happy ending.Jennifer Garner is believable as the mom. Kylie Rogers is convincing. The remainder of the cast are all good. There's a supporting role played by Queen Latifah that seems like a time filler after the writer painted us into a waiting corner.Be warned, not all sick children are saved. If you are open minded, this faith based tale works and it is well done. While it looks good on the big screen, it will play well on home platforms.

		<shortDescription>The Miracles are not just from Heaven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a well done movie, that pulled on the right heart strings to get your emotions running. Anna Beam's story is a heartwarming one. sometimes It was hard to watch this girl's story unfold on the movie screen, it was painful watching her go though her illness and watch her realize nothing can be done and almost give up. You could not help to be touched by it no matter what your belief system.It was a good leading role for Jennifer Garner. She did a great job as Christy Beam, a mom trying to cope with the fact that her daughter is not coming back from an illness they have no cure for, and wonders why God would allow this. While everyone is telling her to have faith she finds it hard cause the situation is out of her control.Speaking of faith, this story is a lot about how it takes a village. The Miracle from heaven is actually coming from right here on Earth. It was about how everyone in Anna Beam's life and the people she touched with her story came together and embraced her with positive vibes, which always helps.I'm not a religious man, but I saw this movie as more than just a film about Faith in god, but I saw something the proves how good the church can be. It's all about not just one persons faith, but everyone together that creates the Miracle. Very nice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had downloaded this with some trepidation - the title should have been warning enough, but perhaps I'm stupid or perhaps I'm just optimistic that actors of this calibre (mostly) wouldn't involved themselves on some pile of religious propaganda.I was entirely wrong, they would and they did and it is.I only made it twenty or so minutes into this film, the constant references to prayer, to god and to all other manner of religious iconography was enough to drive me crazy. Jennifer Garner used to be a fairly reasonable actress, she's not Meryl obviously, but she's done some OK and watchable work, up to this one. She must have been hard up for work to have taken this gig that's for sure, and she also appears to have forgotten how to act.Martin Henderson, appreciating that he is a fellow kiwi I would have forgiven some sins (so to speak) but his terrible fake accent mixed with his similarly wooden acting suggest he must also have been as desperate for work as they were desperate for a good male lead actor. This his work in Grey's Anatomy hopefully we will be spared a sequel to this rubbish.Basically this film seems, from the little i saw, to be aimed directly at what I imagine are the typical bible thumping families in the Mid West of the USA. You know the type, they are married to their cousins, their children have a limb spare or a digit missing, they don't make it past about 8 years in School and they drive a 'truck'.... good wholesome folk who go to church every Sunday and pray about this that and the other, they blame Obama and the Gay for all that is wrong with the world - if you're one of these people, then I can imagine you will think this film Oscar worthy - enjoy!So in summation, if you're into religion and church propaganda then this is the film for you, if you don't believe in invisible men, talking snakes, the world being 4 thousand years old, and you aren't married to your cousin (or shagging her/him), then there are plenty of similarly unintelligent but not god squad movies you could go find.Just no. That is all I can say. I don't blame Obama or the Gays of anyone for what is wrong with the world, but I wonder who the hell funds this sort of crap, the money would have been way better spent housing the homeless or providing medication for the sick who need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miracles from HeavenThe problem with God performing miracles is that he automatically expects you to return the favour.Which means the cured kid in this drama has one whooper of an IUO.Stricken with an ailment that prevents her from digesting food, 10-year-old Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers) undergoes rigorous testing at the behest of her mother (Jennifer Garner) that ultimately concludes that Anna has intestinal pseudoobstruction.It's not until she falls 30-feet from a cottonwood tree and has a near-death experience that Anna finds relief from the excruciating pain. Even more astounding is Anna's account of her encounter with the big man upstairs.Christian propaganda masquerading as wholesome family entertainment, this mawkish mockup of the mother's own memoirs emulates movie-of-the-week acting and storytelling with a side of Sunday school sermonizing thrown in for good measure.In fact, Millennials would be more inclined to attend Sunday services if church had an omelet station.

		<shortDescription>Miracle on the dirt street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Easter showing up a bit earlier this year, the local multiplex has once again resorted to looking like a lineup of Sunday mass topics, with The Young Messiah and now Miracles from Heaven. Despite making up the majority of believers in the United States, up until a few years ago, no studio was willing to go near faith-based property, but after the Kendrick brothers brought monstrous success to the genre, and God's Not Dead followed in its footsteps to utterly extraordinary earnings (so extraordinary you can look for the sequel in theaters on April 1st), the market is now being recognized by more studios like Pure Flix and even mainstream Hollywood.Miracles from Heaven was apparently a story that T.D. Jakes, with his production company, and executives at Columbia Pictures found so wonderful and potential-ridden that they had to pick it up for a wide release a week before one of the biggest Christian holidays of the year. Taking a first look at the film's trailer, concept, and poster, it immediately looks like the equally bad sister film to Heaven is for Real, that nauseatingly saccharine mess that came out two years ago. However, while Miracles from Heaven essentially levels the playing field for being about as cloyingly mawkish as that film, it admirably tries to focus on the characters that make up the story, in addition to their relationships with one another during certain calamity.The film, based on a true story, as you probably could've guessed just by the statement's ubiquity in recent years, revolves around the Beam family, a tight-knit bunch in Burleson, Texas with Christy and Kevin (Jennifer Garner and Martin Henderson) at the helm and their three girls. The prime focus, however, is on their ten-year-old daughter Anna (Kylie Rogers), who has been having extreme stomach pain and prolific bouts of vomiting for weeks on end. Repeated doctor visits diagnose relatively mild to moderate cases of lactose intolerance and ulcers, but Christy knows in her heart that this isn't something so simple. Call it mother's intuition.It turns out, Anna has a rare digestive disorder called pseudo-obstruction motility disorder, where the body thinks there is something obstructing the intestinal tact but there is no such blockage. It comes from the body's inability to properly breakdown and digest food, with the only solution being for the stomach to vomit the food back up. Of course, there is no known cure, but out of desperation, Christy and Anna fly out to Boston to meet Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez), a doctor at Boston Children's Hospital who specializes in pediatric gastroenterology. For months, Anna is sick and in constant pain, to the point where she tells her mother she'd rather be dead. Miracles from Heaven directress Patricia Riggen (director of last year's miner drama The 33 and screenwriter Randy Brown do a great job at conveying the helplessness that plagues both Christy and Anna throughout the entire course of the film. However, one thing that keeps both of them strong to a certain degree is their faith and connection to the Lord. While Christy's dwindles as Anna's situation looks bleak, Anna, her father, and her sisters keep that sort of faith all the way down to a truly terrifying moment that changes the course of Anna's life forever.The incredulity is high in this film, but what would you expect from a film titled Miracles from Heaven that's also based on a true story? However, that doesn't justify the film's almost sickening emphasis on the sad and the melancholic through every scene. Even worse than sermonizing the word of God or some moral about absolute faith, Riggen and company decide to embellish every scene with a frothy musical score that practically works to extract tears and sentiment from the audience in the most unnatural way. For a 110 minute film, the result is a wearying example of what it means to really sentimentalize every little thing in movies, to the point where you imagine the film crew themselves shedding tears at the story and just wish they and the film itself would get a grip.There is also a conflicting narrative here that disturbs me, and the fact that it's glossed over so casually is also problematic. Part of Christy disassociating herself with the church comes after a group of churchgoing ladies suggest to her that Anna's suffering may be a result of Anna or both her and Kevin sinning. The scene is sickening in the sense that it looks to emphasize one of the many reasons why so many people are so disgusted with the church - the way it casually blames victims for their own suffering and has some assuming that if their lives are good, why can't everyone's life be good? This is a very real issue that should infuriate Christy, and while it does for a little while, it also doesn't stop her from eventually recommitting her life to the church. Even if you're going to shamelessly dub Miracles from Heaven a propaganda film, which it kind of is, to be fair, talk about going against your own propaganda.Miracles from Heaven's performances are all on-par with those commendable for basic melodrama that somehow bypassed being an Up TV favorite and got the privilege of a theatrical release, and the fantastical aspect Heaven is for Real chose to make a one-hundred minute film on, Miracles from Heaven chooses to make most of the third act about, which is another positive in that it doesn't lose focus. As faith-based films go, this one definitely realizes that the human side of things is what gets it the respectable points as a film, but forgets that the mawkish and over-sentimentalized route is another route that can make one entirely forget the important aspects of the film they just saw.</fullReview>
