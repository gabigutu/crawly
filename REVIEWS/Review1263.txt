		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of older Adam Sandler movies (Billy Maddison, Happy Gilmore, and old SNL with Farley). Everyone knows Sandler has done some terrible stuff in the past while, but this one wasn't the worst.He wasn't terribly over the top or in your face like he is in roles for films like Zohan, That's my Boy, Jack &amp; Jill. This film had genuinely laugh-out-loud moments; the cast really helps (Kathryn Hahn, Matt Walsh) - even David Spade is funny! The movie isn't a classic. It isn't going to be one you're quoting. The film is enjoyable! If you're looking for a laugh, it's a good film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Need to Do-Over this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that I have hated almost every Adam Sandler film in the last few years. They have consistently been terrible. So when I decided to watch The Do-Over, I did not have high hopes. I really expected the worst. I can say I was pleasantly surprised. Adam Sandler and David Spade actually delivered a decent and fun comedy.Two guys down on their luck fake their own deaths to escape their terrible lives. They take on the identities of two dead guys who apparently had a lot of money and something to hide, and stumble into a world of action they never asked for. Now, being chased by assassins, the two middle aged average Joes must find out why they are being targeted.A simple premise, yes, but it delivers. The story actually has a good plot and some decent, if sometimes sloppy, character development. Some of the jokes are still riddled with that adolescent humor that plagues Happy Madison films, but it also lands quite a few funny moments. This movie will never be considered a classic, or one of my favorites. But I am still glad I checked it out.The acting in this movie is okay. The 2 leads portray their parts convincingly enough. Though it can feel a little lazy at times. The rest of the actors get the job done. Nothing spectacular. But also not bad.The soundtrack has a fun vibe, full of country hits, and some mediocre, generic action film music. It feels okay within the film.The script was good. It definitely had some twists. And it delivered a story with more emotion and depth than the usual Happy Madison productions. It is very predictable to a fault, but it still feels nice to follow the story as it progresses.So, in the end, this is not a masterpiece. It is not Sandler's best work. But it is a lot better than most of the stuff he's put out lately, and I can say I enjoyed watching it. It's a Netflix Original movie, so check it out if you have a chance.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler back?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie I was expecting to be as bad if not worse than The Ridiculous 6 which I couldn't even finish, but I was pleasantly surprised with The Do Over. The movie has a good amount of laughs, and at some points kept me on the edge of my seat. I think that this is one of Sandler's best movies within the past 6 years. I was also very happy with David Spade's performance. I was expecting him to be just like he was in Grown Ups, as a stupid immature old man, but he surprised me as well. He kept the movie funny as well as maintained great acting the entire movie, as well as the whole cast. Overall, the movie was great. Great acting, great laughs, great action(which still surprised me), and one of Sandler's best in the past few years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Do-Over has Adam Sandler back to his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies Adam Sandler has done in years, truly back to his best. Co-staring along side David Spade, play two guys who fake there own deaths to escape there awful lives, only to find out the guys who's identity they have taken are in a lot of trouble. This Netflix original movie is hilarious and a return to form for Sandler, who last played a character similar to this way back in the nighties in a movie called Bulletproof. I think this movie could have benefited from a cinema release. Funny and crude but it also tackles a sensitive theme in a humorous way.This fast paced action comedy is far from Sandler's usual family friendly tone. It's rated R for a reason! Not everyone will find this movie as funny as i did but this is a must watch even for non-Sandler fans. Review 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's actually (probably) the most plot driven Adam Sandler movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE DO-OVER': Three Stars (Out of Five)Action-comedy flick, about two old high school buddies; that reunite at their 25-year reunion, and decide to fake their own deaths (in order to start new lives). Their new identities end up getting them in even more trouble. The movie stars Adam Sandler and David Spade, as the two leads; and it costars Paula Patton, Kathryn Hahn, Nick Swardson, Natasha Leggero, Torsten Voges, Luis Guzman, Matt Walsh and Sean Astin. It was directed by Steven Brill (who also directed Sandler in the movies 'MR. DEEDS' and 'LITTLE NICKY'), and it was written by Kevin Barnett and Chris Pappas. The film is the second movie, in a four- film deal, between Sandler and Netflix. Like nearly all of Sandler's movies, the film is pretty bad; but this one isn't as bad, as most.Spade plays Charlie McMillan, a bank manager (attached to a grocery store); who's used and abused by his wife, Nikki (Leggero), and her two children. He attends his 25-year high school reunion, with Nikki (who's the former prom queen), and she cheats on him, with her ex-husband (Astin). He reunites with his old friend, Max Kessler (Sandler), who tells him he works for the FBI. Later the two go on a yacht trip, while Nikki is on a spa vacation, and Max (unexpectedly) fakes their deaths; so the two can start new lives together. The movie gets a lot more complicated than that; it's actually (probably) the most plot driven Adam Sandler movie ever made (with a ton of twists). That's pretty much where the film's qualities end though. It's still full of a lot of bad dick and fart jokes (that aren't funny), and Sandler once again plays an unlikable asshole; who's much tougher than Sandler could ever possibly be (in real life). Spade is actually good in the movie though. It's interesting, for a change (from the usual bad Sandler movies), but nothing more.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8E1WKbyL3YM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam sandler....... you either love his work or hate it.For me it is a relief like on mid summers afternoon; which is provided by a cool beer. Life in itself is too short, and this movie delivers that message with a punch. you looking for shakes'perian drama, or Quentin Tarantino's mystical direction, you are missing the message. It's Adam Sandler at his best after the Growns up's.It's classic in terms of his way of doing movies. i will not spoil it with details but only a suggestion watch when you are burned out and have some time with a cold one.Its the most irrational, fun, adult entertainment to bring your spirits up.Peace out brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sandler movie in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>20 years ago, a movie starring Adam Sandler, Catherine Bell and David Spade would be plastered all over billboards and the trailer would be shown 50 times during an episode of Saturday Night Live. Well, fast forward 2 decades and it is basically the same movie ? a movie from a decade where Adam Sander made funny movies and David Spade was a star (Catherine Bell, maybe the best actor of the cast really only has a cameo, so we can ignore her). However I was only told about this film from a friend, and I had no interest in it until he said it was good. So the story has Spade (I won't use the character names because Sandler for all intents and purposes is Sandler and Spade is Spade, so why bother) living a unfulfilling life working at a bank and in a loveless marriage only to meet up with Sandler during a school reunion. Very soon Sandler fakes their deaths and hilarity ensues. So it's Sandler doing Sandler, but it is good Sandler, so if you are 40 and remember his glory days of Happy Gilmore, this is a good reminisce. If you only remember Little Nicky, well here is a reminder of why he is a big Hollywood star. Spade has always been a very strong strait man, and the 2 actors do have chemistry. There are the obligatory cast of crazy side characters, who although maybe not classic, are definitely funny. The main villain should get s special nod here. The movie has the Sandler style of dick and fart jokes, but they are more funny and less tasteless than I have seen in recently. The plot is silly, but of course it is supposed to be. However unlike some of his more recent movies such as Grown-ups which forgo plot for what amounts to set pieces of 'comedy', the movie does keep the viewer interested in what is going on.To say that Sander is 'back' might be taking it too far, to say he has made a very respectable, funny movie that reminds me why he was a bright star of comedy for almost a decade is about right.I enjoyed the film, and ultimately, that is what is important!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calling this a Comedy is Really Stretching the Definition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only logical excuse for this movie is that the two writers are 12 years old. They threw in every pre-teen attempt at risqué humor they could find. I can't believe that the two stars, who used to be comedians, don't know any funny people who can write a script for them. I will admit that I have never liked Sandler but I came into this with an open mind and I really wanted to like it. They made that all but impossible. The story is really too stupid to even comment on but you can forgive that in a comedy. What you can't forgive in a comedy is a lack of jokes. Gross doesn't equal funny (unless you are 12).Things up people's butts, Alzheimer's, sweaty testicles, old lady boobs, are just a few of the subjects mined in this film in the search for the elusive laugh. They never really got there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Entertaining, Enough anyways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was quite fun and entertaining, and the first half hour was close to fantastic. Then it kinda went down a few notches, started relying on crude humor and vulgar stuff too much. Then it became not even believable at all. Some humor from silly stuff is okay, but this became just a bit too silly. If Sandler would stick to a bit of drama and comedy that seemed more realistic he could hit one out of the park.As it is, there are glimpses of great, but then equaled out by silly vulgar stuff, that seems more for 13 year old's. Maybe he is not able to make great movies. Well, not great, not horrible, funny at times at least</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title sounds a lot like how Netflix are now feeling......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a Sandler hater by any means. Up until this, I've pretty much defended all of his films. There are a few that are questionable (Jack and Jill, 8 Crazy Nights) but at least they have one scene that is just so bizarre, it borderline saves the film.And now we have the aptly titled The Do Over.Max is a smooth-talking guy who runs into old friend Charlie at a high school reunion. Charlie's life is a mess. His wife Nikki is sleeping with Sean Astin, his step kids hate him, and he's just generally miserable. Reuniting with Max makes him feel like a teenager again, having fun and avoiding his reality. When Max decides to fake their deaths so they can start over in Puerto Rico, Charlie doesn't object for long, until their new identities pasts catch up,with them.......It sounded like a good idea, Adam Sandler in an identity swap crisis, only to find out that his new identity causes more trouble than ever before, but to make it as adult and as vulgar as possible, he's made something that just doesn't sit well with (I know many will chortle) his body of work.It's doesn't have the brightness of a normal Happy Madison vehicle, and it appears that this has been rushed, because I'm guessing that Sandler thought he was going to hit big with Pixels, and then come back with Pixels 2 after this contract was for filled, but alas, we all know how the story went with that.He's probably already been paid for his contract, The Ridiculous six was universally panned, but one of the most watched things on Netflix, so in theory, do either party really care about the quality? Because whether or not the quality is good or bad, it's win win for them.I'm not saying that Sandler doesn't put in a decent performance, he's ways watchable in that favourite second cousin type of way, but he looks like he has dead eyes in some of the scenes. Spade is okay, but seeing as the majority of films he's been in haven't been very good, it's not saying much.It isn't funny in the slightest, the sarcastic element to his comedy formula is sorely missed, and I'm really concerned about what is coming next, because this is such a wasted effort.I'm sure if it wasn't going straight to Netflix, Sandler would have put in a lot more effort into it.But to be fair, it does contain the best use of the Madonna son 'Crazy For You'.But I'm not crazy for this.I feel like I've been done over....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plesantly surprised by this sincere, thrill-ride comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the Sandler gems in the more tonally serious vein of Big Daddy, The Cobbler although it has an out-there premise, the movie is well written overall and provides nice flow. Most certainly worth taking a chance on watching this movie if you have been "Sandler-burned" before or still upset over the recent Joe Dirt 2, which was a disappointment with some notable cameos but too much paid sponsorship and pandered too much to a neo-conservative crowd.Sandler is stepping into acting more in this movie and relies on the better writing and not wacky gimmicks (too many) to let this movie soar. At times, the comedy gets to near screwball highs but the acting helps ground these moments. The various plot twists and aura of mystery shield this movie the the possible plot holes that could be uncovered while adding enough turns to keep an audience's interest intact.A solid 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was literally one of the most disgusting, horrible movies I've seen in my entire life. It's literally jaw-droppingly bad and is extremely hard to watch. This movie is bizarre because it feels like seeing the world through a hyper-masculine point of view that treats women like objects, shames men for being unmanly, and uses violence against women and awkward sexual encounters that are completely for shock value for cheap jokes. The most shocking aspect of this film (if you can even call it that) is the portrayal of the female characters. Literally every female character is treated like a sexual object, including the 83-year-old acting legend Renee Taylor. She appears in an extremely degrading nude scene that seems to be out of a Jackass movie. There is visible oral sex in which a woman participates in a threesome which she seems to be completely uninterested in and is a very awkward encounter for all characters and the viewer. This part has an extremely negative effect on one of the male characters participating and his obvious discomfort is made into a joke by the more manly character. It's just bizarre and the use of sex is so cheap and degrading for all characters that it just comes off as "rapey" and is uncomfortable to watch. Shocking this movie even got made considering the script alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sandler comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A high school reunion brings two friends back together. Max (Sandler) is an FBI agent and Charlie (Spade) a bank manager. They realize at the end of the night, that they both are disappointed about the way their life turned out. When Sandler decides to drastically take matters in his own hands, he drags his newly re-found friend with him kicking and screaming.Truth be told, most Adam Sandler movies don't excel in subtle comedy. They are harsh, immature and over the top. This movie is not an exception. The plot is full of holes, logic and common sense are not pillars of this particular story.Does this make it a bad movie? Yes! Did I enjoy watching it? I did! Sandler is one of my guilty pleasures though. There is something about his screen presence and charisma that keeps me glued to the screen. Most of the characters Sandler plays are effortlessly interchangeable. When he plays a serious character for a change, the quality of work improves (Funny People, Reign Over Me, Punch Drunk Love for example). Hopefully Netflix will steer in another direction for the remaining Sandler title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All i want in this type of movies is to have a laugh. I don't search for deep plot or character develop, just funny times. Unfortunadly i didn't find any. Adam Sandler tries to act in the first part of the movie, he tries to be mysterious, but as soon as the movie adds more complexity, all the acting just fall apart in a careless character, far away from being fun. The stereotyped women in the film set this production to be in the same level as the late 90's trash cinema. The villain just doesn't exist, its foolish to have the same guy doing some gymnastics over and over again; thats not a villain!! This movies tries to be serious and fun at the same time, but its a huge catastrophe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure why I'm reading all these reviews that say this is a return to form for Sandler...it's not. I love me some Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison and this movie is nowhere near the "quality" of those two. Yes Sandler is much more reserved...but that alone doesn't make the movie better. Spade as usual with Chris Farley plays the nerdy straight part. It's a very formulaic approach with a patchwork plot that really makes no sense nor does the director care. I think the main point was to showcase Sandler and Spade as a funny action duo...except the material isn't funny... I think back to Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence in Nothing to Lose...another could have been awful buddy comedy with a bad plot...except Robbins and Lawrence are FUNNY together...and this is exactly the opposite. There's a decent supporting cast also with again some very cringe inducing unfunny material. And Paula Patton...my god for as hot as she is she's every bit as bad an actress. So don't listen to all these reviews...the Do Over isn't even dumb fun...aside from a few chuckles they need a do over on the entire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two down, two to go in Netflix's four-movie deal with Adam Sandler *sigh* *while looking out the bedroom window pondering the demise of the human species*.Other people have described this film as "blergh" and "mehhh" and yes, if they were words in the English dictionary, I'd probably say they are spot-on descriptions. However, my best effort is: it's a cold piece of buttered toast.You're just so used to this basic, bland piece of sh*t thing that you've been force fed from an early age, that you just vague out and consume it with that "it's getting the job done" mentality without a second thought.Upon reflection though, Sandler and Spade just don't seem to care. Apart from the obvious answer of 'money', why would someone put their name to this movie? It's mediocre, there's no love in trying to make the viewer laugh and the five star rating Netflix give it on their platform is deceptive conduct at its finest.Toast - watch Casino on Netflix instead next time.</fullReview>

The rest of it was either predictable and just not funny at all. How Nick Swardson keeps making his way into Sandler's movies is beyond me. He is quite possibly the most unfunny person on the planet.

		<shortDescription>Tries to be different but isn't great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Do-Over is another Adam Sandler film which was driven directly to Netflix (apart of his four-film deal). The film starts and begins well into after a night drinking, smoking weed and basking in the wild life of FBI agent Max Kessler (Adam Sandler), Charlie (David Spade) voice-overs, "I wish I could start from scratch, just get it right this time." And then Kessler, who turns out not to be an FBI agent but a dangerous sociopath, fakes both their deaths and gives Charlie the fresh start he thought he wanted. And, as long-time Sandler observers are well aware, his competence at delivering an improvised comeback has tragically declined over the years.The film has been praised by not being a typical Sandler silly gag comedy, since it is more action based and has an R rating. Many have considered the film better because it is quite somewhat different than his typical share of films, but that does not mean the film is essentially all that good. The plot is decent but it runs tiresome and the jokes are non-existent. However, The Do-Over is a much improvement from his previous Netflix film, the Ridiculous 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the same Adam Sandler that made, "Jack &amp; Jill"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past 5 to 10 years, Sandler has put out terrible movies after another. Such as Blended, Grown ups 2, The cobbler, Jack &amp; Jill and the Ridiculous 6. Last year he put out Pixels, from the looks of the trailer I thought He had Found his Billy Madison spark. But I was wrong, don't get me wrong the movie does have its high points. But sadly the movie was very average. So when I saw the trailer do this it looked great, but I thought nothing of it after Pixels. But one day I decided to sit down and watch it. The first 20 minutes of the movie were good, but I kept telling myself this movie is going to go downhill; But it didn't. It's certainly not better than any of his 90's movies, but it is better than the crap he's been pulling out of his ass the last couple of years. The story made since, the characters are likable and the Comedy is superb! If Sandler puts out more movies like this more people might forget about the last couple of years! To sum it up, if you were a fan of Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Airheads, Click, The wedding singer and the Water Boy, I think you'll get a couple of chuckles out of this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well actually, The Ridiculous Six was more of a start of the Do-Over in Sandler's Career.The Do-Over has the same qualities as Ridiculous Six. it's not mind blowing funny but it is amusing to watch when you need something like that.Sandler is not at his prime but he's sniffing around those mid-to- late 90s frat boy outings that made him a movie star. One thing Sandler loves to do is get his friends to be in the movie, so for The Do-over he gets his buddy, David Spade to co-star (the whole while I was waiting for Rob Schneider to come out of the wood work and yell "you can do it!" , but I guess he was too busy working on his own show, which you can stream on Netflix).In a plot similar to another recent release, Central Intelligence (which made it into theaters thanks to the movie star combo of Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson), David Spade plays a man who life got stuck on a runt after high school, and at his Reunion, his best friend in High School sees what's going on and orchestras a plan to fake their deaths and restart their lives with new identities, but discover their new selves lead to fun and fortune as well as danger and murder.The high school reunion scenario seem to work perfect to revive the Sandler's style of Frat boy humor, which still gets a laugh.If you still have a glimmer of hope for Sandler than the Do-Over works.http://cinemagardens.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the negative reviews I thought I was in for a stinker of a movie. Not the case for me. I'm really not sure why folks who don't care for Adam Sandler's brand of humor seem to watch all his movies and can't wait to post a negative review. I thought the movie had many very funny moments. Having said that, I would agree that there is definitely an age bracket element who will be more apt to "get" some of the humor. But that's the same with any movie with regard to time period references. Here's my advice - If you look at Sandler's work as a whole and like the majority of his movies you'll like this. If not probably not. The plot twists are enjoyable as well. On a 5 Star scale I'd go with a solid 3/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Far From the Worst Thing Sandler's Ever Done But It's Not Anywhere Near His Classic Stuff Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler's movies have been dropping in quality pretty steadily over the last few years. It doesn't make me happy to write that but if you can't see that by now, I don't know what to tell you. Even his most dedicated supporters are coming to that realization. I loved a lot of his earlier movies (Happy Gilmore, Anger Management and even You Don't Mess With The Zohan) but it almost seems like he's given up. At least with Pixels he had a cool idea and while I didn't like the movie as a whole, there were parts of it I did enjoy (the video game character action scenes were interesting). I didn't have high hopes for The Do-Over but it did look like he was trying to do something different. After seeing it, I think people are overreacting, it's not as godawful as the critics have said, but calling it good is definitely a stretch.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Our main character is Charlie (David Spade), he's a banker at a bank inside a grocery store. He married the hot girl from high school and she cheats on him constantly. Her two kids from a previous marriage hate his guts and don't treat him with respect. He just wants a fresh start, the ability to try things again with a clean slate. He's at his high school reunion when he bumps into his old high school friend Max (Adam Sandler). Max has turned out okay, he's an FBI agent and after taking Charlie out on his boat, he's obviously not hurting for money. The next day, he wakes up in a hotel room tied to the bed. Max tells him that he needed a fresh start too, he's actually a coroner and he grabbed a couple of dead bodies from the morgue to fake their deaths. Charlie initially disagrees and goes back to watch his funeral where there are no tears shed and then to his house to see his wife cheating on him and then he warms up to the idea. He meets Max who is coincidentally watching his funeral and tells him he's in.With movies I don't generally like, I start out with the positives. One of the reasons the quality of Sandler's movies have suffered is that he doesn't seem to have the same energy he used to. In The Do-Over he at least looks like that he's having fun hanging out with David Spade. Their friendship comes across and it helps the movie. I also thought they had an interesting premise here, the handling of it was another matter but it was interesting. I'll admit that I did laugh a few times during the movie. As opposed to the family friendly Pixels, there was a little more room to push the envelope comedy wise with the R rating and I think that also helped.Now getting to the other side of the coin, while some of the material worked, a lot of it didn't. It wasn't so bad but to me it felt really outdated. There are a lot of homophobic jokes, a lot of sexist jokes and some gross out jokes. I wasn't offended by it, I just found it to be juvenile and unfunny. A lot of this stuff I thought we as the movie going public had moved past by now but if there's an audience that enjoys it, that's cool. It just didn't work for me.When it comes to the acting, don't look for award worthy stuff here. I'll give David Spade credit for being passable. He works well with Sandler and he was okay. Sandler wasn't bad but I feel like I've talked about him enough. The disappointing part was seeing Paula Patton and Kathryn Hahn in this. Paula's an underrated actress (she was great in MI: Ghost Protocol) who is yet to get her big break (maybe it will be Warcraft?) and she just doesn't fit in this movie. I hope more projects come her way though. Katheryn Hahn is a genuinely funny actress but she's not given much to play with here and she can't help the movie. It was nice that Nick Swardson was actually pretty restrained here. He's usually in Sandler's movies to be made fun of but he was toned down considerably.Most of the parts of this movie that are decent come in the start and the middle. By the time you hit the last half hour, the plot becomes a mess and the movie derails. I think if you're a fan of Adam Sandler's recent work, this will be a pleasant surprise. I largely agree with the critical majority though. This movie could be far worse but it's not nearly as good as Adam's classic stuff. If you watch the trailer and think it's crap, don't even attempt to watch The Do-Over, your mind won't be changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More about conspiracy theory than a comedy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is a great actor. However, I have never seen him play in a movie that tries so obviously to send some messages (more ore less interesting).Overall, the movie follows an escalating course of action. Two old school buddies meet at the reunion, and the fun starts.. typical Adam Sandler type of comedy. The story was a bit enforced by a script written by Eric Borke. Don't know the guy, but some ideologies were out of context. Without giving any spoilers, I can say that overall, it is a movie that will start some laughs.Still, killing comedy for conspiracy theory... Adam, I hope you choose a better one (script) next time</fullReview>

Only see this if you are a huge fan of Adam Sandler and his gang. Otherwise, look the other way. Over the top "Sandler humour"... and then some.Is Adam Sandler a genius or is he plain and simple caught in his own naive, juvenile and gross mental institution?Is it that "Sandler Inc." have lost all of his money and now turn to Netflix, as this motion picture is a production from Netflix?This is a odd Sandler movie... I have to give it that. It is like a sloppy detective, TV movie wrapped around with the twisted humour... with such a enormous twist that it flips it over totally; the cure for cancer.I want to see Adam Sandler, David Spade, Steve Zahn, Rob Schneider, Danny Trejo, Nick Swardson and the rest of the gang in a serious movie. Maybe a thriller with a twist of drama. A solid production; because I am convinced that they can act and do something huge. They have that gift... so...use it.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Normal American standard. - The actors : Adam Sandlers gang.... again....and again.... and again. - The story : Kind of fun. - Entertainment : A little. And it is getting too much for too long. - Age : 155,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After quite a few disappointing Adam Sandler movies, I hope this is the start to Sandler getting his groove back. This film was wonderful. David Spade was hysterical and Adam Sandler was excellent as well. A lot of movies today fail to have a hook that will keep you interested, which means even if it winds up being a good film you have to struggle through the first part to enjoy it. Not so with this one. Within three minutes of the start of this picture, I was enjoying Spade and Sandler's chemistry and the funny story. I don't understand why this film is rated low, but this is a great movie and I hope we can expect more to come from Spade and Sandler. They work together as well, in my opinion, as Spade and Chris Farley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High school reunion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Adam Sandler's second film as part of his Netflix deal and he has dusted off another script from the rejected bin.Sandler knows what his fans wants. Songs from the 1980s and 90s. Risqué jokes, sexy ladies and exotic locations.Sandler and David Spade meet up in a High School Reunion. Spade's life is struck in a rut and becomes an unwilling participant where they fake their deaths to get out of their mundane lives and start again. They take the identities and cash from a deposit box of two recently deceased people and go to Puerto Rico to party and have sex with women.The problem is these two people were killed by assassins and when they resurface, Sandler and Spade are chased by an acrobatic hit-man, find out that these two dead people were working on a cure for cancer and people want the formula.There is actually a lot of plot to this film but it never really hangs together too well. The jokes again tend to misfire as well. It really is not a funny film. You get some female nudity because it is a Sandler film so lets get some hot women to show their breasts.The actual humorous scenes are pedestrian, I think they were badly directed and not well written. Sandler coasts through all this although Spade is actually making an effort and he gives the best performance in the movie.I just get a feeling that Sandler has grabbed the Netflix cash, churned out the film and had a great holiday in Puerto Rico.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof Sandler can make great movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure what happened to Adam Sandler recently because his movies when from really funny to painfully bad. Consequently, I clicked on "The Do-Over" with more than a bit of trepidation. Still, it had a decent number of stars and the best part about Netflix is being able to stop watching as you see fit. Well, surprise! surprise! I ended up being very glad I took a chance on this flick.No, this is not the next Citizen Kane, but if you are looking for a feel good comedy, then you owe it to yourself to watch it. I confess that the inclusion of David Spade also was a huge plus for me, but even if you're not a Spade fan, there's a good chance you're going to enjoy "The Do-Over". Yes, there are still of few jokes that rely on juvenile and gross themes for laughs; however, overall this is a delightful movie with a lot of heart. Put another way, it actually has a plot that keeps you engaged, instead of a string of crass jokes with very little story and/or a story that's so dumb you simply cannot get into it, as has been the case with many of Sandler's recent films.Another aspect of this movie you are likely to enjoy is the scenery. It appears they filmed mostly in Puerto Rico and Georgia, the peach state, which made for some nice backdrops. The other thing I enjoyed was the action. The story included a fair amount of gunfire and car chases, so if that's a selling point for you when it comes to movies, you'll have even more to love.Now, I'm not saying this is a family film. While it is uplifting, this is definitely not a movie for the kids. There is a lot of sex and violence, some of which was super R-rated, so if you have kids maybe wait until they're at gram-gram's for the weekend before checking this one out. And if your children ask to see it, unless they are in college, just say no.No Sandler's somewhat sophomoric humor might not be for everyone, but if you aren't one of those people who take everything too seriously and believes only highbrow comedy is worthy of your attention, then this movie will make you laugh out loud.I only hope this movie is a beginning of Sandler's return to form. He obviously has the potential to produce good films and shows when he doesn't go overboard on cheap laughs at the expense of storytelling, so here's hoping he remembers that in the future. Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing more movies like "The Do-Over".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a waste of everyone's time. Go do something else. Take that long time you need to wax or something... Its worth it when compared to this. Has I was trying to watch it and care for it, all I see was 2 old ex Hollywood starts, trying to act like if time had not pass for them. There's not ONE single young boy cast in this movie. And I don't think its a coincidence. A young man would show how old the main actors are. But young women? Of course! Always young, always sexy, always jumping on dicks and always falling for the two old farts "charms". That I have to say are... null. I could not keep on watching this. Moving forward till I got the end was the best decision ever. But even that was cliché! The movie is just has a boring patchwork story, full of sex clichés, cheap vulgar dialog, not funny at all. Sandler wanting to be credible has a big action hero is a joke! Maybe the only part were the public can smug a smile because the result is that ridiculous. All the time Spandler's wig was fixating my attention. Everything bad that has been said about this movie is true and more can always be added. This is brain torture. Save yourself from brain cell damage!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know your comedy is bad when the mediocre plot is better than the actual so-called comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen many of Adam Sandler's recent bombs so I can't really compare this to any of them. But I heard from many reviewers that The Do-Over is a slight return to form for the comedian. If this is a return to form, than his recent comedies must have entire suicide hotlines dedicated to them, because this movie was SO not funny. There was a total count of about two funny moments throughout this entire one-hundred and eight minute film. I didn't know that was physically possible before my viewing of this let-down.Let's start out with our two main stars: David Spade and Adam Sandler. Sandler had literally one funny moment near the end of the movie, and then he ruined it by taking the joke too far. He also basically played himself. The advertising lead us to believe that Sandler took a different route with his character, but he played the same old, gibberish-spouting goofball we are all tired of. However, I honestly thought that he was better than David Spade. David Spade was given the starring role in this film, and he did absolutely nothing with it. I don't know what I expected, but I never expected to never laugh at all when Spade was on the screen. I feel genuinely sorry for some of the completely qualified actors that were dragged into this bore. Paula Patton was yet another female character that was there purely for the guys to screw. Speaking of which, I cannot think of one female in this this movie that was not a sex object. Seriously? They got Luis Guzman to be the most disgustingly written role of the year thus far (at least that I've seen). Even Sean Astin had a small cameo in this film that I was shocked and appalled by. How did they get these people to do this? The only small celebrity role that I thought was moderately funny was Nick Swardson, who also had the only funny ongoing joke of the film.The one thing that I did not completely hate about it was the plot. There was actually a couple of good twists I liked that I didn't see coming. So yes, I just walked out of an Adam Sandler comedy where the plot worked better than the jokes.This has been the most popular movie on Netflix since its release, and I still don't understand why. I also don't understand why all of the top reviews on IMDb are positive. If you want to see a funny film in your spare time, than avoid The Do-Over like the plague. Watch Trainwreck instead.I give The Do-Over 2/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of two men who fake their own death, and take up the identities of two rich men with a mansion in Puerto Rico. Just as their high lives are getting very fun, some serious trouble shows up at the doorstep.The story is a bit disturbing, because of the dishonesty involved in impersonating dead people. In addition, the circumstances leading to the discovery of the dead men are too fishy to be believed. The jokes are at times offensive, and even homophobic. Times have changed, homophobic jokes are not funny anymore. It just makes the film look desperate in trying to make people laugh, and it stops at no length. The film is not funny.

		<fullReview>I found this on Netflix streaming, in spite of its rather low rating and many negative reviews I decided to see for myself. In general I enjoy Adam Sandler movies but this one is so stupid and so dirty that there are very few enjoyable and entertaining parts.Adam Sandler is Max and David Spade is Charlie, they were classmates when young and both reunite at a 30-year class reunion. It seems to come out of nowhere, Max recognizes that Charlie has a boring existence, manager of a bank inside a grocery store, and his wife is taking advantage of him. Max says he is an FBI agent and tells Charlie he needs a change. They take out a nice boat, it blows up, they use it to fake their deaths to assume the identities of dead guys. They even peek in on their own funerals.But Max isn't really an FBI agent, nor is he any of the many ways he describes himself through the movie. He had done a bit of pre-reunion stalking of Charlie to pick out the perfect foil. The two men find out there is money in an offshore account, take it and move into the exotic house of one of the dead men. They draw a lot of attention to themselves.It was a chore to finish it, the misdirection turned out to be related to cancer research and big Pharma was suppressing the "cure" because it would cost them $$ Billions in lost cancer drug sales.I have a saying, "You can't really appreciate the very best movies unless you see a really bad movie from time to time." This was my really bad movie for 2016.</fullReview>

The humour is funny, juvenile, slapstick, and it works. We laughed so many times. The plot has a few twists in it to keep you on your toes. There were a few things we did not expect, so funny!! There is a scene on the boat that was totally unexpected with a flare gun. The scene after David Spade gets his tongue pierced is great. This is the funniest Adam Sandler movie I have seen in ages.

		<fullReview>OK. This is the latest Adam Sandler film. Another one made for Netflix. I watched this on Netflix along with his last two, (The Ridiculous 6, The Cobbler) I thought this one was a little bit better than Ridiculous 6 which i didn't even get to finish. But with The Cobbler it probably stands about the same. This film had a few laughs involved, but all Sandlers latest stuff doesn't have that same Adam Sandler feel anymore. Compared to 50 First Dates, that stood out to me as some of his best work on screen, along with Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer. Sean Astin had a little part in this, who i hadn't seen in an Adam Sandler film since 2005 (Click) he also played Doug in 50 First Dates (2004) for me, most memorable for his portrayal of Sam Wise Gamgee in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy. With Director Steven Brill, director of some other Sandler pictures (Little Nicky, Mr Deeds) It had been 14 Years since he had last worked with Sandler, but they both did a good job with this movie, i don't think this movie gets the rating it should be. It was hugely enjoyable at times, but a little bit predictable, i guessed what was going to happen at the end half way through the movie, but maybe it's because i've seen so many movie. The Do- Over is a film i'd recommend if you just want something short with a slightly rude humour just like all the Sandler movies. But in the end, if you just want a good Sandler movie, i'd recommend 50 First Dates or The Wedding Singer.</fullReview>

Netflix should be proud for producing something that HBO and Network TV will probably never be able to do. A solid winner.

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Ridiculous Six</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Do-Over is Adam Sandler's second film under his four film Netflix deal. The first was the horrendously bad The Ridiculous Six. How does his second go-round fare? A little better. Charlie is a push over. He lives in the same old house, drives the same old car and works at the same old job. His current wife still has flings with her ex-husband and he does nothing about it, instead he supports her financially and takes care of her two brat kids. While at his high-school reunion, he runs into Max, his childhood best friend. Max encourages Charlie to live a little and invites him on his boat for some fun. That boat explodes. Charlie then wakes up to find out Max has faked their deaths to give Charlie a chance to "start-over". The only problem is the two identities they take over have some bad people after them. Steven Brill's other two Sandler flicks are Little Nicky and Mr. Deeds. This might be the best one out of the three, but that bar isn't exactly high. I'm not sure if I'm going easy on this film or not, but it might be Sandler's best comedy film in years. A quick look at his IMDb resume shows his latest efforts: The Ridiculous Six, Pixels, The Cobbler, Blended, Grown Ups 2, That's My Boy, Jack &amp; Jill...it's sad that The Do-Over is better than these movies. One of the reasons why has to be because this film actually has a STORY to it. A Sandler film with an actual PLOT??? WHAAAAAA???????So, as one would guess, Max isn't telling Charlie everything and when those bad people come looking for them, Charlie is thrust into this violent life with no ways of protecting himself. He's a geek, a buffoon and has to grow a set in order to help out Max. This could potentially be the best thing for him. David Spade is Charlie, another Sandler friend from SNL. He isn't his usual crude and shred self, he actually shows some pathos here. As for Sandler, he still seems to be a bit on auto- pilot, but he's doing something different, which is something at least. His character obviously has ulterior motives and you can't really take anything he says at face value, so one of the more enjoyable moments is discovering what that is. So yes, I was a little surprised by how NOT TERRIBLE this film was. That's not saying it's good or anything...it's simply not terrible.Sandler would never give up the opportunity to continue his lavish film location lifestyle as an actor. So like every other film he's been doing, they go to an exotic location here, living in a giant mansion with beautiful women and fast cars. No surprise there. One of those beautiful women is Paula Patton. Unfortunately I don't know if she is phoning it in more than Sandler or not because she is bland. The Do-Over is an action comedy with some surprising story moments that will only be good to you if you expect the worst. I was expecting the worst. I think they should have gone with this film first and completely nix Ridiculous Six. That film is more gags, this one is more story. Story will always trump dumb gags in my opinion. The Do-Over isn't without it's own share of gags though either. Seeing Spade and Luis Guzmán in a threesome with awkward stares was kind of funny. The ball sweat dripping on someone's face later on was a bit gross...to say the least. Had this film come out first, it would have been reviewed worse in my opinion. It's only because of how UTTERLY TERRIBLE Ridiculous Six is, that this film seems to be getting a pass. Look, even I'm doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, but has bad reviews (and the reasoning behind them)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has gotten very bad reviews, despite being good. There is a reasoning behind the bad reviews and that is because it is being rated as an Adam Sandler movie. Adam Sandler movies are supposed to be funny and have the entire plot revolving around trying to be funny. This movie is not just a funny Adam Sandler movie. From trailers you might expect it to be one, but it has a more serious plot and it is a good one. Sandler and Spade go to find the cure for cancer and figure out why the research for it stopped. This movie is rated as an Adam Sandler movie, but comedians can make more serious movies. For example, Jim Carry's The Truman Show was a great dramatic movie. If someone where just to rate The Truman Show on the idea that all Jim Carry movies should be Dumb and Dumber, then it would be considered bad. You cannot consider this just another Adam Sandler movie, but consider it Adam Sandler's The Truman Show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Adam Sandler movies. They are fun and feel good movies just to relax for 90 minutes.They don't want to be more nor less. They deliver that.This was not Sandler's best movie, but it was in the top ranking.Good story, good jokes, good plot twists, nice girls, what else could you ask for?If you are a German crossfitting vegan who vapes, and hates Sandler, just because your Barista at your Starbucks hate it too, then don't watch it!If you like fun movies to relax, then it's absolutely for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a return to form for Sandler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quality of Adam Sandler films has steadily declined since his early days where his comedic style was a box office draw and his name was associated to a good film (Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer). I've always liked his films, as silly as some can be and so when a new Adam Sandler film is released I will watch it - knowing that it may not be good.Whilst The Ridiculous 6 was nowhere near classic Sandler, it was entertaining enough to watch whilst being borderline silly. Going into the 2nd film of his Netflix deal I had high hopes after reading the reviews here saying that Adam Sandler was back to form. Whilst I agree this performance was a little more restrained/serious the film was let down by poor direction and shoddy production values. I know Netflix aren't a major studio but you really get the sense of watching something limited. The line delivery of the comedy didn't quite hit home with most gags falling flat. Lack of cohesion to setting up scenes and characters by the director did not help and after 30 minutes I had decided that watching the remainder of the film would be a waste of time. I suppose Adam Sandler made the right move because I really can't see this or his previous film doing well theatrically. Netflix made a bad investment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This felt like more a movie Adam Sandler got a little bit more serious about. Him and David Spade stay in character and don't try to be silly for no reason. I like the story line although Paula Patton is a terrible actor but she is cute so they will give her roles. The only thing I could find wrong was I wanted to hear more jokes. I think Sandler held back a little in that are but overall a fun movie to watch.Not his best film by far by for sure better than the last 4 he made. You should enjoy this movie if you don't expect too much. Adam's movie are really never drop dead funny but he somehow amazes every now and then. David is really a champ for still be able to hold the big screen at his age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler is back...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting no less than a typical B-movie, Starring Sandler.I was pleasantly surprised when the credits hit the screen. The movie had it all, lots of fun moments, enough action to keep you near the screen and the classic Sandler charm.The plot was well-written and the structure of the plot really surprised me with it "hiding" the real plot till the last 10 minutes of the movie. I would have given this a 8/10, but David Spade is simply not in the same class as Sandler in this movie. David was really fun in "Grown Ups", but seems to have dropped in level (Grown Ups 2), and this is not exception.If Adam Sandler and David Spade wasn't a 'package deal' and Adam got another co-star for this movie it could have been really really close to perfect for a Comedy.Thanks for the movie, hopes Netflix will support more of these movies, and nice job Adam Sandler in stepping up your game !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ridiculous Six" was better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to watch this new Netflix orig. movie a few nights ago, the second of a 4-picture deal Adam Sandler has made w/ the streaming service network, after last year's "Ridiculous Six". This reunites SNL alums, David Spade as a horribly-treated-by-life old friend of Sandler's CIA character, who decides to fake their own deaths so they can start their pathetic lives over. Hmmm.... like who HASN'T thought of doing that-??!! LOL Well, one thing leads to another, and we realize the whole thing has more to do w/ Sandler's character. I dunno, I liked this movie to a degree, and even thought the *POSSIBLE SPOILER* movie's twist near the end added a touch of extra class than you would usually find in a typical Adam Sandler comedy, just thought this movie could've used a few more good laughs. It's not bad per your usual theatrical Sandler comedy, and if you typically like his work, you'll probably like this. I just hope his next couple films in the 4- picture deal are better, and I would say of the first two, "Ridiculous Six" was the more enjoyable...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexist nonsense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Do Over' is Adam Sandlers latest film for Netflix following the incredibly bad 'Ridiculous 6'. This time Sandler has cast himself as a cool action star constantly saving David Spade from anything and everything. Spade plays a bank manager who desperately wants to change his horribly mediocre life and start anew. Sandler grants this wish by faking their deaths and taking on new identities. At first glance this is actually not a bad idea. It far surpasses any set up that Sandler has had in a movie for quite some time. Not to mention that this is his first R rated comedy in quite some time. So, there was a tiny shred of hope for me going into this film. However that shred was dashed very quickly. As I said, the first ten to twenty minutes aren't terrible. It's the following hour and a half where Sandlers trademark laziness hits with full force. Every new film he cranks out leaves me with a terribly bitter taste in my mouth, and it's not only because they are awful but because they all are wasted opportunities. 'Pixels' was actually a pretty original idea and it wasted. Same goes for 'Ridiculous 6'. And as I watched this film the same is clear here. There are countless scenes where you could tell that you should care about what is happening but you don't. This mainly stems from the truly atrocious storytelling at play.The film is held together but the films overall through line but it falls apart from scene to scene. Everything always works out for no reason. For some reason Spade can tell exactly what kind of bank a certain key goes too. And although Sandlers character was set up as a coward that hides it well he suddenly has access to weapons and uses them with lethal accuracy.Where did these guns come from and how is he so great at using them? Your guess is as good as mine. All the while Sandler and spade could not look more bored. The only times that they truly seem to care about what is going on is when they are allowed to say crude and over the top stupid things. &#x200b; Other than that their performances come down to them being super sexist and bored. Seriously, every women on screen is only used as a sex symbol. An object to be used or taken advantage of. It puts on display this subtle Sandlerism in the worst way possible. Most of his films have a hint of sexism but this one shows the true depth of it.When the majority of your jokes revolve around this how good can you really expect your film to be? There is just nothing funny here at all. If they leads aren't being super sexist then they are being crude for the sake of being crude. There is no real jokes here at all, they shove hot dogs in each others face and laugh or fart and laugh. Each joke that is given to us is the punch line without any set up. And we all know that jokes are really only funny with a great set up. But the film can fall back on it's visual humor right? If there was any, maybe. But it doesn't even try. That is why this, like many of other Sandler movies, fails. It's so incredibly lazy in every thing that it does. Nothing makes sense, the pacing is all over the place, it's humor is terrible, and the result is yet another crapped out piece of garbage. But honestly, was anyone really surprised?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to exploit promising premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Do-Over" takes a promising premise and subverts it with an overly complicated plot and nonlinear timeline. Several of the characters aren't what they initially claim to be. This trope is overused to the point of tedium. The protagonist should be a very sympathetic character, but pretends to be so unsympathetic and driven by shady motives that it is difficult to identify with him or to empathize. The sidekick is a cuckolded milquetoast underachiever, so it is also difficult to care about him either. When the actual identities of the characters are revealed we realize the characters we've disliked for behaving like jerks are the ones we should have rooted for and the ones we liked are villains. Concurrently, we meet several characters cast against type, compounding our confusion and uncertain allegiances. Movies are about people who must overcome extraordinary challenges. One of the basic elements that determines the plot is whether or not the character has the requisite skills. In "Commando," Schwarzenegger's John Matrix already possesses all the skills he needs, as demonstrated at the climax, when he confronts the most difficult challenge alone and unarmed. In "The Karate Kid," the protagonist has none of the requisite skills and much of the film is about acquiring those skills. Another basic element is whether the hero is thrust into the situation ("U Turn," "Cast Away") or sets out looking for trouble ("Batman Begins"). "The Do-Over" plays fast and easy with these and other structural elements. At one point, Sandler's Max claims to be a character who might have the necessary skills, but later we learn he didn't have the training or skills to do the things he did. In the final confrontation, the battle is fought by other characters while Max stands by as an observer. (The scene is visually satisfying, but structurally disappointing.) The moment when all seems lost occurs after the final confrontation, not before. The structure of the movie is chaotic, which weakens the emotional response. The promising premise is not developed as well as might have been hoped. The plot stretches credulity way beyond limits, even for a comedy. A corporation is willing to hire a remorseless assassin to engage in what might loosely be termed unfair competition in restraint of trade concerning human drug trials that seem to have occurred without any prior tests on animals or FDA oversight. A small team accomplished incredible results in a brief period that much larger companies couldn't match. Characters have information one wouldn't expect them to posses, but lack information they should have. The obligatory Sandler excursion to an exotic location doesn't make much sense. The film offers some wacky and unusual characters, exotic locations, a few exotic vehicles and above average production values. It has some genuinely funny moments, but the laughs are not frequent or as big enough to make the film consistently enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a word to describe this comedy, and funny probably isn't it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time, maybe recounting back to the early and mid 2000s, when Adam Sandler comedies were some of the best Hollywood had to offer. Every since then, his filmography seems to have gone down hard, bumpy road of lackluster comedies, most notably 'Jack and Jill' which is considered by many his all time biggest atrocity. Though ever once a while, he manages to spit out a moderately watchable movie, most of his attempts on bringing laughter fall short of success. In this second Netflix original following last year's spiritless western comedy 'Ridiculous 6', Sandler pairs up with David Spade for first time since their outing with 'Grown Ups' and its sequel. Directed by Steven Brill, David Spade plays Charlie, an unlucky fellow living and unfair with his unfaithful wife Nikki (played by Natasha Leggero) who is secretly cheating on him with her ex and his two stepsons who constantly treat him like garbage. The only friend he has in life is his childhood best friend Max (played by Adam Sandler) who isn't living a much fun life either. While bonding together on a boating trip, Max blows up the boat leaving their family and friends to assume to their deaths. Except there is one thing, their deaths are fake. They escape to Puerto Rico to start a new luxurious with new identities. The two only find themselves in deep trouble however, when they learn they've stolen the identities from two assassins lead by man known as the Gymnast (played by Torsten Vorges) who is now set to kill them.Adam Sandler and David Spade have the potential on making a smart comedic duo, but they never seem to have their A-game here. Instead, they stroll for 108 minutes in a comedic ghost town where laughs are scarce and most of humor is just flat out dumb whether it revolves around sex or jokes on female body parts. As this in an action comedy, we are supposed to experience a balance of smart humor and good action. Unfortunately, not only is there a severe shortage of laughs, but the action scenes aren't even fun. There a few car chasing scenes along with some gunfights and fistfights, none of them are particularly exciting or funny. This film goes on close to two hours and very rarely spits out a good joke or anything close to funny, and it gets to the point where it drowns the viewers into total boredom. If you take all the funny bits and composite them into a little video, you are probably looking at no more than two minutes; everything else is just a long stretch of tedious comedy and lazy writing. Adam Sandler maintains his same not-so-smart character vibe similar to all the characters he portrays in his movies. David Spade on the other hand, seems hopelessly confused and suffers in series of botched humor and dialogue that never seems it land. It is just genuinely sad that this film boasts a somewhat plot (though flawed) storyline and fails to come up with good laughter and soul to support it. The Do-Over serves as just another comedic misfire by Adam Sandler and his fellow co- star David Spade. The movie is ultimately forgettable and does very little, if any to satisfy. If you happen to be someone who is very amused easily, then this one just might be worth a shot. Otherwise, it sends a strong signal for Adam Sandler to change gears. It is generally hard to say whether Adam Sandler enjoys playing dumb characters or is just constantly falling victim to poorly written comedies.</fullReview>

Adam does a good job of staying in character....never going over the top, and Spade is totally believable as his high school chum. No spoilers here. Well done, mindless fun and action. Congrats to Sandler and Spade, would like to see them together again in another fun spoof. Good time nice mindless movie to chill with, and sit back and laugh. No belly laughs, just a good rollicking fun movie. I am very happy that David Spade is given a good character, he needed this. Sandler plays rough/ straight guy very well and never goes over the top. This movie has shown the two can actually ACT and Stretch. Now lets hope the get better and better movie offers! Good job from Netflix. Perfect home viewing movie.Thanks Spade and Sandler and writers for a good fun Net-Flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It actually made me laugh, I love David Spade and Sandler together. The movies story was actually decent as well and loaded with laughs. This movie is easily better than half of Adam's films, this is a turn around for him. Just about every scene had some dirty humor to it. 8/10 better than most Sandler movies. David Spades character, in the beginning, was frustrating but then it paid off as he develops. The story was a bit hard to follow, especially if you weren't listening. The story actually has some truth behind it... The cure for cancer has been developed but large corporations hide it. Casting Spade as Charlie turns out to be the movie's boldest, strangest gambit: It actually represents a stretch for him as an actor, as quiet, unassuming, sad-sack Charlie issues not a single sarcastic dismissal for the film's entire running time. The break in smarm is welcome, but it might simply be the logical endgame to Spade's late-period film appearance The story is about making up for lost time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Real With Your Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think there is a need for a reality check to be a part of consideration when selecting a movie to watch. Adam Sandler has varying levels of comedy content - my opinion of course. There is the obvious- some movies are funnier than others...but let's just be real, everyone's opinion differs. I go into his movies by level of crudeness, sexual crass and extremity as to whether or not I may enjoy it. I have a relatively dry sense of humor and find humor in areas that are not so funny to a more conservative person. If you don't go into an Adam Sandler movie expecting a little over the top I think you're just unrealistic in your expectations as I feel the idea he has is to entertain thus, not always realistic. If I want realistic I will watch real life or a movie based on one. When I watch Adam Sandler I don't cross reference facts. With that being said - this one had a few more moments of vileness than I preferred but I actually thought there was good chemistry between him and David Spade- someone I think who does the same type of comedy. Paula Patton isn't the greatest actress but something about her is enjoyable to watch and I think comedies are where she does best. Everyone else was fun to watch-even in the parts that grossed me out. I even laughed in those parts and enjoyed the story line. It was different and entertaining. Could have done with a little more of some of the scenes to be left to my imagination but still thought it was a pretty good movie for everything that seems to be required content for any movie now a days. An 8 simply cause my personal taste required a few more head turns away than normal LOL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been long since Adam Sandler &amp; David Spade made a fun film. Though they have teamed up before, their films, sadly, have not been up-to the mark. 'The Do-Over', however, is their latest &amp; most entertaining film in a long time. Its fun, as this action-comedy actually offers a story, that has some merit. 'The Do-Over' Synopsis: Two down-on-their-luck guys decide to fake their own deaths and start over with new identities, only to find the people they're pretending to be are in even deeper trouble.'The Do-Over' is time-pass entertainment. Sure, there are some ridiculous jokes here, even gross to be honest. But, on the plus side, the narrative holds for the most part. The leading characters are fun to watch &amp; one particular twist towards the end, actually works.Kevin Barnett &amp; Chris Pappas's Screenplay (notwithstanding some really bad jokes), is well-done otherwise. Steven Brill's Direction is passable.Performance-Wise: Sandler &amp; Spade work superbly here. Both of the underrated actors are in form, complementing each other throughout, even when the Writing lets them down. Paula Patton is terrific &amp; oozes sex-appeal. Kathryn Hahn is first-rate in a brief role. Nick Swardson &amp; Michael Chiklis are as usual.On the whole, 'The Do-Over' isn't solid, but what it is, is a fun, breezy watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the project Sandler needs to revive his career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think IMDb allows or encourages single word reviews, but a big, resounding 'no' is what I have to say about this film. No, it's not very good and no, it's not going to revive the career of Adam Sandler. It's a shame, as I have enjoyed several of Sandler's films and even gave a favorable review to his recent odd film, "The Cobbler". But unfortunately, again and again, "The Do-Over" simply is disappointing.The story idea isn't bad and could have worked. When two high school friends meet at a reunion, one of them hatches up a plan without telling his old friend....he's planning on faking their deaths and assuming the lives to two other guys. Who are these other guys and what sort of lives did these dead men lead? Max (Sandler) isn't sure but he knows it's gotta be better than their current lives...though Charlie (David Spade) isn't so sure. What follows is a film very much like a re-working of a very funny film, "Date Night"...as the two idiots nearly get killed again and again because apparently the dead guys they are impersonating were dead because many people wanted them dead...permanently.So why doesn't this film work out? Much of it is the writing. Again and again, the dialog and jokes seem to follow the mantra "when in doubt, go for the cheap, crude laugh. Additionally, the film isn't all that satisfying because it's also an action flick...and neither Sandler nor Spade seem suited for such roles. I could say more but the bottom line is that by the time the film ended, I'd long lost interest in the picture and I would assume this would be the case with most viewers. If you still are interested, this direct to Netflix picture is available now through their streaming service.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair return for Sandler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Do-Over is directed by Steven Brill and stars Adam Sandler, David Spade, Paula Patton and Kathryn Hahn. Two down-on-their-luck guys decide to fake their own deaths and start over with new identities, only to find the people they're pretending to be are in even deeper trouble.The second movie in the Sandler/Netflix deal has been released and it's a huge improvement on the last feature 'The Ridiculous 6'. It's also being named by many as "Sandler's come-back," which I certainly agree with. Since Grown Ups in 2010, most of his work has been lacking in comedy and exaggerated in childish situations. Now Sandler has landed himself a more thought-through story and working alongside David Spade once again, has aided his on-screen persona. There's a lot of great chemistry throughout, as you'd expect from this duo. I found them both very funny in Grown Ups (2010) and it seems that this bond has stuck since the last time they worked together. The story takes on a pretty serious topic which develops around 40-50 minutes into the movie, bringing in that heartfelt feeling we always got in the classic Sandler movies from years ago; Big Daddy, Click and Funny People, to name a few. This is another reason the movie surpasses the previous 6 years of disappointing work. Sure, there are a few moments that seem forced but they're shadowed by the scenes that are grossly hilarious. It's a nice balance. Now although it had me laughing, there were some sections where I wished it was more fun and playful in the scenario they're in, which is what I was expecting from the trailer. But even still, it was a great effort and I'm able to say I'm genuinely looking forward to the next instalment in this Netflix movie deal.The cinematography was also pretty supportive of the screenplay. There's a few scenes that I found had beautiful backdrops that really had a hand in my overall enjoyment of the movie. That said, Sandler has always been skilled at knowing how to pack up everything, call up his buddies and head out on holiday to make a feature with fun visuals, so it's no major surprise. My verdict; The Do-Over gives us the fair return of Adam Sandler and his fun, gross comedy that felt very absent these past few years. This is definitely worth the watch if you have the time and want to give Sandler a fighting chance. Who knows, he might just surprise you. (Now available to stream on Netflix)The Do-Over, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie that was expecting to be as bad or even worst than the ridiculous 6 that came out in February I was highly surprised on how good this movie actually was. the movie is about Adam Sanlder and David spade that fake their death due to the life's being awful, but there's a twist the they change there identity to people that have died but unfortunately for them they are the most FBI wanted in America David spade doesn't know why yet but Sandler secretly does, so they are hunted down by serial killer because they want the secret formal the movie plays thriller, comedy and drama all in to 1 and is simply brilliant while doing it. They get away from serial killers lucky to find the dead guys wife (forgot names sorry) so they find her and at first she seems nice but later we find the full truth. David spade finds that Adam Sandler has cancer and there is a secret formal that will save him, but the serial killer guys want the formal and they will destroy it because it won't get them enough money. This is were we find that the dead guys wife is evil and she's working for them. I don't want to spoil the ending fully, this is my first review so sorry if it's not to good, I would highly recommend this movie as it's free on Netflix 9/10 one of the best Adam Sanlder movies ever!!</fullReview>

I enjoy most Happy Maddison movies pre- 2005, and after the Ridiculous Six, I honestly thought I'd turn this off after 30 mins and watch Will and Grace reruns. Anyway the first 50 minutes I didn't even Crack a smile (except for David Spades 3 way scene). But I got a few laughs throughout the movie. Like I said typical Adam Sandler. Very predictable but it was fun. Plus it was free. This movie will get trashed by critics and people who hate Adam Sandler, but I think it's once of those comedies you can just turn off your brain and watch and play on facebook at the same time without missing much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You would not expect this from an Adam Sandler movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is actually OK. For an Adam Sandler movie, you could even say it's good. It's also nice that he doesn't push his antics as much, he's just too old for that now.But, the main problem of this movie is that it's neither fun or very funny. Even though it's not your regular Adam Sandler comedy, it is a comedy, so fun &amp; funny is important, and it's just not there. The main twist in the story, Paula Patton turning evil, could be seen a mile away and, while she did a great job of playing an evil beautiful woman pretending to be nice, she did a rather poor job of playing an evil beautiful woman not pretending any more.The movie has its moments and is easy to watch (Catherine Bell looks amazing for her age), you do get somewhat involved with the story and want to see it through. So, if you're up for a light comedy with a decent story, it's OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Do-over is the second film in Adam Sandler's deal with Netflix and to set things straight it is miles better than than ridiculous six. However thats not saying much in the quality of the film. The film attempts to do many things at once. At times it's an action movie and at others it's a over the top raunchy comedy. This along with the jumbled confusing plot makes the film very confusing and hard to watch. Not to mention the forced chemistry between the two leads. If there is one bright side its that the film is watchable. There is nothing to remember from the Do-over but there is nothing to make you cringe either. 5/10 OK. i would rate it R:Pervasive Language,Some Strong Sexual Content including brief Graphic Nudity,violence and some drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Adam, David &amp; Paula all did a great job. I honestly might not have made it through this movie but the biggest thing that keep me watching was Paula Patton's amazing cleavage she looks great in all the scenes in this movie. She even has a girl fight that is pretty well done and was great to watch I just hope she didn't get hurt making it. Every now and then there is a few funny things in this movie with Adam and David. I think what I thought was the funniest part of this movie was when Adam is always handing David a joint and when David offers it back to him he refuses to smoke it because he doesn't want to get in trouble. There is also scene in the boat with a few nice pairs of breasts shown but they are pretty far away and just shown for a moment. Cons: I think this movie could have been done better it seems to have some things that just don't fit into the movie. The jokes seemed to be a bit missing and instead of jokes there was just overdone things like dead nude male images or sweaty balls and old ladies tits or bones coming out of peoples arms and gross torture stuff Honestly this movie should have been pg-13 and just not had that stupid stuff those things were not funny and I think most people would agree with me about that. It has more of a "B" movie feel to it then most of Adam Sandlers older movies that were mostly jokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: Not funny, not logical, not physically possible, no charismatic characters. Story: bank manager has shitty life. Old friend meets him in reunion, takes him to a fun trip, kidnaps him and informs him that he stole the identity of two people so they both can start their lives fresh. Bank manager is first against it, then changes mind. The assassins that killed the dead people are now after the 2 protagonists. The protagonists look for clues about the dead guys, meet the wife of one of them, and a biker who was the lover of the other. The dead guys were finding a cure for cancer, got out of money, and then started robbing banks and became one of America's most wanted. Seriously, that movie was so boring and not funny, that it's getting hard to even end this review. I hope you got the gist of the implausibility and level of cliché.</fullReview>
