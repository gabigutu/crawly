		<shortDescription>Depp is Great...Movie Itself? Not So Much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass serves as a nice redemption for the floundering career of Johnny Depp, who has leaned more on quirky voices and loud makeup than his actual skills in recent years. His portrayal of mob boss Whitey Bulger is a powerhouse performance and easily his best since he first introduced the world to Jack Sparrow. It's too bad the movie as a whole doesn't fair quite as well. Despite a great cast and some interestingly insane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most infamous criminals feels more like small claims court. Director Cooper focuses his narrative on Bulger's less-than-legal partnership with the FBI. It's a fascinatingly close-knit community we witness (agents, felons, politicians, and families alike) in which loyalty and corruption go hand-in-hand. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's-feel gangster film that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of better films. Therein lies its big problem: What is Black Mass offering that hasn't already been perfected in other gangster films? Unfortunately, instead of a true movie-making vision, it's like a guy watched every crime drama from the last 40 years and just spit out a less-interesting copycat. Not that a counterfeit of something great can't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the performances from the top-notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb as his, all of whom nail the oft-parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb. But with too many side plots to juggle, not enough cohesion to the storytelling, and an unfortunate lack of auteur vision, Black Mass just can't stand against the great American crime films of yore (Chinatown, Godfather, Goodfellas).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass is a decent film, but it could have been great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass: A Near Miss'Black Mass' is another is a line of crime dramas set in Boston. The film will inevitable be compared to 'The Departed.' And it falls short in the comparison. The acting is top rate, and Depp is much better, not as hammy, than the comic portrait of a crime boss by Nicholson in 'The Departed.' Depp is genuinely threatening in the film and the make-up job given him in the film adds to the fright. 'Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in its favor. In fact, the overall look of the film is exquisite. That, and the acting, are the two best things in the film. However, the movie is both too much and not enough. 'Black Mass' tries to cover too much and thus it lacks focus. This is where 'The Departed' succeeds. While 'The Departed' has many layers and character, it has a focus: the Southie, Billy. 'Black Mass' doesn't have a main theme, a main character, a main protagonist or antagonist. There are a bunch of characters in tense situations with some irony and symbolism. However, in the end, there is nothing to hold onto, no lessons, no emotions, love or hate, for any characters. As I was watching, both my film buddy and I thought the same thing: Scorsese could have made this story work with his writing and directing. We also thought that in an era of long- form television that it could have made a great 10-20 episode show. Then it could have gone into depth about the childhood relationships between crime boss Bulger, his FBI friend Connolly and Whitey's brother, State Senator Billy Bulger. As miniseries, it could have more deeply explored the racial tensions between the Irish and Italians with the African Americans stuck in the middle. It could have taken a deeper look into Boston politics and corruption, police corruption, and more. The miniseries could have also gone further into the Irish American funding of the IRA. As it was, it touched on each of those issues in an unsatisfactory fashion. If the film had taken a deeper look into any ONE of those themes, it would have made for a better movie. Rating: MatinéeFor the great look and outstanding acting, I suggest you see it on the big screen. Otherwise, wait for the miniseries. Hey, a man can dream. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like slow, plodding movies full of unlikeable characters, by all means gear up for this sleep inducing film. Goodfellas is an action movie compared to Black Mass.There are a few good qualities here: top shelf production, excellent acting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices - leading to predictable consequences.But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters are worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer any true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea.But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason to sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The scumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a law enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best (including Benedict, who for all his talent, brings nothing of note to an already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture what-so-ever, and often these fat, out of shape gangsters look absurd in their early 80's sunglasses and attire. There will be no awards given for costuming or make-up here. True Depp is transformed with prosthetics, but as a friend and I joked - his character is far exceeded by the likes of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.If you've seen the trailer, you've been robbed of one of the films three or four memorable moments. Interestingly, all of these good scenes are just spice to the meat of the film. This is not a good thing! When the main arc is dull, the violence (while realistic) lacks stylistic punctuation, and the constant voice overs are delivered with apathy... one wonders what the hell the director was thinking!Waste of time, even for fans of actors involved.my score? a disappointingly average 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I swear to God I really really wanted to like this movie. I am kind of a fan of Bulger's for some sick reason and I felt like Johnny Depp was appropriately menacing and weird looking and did a good job with making the Violence believable. What failed was the writing. There is never really any attention paid to why Whitey was Whitey or how he got to be Whitey or why he wanted to be Whitey. His kid is dead his marriage ruined and he is just accumulating money to accumulate money? Why? He apparently has no vices to speak of except giving money to con men from the IRA. The whole thing just makes no sense. The whole thing just seemed apathetic.It could have been a real classic but they fornicated with the puppy yet again. It was just Depp looking weird and enjoying a WHitey Halloween costume while he strangled hookers and killed informants. Thanks Hollywood. I suspect you can blame the producers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Black Mass" is all but Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I try not to get my hopes up too much for certain movies, and "Black Mass" (which I got very excited about) just reminds me why.Oh, Scott Cooper... how did you manage to make one of the most twisted, unusual, and mysterious gangster stories into an emotionless web of a film? From acting to editing, there was so much wrong that it's almost surprising.My main issue was the nonexistence of a certain necessity: stakes. In all great mafia flicks, stakes are essential. Would "Goodfellas" have been as remarkable if it didn't feel like any wrong move would set off a universe-ending set of events? Would the "Godfather" have been considered the greatest film of all time if a war wasn't seconds away from breaking out? "Black Mass" managed to keep a story that easily could've had those steaks from having any at all. This was, of course, caused by the emotionless acting, but more on that in a second. But this film really made me not care if the protagonist (whether you consider that to be Bulger or Connolly) lives or dies; and in a mob movie, that is a worse crime than anything committed on screen.So the acting I blame entirely on Cooper. Every single actor did a great job with what they were given, but the problem is that they were given the wrong thing. For example, Depp was probably told to play a silent yet psychotic, friendly yet intimidating crime lord. Did he do that well? Absolutely. Is that who the character was written as? Not at all. Same goes for Joel Edgerton's - who I thought did the best job out of all of the actors - character, Jesse Plemons' character, and even smaller characters like Adam Scott's. All those actors did well, but not in the right parts.The list goes on with issues, so let's talk about why the movie got 2 stars rather than zero (therefore, let's talk about the positives). I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film. Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder. Also, I thought the shooting locations were very well chosen, as they really captured the narrow-mindedness of the lead characters' lives.So should you see this movie? -If you love mafia movies of any shape or size, then go see it. -If you love Johnny Depp, wait until it comes out on demand. -If you don't love mafia movies, haven't seen many mafia movies, or just have none of the listed qualities above, then don't see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Not Quite Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a crime drama movie revolving around the true events behind the Winter Hill Gang and the gang's leader Whitey Bulger played by Johnny Depp. The premise for the film was very interesting as it played on Whitey Bulger's connections as his brother, William Bulger, played by Benedict Cummberbatch is a Massachusetts State Senator while one of his childhood friends John Connolly played by Joel Edgerton is an FBI agent. This an amazing premise however it was not fully executed as it focused mainly on Joel Edgerton's character and Cummberbatch's character felt out of place at times. This may have been a more realistic approach however I felt like they could have utilized Cummberbatch's character more in the film as it would have added two assets for Whitey. The Film is divided in three parts overlooking Whitey's almost twenty year reign. However because of this approach it leaves viewers wondering what happened in that time frame and feels as if it was forced to make the movie feel more like the actually events, so spread out. The cinematography and direction of the film is very crisp and sleek which makes the film a lot more enjoyable. The acting all together throughout the film is superb as it holds a stellar cast. I found Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton,Kevin Bacon and Benedict Cummberbatch to be all great. Depp's performance was electrifying and he should get an Oscar nod but I would not be surprised if he does not get one.Overall decent film7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comprised of spectacular performances, Johnny Depp and Co. carry this run-of-the-mill B list Mob movie to relevance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Encompassed with episodic rhythm and an awfully conventional format, Scott Cooper mutates a story of rich soil capable of greatness to a detaching and routine crime film. Black Mass grasps only on the superficial layer as it focuses solely on documented events of the crime they organized. Due to this, the movie suffers as it seems to be merely a biography- laying out these horrific events in these specified timeframes but not putting any focus on the characters that performed it. All action, but none of the story that happens between that allows the audience to view who they are and what they're like. Black Mass fails to delve deeper into the roots, and this of course limits the scope of all the actors. Great mob cinematography such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos- all of these were so great because they allowed the audience to see what the characters were like when they weren't shooting, beating, or plotting against people.That being said, in their limited boxes boy do these actors put on a show. Led by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, the audience can tell straight from the start that this cast reveled and lived their roles. With the amount of overwhelming, heinous events; the film had to have someone cold-hearted and sleazy, and woah did these actors become the epitome of that. However, due to this heavily limited character, the only "rise" the audience feels are from the bone-chilling actions that these men did. Black Mass fails to captivate. And when the closing credits roll a feeling of disappointment washes over you, as it feels like you just watched an episode on the ID channel with really, really good actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, uninspired crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to inform others about how awful this film was. And I want to prefice this by saying I love crime films and have seen the greats such as Goodfellas, the Godfather, and The Departed but this was just drivel. Let's start with the acting: Johnny Depp plays Boston crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger and reveals virtually nothing about the character he plays aside from the violent actions he portrays. The supporting cast does nothing to make this a compelling story either with the exception of Joel Edgerton's John Connolly as a street-wise kid turned FBI agent loyal to Bulger's cause. The pacing and dialogue are also the biggest culprits here. The film develops slowly leaving the watcher wondering if it will ever pick up to an emotional crescendo with only to find out the ride is as monotonous as your daily drive. Moreover, the dialogue feels like students taking turns reading out of a textbook. I know that the film is a biographic one but there's no need to have it feel as though you're reading a Wikipedia article. Likewise, the musical score tries to underpin the uneasy feel of the movie but only works to put the viewer to sleep with its two tone rise and fall. None of the cinematography and shots of the scenes work to create anything worth capturing attention. There are shots of Southie that do convey the bleak outlook of Bulger's turf but they are few and far between as the film mostly focuses on the boring and uninspired dialogue and setting the actors are captured in such as living rooms, offices, dark bars, and car interiors. If I was to summarize watching this film with an analogy I would describe it as eating and tasting a cardboard box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie with a bunch of my college friends (we are all in college). They all loved it. And I will say that Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton were fantastic in this movie, however, the movie lacked the qualities of a great mob movie. I have always been fascinated by the mob genre. I have watched the sopranos, goodfellas, donnie brasco, the godfather, and basically all mob movies under the sun. I feel like Johnny Depp and Edgerton are great at portraying their characters, but I feel like no other character was developed at all. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the great actors of today, but Cooper just wasted his talents on a weak supporting role.I was also looking forward to see the inner workings of how Whitey Bulger came to power. I understand that he was a silent, cold-blooded mobster that used the FBI to become to be one of the most influential criminals in Boston. However, other then a few choking scenes and murder scenes, I would have liked Cooper to show more of the specifics of Bulger's rise to power. Also, we rarely see Bulger interacting in the everyday mob-life, but we always see how he handles unique, problematic situations all-the time. I would have liked to have seen one normal day in Whitey Bulger's life given the movie was only was 2 hours long. Overall, a decent movie with great acting by Depp and Edgerton, but lacking on some of the finer details of a classic mob movie. P.S. I could not take Ben Wyatt serious in that mustache.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and Gentleman, The Academy Award for Best Male Actor goes to.........JOHNNY DEPP!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The icy blue eyes of notorious Boston crime boss James "Whitey" Bulger stare out from the screen in Scott Cooper's "Black Mass" like the gaze of some confident jungle predator calmly lying in wait, holding his ground until the moment he moves in for the kill. And that same coolly calculated composure extends to every aspect of how the actor playing Bulger embodies the role, or rather disappears into it. But if Johnny Depp's mesmerizing performance ? a bracing return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires ? is the chief selling point of "Black Mass," there is much else to recommend this sober, sprawling, deeply engrossing evocation of Bulger's South Boston fiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly, played with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton. Something of an anti-"The Departed" (which was partly inspired by the Bulger case), the movie has an intentionally muted, '70s-style look and feel that may limit its appeal to the date-night multiplex crowd, but quality- starved adult moviegoers should flock to one of the fall's first serious, awards-caliber attractions. Not only that but Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays as a Senator and as Whitey's brother) has given a stellar performance. He is truly a talented person who gives his all in every film/show he acts.BOTTOM LINE: Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar, if not then at least a nomination. Truly worth watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only time I ever recall of being terrified of Johnny Depp as a character was in Sweeney Todd and I never thought he could top that performance. But I stand corrected, his performance as Whitey Bulger is not only terrifying as hell but one of the best performances Depp has ever pulled off! This is the type of the film that makes you want more and more after each scene is done all the way towards the end, and the supporting characters really help Black Mass reach its full potential of hitting the right spots for a moviegoer. Scott Cooper did an amazing job in this biopic he also she be up for best director, Joel Edgerton steals the spotlight in some scenes and bloody nails it in all the screen time he gets. This film also has a nice funny side to it as well which really makes you laugh then BAM all seriousness. By far probably the best film I have seen this year!Deserves more than 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, horrible execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it was my own fault for expecting "Black Mass" to be a classic gangster flick when I walked into the theater; setting my own expectations too high and ultimately having the bar being lowered so much that I could hardly even remember where the bar had initially even BEEN by the end of it. When the ending credits started to roll at the almost two-hour mark that the movie lasted, I internally shook my head and wondered if suggesting it to my father and brother as an idea for something to do that Sunday was a mistake. It almost felt like a funeral procession when everyone left that room, wanting to get home and forget about the sorrowful thing they'd just been involved in. A few people commented to each other about the facts of James "Whitey" Bulger that they knew before going in, but other than that, it was nearly dead silent. Shouldn't viewers walk out of a theater smiling and making remarks about their favorite parts or lines of it to others around them instead of looking like they'd just been to a cemetery to put a deceased loved one to rest?I might as well start with my biggest complaint: the music. No matter how bad of a movie I've ever seen, I could at least say that the soundtrack to it was decent enough and could stand alone as something worth listening to. "Black Mass" wins the record of being the first and so far only movie on my list of films that were ruined by a horrible soundtrack. I've never heard of Tom Holkenberg before, but whoever he is, I would suggest him for overly-serious dramas or perhaps even daytime TV shows instead of crime movies. In almost every other scene, there was dark, ominous orchestral/electronic score that popped up either before or immediately after a murder or (what was at least supposed to be before it was soiled) interesting scene. Quite often, the most shocking or grisly things we see in movies or TV has no music of any kind to it to enhance what you're seeing and make it that much more intense to watch, and I can safely say that "Black Mass" had much less of a dramatic or intense impact as it could have had without it. Some scenes were even spoiled for me because of hearing the almost exact same dreary piece annoyingly slide in right before them, like a friend who just shows up on your doorstep and coyly asks you right before dinner begins if they can have a seat at the table next to you. The two songs I can recall that were in the movie, The Animals' "Don't Bring Me Down" and Ella Fitzgerald's rendition of "Jingle Bells," were better than the entire score combined. One, because they're both classics and fondly memorable to me, and two, because unlike the score, they were actually well-placed and almost perfectly fit with the scenes that they were in. Martin Scorsese, for example, threw in all kinds of nostalgic music from the time periods that "Goodfellas" and "Casino" were in, but with just two songs that I can remember and a bad original score in this movie, it just fell completely flat.The one good thing I can say about this film is that there was not a single person in the whole cast that I thought didn't do a VERY good job. Everyone, especially Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, should be very proud of themselves because of the roles they played and how they played them. Even Adam Scott, a familiar face I know from the 2008 laugh-out-loud riot "Step Brothers" and some other comedic roles in TV shows, was good in the few scenes he was actually in as an FBI agent, proving to me that he can easily be convincingly dramatic and deadly serious when he needs to instead of just the funny man most people probably know him best for.That all being said, however, brings me to my other complaint: the overall execution, or severe lack thereof. There probably isn't a single Oscar nominee/winner on the planet, alive or dead, who could have saved this movie by their acting skills. There was almost no style or standout trait to how this was shot whatsoever, and there was perhaps one murder scene in the entire movie out of the half- dozen of them that there were (give or take one, maybe two) that was surprising or shocking to me in any way because of how predictable the whole thing was. Almost every death to me was seen coming a mile away, especially two in particular that involve Bulger driving out to some obscure location or area free of witnesses with his intended victim and one or two fellow mob members in tow, has a short conversation with them, and then kills them seemingly out of the blue. To again reference two of Scorsese's gangster movies, this was a formula that worked very well for him in "Goodfellas" and "Casino" in the early/mid-90's but has since been nearly exhausted in similar films because of how often it's used, and mostly without alteration or a different approach to it to at least throw the viewer for a loop, too. Perhaps the aforementioned murder scenes were intended to be sudden or surprising to the audience, but to me at least, they were almost laughably foreshadowed and obvious.In short, though I thought that the acting was superb and some of the storyline was interesting, this was overall not a good movie and is probably not worth spending your money on to see at an actual theater. It was overly dreary and almost downright depressing; it seemed like no one even had fun making it. You're probably better off reading the book that this movie was based off of instead of watching the actual movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Goodfellas is a gourmet patisserie then Black Mass is an airport Cinnabon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The intrigue of all crime movies relies on a simple idea: people are complex, but actions are not. Behind every reductive, one-word crime ?"murder," "theft," "extortion"? is a human with a motive and a history to support that motive. Part of the reason we follow the stories of criminals is to overlay ourselves on their paths, trace the steps around their intentions, and see where they turn where you would not. Great crime stories give us the opportunity feel our own humanity guide us through darkness. Unfortunately, I felt nothing while watching Black Mass.Heralded as a return to acting form for Johnny Depp, Black Mass tells the true-crime story of James "Whitey" Bulger, a mythologized, south-Boston crime lord who operated from the late 70's to early 90's. As an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the film portrays the key years of Bulger's ascent to power in the Boston crime world, during which he acted as an FBI-informant through slick FBI agent (and Southie homeboy) John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). At the behest of Connolly and his less enthusiastic boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Bulger provides information that precipitates the downfall of the Italian mob, allowing his own Winter Hill gang to take over all aspects of Boston crime, from the drug trade to money laundering, and everything in-between.However, with such a compelling, cant-fail crime premise, the film is bafflingly hollow. Other than hearing a laundry list of crimes that Bulger supposedly spearheads, we almost never see any crimes being committed, other than the odd shotgun rampage or prostitute murder (both which felt sadly derivative for such gruesome scenes). Doors slam, money is exchanged, and men with furrowed brows walk hastily down empty alleys?but it never feels like we are made to understand why.Where is the money coming from? What are Whitey's motivations? Who are the victims of these crimes, or rather, where are the commoners (for a film with such a large cast, it seems completely devoid of extras) of Boston at all? Even the undeniable Benedict Cumberbatch seems adrift and misused in his role as Whitey's state senator brother Billy Bulger.Director Scott Cooper chose to focus only on a handful of key years during Whitey's reign of terror, perhaps to draw focus on his peak instead of wasting time on his rise or fall. Unfortunately, the result is a dubiously avowed criminal juggernaut who feels?and sometimes looks?like he is made out of paper. Much has been made of Depp's transformation into the balding, ghostly Bulger through the magic of makeup, prosthetics, and false teeth. He looks legitimately ghoulish throughout the film, yet the performance feels thin and insubstantial, perhaps less due to Depp's acting than to the camera's disinterest.Depp does has his moments, especially in one particularly tense scene where he slinks out of the shadows to confront Connolly's untrusting wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson), lurking over her like a pale, demonic shadow. During that scene, I felt like I was watching a horror movie. Afterwards, I could only lament the fact the rest of the movie didn't try harder to be a horror movie, or didn't try harder to be anything interesting at all.Black Mass has the trappings of a great film with solid performances, beautifully lit shots, and a wealth of source materials, making its ultimate failure that much more disappointing. Crime stories are a staple of American cinema and we accept them for their inherent limitations. However, in 2015 it's simply unacceptable to approach the making of a crime movie with absolutely no creative spirit.Several other reviews have likened Black Mass to a poor imitation of Goodfellas or other Scorsese films. If Goodfellas is the gourmet pâtisserie of crime movies, then Black Mass is an airport Cinnabon, a fluorescently lit sprawl of half baked, cookie-cutter crime characters we've all come to expect?a dash of angry FBI chief here, a sprinkle of disgruntled mob grunt there?who delivered their lines and then seemingly evaporate into stale air. The movie runs over two excruciating hours yet fails to make plain the impact of the Bulger's crimes, resulting in a story which accomplishes the impossible feat of feeling both protracted and unfinished.Scott Cooper strives to portray Whitey Bulger as the boogeyman, an unstoppable nightmare whose actions are made infinitely more terrifying by the knowledge that they exist in reality. Instead, Black Mass is the kind of dream that you forget the instant you wake up.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling Depp but the overall cake fails to rise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name James Bulger brings a chill to many older British people. For James was the little boy abducted from a shopping centre in 1993 by two older boys, murdered and left on a railway line. But the subject of "Black Mass" is real-life hoodlum James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) who grew to be the kingpin in the Boston underworld.Heavily protected by an old friend and FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Egerton, "The Great Gatsby") who is running him as an informant, Bulger ruthlessly destroys his Boston Italian rivals and tries to keep one step ahead of sceptical FBI boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) and CIA investigator Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll from "House of Cards"). Told in flashback form, the film charts Bulger's career and his relationship with his brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) who (amazing but true!) was the State Senator for Massachusetts.Depp is a chameleon-like actor. Unlike someone like Tom Hanks (who is always 'Tom Hanks'), Depp transforms himself physically to inhabit his roles: Jack Sparrow; Willy Wonka; The Mad Hatter; Edward Scissorhands ? it is sometimes difficult to equate the roles to the same actor. In "Black Mass" he does it again, being almost unrecognisable in the role. But he delivers in the acting stakes and turns in a chilling performance as the psychopathic mob leader. In supporting roles are Jesse Plemons ("The Program") and W. Earl Brown ("There's Something About Mary") as his right (and left) arm men and the talented Dakota Johnson as the concerned mother to his son.Although it's good as a simple gangster film, the film is a little two-dimensional to be great.The treatment of the relationship between the brothers ? surely one of the most dramatic and surprising parts of the story ? is perfunctory, with Cumberbatch (sporting a good Bostonian accent) having relatively few minutes on the screen.It's also almost impossible to form any emotional connection with Depp's character. Most screen villains have at least some sense of dark and shade (see Tom Hardy's recent portrayal of Reggie Kray in "Legend"). In contrast, Depp's Bulger is as uniformly dark as the title suggests.Directed by Scott Cooper it's a workmanlike film, with many inevitably violent scenes. It's certainly watchable?. but won't be memorable.(Please visit Bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the life of the demented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime boss is the name of the game. And there is no hero in this. No savior, and no happy tales at the end of the rainbow. This is blood and grit all the way through but it's not all in it. This movie shows the nature of man, a person, as we were shown the gradual change that happened to him as tragedies after tragedies happened to him, and thus show us the unraveling, the change that took him over through out the course of the movie.There is the love of the father, love of a son, and love of a brother. This things are what held him to the ground. It's what held him to be sane in my opinion. And so in the end, we were shown what it is that made him what he is, but still, I would guess many is with me in this that this is no excuse, for the crimes, unforgivable and most unthinkable. In fact, it was in my impression that the character that Johny Depp played was a psychopath. I mean he was calm, and smiling and unsuspecting, till the second he pulls a gun on you. That's how I call those types, not that I've associated myself with those kinds, or so I think, you never know.But since kids, I have got the sense that they were living in a rough neighborhood. And it is Brooklyn in the 70s and early 80s, so it seems justifiable to speculate that it is the kind of environment that would produce someone likely to be listed as FBI's most wanted list.As I said, there is no hero in this, just pure truth, and as it usually is, with a changing society where leaders, us secretary attorney, and some dude that'd take over, there is always, without a doubt, change, either for the good or bad and this is what I have observed in this movie. A change of leader, made this criminal group more deadly, but also, due to that same reason, that same group, meet an ugly decline. And since this is a society, that caters the good, I must say that it'd produce well, outstanding law enforcing, disciplined citizens, and as time goes by, ruthless, evil groups get disinfected. It's not really that black and white but what I mean is pretty simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very interested in watching this film as a true-crime buff. We all understand that there will be a certain amount of theatrical license taken whenever dealing with such subject matter. I didn't expect it to be too far off base from reality since the Whitey Bulger fiasco has been highly publicized. Johnny Depp was a little odd choice in my opinion by his been known to pull bigger rabbits on the hat (even literally). Good to have Johnny Depp reminders every once in while he's a legitimate actor not just trying to fund additional island property.The problem in films of this nature tend to be how familiar the general public is with the issues and our opinions of what we believe reality to be. We hold film a little too stringently against reality or at least what the media has presented as reality to most of us. I would like to think that enough due diligence has gone into whatever form of dramaturgy has happened by responsible parties to present a relatively balanced film. But in general we want the grit and grime without regard for legalities or implications.True, the film focuses on alliances and the levity provided that we have always suspected. And we have seen a ton of films in this genre with such focus and we have fabricated our own concepts of how such organizations work, how such unholy alliances are formed, and therefore have an expectation of what we should see. This past history in turn doesn't really provide a fair shake for any film in the current time frame as we have so much the compare it to.I believe that the real demystification of this spell (not to say the cast wasn't good or to question the deftness of Depp) is that we seem to have seen this story a lot. We know how it ends, we realize there's very little arc and we'd like to see a twist to the hat trick that we haven't seen before... If it sticks to the reality of the situation, it's simply not gonna happen.Does it deliver? Yes. Is it a Tarantino yarn? Not remotely. Will you be entertained, to a greater extent? Yes.I think this year DiCaprio may have Depp on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Mass was such a boring movie. There, I said it..Not only was it boring, but it was also confusing at several points which made it nearly impossible to enjoy while watching it for the first (and only) time. It isn't completely impossible, but there were far too many pieces missing throughout.I checked my watch an hour in and dreaded the fact that I still had another hour to sit through.Excessive swearing and random killing is all this movie was. Were the performances outstanding? Hardly. And this surprised me considering all of the positive reviews and famous names of people who were in it.In the end you're left with an overrated crime based "drama" movie that isn't worth watching and full of regret wishing you had bought that dessert rather than sitting through over 2 hours of whatever the hell that was. I was very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Mass is a waste of your time and money. DO NOT see this. The number of well-known actors used in this film is a damn shame because every single role is such a cardboard cutout that any lesser-known actor wouldn't have made a difference. Depp plays "Whitey" Bulger, and to constantly remind the audience that he's a real bad guy, he gives stone-cold, eye piercing looks, he throws in the necessary run of the mill curses, kills a few unremarkable people throughout and that's it. Don't expect any action or colorful, well-written characters. Yes, this is based off a true story, but, in the context of the film, there is no significance; it doesn't matter--it's been done a ton before and it adds absolutely nothing new or refreshing to the genre. Except for a couple of interesting subplots (which are all quickly brushed off and "resolved" by a single line of dialogue in a following scene), this film has nothing going for it. And it really is a shame; there are hints of a better film that shine through every once in a while during its seemingly forever-feeling run-time, but, that's not to be had. There's not much more to say because this film really doesn't have much going for it. DON'T go to see this--it really is THAT bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie. For me, biopic as a whole (and in some ways this is the case of this film) are part of a genre that is extremely difficult to make interesting, engaging, or at least curious to the public, that is, it requires a huge racing everyone involved in the production, and also that the story in question has some basis to be adapted to the cinema. Black Mass is not an example of excellence in this type of film, far from it, but can fulfill its role as a whole is good, has an extremely attractive story, and at times his many jumps in time cease all very chopped, but the whole experience is justified by a major factor: Johnny Depp. All actors in the main long core are fine in their roles, which already slightly increases the overall grade, but Depp is really fantastic, leaving those who really watches in fear for all who engage with him, even with some dramas placed within the story somewhat unresolved, all convictions and Jimmy Bulger motivations are extremely convincing in the hands of the great actor. Analyzing only the narrative and structure of the feature film the note would be 6 or even 5 though, as the evaluation can not just focus only on a few factors, but in all, 7 seems but fair, a good movie, which has great asset as the expertise of its actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, just so damn standard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American crime genre is arguably the cornerstone of modern cinema. Think cinematic masterpieces and there's a good chance every third one is a mobster flick or underworld yarn. This breed of film is nothing if not reliable. Why, then, is the first notable movie about one of U.S.A's most notorious and durable heads of crime so unmemorable? Checking off key points in an organised but uninspired manner, this James "Whitey" Bulger biopic is seemingly more concerned about fitting in all the Wiki-worthy moments rather than truly delving into the psyche of a monstrous man. The unfocused script stems from the choice to trace two decades of Bulger's life (1975 to 1995), an unwieldy stretch of time that results in an unclear filmic timeline and the requirement for truly horrible makeup and wigs. Johnny Depp has succeeded at portraying a gangster before ? his John Dillinger in Public Enemies is enthralling ? however he's lumped with too many poorly executed physical alterations and character development shortcomings to make an impression here. Aussie Joel Edgerton fares better as a morally intriguing federal agent skating on thin ice, and Kevin Bacon is enjoyable as a frustrated FBI boss, but why Benedict Cumberbatch signed on for such an inconsequential role, as Bulger's Senator brother, is anyone's guess. Scott Cooper keeps it relatively low-key behind the camera, aside from a couple of stylish murder sequences, with the suitably dour cinematography and unfussy score following suit. Overall Black Mass is never overtly bad, per se; its major sin is just being so damn standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor acting. Extremely slow moving story. Do Not watch this movie. Its barely watchable in bits but largely uncoordinated with no consistent narrative and characters. The director needs to learn to do some editing and script writing. No body in their right mind would have approved this movie to go into production. I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film. Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder. All the positive-rated reviews are by Johny depp fan boys and not good cinema critiques. Avoid watching it if you can, at all costs. A sheer waste of 2 hours! The ending is predictable within the first 5 minutes of the movie. Go re-watch the usual suspects instead.</fullReview>

I can't imagine anything that could be done to make this movie more boring. Even a black screen for 122 minute would have been better because then you get to sleep.The movie moves at such a slow pace with so boring a plot and so many attempts at making everybody look good and being politically correct, that even the awesome Johnny Depp performances in the trailer look weak and halfhearted when put into context.Basically: Watch the trailers (they're awesome), but not the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp Leads the Mob Acting, but Depressing and Dull at Points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Icy Blue eyes stare at you, their cold, blue gaze promising fear and death with every blink. Who or what do these eyes belong too? None other than the notorious criminal Jimmy Whitey Bulger, one of the most notorious crime lords in history. Okay? so maybe it was Johnny Depp playing the mob legend, but regardless of the source, those eyes sum up the tone of the movie Black Mass. This film kind of snuck under the radar for most, but I'm here to help shed some light on what it beholds. Returning after a three-week hiatus, it's Robbie K with another movie review. As the title suggests, Black Mass is a tale that is perhaps one of the darkest movies I've seen in a long time. The visual portrayal of Bulger's rise to power is one without filters, where violence, threats, and death rain in high definition splendor. Unlike older mob movies that resulted to gunfights and quick, clean kills, Black Mass gets its hands dirty with detailed torture and gore painting the silver screen a sickly red. Those with weak constitutions will need to avoid this picture, especially during the instances where Whitey results to other means to deal with the "rats" of Boston. I give props to Scott Cooper and his team for unfolding a portion of the mafia world, but like so many took it a little too far than was necessary. How many random characters being shot in the head does one really need to see to get the message? The major component that I felt was the greatest aspect of this movie was the acting. Once more Johnny Depp has impressed me with his talent, temporarily chucking the whimsical and wacky for the dark and dismal. Depp brings a level of unease and terror I never thought possible in both looks (great makeup) and delivery of his lines. Like many of my fellow reviewers have stated, this could indeed be an Oscar worthy role for Depp and while he was the main pillar of this movie there were other supporting actors who need a little praise. Joel Edgerton as the corrupt CIA officer packs a pretty mean punch, oozing with festering greed, as he feigns ignorance for Whitey's services, while trying to cover his hide. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of a politician to the T, with the confidence, arrogance, and cheesy grin to sell the crowd. The movie could have been even better if Cumberbatch could have been more integrated in the film, but he made the most of his time. And of course Kevin Bacon uses his familiar tactics , which although not impressive, did help tie the story together. Now what about the story? Whitey's tale is very detailed, showing the life changing events that shaped him into the threat he became. Even more detailed is the corrupt deals Whitey makes, and the drama that unfolds with each shot. However, despite all the attention to detail, the tale isn't all that exciting. Black Mass felt more like an upscale documentary, devoid of any movie magic or exciting choreographed scenes. The pace of the movie is slow; at times feeling like it's going nowhere, primarily due to a lack of suspense. Maybe if there had been a rival in his history, or at least some glimmer of hope it could have had a little more thrill to it. The details also make things a bit convoluted as well and hard to follow until they literally state the purpose a few minutes later. What does this boil down to? A need for editing, to not only assist with the clarity, but also keep the depression to an absolute minimum. However, if you are one for the facts and wish to avoid the fluff that Hollywood thrives on, this movie's dynamics will more than entertain you.Black Mass certainly has some of the best mobster betrayal seen for some time, capturing the ruthless nature of the Boston underbelly. However, if you can't stomach intense violence, and you are looking for some more exciting twists to a film you need to pick another option. This film has a lot of quality to it, but overall it wasn't the most entertaining or impressive film to grace the silver screen. Being a biography, this movie probably would have been better suited for a TV special on the History channel. My suggestion is to wait for this one to come to Redbox to watch in the comfort of your own home, unless of course you are an avid mob movie fan, or Depp enthusiast. My scores are: Biography/Crime/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Long and boring" are the first words that come to mind when exiting from this film, which seems strange because a gangster film which is boring is almost a contrast in words. Off-hand I can't think of another gangster film that had less action, suspense, or drama. Apart from the length and direction, the musical score is almost non-existent, which in a film of this nature trying to recapture bygone days, is a cardinal sin.Perhaps the worst feature of the film, though, is the acting, from Johnny Depp's poor imitation of Jack Nicholson to the Irish accents that come and go throughout the film. It's not all bad acting. For me, David Harbour ("End of Watch"), Dakota Johnson ("The Social Network") and Juno Temple ("Magic, Magic") stood out.This is a film you can surely miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Johnny Depp's career has had several ups and downs. For every 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Ed Wood', there's a 'The Tourist' or 'Mortdecai. 'Black Mass' falls somewhere between the two, Depp is fantastic but the film itself, drags.Depp plays Whitey Bulger, a Boston gangster with a psychotic edge, who aligns himself with childhood friend and FBI agent, John Connolly, played by Joel Edgerton. It's almost a cliché to say that a performance is 'trans-formative' but it does apply to Depp in this film. Much like Steve Carrell in 'Foxcatcher', you look past the make up and see a truly nuanced performance that is surprisingly subtle at times, if not ludicrously OTT as well. Joel Edgerton's performance is likely to not get as much awards attention as Depp's, but he deserves to. One scene in particular which show's his range is where he has to bluff his way through a conversation with his boss about the FBI's involvement with Bulger. His demeanor goes from showboating jerk to sniveling loser in seconds. A man whose power only extends to a certain degree and no more. The dark atmosphere and weather of South Boston gives the film a grey-ish tint to it. This reflects the dark subject matter as well as the spiraling mood of Bulger and the people he is connected to. However, it also gives the film a very boring 'look'. The cinematography is not particularly engaging nor beautiful either. All of the criticisms are mostly nitpicks because the biggest issue with the film is that it is all too familiar. Shades of The Sopranos here (Family and home life juxtaposed with violence etc.), hints of Goodfellas there (Links with the FBI, "How am I funny") which gives the vibe of a boring college gangster slideshow and/or quiz of 'Guess the gangster film!'. For a casual viewer, it could be effective. But sometimes, it's a little too lazy on standard gangster film traits. What elevates a crime film from ordinary to brilliant, is the layers and subtext attached to it. The Godfather is great because it juggles a man's blood thirsty ambitions with his family life. Heat is great because it examines the relationship between the cop and criminal. Black Mass features Johnny Depp kicking someone's head in, and that's about it. But boy does he do some good kicking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sluggish Crime Saga with little Cinematic Flair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Out of the Furnace" director Scott Cooper's "Black Mass" qualifies as a gritty, atmospheric, but middling mobster melodrama that chronicles the life and crimes of James "Whitey" Bulger, a notorious Boston gangster with an Irish upbringing who evaded authorities for 16 years before justice eventually caught and convicted him for 11 homicides. Adapted from a thoroughgoing non-fiction bestseller by "Boston Globe" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, this unsavory, R-rated, crime chiller provides "Pirates of the Caribbean" star Johnny Depp with a chance to atone for far too many silly, superficial comedies. Academy Award-winner Jack Nicholson did an imaginary take on this real-life sociopath in Martin Scorsese's memorable law and order epic "The Departed," a mob movie ten times more suspenseful than "Black Mass." Now, Depp stars as the infamous felon himself. Although he appears incredibly chilling as the bloodthirsty maniac who is currently serving two life sentences plus five years, nothing about Depp's performance reveals any insights about this heinous individual. Indeed, thanks to prosthetics galore, Depp bears a striking resemblance to Bulger, but nothing beneath his grim, tight-lipped portrayal yields a clue about the murderer's mindset. Reportedly, Bulger refused to talk to Depp about his life. Meantime, this is not the Depp that we have grown accustomed to in movies like the frivolous "Pirates" franchise, "The Lone Ranger," "Tusk," "Dark Shadows," and "Mortdecai." Instead, this is the Depp of "Public Enemies," "Donnie Brasco," and "Once Upon a Time in Mexico." As Bulger, Depp strangles a defenseless young harlot with a rope, beats an adversary to death with his bare fists, and mows downs an unarmed, but treacherous henchman with a carbine. Don't walk into "Black Mass" and imagine you're going to see something that will make you giggle with glee. Unquestionably, "Black Mass" constitutes a long overdue return to form for the immensely talented Depp. Critics have hailed his performance as Oscar worthy. As unforgettable as Depp is, the man who steals the show and delivers the best performance is Depp's co-star Joel Edgerton of "Warriors." Cast as corrupt FBI Agent John Connolly, who conspired with the real-life Bulger to shield him from prosecution, Edgerton emerges as nothing short of sensational. While Depp relies on prosthetics to impersonate Bulger, Edgerton shuns elaborate make-up and turns the tainted FBI agent into a sympathetic flesh and blood character. He gets under Connolly's skin and shows us what makes the man tick.A profane, violent, but episodic crime thriller, "Black Mass" covers familiar ground. Director Scott Cooper, who also helmed "Crazy Heart," neither pulls any punches in his casual depiction of mob violence nor does he startle us with any surprises. You've seen everything that Cooper stages here in other gangster movies. Essentially, "Black Mass" is an empire-building crime film, but Cooper doesn't recount either how Bulger established his empire or solidified it with his intimidating reputation. Instead, he dwells on episodes that earlier movies like "The Departed," "Goodfellas," "The Town," "Killing Me Softly," "The Friends of Eddie Coyle," and the two "Boondock Saints" thrillers have done before and done with greater panache. Basically, the action unfolds in five year increments, beginning in 1975 as a number of Bulger's cronies cut deals with the Feds to save their necks. Freshman scenarist Mark Mallouk and "Edge of Tomorrow" scribe Jez Butterworth neglect to explore the psychology behind the treachery that prompted Bulger's underlings to inform on him. Meantime, Cooper focuses almost entirely on the relationship between Bulger and Connolly. The subplot involving Whitey's older brother Billy could have been left on the editing room floor. Incredibly, "Black Mass" omits some of the more compelling incidents in the page-turning Lehr and O'Neill book. Specifically, the filmmakers have altered the events that brought Bulger and Connolly together as conspirators as well as some of the crimes. A convicted bank robber who did 9-years in Alcatraz, Bulger masqueraded as a Robin Hood-style gangster around South Boston, but his fellow goons weren't fooled by his shenanigans. Ironically, loyalty among these thieves is the first casualty. As the film unfolds, Bulger henchman Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons of "Varsity Blues"), goes on the record swearing that he isn't a "rat!" On the other hand, FBI Agent John Connolly worshiped the ground that Bulger trod and refused to testify against him. Connolly grew up in the same blue-collar Irish neighborhood as Bulger. Whitey intervened in a fight where Connolly would have suffered grievously without his support. Connolly struggles to convince his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson of "Kinsey") that loyalty supersedes morality. Nevertheless, her husband's adulation for Bulger repels her. Connolly sets out to recruit Bulger as a source, but Bulger balks at being an informant. Inevitably, Connolly forges an unholy alliance with Bulger, so the Bureau can crush the Mafia in Boston and he could claim credit for the demise of the Italians. Ultimately, Connolly sold his soul to the devil, while Cooper makes Bulger appear as sinister as Satan.Distinguished by its brooding cinematography, authentic production values, and documentary flavor, "Black Mass" succeeds more as a tour de force showcase for the actors than a landmark example of a gangster movie. A top-tier supporting cast, featuring "Sherlock" star Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billy, who carved out a reputation for himself in Congress as a man of the people, surround Depp and Edgerton. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour, and Adam Scott play Connolly's eloquent, well-tailored, FBI colleagues. Harbour delivers a powerful performance as the weak link in the group of FBI agents who turn a blind eye to Bulger's criminal activities as long as he furnishes them with information about the Mafia. As Bulger's amoral associates, Rory Cochrane, Jesse Plemons, and W. Earl Brown will make your skin crawl. Peter Sarsgaard rounds out the cast as one of Bulger's sadistic but ill-fated adversaries. Nobody gives a weak performance in "Black Mass." Sadly, for all of his crime-does-not-pay sentiments, Cooper has fashioned a dreary, sluggish crime saga devoid of any cinematic flair or unpredictable spontaneity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now we've seen this format often enough with its well-rehearsed drills: men in suits and big ties: large hair on everyone; a soundtrack of known and more obscure period hits; moody settings in bars, wasteland, and a shabby district of town; a protagonist that is attractive in a psychopathic sense, a supporting cast of solid actors embellish the entire piece; a script with a couple of strong scenes and a memorable line and bada bing - it's a quality piece of work.There's little wrong with this movie: some people may quibble about Depp (who seems to have channeled a bit of Nicholson from The Departed as he filched Keith Richards for the pirate series), but really, it's not worth the struggle. We've seen it, or a variation of it a few times and it does nothing new. So it grinds on to it's inevitable conclusion and then we forget about it.If there is tedium it's in the script which skates over the material in the standard ways, although it offers a central focus over loyalty, but somehow this too has been over done, overplayed too often as well.It's not bad, it's not great; its just another product off the line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been the Fall of disappointing movies. BLACK MASS stands at the top of this list. Take one look at Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger and you'll think his make-up artist had Tim Burton on a direct line. Nonetheless, I understand how BLACK MASS fell into the trap of becoming yet another poorly failed Goodfellas/Donnie Brasco. The life of one of the most infamous crime bosses is hard to discern - what is even harder to discern is the world that surrounds him. It's not truth versus fable. It's how do we explain the damn thing? From his heinous acts of legendary proportion, the real Whitey is known as one of the most ruthless/inhumane people to ever walk this planet. He was on the 10 most wanted list for the entire world before being captured by the FBI. There's some nasty buggers on there - so we get the drift. However, for most movies/TV shows to work, the audience has to have an affinity for the main character - it's the element that made The Sopranos such a smashing success. Do we even have the right to give Whitey Bulger the privilege? Yes - purely on dynamics, of course. His heart is black (no spoiler here, folks). Lets see how it beats - not just look at a dude dressed up like the Joker with a leather jacket. In my opinion, there are alternatives to create a more compelling story - but I didn't write the film or will claim to be able to pull it off myself. Although I might have had some objections with making Johnny Depp look like the Wolfman.Give me a strong story runner from TV and we might have some gasoline. David Milch, want to hop in the batter's box? We'll surely give you a bat. SPOILER* We're not asking for a documentary - we can't ask that of any fictional movie. But, we do want human moments that make us relate to the character - if at least for five minutes. And, where Goodfellas has Henry Hill in tears when asking his boss for money or Tony Soprano crying in therapy, Black Mass has a few mundane blasé scenes with his wife and mother - who checks out early on. In fact, every female character in the film is the same (except for the prostitute Whitey strangles played by the sultry Juno Temple).SPOILER* the one good scene Whitey purposely freaking out the FBI agents at dinner when discussing a homemade family receipt - this is in the trailer - which is why I wanted to see the movie. This is followed by Whitey paying a visit to Connolly's wife upstairs. He is terrorizing, horrifying, you name it - and he's actually dynamic here. Too bad this is five minutes amongst 122. Wait for this on HBO. Do not pay for it on demand. Seriously. Don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering how Depp has already portrayed the role of John Dillinger in Public Enemies, my expectations for this movie were soaring high and I was sure that Depp would do wonders with this role. But surprisingly enough, he didn't do wonders but instead he did something unimaginable, something so exceptional that it very well may be regarded as his finest performance till date.The story chronicles around the life of James "Whitey" Bulger. When his control over his... turf is challenged by the northern Angiulo Brothers (mafia family), he has no choice but to become an informant for the FBI... correction as Jimmy says.. strike a business deal with them. What follows is a series of events that depict the rise of a small time gangster into becoming one of the most infamous violent criminals in the history of South Boston.Scott Cooper takes you on a journey which is downright brutal and chilling. There is not a single moment in the movie where you'll want to take your eyes off the screen. He manages to get you hooked from the very beginning and before you realise you're completely involved in the lives of all the characters. I mean that's the mark of a brilliant director, isn't it? To be able to have such an impact on his audiences that they would talk about the movie even after they've left the theater.Johnny Depp with his icy blue eyes will definitely give you chills and creeps. His predator like gaze will stare right through the screen and pierce your body to give you the shivers you've never felt before. The unpredictability of his character will bring about many uncomfortable scenes for the audiences.Trust me when I say this the only time I've been terrified of him is when he starred in Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd. He has managed to shut the mouth of every critic that said his career was going downhill. His transformation into Jimmy is so real that it almost makes it difficult to recognise him.Well to praise only Depp would not be right because the movie would not fair well without its supporting cast. From Jimmy's right-hand man Stephen Flemmi (exceptionally well portrayed by Rory Cochrane) to the newcomer Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) and the cold and calculative hit-man, Johnny Martorano (W. Earl Brown). Also, John Connolly, played by none other than Joel Edgerton, who's back in his neighborhood to bring down the Angiulo Brothers by any means possible.And not to forget Billy Bulger (Benedict) as the powerful state senator. Although given only a little screen space, he still manages to leave an impact (like always.. hater's gona hate).People say you'll regret the things you didn't do more than the ones you did. So not getting your asses of the couch and watching this movie will definitely be the one thing that you'll regret. Trust me on that. To conclude, Depp deserves nothing short of an Oscar for his "Strictly Criminal" performance. I hope you enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I still know very little about Whitey Bulger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe this is my fault and I missed the point of the film, but it simply doesn't allow you to get to know Bulger at all. Its simply a string of scenes of Bulger doing bad things with little connecting, little explanation and nothing in terms of who he really is. How did he become who he is, whats his motivation? None of this is answered in the film. I think it was simply too big of a story to tell in 2 hours so they cut out any background or emotional story lines and simply left the more "exciting" murders and crimes. The acting was average. Nothing stood out as being exceptional or cringy, though the characters seemed one dimensional. Not the worst film of the year and I think if it interests you then see it, at worst you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of plot, emotion holds Black Mass back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had fantastic trailers. I was beyond excited to see it, and went out opening weekend with high hopes. Unfortunately, it completely failed to live up to my expectations, leading to a very poor night.As most reviewers will tell you, the acting is done well in this movie. Depp especially does a fantastic job. However, his character (Whitey Bulger) was never fleshed out, the only backstory given through the FBI agent (Connolly) who he informs to, who was a childhood friend of his. In fact, the plot was executed so poorly that you never truly care for Whitey and have no idea what his story actually is, or his motivation. This is exemplified perfectly in one early scene.Whitey is introduced in a scene which takes place in a bar, in which he sits silently at a table with a group of mob members. These members are having a conversation meant to set up a bit of plot regarding the current mob politics. The characters who speak, however, can barely be heard over the bar noise. They aren't even shown on camera, because visually the scene focuses only on Depp watching another character eat out of a peanut bowl after licking his fingers. After the conversation ends, Depp calls out the character for doing this, and threatens him. Right from the beginning, the plot took a backseat and the movie served only to show that Whitey is a really bad guy.This movie completely failed to deliver on plot, with no connections from one scene to the next and no excitement. There was not even a climax. Towards the end, Depp suddenly gives guns to the IRA and gets caught in the next scene. That's it. The movie ends minutes later. The lack of emotion and plot, with the only focus being on Whitey Bulger's bad side, holds this movie back from offering anything compelling. It was just bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly I just don't get why Johnny "prosthetics" Depp is even in this. When you are introduced to him you immediately mistake him for Ray Liotta. Down to the eye lashes even the accent. They worked hard to make him Ray Liotta on every level except he's dull and monotone where ray does that stand up and applaud rage face Depp is incapable of. He's just not enjoyable to watch. He looks a bit like Whitey Bulger but it's really incidental and a waste of effort. Hell if anything he looks more like Dracula than Whitey Bulger who was actually a fairly attractive guy. The rest of the movie is a weird borefest. None of the scenes connect. Stuff just happens then they move to days or weeks or years later with no transition. Nothing in any point ties to later scenes either directly or metaphorically. Characters come and go aimlessly. It's a real shame, other than Joel Edgerton who's wasted on this poorly written bad cop the rest of the cast is quite good. Roy Cochrane played his partner Steve Flemmi and he was great. I don't think anyone's gonna read these reviews and pass on this, but I'd say at least don't waste money on this one. Just go watch good fellas, it really is just ripping off it pretty bad. I'm gonna go watch the Whitey Bulger documentary, I suspect it be more entertaining and enlightening. You also leave this film feeling like you didn't learn much about Bulgar. I think the critics are giving this movie too many breaks because they were wowed by Depps Ray Liotta impression. I was not.</fullReview>

Nothing stood out at all; the acting was fine, the story was fine, and the soundtrack was terrible in my opinion. The music sounded like it belonged in a Bourne movie. All of the "plot-twists" that were supposed to feel surprising didn't feel very surprising. It was completely obvious when something bad was going to happen to someone, unlike other gang movies like Goodfellas or Godfather. If your not too picky and want to watch some decent gang action and drama then you will likely enjoy this movie, but if your a movie snob like me I would recommend passing on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Black Mass" is massively disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a story that was begging to be filmed. James "Whitey" Bulger gains control of organized crime in South Boston and, with the help of corrupt law enforcement officials, expands his criminal empire to include the whole city. He gets rich through racketeering, extortion and drug trafficking and enforces his will through violence. Meanwhile, his younger brother is a rising star in Massachusetts politics and becomes President of the State Senate. When Whitey learns that law enforcement is closing in on him, he disappears. Bulger rises to number two on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list (behind only Osama Bin Laden) but remains a fugitive for 16 years until he's arrested. Yes, It's a story tailor-made for Hollywood. Unfortunately, the Hollywood treatment is exactly what Bulger's story gets in "Black Mass" (R, 2:02).Johnny Depp stars as Whitey Bulger and the film focuses on the middle portion of his life, his rise and fall as a Boston crime boss. In the mid-1970s, Bulger was on the rise but his criminal activities were confined to the South Boston neighborhood where he grew up. When his childhood friend, FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), suggests an alliance that can help both of their careers, Bulger agrees. Whitey will supply information about his rivals in the Italian mafia, while the FBI uses that information to bring down the Italians, but ignores Bulger. That arrangement does benefit both parties. The local FBI cripples the Patriarca crime family and Connolly gets promoted. Bulger becomes the undisputed crime lord of Boston and ignores the FBI's demands that he refrain from committing serious crimes. As Bulger's criminal activities increase, the FBI realizes they're in too deep with Whitey to even try stopping him.There are many problems with this movie, starting with the casting. In a film whose main characters are male, the female cast members do most of the best work. Dakota Johnson (as Whitey's long-time girlfriend) and Julianne Nicholson (as John Connolly's wife) give especially strong performances. Among the males, Edgerton, and Corey Stoll (as Connolly's supervisor) do their usual exceptional work, while the actors playing Bulger's cohorts (Rory Cochrane, W. Earl Brown, Jesse Plemons and Peter Sarsgaard) are no more than serviceable, and consistently outstanding actors like Kevin Bacon (as the director of the FBI's Boston filed office), Adam Scott (as an FBI agent) and Benedict Cumberbatch (as Whitey's politician brother) are simply miscast. The same can be said for Johnny Depp. He gives a convincing performance, but the make-up used on him is distracting and it feels like a lot of time and effort went into making Depp look, sound and act like Ray Liotta in "Goodfellas"? ?and that's not the only distracting part of this movie ? or the only connection with "Goodfellas". As in that 1990 classic, gangsters are depicted as respected in their neighborhoods/families and there are scenes in which people are talked to very calmly right before they're killed (including one such scene in an otherwise empty room) and there's even a scene in which a dangerous criminal frightens someone by threatening him as a joke, a la Joe Pesci's character in Martin Scorsese's film. The original aspects of this film's characterization of gangsters aren't very compelling either. The opening scene, designed to show Whitey's menacing personality, has him complaining about one of his friends licking his fingers and putting them back in a bowl of bar nuts. Seriously? Is this a gangster movie or an episode of "Seinfeld"? Worst of all is the script's liberal use of dramatic license. Several of the movie's characters, plot points, and major facts are different from what happened and how it happened, while other important details are left out. It's unnecessary and counterproductive to change so much of a true story that so many people know so well. It also would have been nice if the script related the movie's title to the story in some way, shape or form. This movie is based on a fascinating and many-faceted true story and, overall, the film tells a fairly interesting tale, but the devil is in the details and this version of the story of the FBI's deal with Boston's devil is disappointing.

		<shortDescription>"This is to gangster films what Fury is to war films" -a friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even without taking into account the misleading advertising, this is still a complete disaster of a film. The writing is sloppy at best, the editing is downright horrific, the score is so bland that it seems to be dead set on ruining any chance that any scene has of showing any quality, and even the acting is frequently cringe-worthy. This is a film so overtly disorganized and lacking of vision that by watching it you get the feeling that it actually wants you to give up and watch something else.The main attraction is Depp's performance, but for the entire second half of the film, he takes a screen time backseat to appease the very poorly cast Joel Edgerton, who despite being a fine actor in his own right, could not possibly do any good with a character that the audience could have witnessed in a small role in a single scene, and know just as much about as they do by the end of the movie. In fact, the same could be said for nearly every character. I learned nothing about Whitey Bulger that I didn't gather from the trailer for this movie.Characters and plot lines come and go with no indication of significance because the film's main thematic focus appears to be the idea of using a bad guy to get other bad guys, and the ethical dilemmas that might surround such an agreement. The way it decides to convey this theme would be by having a scene where Joel Edgerton says that he needs Johnny Depp, and then one or more of his colleagues (or wife) either silently or loudly question his enthusiasm for the informant while new information is received to further enforce the illusion that there is anything here to actually invest in. Now repeat that scene about twenty or thirty times and you have the bulk of the movie, then throw some violent scenes in between with little to no context or reason to care and you have the rest, that is the rest that you will still be able to vaguely remember less than thirty minutes after finishing it.But a script never makes or breaks a film; that responsibility lies in the editing. And my god, does this film have really, really bad editing. There is never any sense that the movie has an idea of what is going through the audience's head as they traverse through scene after scene of insultingly forced use of music (which is cookie-cutter enough already without taking center stage) and dreadful cutting. Things don't get prettier when looking at the pacing of the film from a broader perspective...it should not be clear WITHOUT researching a film that it can't decide who the protagonist should be (or if there should be one at all) or how much focus should be given to ANY character or ANY event. I'm not sure what went wrong because there's a lot of talent involved in this in both the cast and crew, but the final product here is a dull mess of a motion picture whose only redeeming qualities (a few entertaining moments and standout performances from Depp and Sarsgaard) are so outweighed by its flaws that it's really not even worth a glance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both my gf and I saw this just now and we both wanted to leave after an hour but kept sticking with it. The acting is fine, but this movie falls flat on keeping the audience engaged and interested. We spent the whole movie looking at each other and hoping it would end. Definitely don't recommend seeing this. Love Johnny Depp like most of you, but take my advice and watch this when you don't run the risk of waisting $15 and two hours of your time.The movie spans 30 years of crime under Whitey Bulger and jumps from hit to hit and scene to scene leaving the viewer questioning why it matters to continue to watch the movie. The primary point of drama is whether is Bulger's relationship with his friend Cooper will unravel and leave them both out to dry; but the viewer quickly loses interests when it becomes evident that the move has nothing special to it. I am very disappointed I spent money to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hot blooded gangster film about a cold blooded bastard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass tells the story of the infamous alliance between the Boston FBI and the city's bastard son, James "Whitey" Bulger. In telling a story that has stained Boston and the FBI for all of eternity and telling with precision, guts and, most of all, honesty, it solidifies Black Mass as one of the best films of the year thus far. Starring an unrecognizable Johnny Depp and a scene stealing Joel Edgerton, the film blasts off on screen, making you want more and more as it play out. Just like in typical gangster fashion, there are long speeches, there is brutal violence and there is not one moment where it ever lets up. While the film itself doesn't break any new ground regarding gangster films, it is still a more than welcomed addition to the lot of them and may even become iconic but it is a bit too early to tell. Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic as Bulger. Depp brings a level of performance to the table that we haven't seen in years. He can be charming, cunning, ruthless and, at times, so cold blooded you question if this man has any humanity. For an actor to be able to pull off this kind of role, it takes a specific mind set and Johnny Depp nails it. Between scenes of him murdering anyone who threatens his empire, we see Bulger, the family man. The man that would kill for nothing being brought to his knees as he is told his son has died. There is humanity in Depp's performance as Bulger, there's just so many layers to peel back in order to get to it. I can't rave about Depp enough. The man is mind blowingly fantastic in this film and no words I can put down can justify the level of perfection he brings to this film. Joel Edgerton plays John Connolly, who ends up stealing the show in many scenes. Edgerton has become a force to be reckoned with and a pool of untapped talent that has finally been able to roar to the surface with August's The Gift (for which he wrote, directed and starred) and now with Black Mass. I sense an Oscar nomination for his work in Black Mass. He is THAT good. To be able to act opposite of Depp's career best performance and hold your own, that is saying something in and of itself. Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Julianne Nicholson, Rory Cochrane and everyone else in this cast is pitch perfect. Even Dakota Johnson is good but then again, my expectations for her was that it was going to be hard to take her seriously but she ended up delivering a fantastic performance as Lyndsay Cyr. Scott Cooper has directed some pretty fantastic films, Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace. But Black Mass is his masterpiece thus far. Cooper created a film drenched in the styles of the 70s cinema. It acts a love letter to films like The Godfather, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Mean Streets and even Serpico. Cooper's direction skyrockets what could have easily been a bomb into something very organic and very special. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic in this film, covering Boston never like a character but as a playground for Whitey. It is engrossing and engaging throughout and never overwhelming like Cooper's Out of the Furnace cinematography was. Every component to this film screams for perfection and with a director like Scott Cooper and a cast headed by an Oscar worthy Johnny Depp, the film gets just that...perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels right at home with Scorsese gangster flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fail to understand why Black Mass is so underrated. I wasn't expecting much from this film and it's one of the greatest gangster films of all time - definitely the best of the past 10 years (along with The Departed). Black Mass feels right at home with Scorsese gangster films but is far from another Goodfellas copy. It is dirty and nasty and extremely compelling. This classic American gangster tale spanning over a decade in 2 hours. And Johnny Depp's portrayal of James Whitey Bulger is Oscar worthy!! You forget completely that you are watching Johnny Depp, I am not even joking. The man is a terrific actor and is brooding and terrifying but you love to watch him. The infamous steak recipe scene is pure brilliance. Black Mass is rock solid and well structured and intelligent and doesn't at any moment try to be cool. The film is cool anyway and all the kills are over quickly apart from two suffocations which build Jimmy's character as a ruthless killer and are two very powerful scenes. The film does not have to focus on violence for it's shock factor, the shock factor is all in Depp's performance. The cinematography of Black Mass is nothing less than beautiful. It's just a great film to look at. Getting lost in Black Mass' stunning visuals makes it so much easier to get lost in the very real and in no way at all stylized world of the Boston Underworld.This sadistic tale feels so wrong to love so much, but it is simple, Scott Cooper has crafted a masterpiece and, although it might not be right now, Black Mass is going to be a classic! Black Mass does not have a single bad performance. The chemistry between Depp and Edgerton is great and you buy these as two old friends. Watching the loss of humanity in Edgerton as he loses his grasp on what's right and wrong is subtle yet awesome and as Depp's portrayal of Bulger goes from inhuman to monster is even more enthrawling. Aside from rock ballads and hilarious comedy (although Black Mass does have one or two darkly comedic scenes) it's a Scorsese gangster flick at heart (as The Departed is loosely based on the story of James Whitey Bulger). If you haven't already, go and watch Black Mass. It is a film for everyone. You can sit back and simply watch it unfold or you can be sucked into the world of Black Mass through it's incredible energy and be left thinking about it for days. Is it as good as Goodfellas? No. But it comes damn close!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True story of mobster Whitey Bulger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Black Mass is a 2015 American biographical crime drama-thriller film directed by Scott Cooper and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, based on the 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. The film has an ensemble cast including Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, Dakota Johnson, and Corey Stoll.-The film follows the criminal career of infamous Irish-American mobster Whitey Bulger (Depp). Principal photography of the film began on May 19, 2014 in Boston, and wrapped on August 1, 2014. It had its world premiere at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. The film was released by Warner Bros. worldwide on September 18, 2015. This also marks the second of Depp's portrayals of a gangster, after his successful film Public Enemies.--Critical response: -Black Mass received generally positive reviews; particular praise was given to Depp's performance. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 75% based on 236 reviews and an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Black Mass spins a gripping yarn out of its fact-based story ? and leaves audiences with one of Johnny Depp's most compelling performances in years." On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 68 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.-Johnny Depp's portrayal of Whitey Bulger received critical acclaim. Critics from The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, and TheWrap called it one of his best performances to date. The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy, in addition to praising the film, called Depp's performance "fully convincing and frightening", saying it to is "very welcome at this point in his career and one of his best." -Similarly, Indie Wire's Eric Kohn praised the cast and highlighted Depp's performance and Cooper's directorial efforts to depict "the haunting legacy of Bulger's criminal deeds, and the lingering sense that no justice can erase their impact." Admiring Black Mass as an "elegantly understated crime drama", Variety's Scott Foundas positively compared Depp's performance in the film to his earlier roles with Tim Burton.-TheWrap's Alonso Duralde praised Depp's performance, but was less positive towards the film's pacing and short on screen appearances of some supporting characters. BBC Culture's Nicolas Barber found some of the subplots to be unnecessary (specifically mentioning Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger), and argued that "the film is never bad, but, given the gob-smacking true story, it's disappointing that it's not great". In a negative review, CraveOnline's Fred Topel labeled Black Mass as a "black mess". He criticized the screen writing and argued that the film borrows too heavily from Goodfellas, writing: "...it's clear that the filmmakers wanted to turn this into Goodfellas and tried to shoehorn this story into a similar kind of seductive, funny, shocking gangster tale. ...Several scenes seem to want to be like the 'how am I funny?' scene in Goodfellas, but it's blatant".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back, Mr. Depp, we've missed you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know a whole lot about James "Whitey" Bulger outside of what I got in the documentary about him that came out shortly before this film. Needless to say, he was quite an unsavory character, but interesting movies have been made about those types, even in the gangster genre. BLACK MASS didn't always work as an engaging story, despite combining two of my biggest interests (gangsters and true crime), because it never really focused on a particular aspect of the events and, as such, was a little unwieldy and never really let its characters develop. To be sure, it has an impressive cast and all of them do fine work, but few of them outside of Johnny Depp were given any room to make an impression. Still, this is a well-crafted film from a technical perspective, with excellent camera-work, a good score (courtesy of Junkie XL, no less), and a welcome return to form by Johnny Depp. This is the best I've seen him in years, possibly since DONNIE BRASCO. For all of the faults in the narrative structure, Johnny Depp is what makes this worth watching. There are times when he was legitimately frightening, even though a couple of these moments were partially given away in the trailers. Although BLACK MASS aspires to be in the same company as GOODFELLAS and DONNIE BRASCO, it doesn't quite live up to them, at least in terms of lasting quality and rewatchability. Still, it is a perfectly serviceable true crime tale with a top-notch performance by Depp, itself alone to recommend at least one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This biopic of a famous Boston crime lord falls flat for a number of reasons. Depp acts his socks off and the make-up and camera departments deserve credit for imbuing a coldness in those blue blue eyes. Cumberbach also copes ably with a role that is a departure from much of his previous work. But the story fails to engage. The main problem is the FBI office. The complicity of the FBI in the rise of this nefarious individual is what makes this story stand out, but the squabbling between the various characters in that setting lacks gravitas. Kevin Bacon is unusually limited. The story chases Boston authenticity, forsaking gripping drama in the process. There is one scene where Bulger plays mind games with an FBI officer over the dinner table about a 'secret' family recipe. A potentially dramatic scene, if we hadn't witnessed it before, beat for beat, in Goodfellas. Taking a cookie-cutter to that iconic 'You think I'm funny?' scene is symptomatic of the lack of ambition and verve in this film. Not a terrible film, but the lack of risk, or surprise, is disappointing. The filmmakers should have watched 'Snowtown' before starting out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stellar showcase of Depp's talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a film that intrigued me from the initial trailer with its atmospheric and chilling introduction to this portrayal of such a notorious gangster.As someone who hadn't heard of James Bolger until this film (whether that's weird or not I don't know) I found it fascinating to learn about his story and his life through Johnny Depp's portrayal of Whitey. This truly is a showcase of Depp's acting chops through and through, with other great performances from actors like Joel Edgerton and Kevin Bacon.Director Scott Cooper and writers Mark &amp; Jez don't hold back on showing some of the more gruesome aspects of this gangsters life. The harsh, grounded and brutal scenes really strike a chord with you and make you fear this person, really making you feel lucky you didn't live in South Boston during the 80's.Wonky pacing makes for an uneven film and some actors I felt were a little miss-cast (as much as I love him as an actor I don't feel Benedict was a good choice for Whitey's brother), but overall this is an enjoyable yet haunting true tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp rarely disappoints and most especially does not here. Scott Cooper has assembled a superb supporting cast, and elicited brilliant performances from them all around. It is absolutely beautifully shot...the lighting, angles, tone...everything. Dark and emotional, yet with an undertone of functional coldness. It mirrors the characters, the emotional tone of the content, as well as the era. Coupled with a poignant score throughout, ranging from funk/disco to classic strings, you are taken on an emotional ride touching all bases. Be advised: this is not an action shoot- 'em-up gangster flick. This is a journey into the mind and soul.Blood, honor, and loyalty...peppered with more than a touch of psychopathy. Bulger is a complicated and conflicted man and Depp seems to have captured all of him, especially his humanity, flawed as we all can be. I sincerely hope that he sees this film &amp; realizes the honor Johnny has done him in this portrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>long, slow paced Boston mob movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From 2015, Black Mass is the story of Boston mobster Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), the boss of the Boston Irish Mob called the Winter Hill Gang. His brother was President of the Massachusetts Senate, William Bulger, here played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Under investigator John Connelly (Joel Edgerton), Whitey served as an informant, with Connelly giving information to the FBI. Whitey's crimes were ignored as he fed them info on other gangs, using the FBI to destroy other gangs while his stayed in power. Once his activities - drugs, murder, racketeering, money laundering, Irish gun running, and extortion were exposed, everyone was humiliated. Bulger took off for sixteen years, finally arrested at the age of 81 in California, and is now in prison.The performances are all terrific. I lived in Boston and I personally saw nothing wrong with Benedict Cumberbatch's accent, or anyone else's -- when people don't want to like you, they don't, and that's it. Edgerton and the rest of the cast were very effective.Depp is terrifying, keeping his voice low but ready to snap at any second. A marvelous performance. I'm not sure why Cumberbatch did this film - he doesn't have a very large role. He reminded me a little of Dennis Quaid here, though I'm not sure why.Truth be told, I watched this because I love Depp and Cumberbatch, but this to me was not a great movie. Lots of violence and the f-bomb every other word is fine, but putting up with all that blood just wasn't worth it. In the hands of a less experienced cast, I think this would have a real dud.I think the pace could have been much better, and at 2 hours and 3 minutes, maybe 10 or 15 minutes -- a couple of strangulations perhaps - could have been cut. We got the point - cross him and he'll kill you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp's best performance in five years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Shadow, Transcendence, The Lone Ranger, Into the woods Mortdecai-heck, even Pirate of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides are all related. And they related together as a list of mediocre to universally derided films that A-list actor Johnny Depp has headlined in the past few years. Truth be told, the actor always seem comfortable in eccentric style of acting: playing unserious characters with the strangest of make-ups and costumes. Not to take anything away from the actor, but he has featured in serious roles, which are a far-cry from his comfort zones. But when an audience becomes accustomed to your playful nature in the movies, then it's hard to take you serious even when you are trying to be-exactly the case in (Transcendence) is.In Black Mass, Johnny plays James "Whitey" Bulger: a notorious Boston gangster from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. Boldly, I can say this is one Depp's finest performance in the last five years if not in his whole career. He takes the character and makes it his own. That "crime" coating fits his every being and personality. He plays it in such a way that you dread meeting the personality real life: maniacal, dangerous, cold and calculating-his operandi of taking out potential enemies in the film while playing the crime boss of Boston's underworld is riveting. More so because he stares coldly into the eyes of each kill. This is one of those set-ups where the attributes of the real life figure doesn't matter because the person acting it out in front of you has done the most evil to convince you of how far that crime figure is willing to go.Then, in an opposite demeanour, he seems empathetic. There are several scenes throughout the film where Johnny's character partakes in mob activities and at the same time takes part in playing the father/son/husband/brother figure. In the role of a son, he imbibes loyalty and respect-the role of a father, moral teacher and understanding-the role of a husband appropriate non-violence bouts of naughtiness. But in the underworld, he is ruthless as ever. Basically, the film avoids delving further into the past life of Whitey Bulger like a biopic would-starting only after his freedom after his first incarceration. And from there build upwards into his collaboration with the FBI and how he uses this advantage to gain the upper hand in running his activities uninterrupted.The old school vibe of the film is solid considering the disco era of the 1970s and the film is not like of those that spotlights on how crime figures live an extravagant lifestyle. In a way, the film is self contained-much more like in a neighbourhood, which only aims to follow a group of friends around: in this case Johnny's character and his entourage, half of whom he kills. The film gave me another perspective on the city of Boston. Severally, the camera narrows in on empty streets and quiet neighbourhoods in a kind of everybody knows everybody when the citizens are shown while promoting their traditional values. No threads are explored. Here, it is all about the character of Whitey and how ironically the city's crime boss is the older brother to the most powerful politician in the state: played by Benedict Cumberbatch: a fascinating story for audience who decide to research the story.The FBI complicity in the crimes are told through the story of supporting character Billy Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), much like how it happened real life. Furthermore, the supporting cast all get to shine in their own capacities. Dakota Johnson impresses playing Whitey's life-showing she has got range and could excel if given the right material to work with. Corey Stoll represents that no-nonsense lawyer willing to bring down the mob boss. And Benedict Cumberbatch is on that naive character side choosing to ignore his brother's crimes. For a crime drama, Black Mass is sharp, on-edge and spellbinding: an opportunity which Johnny Depp uses to remind us that he's still got talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic and Revealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on actual people and real events. It's not a typical crime thriller, it's a realistic classic on the same level as Goodfellas.Director Scott Cooper, the screenwriters and lead actor Johnny Depp do an excellent job of gradually revealing the personality of Whitey Bulger, a true psychopath. Bulger is quick to betray his friends and is unforgiving even to his closest associates when they present the slightest threat to him, while at the same time he demands total loyalty from everybody around him.I haven't liked Joel Edgerton in other roles, such as Ramses in Exodus: Gods and Kings, but he is the ideal actor to play John Connolly.Black Mass moves along at just the right pace, not too fast for character development and yet quickly enough so that it's never dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1000 faces of delusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the typical gangster film, with rise and fall and a series of tense situations. It's not Goodfellas but in that lineage of unspoken titillation at what people get away with; it seems we'll always want to be flies-in-the-wall in the same room with horrible men, tiptoe out from our lives of social convention to sneak a peak at a life of gross irresponsibility.Of the two things that stand out in this peak one is Depp continuing to be our current Lon Chaney Sr; here donning a ghastly new face and glacial stare as Boston mobster who menaces everyone, adding another face to the Depp gallery. I would love to see him as Dr. Mabuse.It's the usual gangster role since Cagney first delighted us by tearing holes at the life of convention, only with the studied reserve that Depp brings to films. Cagney threw himself at the room, Depp glides cautiously. Whereas others would simply have played a guy, you can tell that he has spent copious time constructing, studying mannerisms and inflections. It seems that he almost always needs the remove of a mask from which to immerse himself.The other thing that I liked here is that we don't just have crime plots and counterplots but these understood in the light of what gives rise to a profoundly illogical world at large; ours, as we spy shades of it daily in the news.People come together to create bonds and form alliances, mobsters against another more dominant fraction, mobsters and Feds in cahoots against that faction, mobsters and Florida businessmen skimming together off the top, mobsters and IRA in alliance for the good of a cause, other Feds against the corrupt former ones. We see enough of it to imagine that it goes on forever in myriad guises.Bonds of this kind being a matter of seeing yourself in a common ground with others, this ground is always constructed on the basis of shared storytelling. It can be loyalty or justice, or having grown up in the same neighborhood. But when this internal logic is upheld against common human sense, that ends up creating deluded human beings and an illogical world, one where a law agency turns a blind eye to crime in one side of the city to quash it in another, only to find the whole city still festered with it.You'll see tribal allegiances of this kind whenever humanity is beset by violence and oppression, sometimes as response. This is true from mafia and drug cartels to the cartels of financiers and politicians. It's - partly but significantly - why the Middle East is full of rips in the fabric and only held together with brute force.Interestingly we're shown that all the relevant information that helped them make progress were already available to them in the depositions of informants, Bulger gave them nothing of substance. The whole plot was to no avail, all they needed was in plain sight of them, if only they had looked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Around a Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested in seeing this movie, considering it's ratings are the quickest falling ones I've ever seen (going from a 9.5 to a 7.2 in a couple weeks), I was curious as to how good it actually was, and I'm happy to say that it's actually a very impressive film. The plot is very good. The idea is great, and it actually feels like it could be real. It is based off a true story though, so you'd hope so. It manages to pull off it's plot very well too. It's interesting and although I didn't always know who the minor characters were I always figured out what their importance was, plus they were minor so it didn't matter too much. Despite progressing over the course of 10 years and showing barely any of it, it's still paced relatively well too. The characters are good. While I couldn't always tell the difference between some characters (two specifically) you knew the ones who were important pretty well. The secondary characters didn't receive a whole lot of development, nor a lot of screen time. It didn't take away from the movie though. The two main characters, Whitey and Connolly, were great. The acting on their parts were fantastic too, especially Johnny Depp. It's to be expected, but he was perfect for the role. He's intimidating, a little scary, but he still makes Whitey feel like a real person that you could almost sympathize with. Joel Edgerton as John Connolly was great too, but Depp was still the star in terms of acting.While the first hour of the movie is well-paced, the last hour isn't so much. I found myself glancing at the lasting run time often, only to see that only 5-10 minutes had gone by. It wasn't that it was uninteresting, the last hour was fantastic, but it was a little slow. Going into this movie I thought there'd be a bit of action (gun fights, etc.), but that didn't happen. Normally when a movie isn't the genre that I expected, it ends up not being as enjoyable, but this movie still managed to hold my interest, despite my expectations. Overall Black Mass is great. It's got a great, well-executed plot, great characters and acting, and decent pacing. Maybe I'll just have to see it again. I'm certainly looking forward to doing so. In the end I would certainly recommend Black Mass to anyone looking for an awesome crime drama, just don't expect a whole lot of fights, because like I said, it's a drama.</fullReview>

More precisely, his character is more interesting than the movie star's character.I don't have much to say about that one. I have been bothered through ALL the movie by the prosthetics used on him. Couldn't he have shaved his head instead? You know, Christian Bale transformed his hair in American Hustle in a very credible way. Here it was not. And don't get me started on the eyes! No, No way, Hell no! Oh and all the movie! The editing! Really I don't like to say so many negative things. But the scenes were often too long and not significant enough. It was always like a sauce that never thickens. Odd. At some point, there is this view from the sky, and it's halfway of the movie, and I got me thinking : I could as well stop now! They should not have put a big star on the movie poster and all these little faces below him. Because these little faces are what saves this movie.

However what useful information Jimmy actually gives the FBI as an informant isn't entirely clear except one scene where John Connelly (Jimmy's FBI confident played by Joel Egerton) turns up to the office with a load of snaps of Jimmy's rival gangster clan hanging out. The film looks great but the audience never really get to know any of the characters. Towards the latter stages of the film Joel Egerton acts every scene as if he's on his fifth shot of whiskey which is mainly caused by the introduction of an FBI investigator keen to pursue Jimmy's criminal activities. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Jimmy's brother, who is also the state senator. After the perimeter's of the film have been established the pace slows and a scene by a beach that caused me to hope there would be a tsunami was a reminder the action was on gangster movie cruise control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp becomes Whitey Bulger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may seem like a bold statement, but this might just be Johnny Depp's best performance of all time. Depp's always been one of my favorite actors and I just loved that he decided to do this movie, because, despite his talent, it just felt to me the characters he portrayed lately are kind of Tim Burton parodied versions of himself or something. But I love that he went for this project, because he absolutely nailed it, big time. His performance is flawless, but let's talk about some of the other actors in the film who are also great. Benedict Cumberbatch nails the Boston accent, surprisingly, he's great. Joel Edgerton is also pretty fantastic in the move, as well. However, the unfortunate reality of Black Mass, is that it's enormously elevated by its performances, particularly Depp's. I wasn't really invested in the story as I should have been and the plot moves achingly slow. What they really should have done is they should have focused almost entirely on Johnny Depp's character, because every scene he's in is pretty much the best scenes in the film. The entire under the table stuff with the FBI simply didn't do it for me, and it's really a shame because it's like the entire second half of the film focuses entirely on that. However, I do think Black Mass is a good movie, it's just not a great one. But it's worth the price of admission simply to see Johnny Depp.</fullReview>

Regardless, his film have a solid feel to them - they feel robust, and he is great for getting great people in-front of the camera.In this film, the two featured leads, Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, deliver the best work they could possibly do; Depp's performance as James Bulger is malevolent, terrifying, and in many scenes totally believable. He isn't a light, jolly, seductive figure that Depp's reputation lends itself naturally towards, and I think is totally worthy of an Oscar. Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, Bulger's FBI handler who is manipulated is fantastic as the man whose awe of Bulger drags him in deeper and deeper to the point where he can't separate personal and professional boundaries.The biggest problem with the film is that the emotional fulcrum point is around the two most emotionally compromising people. The other cast are fairly wasted; the most notable example is Benedict Cumberbatch, who does great as Senator Billy Bulger, who creates a honorable, no bs man who loses his position because of his brother is pushed to the side despite a great performance with a believable Boston accent.Overall the film is a strong one, but it keeps itself from being perfect. Depp's performance however IS perfect, and is solely worth seeing for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern day Goodfellas with differences in plot and cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've learned that anticipation can occasionally be the enemy of awareness, a lesson that I discovered while watching Black Mass. As a member of the film nerd mafia, I desperately wanted this film to answer one buzzing question - does Johnny Depp still possess the acting chops he held prior to Pirates of the Caribbean? It doesn't matter if you've seen the movie or not, because the answer is dead obvious: yes.Depp shines as James "Whitey" Bulger (or Jimmy, as we are encouraged to call him), an unpredictable and ice-cold gangster who prowls the waters of the story like a great white shark, manifesting his fearless and violent nature at the sign of any given threat. As he dives into the depths of this real-life Boston gangster, he is completely unrecognisable and genuinely frightening, receiving assistance from the talented makeup artists of this film. While this film is designed as a vehicle for Johnny Depp, the ensemble cast further seduces you to go see the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch and Joel Edgerton morph into their roles as Jimmy's allies, while Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott perfectly suit their roles as detectives from the 70s. It goes without saying that the cast is what drives the power of the film.The film, however, does suffer from a weak screenplay that fails to maintain the interest it should. While the film had a strong start and established the characters effectively, the second act mysteriously lacked the tension and controlled pacing that was present in the first thirty minutes. While the premise of a gangster who allies with the FBI to strengthen is own power is genuinely interesting, the film reminded me how movies that are "based on a true story" should be treated with caution. The other noteworthy, and perhaps admirable, element of Black Mass is its unapologetic tribute to Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. The intersection between criminal activity, family life and the ever-looming threat of the FBI all tread familiar territory, while the values of integrity, camaraderie and fortitude make the film feel like a modern day Goodfellas with differences in plot and cast. While I might question Black Mass's decision not to use contemporary music, I should remind myself of the never-ending difficulties imposed by music copyright. Although I feel like a bit of a nitpicker, I am happy to crown Black Mass as Johnny Depp's absolution from shoddy filmmaking, even if the story fails to match the depth of its cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As gangster films go, you could do worse, but that being said you could also do better. Admittedly, what makes this film most interesting is Johnny Depp, and if it hadn't been for him the film would be yet another formulaic gangster movie, with all the same clichés and the same basic plot as countless others. Which it is of course, but its just slightly more interesting.Depp's performance is good because it is unusual for his career. In my opinion Blow was both a better film and better acted, but here Depp plays to his age, which is new, and he does it very well. Depp's character, James Bulger, was a homicidal psychopath who once stole a poor mans winning lottery ticket so he could add a few extra million dollars to his million dollars. Quite why we should have a film that glamorises that I don't know, but I digress. The point is that Depps performance is so charismatic that we find ourselves rooting for this scumbag until the very end.Depp's acting aside there are some good moments, but those moments are spread thinly between gangster caricatures and, to be honest, an obvious plot. Its well written, adequately directed and generally strong in most areas but it lacks that special something that would make it deserve to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a man who knows his crime movies, I was very stoked to see this. The advertising campaign made this movie look like the cinematic event of year. Everyone got so excited, that they got disappointed when they realized that it wasn't another Goodfellas. Let's be honest, how many movies are? It was really never meant to be in the first place. The Whitey Bulger story is something much slower, creepier and slimier. Black Mass is the Whitey Bulger story, as it really went down. With everything considered, it is nothing short of a great crime movie. At the center of it all is a tour-de-force performance by Johnny Depp. It's the best performance he's done in more than a decade. He has the Best Actor nominations on lock. Every time he is on screen, you cannot keep your eyes off of him. He's fascinating, and yet absolutely revolting. Other than Depp, we have a so-so performance by Joel Edgarton, and a surprisingly stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger. It's as violent as any great gangster movie, and just as well shot. I think it's not to be missed, as long as you remind yourself that this isn't going to be Scorsese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I was disappointed. I watched with greater expectations than I should have. The film failed to engage my interest (that doesn't mean it wont engage someone else's)I had seen Legend recently which was a far better production and Tom Hardy superb; so films with a Gangster theme appear to be prominent this year. This film also based on a true story was far grittier and didn't glamorise the actions of those that the film portrays - Johnny Depp is almost unrecognisable as Whitey Bulger which the film is essentially about. This could have been a brilliant film instead it is a collaboration of scenes mismatched together threaded together to make some sense which it fails to do as you don't connect to the characters in it; becoming ordinary and pedestrian instead of gripping your attention as say characters in the Departed which has been often referred to in reviews. I agree with a previous reviewer that had more emphasis been put on the development of the characters from childhood Whitey Bulger, John Connoly and Billy Bulger (brother and senator) and how this then transformed into later life this would have been a really good film as it is, it is worth watching but don't break a leg to do so. It also fails in the final 30 minutes as it doesn't show us how we get to the bringing the gang down - it simply just happens! there is no tension or how it all unravels. Watch the Departed on DVD for a real gripping film and Legend for better acting and a better presented story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is at times engaging and throws you in a world of vivid characters. Depp particularly shows that despite the foibles of his past years he is still a great actor. Yet despite those few gems the movie is coated with a deep layer of mundanity that does nothing but leave you with a sense of emptiness after the movie is done.Black Mass suffers from a common ailment of Based on True Events films in that real stories do not fit nicely into narratives. That's especially true for films that try to span many years. Black Mass, like many such films, feels rough around the edges like it just doesn't have the time to tell the entire story so it just bites off pieces here and there making the finished work look like Cliff's Notes of a much larger story.I didn't feel satisfied with what I got in the end. The movie doesn't focus on any one character or at least paint a portrait of the criminal world. To tell the truth I felt rather disappointed after the movie ended because I expected so much more from this film. I do believe it had the potential for greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp Is The Only Positive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp's acting is as always amazing however even that could not save this movie. From the trailer I had the impression of going to see a mix of 'The Departed' and 'Johnny Brasco' however with so much going for it this movie failed to deliver. My main issue with this movie is that the Character Development is average at best. You get no sense why Johnny Depp (Whitey Bulger) and Joel Edgerton (FBI Agent John Connolly) have such a deep connection. With a great cast it is sad that the plot fell so far behind. It is worth watching but I would definitely wait for it to be on DVD/Streaming Service. This movie is just not worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performances from Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton save Black Mass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing that will surprise you about Black Mass is why we ever doubted Johnny Depp in the first place.In all fairness Depp hasn't had the best track record as of late but not for his lack of effort. Yes he loves to hide behind make-up and prosthetics, but doesn't Mr. Depp always sink into these bizarre characters like a glove? His range of performances is something to be admired, and his portrayal of the notorious South Boston gangster Jimmy "Whitey" Bulger is no different. It's simply an outstanding performance. The entire film seems to hinge on it; he's captivating, frightening, odd, and charismatic all at once. And Depp isn't the only one doing great work here. Benedict Cumberbatch does a fine job with that difficult Boston accent, Kevin Bacon is reliable as usual, Dakota Johnson, Corey Stoll, Jesse Plemons all provide solid character work. But the real standout is Joel Edgerton. This man is unstoppable as of late. With The Gift earlier this year and now his turn as a corrupt FBI agent in this film, Edgerton has established himself as a true talent we can expect great things from. But with all these fantastic performances the film just isn't that memorable.Director Scott Cooper does an admirable job but his approach to the content lacks insight or originality. The story stays engaging at first but looses steam midway and never seems to find it's footing near the end. Overall it's an entertaining film thanks to its actors but won't be leaving you wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Departed" in Real Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was the first thing I thought when I started watching this very slow-burn take on the life and times of Whitey Bulger.I have read a few other reviews that seem to agree, this film starts of slow, and pretty much remains slow, but with each new development more corpses are buried under the pier, and you have to ask how can anyone remain clean? "1000 faces of delusion" maybe put it the best, "It's not Goodfellas but in that lineage of unspoken titillation at what people get away with; it seems we'll always want to be flies-in-the-wall in the same room with horrible men".And as much as I enjoyed Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather Trilogy, and even The Departed, those were fantasy stories maybe slightly based on real life figures.But the image of Whitey Bulger is so unusual that this story is fascinating. And Bulger's own background - This film does not touch on his alleged involvement with the MK-ULTRA Program, but it shows this somewhat charismatic crook in a most realistic manner.Johnny Depp seems to have been born for this role, he even looks a lot like the man, makeup aside. And what starts out as an idealistic young FBI agent, Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, ends up deluding himself. It all sounded so good, when he met Bulger and proposed a way to take down a rival Mafia gang, but what started out as something "for the good of all" (of course, except for the rival gang) ended up as an escalating pile of bodies and a geometrically increasing Body of Lies. In setting up an ambitious alliance with Bulger, Connolly forgot why he was doing it, and from then on was a total loss.It seems that anyone who became involved with Bulger's business became horribly dead as well. And Bulger did not stop with Business Associates, family and friends were not immune. But we still approach the character as a human being, his relations with his mother and "little brother" Billy (Played well with a great accent by Benedict Cumberbatch) are all the same things we all have in common. And the fact that Billy Bulger was somewhat protected from the worse part pf Whitey's activities, seems like what our family members do for us.Regardless of this, there are no "Happy Endings" here, and the bad guys don't get away with it. In the long run, everyone has to account for their actions. I would only hope real life is the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Black Mass' reminded me of two things.One: Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Also set in South Boston, also about the ties between the Boston crime scene and law enforcement agencies, also focusing on the characters of two men. The difference is that 'The Departed' is about infiltration, and 'Black Mass' is about cooperation.Two: the so-called IRT-affair, a scandal that shocked the Netherlands in the nineties. Police forces had knowingly turned a blind eye on large scale cocaine smuggling, hoping to get information in return. After a parliamentary inquiry had uncovered the scandal, investigation methods were changed thoroughly.In 'Black Mass', the Boston branch of the FBI gets involved in a similar affair. It's based on true events, involving the close ties between FBI agent John Connolly and crime lord James 'Whitey' Bulger. Both men grew up in the streets of South Boston, developing an unwritten code of honour that served them both well.The movie shows excellently how both men are slowly stretching the limits they are prepared to cross. Connolly knows he goes too far by protecting a murderer and drugs trader, but goes on regardlessly, driven by his code of honour and above all his ego and burning ambition. Bulger, on the other hand, at first is hesitant about cooperating with the FBI, but tells himself it is alright because it is a business alliance instead of an information exchange.Some reviewers complain that this is a crime movie without crime. That's true, but that is exactly why I liked this film. It is about the psychological development of two men, who are not really friends, but use each other in their mutual interest. The film shows very convincingly how they are slowly but surely digging their own grave.The performances are great. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the ice cold psychopath and manipulator Bulger is Oscar material. But Joel Edgerton is just as impressive as the streetwise and egotistical FBI agent John Connolly.The pacing and the structure of the film are just right. There are some interesting side stories, such as Bulger's relationship with his brother, the politician Billy Bulger, and the death of his baby son. Also, the respective wives of Connolly and Bulger get some interesting screen time. But overall, the story keeps focused on the downward spiral, caused by the cooperation between the two men.Director Scott Cooper is no Scorsese, of course. But nevertheless, this film is an impressive, well-made and entertaining crime thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Performances all around, but Johnny Depp is the star,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a fantastic crime film that dives deep in the life of Whitey Bulger, one of the most infamous criminals there is, revolving around the FBI's struggles to find any proof of him committing a crime, because of his skills with the law, the story is very interesting and you will find it very hard to believe that it is all completely true. The only thing about this film that I felt was missing was more violence, Bulger lived a long life full of crime, and I think making this film 15A was a mistake, because they weren't allowed show as much as regards to the terrible crime himself and his men committed. It pans away for certain scenes or moves forward to the next scene at times when you can tell things are about to get intense, it would have been better off with an 18's rating. All the performances are absolutely outstanding, ranging from top notch acting from the likes of Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons, and even some unexpectedly terrific turns from the likes of Dakota Johnson, Adam Scott and Kevin Bacon. However, none of these great actors can top Johnny Depp in the lead role, he shines in every scene, he lives and breaths Bulger and it is very clear that he went method for his performance, I've never been unimpressed with him in any movie, but this is some of his best work yet. While it may be lacking in thrills at times, Black Mass boasts a terrific story, excellent character development and outstanding performances, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime drama. The story of real life criminal James "Whitey" Bulger, following his long life of crime in Boston, which he was able to keep up after forming a relationship with the FBI. Best Performance: Johnny Depp</fullReview>

So many things wrong with this film starting with the story though, undeveloped characters and little to no explanation of the back story to James "Whitey" Bulger other than he did some time behind bars because someone snitched on him.The accents are questionable and the dialogue cliché. It tries to copy the great gangster flicks of our time but just ends up being mediocre.When we are introduced to the CIA agent things got a little bit more interesting, but then the film tends to speed past anything interesting as if it's not of any importance and tries to focus on intimate moments between the main characters, it might of worked if the script wasn't so boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp- a massive performance in greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time that we'd had another refreshing mafia pic, although Black Mass is not in the same category as old unforgotten classics. Again, this is based on real characters, Depp at his creepiest, who has his moments, of really making you unsettled, and we love this great actor for it. First off, the acting is superb, no one out of line here, Dakota Johnson looking sexier here than in Fifty Shades, who plays Depp's wife. Whitney Bulger (Depp) was the most feared gangster in Boston, where Depp's obviously done the character justice. Responsible for a supermarket of crime, but impossible to catch. An old friend from the neighborhood, John Connolly (Oz's Edgerton) now, FBI, throws an offer at Depp to be an informant, taking down obvious arch enemy mob figures, Bulger, hates, while maintaining to go on doing what he does. What's truly sad about this arrangement was how John and his partner, got themselves in something way over their head, really copping a tragic blow, by really trying to do good, where Connolly, lucked out most of all with an eye widening and truly unjust sentence. It's the last half an hour, the dangerous situation and predicament of Connolly's and co, that really makes this part of the movie's most engrossing which doesn't ensue as you think it will, as in more blood spattering. There are other frightening moments, and some predictable ones, in this that comes from seeing other mafia pics, but B.M. is another reason, to see a great actor at work, in probably what is his finest hour. Bulger was a despicable figure and there were times, you actually sympathize with him, through his pathetic self, but Depp's performance will leave his mark on ya. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merits to become a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read quite a few underwhelming reviews which I think do not do justice to this captivating film. First of all, forget about "The godfather" or "The departed". It's different, less flashy and maybe also less entertaining, especially for people not used to "slow" movies. However I also find it more realistic and thought-provoking. Some of the more critical opinions point out the "lack of depth of the characters", however we should not forget that real-life carrier criminals are often in fact, less than complicated and certainly aren't the uber cool guys often depicted on screen. They might be intelligent in some cases, but they are greedy, violent and don't have moral boundaries. Frequently they also show sadistic tendencies, as the protagonist does. I consider it exhilarating that there's no glorification of organized crime and those involved in it, just a quite faithful, as far as I know, adaptation of true events.The stellar cast is top-notch, even secondary characters give a convincing performance. Depp's acting is certainly Oscar-worthy, he is unrecognizable and really frightening. Edgerton is just perfect as the sleazy, yet loyal in his own twisted way, cop. Cumberbatch is solid as always, I 'd have loved to see more of Kevin Bacon, one of my all- time favorite actors. Furthermore, I was absolutely stunned by Sarsgaard's performance, he really shines in his small part. I definitively recommend you watch it in the cinema, in order to fully appreciate the style, the musical score and the gloomy atmosphere. I didn't give it a 10/10 rating, because imho the editing should have been slightly tighter, especially during the first third of the film. Otherwise I hope time treats it kindly and puts it among the classics of its genre, as it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm Irish and I live in a Boston suburb. Here is what I would have done to make a better movie. Start the film in the projects when Connolly and the Bulgers were young. Show the environment they were raised in.The cops. the Catholic Church. All were relevant in their upbringing. How being a "rat" was considered more serious than being a murderer. How loyalty was considered the most worthy quality. Tell us something about the growth of Howie Winter and the Winter Hill Gang and how Bulger grew within that gang . Describe the relationship between the Irish gangsters of Southie and the Mafia in the North End. Take the first 30 minutes of the movie as background and then tell the Connolly- Bulger story. I didn't like the way that the Connolly angle shared equal screen with the Whitey angle. As for the Whitey Bulger portrayal, forget the drivel of the tragedies of his son and mother's deaths. The guy was a bad guy. The viewer doesn't need to be reminded that even bad guys have a heart once in a while. I never got the feeling that the whole film was nothing more than the story of a local hood.A little know gangster outside of South Boston. As for the Angiulo family, pure hogwash . My friends and i used to go over the the North End for pizza after a Bruins game and we knew where Angiulo lived so how could the FBI not know. The actors' make up was horrible. Boston accents were pretty good and Depp was good . An o.k. movie but could have been so much better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is being told from the perspectives and narration of Kevin Weeks, John Martorano and Stephen Flemmi, who were the right hand men of the crime lord James (Jimmy) "Whitey" Bulger. In 1975 Jimmy leads a South Boston's small time gang Winter Hill. He recruits Kevin Weeks as he takes him to brutalize Joey Angiulo, member of the competing Angiulo mafia from the North. Meanwhile, an FBI agent John Connolly, who grew up in Jimmy's neighborhood, comes back to Boston. He soon speaks to Jimmy's brother Billy, who's now a senator, to arrange a meeting with Jimmy. Connlly proposes an alliance between them to bring down the Angiulo. One night at Winter Hill's watering hole The Triple O's, one of Jimmy's guy raised his fist in his drunkenness to Jimmy. Jimmy soon takes care of it decisively. Connolly wins his superior's approval about the alliance with Jimmy. Jimmy only told Flemmi about it. Jimmy lost his son to an illness. This makes him more ruthless as he expands his crime activities.In 1981 Winter Hill's illegal activities are racking up a lot of cash, and the gang pays bribes to both the police and even the FBI. Jimmy gives out the address of the Angiulo headquarters to Connolly, making the FBI more lenient to Winter Hill. Jimmy also has a hand in the Miami company Jai Alai. He made the deals with John Callahan and Brian Halloran. Callahan says that the company's new owner Roger Wheeler is being nosy about the bookkeeping, and asks a favor from Jimmy. Flemmi asks Bryan about a hit on Wheeler but Jimmy tells Bryan to leave with some money. Soon Wheeler gets killed. The FBI gets annoyed about it and Bryan comes forward to ask for protection from the bureau. But Connolly dismisses Bryan and calms his fellow agents. He confronts Jimmy about Wheeler but Jimmy manages to get the name of the rat who sold his name out from Connoly, and soon Jimmy kills Bryan. As the FBI again panics about Bryan, they hit the jackpot and arrests the Angiulo head. In celebration Jimmy and his crew takes Connolly to Miami in spring of 1982. Flemmi kills Callahan there at Connolly's knowledge, supposedly strengthening the bond between Jimy and Connolly.In 1985 Jimmy and Billy lost their mother. Jimmy starts supplying arms to the IRA. In cold blood he kills Deborah, the daughter of Flemmi's girlfriend, who was ratting to the police. The district attorney in the FBI's Boston office gets replaced with Fred Wyshak, and Connolly gets a hard time to convince him about Jimmy. His fellow agents also discover that the intel supposedly from Jimmy are actually old ignored intel from other informants. The boat carrying the arms to Ireland gets intercepted due to the pilot being a snitch. Connolly's colleagues deny him the pilot's name but Jimmy soon finds the man and kills him. Connolly's colleague comes clean to the press and opens up publicly Jimmy as an FBI informant since 1975. In 1995 Jimmy left Boston and became a fugitive. He is captured in California in 2011.The story is decently written and shown enough balance for the main focus character Jimmy Bulger. Yet this balance only lasted for about one third of the whole movie, since Jimmy becomes a pure wolf in sheep's clothing until the ending. On the other perspective, most of the other characters also have little to none variation of their original introductory state. John Connolly seems very stupid that for years he doesn't realize he's been played by Jimmy. So does John Morris' indecisiveness which lasted for years. Only Stephen Flemmi's character has a little bit of humanity shown when he stood by as Deborah gets killed.The crime is the real attraction for this movie, pure cold blood executions to be exact. The movie makers were more than able to present us the camera tricks to show those convincing scenes with blood splattering all over and doing it at close distances. Don't expect to find anything like a shootout or the likes in this movie, though. If the movie makers stayed true to history or the book it was based on, apparently Jimmy Bulger is one who prefer silencing his targets "persuasively".The drama parts had good grounding at the first one third or so of the duration. It nicely balances Jimmy's personality by giving depiction of humanity in caring for his son. But after that, it looks like the drama went all gone as the movie prefer to emphasize more Jimmy's ruthlessness after his son's death. Furthermore, The movie isn't being clear about the Lindsey's whereabouts after her loss.The acting in overall is indeed a great job to see. Johnny Depp is truly one of the masters in deep character acting. His portrayal of Jimmy made me forget that he was also the confused Edward Scissorhands and the quirky Jack Sparrow. Add to this is the performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, who although had just a less significant part here, managed to add in a touch of authenticity into his speech's accenting. Having a cast of big names but small parts here turned out to be quite a nice move. Putting the less famous Rory Cochrane and Jesse Plemmons alongside Depp keeps the focus to the relationship between Jimmy and Joel Edgerton's Connolly at significance. Still placing familiar faces like Peter Sarsgaard, Dakota Johnson, Corey Stoll and even Juno Temple helped other scenes to gain attention.My say for Black Mass (2015) is a 6 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see it in the cinemas. It's adequately entertaining as we get to be presented with quite a gripping story based on true events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters without Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I enjoy short movies, this 2 hour film needed to be 3 hours in order to work. Much of the movie is spent introducing characters who are quickly killed off or disappear before the audience gets to know them. The back story for movies such as The Departed helped the audience see the progression of the movie's characters to help them see the motivation of why and what the character is all about. We see the roles played by Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio well defined before we even see the opening credits. We see their past, where they came from, and home they were motivated to become the people they were. Black Mass fails at this miserably. We are introduced to many characters in such a short period of time. Each time, the audience easily looses track on who the main character is because we jump around to so many different people. For example, the movie starts with introducing Kevin Weeks. We start to take a journey with this character in the third person and then quickly leave this character completely to meet more characters. This is a story about James 'Whitey' Bulger. Then again, we spend more time with John Connolly only to loose any connection on what makes either one tick. The audience sees Whitey experience the death of many of his loved ones, but we do not see or hear of anything prior to the movie that would explain who and what he is and how he became that way. The same goes for Connolly's motivation. Just because he's from the neighborhood does not clearly define his motives, let alone his bond and loyalty to Whitey. The side story of the relationship with the Bulger Brothers fall short. The 800 lbs. elephant in the room is not really talked about as the two characters hardly share any screen time. Also, Black Mass does not have a single positive female character. Each is either limited in what they can bring to the story let alone a victim. Leave it to 4 male writers to fail at writing anything positive for a woman. Sadly, Black Mass is one of the best performances Johnny Depp has had in over ten years. The period piece of Boston / Miami in the 70's and 80's is great. The overall story of Black Mass is interesting, but falls short. The reason is simple. The main character is never defined. Although Whitey Bulger is the main star, we spend less than half the movie away from him as we are bored with side stories that are connected but have no connection with the audience. Black Mass could have been great, but did not have enough time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp was great, but the movie was blah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never spill the family secret.The story is about Whitey Bulger, brother of a state senator and the most infamous criminal in South Boston. Childhood friend John Connolly would become a leading figure in Boston's FBI office while Bulger become a figurehead in the Irish mob. When they connected, Connolly convinced Bulger to help take down the Italian mafia - but as things spiral out of control, Bulger finds himself as part of the FBI's Most Wanted.Ever since the first teaser trailer for Black Mass came out, I knew for a fact that Johnny Depp was back to his old roots and finally playing a character that wasn't Jack Sparrow. It looked gritty, sharp, brutal and totally refreshing to see Depp in this type of role. I was hyped as sh*t to see this movie and I couldn't wait to watch Johnny Depp's performance as Whitey Bulger.After finally seeing the movie I can say that Black Mass as a film was alright, but Johnny Depp's performance in this movie was freaking fantastic and he stole the whole show.The positives: This has to be Johnny Depp's best performance in years. I can best describe he's performance as darkly comical, frighting and really uncomfortable at times. That's the power and the weight Depp brought to this performance and he absolutely pulled it off. I'm so happy to see Johnny Depp giving a good performance that wasn't anything like Transcendence or The Lone Ranger. The cinematography in this movie was beautifully shot and the camera work used in the film was just stunning. Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton and Kevin Bacon gave a great performance in the movie.Now for the problems: The movie itself felt pretty empty and very hollow to me. There wasn't anything to latch on to since the movie doesn't have a protagonist or a character that you can relate to. Everyone is a villain.The dialogue in the movie wasn't that interesting and it was very hard for me to latch on. These a lot of police investigation in this movie that was actually documented and to me it wasn't very interesting and I wish that the movie focused a little more on Depp's character.Overall Black Mass has amazing cinematography, a great performance from Depp and good directing. But it isn't something that I'll be watching again anytime soon, because I can't see myself watching this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Movies Are Officially Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like every gangster movie made in the past 15 years is just a weak pastiche of previous gangster movies. Nothing new has been added to the genre in a long time and this film certainly isn't adding anything but canned dialogue and a pointless story. "F you, you F-ing F bal. I'll kill you." For me the roles have reversed between TV and movies. TV, once the ugly step-sister of feature films, has completely usurped the position of movies in modern pop culture. Movies just seemed overly formulaic, the character development is either lacking or forced, and there just isn't room for surprises.We start off with one of the central character's thugs being interviewed. A promising start but this kid all but disappears after the first couple of scenes. Why? Because there are WAY too many characters introduced in the film. The wives, the bosses, the cop's partner, the hit man, the cop's boss, the DA, and on and on. In a TV series this would be possible but not in a two hour movie (that seemed like four hours). How about having a better tory and many fewer characters?And just look at all those movie stars. Movie stars, at least to me, are a complete liability and watching a bunch of tired hacks sleep walk through an even more tired script like Black Mass isn't my idea of a good time. "Look everyone, it's Johnny Depp! He's acting! He's really acting!" I just can't get beyond the fact that I'm looking at Johnny Depp and can never get to the point where I'm seeing a character. I also couldn't get past the fact that it looked like he was dressed up for Halloween as Freddie Krueger. I'll take the TV no-name actors every time.And please just stop it with the accents! I have dedicated my life to learning languages and nothing mugs me more than a phony accent. I have worked to perfect my accents in French and Spanish for years and years yet I would never try to pass myself off as a native.As I've said before, I wouldn't trade one episode of Breaking Bad for all of the movies I've seen in the past three years. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of Taste, Black Mass critic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young director Scott Cooper's third directing experience Black Mass, tells the real story of "James "Whitey" Bulger", a well-known Mobster who was active in South Boston in the period of 1970's until mid-1990's. I found the biography of Whitey Bulger intriguing. Johnny Depp as the Bulger character vitalizer, did well job on the character, And of course, Benedict Cumberbatch's presence in the cast, as William Bulger (brother of Whitey) must have made the attraction on the audience. I found it wise to blend his acting skills, with one of the most characteristic actor, Depp. Generally I admit the casting was good. Everything in the director Scott Cooper's kitchen, such as great actors, cinematography and a unique biography adopted script, has been served to him, to cook. However, I found something missing meanwhile, I was expecting more from the movie. I loved the art direction, shooting angles, acting and etc. But still I felt the attachment problem with the arid taste of editing and directing. The main problems of the latest Hollywood Mobster movies are these actually. The same scenes with individual violent punishments of betray, the boss's and the gangs sudden rise story, depicted in one scene in a few seconds, boss's problems shown as his loneliness as he loses his family members or getting frustrated with his wife and old friends. And in the aspect of the gang members, senior to junior, feeling the boss fear with a thinking of the boss is going mad day by day. The all come as in the right and simultaneous way, just as millions of other similar late Hollywood Mobster movies.Scarface "Tony Montana" had been brought in life by "Al Pacino". It was unique and it still is mentioned as a classic Mob-story because It was the first. The depiction of Tony Montana from his penniless times to become the drug lord of the whole Miami depicted almost same as In this biographic history of Whitey Bulger. Besides, Scarface was more violent and graphic, It wasn't the style that made it apart from it's equivalents (for instance) as "Black Mass". The real difference was its way of giving the sense of ambition and violent side of Tony Montana to the audience, with much more accurate catharsis than the others. I am sure, the acting skills of Al Pacino as playing the character, such as using his mimics, anger expositions, both physical and mental descents and ascents, must have thrilled and caused more emotional changes than the after 2000's mob story movies on the audience while watching Scarface, even second time as well. I felt that way at least. So the missing part was generally the lack of the absorption of the characters by me. It is possible for the director, wanting to stay loyal to the real life story of the Whitey Bulger so that, maybe his calm and creepy silent characteristic depiction was thought to be depicted sovereign. The violence was castrated by the director and the editors maybe, instead of a more novelish way of narration. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it, to get the feeling from a genre that I like to watch. But, for instance, "Kill The Irishman", "Departed" (although I believe that it was inspired by the Hongkong version "Infernal Affairs") and some more other examples of TV and cinema productions, telling the inside stories of Irish mobs made me more attached than "Black Mass". Unfortunately, I must admit that it would be much more effective with its cast, and unique biographical story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp finally playing a serious role without going over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If nobody sees it, it didn't happen."Black Mass is Scott Cooper's follow up to his dark thriller, Out of the Furnace. This gangster film centers on the true story of one of Boston's most wanted criminals, Whitey Bulger, an Irish mobster who served as an informant for the FBI against the Italian Mafia for many years, during which time he used the special treatment to get away with committing several gruesome crimes of his own and rise to the top. The film is extremely slow paced and it focuses on the small details of Whitey's crime life, but it is also a breath of fresh air for its realistic portrayal of the gritty criminal life without sensationalizing these gangsters. The violence is real and gruesome and not something worth celebrating here. It does however prove why audiences love the more fast paced fictitious portrayal of these criminal, because it can become a dull exercise at times to portray these characters as real people. The greatest strength of Black Mass is without a doubt Johnny Depp's portrayal of Whitey because it was exciting to finally see him play a straight role once again. He's menacing without going over the top. The prosthetics were a bit distracting, but it was worth it to get to see Depp playing this older man. Black Mass tries too hard to remain authentic to the real life events and by doing so it becomes a dull procedural at times, but Depp's performance makes it worth recommending. The film centers on Whitey's relationship with a Boston FBI agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) who struck a deal with him during the course of several years. Whitey was asked to snitch on the Italian mafia which would lead to more arrests for Connolly while Whitey was allowed to get away with his criminal undertakings. It was a win-win situation for both of them. The story then closely follows how Whitey went about doing his business with his entrusted men, Kevin (Jesse Plemons) and Steve (Rory Cochrane), performing gruesome executions while the police looked the other way. Meanwhile, Whitey's brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) was rising to the top of the Massachusetts Senate, but he doesn't play a major role in the story. Other characters who are simply introduced but not given much to do are Whitey's partner: Lindsey (Dakota Johnson), Connolly's right hand man in the agency: John Morris (David Harbour), and Connolly's wife: Marianne (Julianne Nicholson). The film uses these characters to explore some of the family dynamics and when it does it works to its advantage, but the film feels like it is missing some cohesiveness between each separate individual. Take for instance a scene where Whitey is sharing a meal with Lindsey and their son while he is explaining to him how to get away with hitting a boy in school who is bullying him. The scene works perfectly to give us a sense of how Whitey thinks and acts, but it doesn't do anything for the film narratively and it feels like a separate scene all together. There are several moments like this that seem to be presented only as facts, but these facts don't add up to much and it drags out the premise making us lose interest in the story. There are some great scenes where Depp is allowed to shine, but other than that the film does miss a lot of its targets. The talented cast is mostly wasted with Benedict Cumberbatch, Juno Temple, and Kevin Bacon given very little to do. Depp and Edgerton stand out since the primary focus of the film is on their relationship, but the side plots don't work. While the film tries to focus on other characters it never feels connected to the main relationship that is so central to the story. Johnny Depp might garner some attention for his performance, but the film will quickly be forgotten come award time. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Black Mass and Depp sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable and sinister and creepy as the real life gangster James Whitey Bulger.But he is not creepy enough. He never seems out of control and totally insane like Heath Ledger's joker in The Dark Knight.It's not just that Depp is unlikeable, he's suppose to be unlikeable, its more the fact that there isn't a single likable character in the movie.Joel Edgerton ticked me off from the moment he appeared in the movie. He looked constipated and fat. And not once was he not wearing a suit where even his neck was covered by the collar of his shirt. I hated his suits and his big hair. Like everyone else in the movie he was scum.The movie is in general depressing and boring. As bad as Good Fellas, which in my opinion is one of the crappiest and most overrated gangster movies ever made.And I love good gangster movies like Donnie Brasco, another gangster movie with Depp where he is so much better. Or The Untouchables or Scarface. Masterpieces within their genre.This could have been an interesting movie if Depp have had the guts to play Bulger like a complete psycho. Like Al Pacino in Scarface. Sure he kills several people violently, but even that is done boring. If there had been even one character worth rooting for it could also have improved the movie.Black Mass is one cliché after another and it goes completely by the book as far as gangster movies go which unfortunately makes it very very boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If nobody saw it, would Black Mass still be another Depp disappointment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If nobody sees it, it didn't happen" - Whitey Bulger In the words of Whitey's devilish advise, I wish, for me, that Black Mass didn't happen. It's not that Black Mass is a bad movie, but it was just so dang boring. One of the year's best casts, stories, and overall opportunities for greatness is wasted with this dull, and minimalist gangster bore.Black Mass, essentially is a canvas for Johnny Depp to re-thrive his recently deadbeat career. Depp, as one of the most infamous gangsters of all time, does not disappoint. The control and maturity of the performance is applaud worthy, and maybe award baiting during next year's Academy Awards. Along side him Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast gives terrific performances. Director Scott Cooper also gives a dark tone and effective camera work that is noteworthy. The screenwriters also give a moderately air tight story that I wouldn't call a weakness, despite the at times over dedicated dialogue. So what went wrong with Black Mass? Let us first get to some plot first.Whitey Bulger's rise from small time gangster to FBI's most wanted man is a well known fact, but not a well known story. How he got there is the primary purpose of Black Mass, I think. When FBI agent John Connolly (Edgerton) moves back into his hometown, he reacquaints himself with a childhood friend who was "very good to him" growing up, Whitey. The problem here is that this is not a simple childhood reunion, due to Bulger being a motivated, psychopathic gangster, and Connolly being a morally corrupt FBI agent. Together Bulgar and Connolly get rid of each others competition and "rats" in order to rise up their respective ladders to a not so respectful end. Black Mass does not focus on the business side of Winter Hill Gang's operation, but instead almost solely on dealing with the FBI, competition, and Bulgar's own paranoia. Him and his goons kill quite a few people in this movie, and you can see most of the executions coming from far away. There is one stand out scene, taking place in a parking lot, that was the only excitement or suspense in this entire movie. Everything was predictable. Everything was boring. The story format was intriguing, especially at the beginning, with Bulger's colleagues informing against him, then flashing back to the crimes being explained. A really interesting development was the refrain from making Depp's Bulgar, "cool". One of his guys who was informing the FBI against him explained Bulger as "just a criminal". Cooper and the writers make sure to not commit the all too common mistake of having people leave the theater praising a serial killing gangster.So what went wrong? The lack of cohesiveness of all the minimalist parts drowning the movie of all excitement or intrigue. Over control and nuance kills this movie. Black Mass did not compel me or bring me into this world of South Boston in the 70s and 80s. I knew I was watching a movie the whole time. While being well made and acted, Black Mass completely fails at being even remotely entertaining or immersive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Movie goers tend to fall into one of two groups when it comes to Johnny Depp ? big fans or denigrators. Whichever side of the line you fall, there are few actors who can claim such a diverse career of on screen characters ranging from Edward Scissorhands to Gilbert Grape; from Donnie Brasco to Captain Jack Sparrow; from Willy Wonka to Sweeney Todd; and from John Dillinger to Tonto. Depp now turns his talents towards one of the most unsympathetic real life characters imaginable ? South Boston's infamous crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger.Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) proves yet again that he is an actor's director, rather than a visual technician or story addict. In this adaptation of the book from "Boston Globe" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, Cooper has Depp and Joel Edgerton as his two leads, and an incredibly deep supporting cast that provide the look and feel for this period piece dramatizing the crime and corruption during Bulger's reign.When one thinks of the memorable kingpins of crime/gangster movies, those that come to mind include Michael Corleone (The Godfather movies), Tony Montana (Scarface), Jimmy Conway (Goodfellas), and Frank Costello (The Departed). The Costello character was supposedly partially inspired by Bulger. What made each of these characters fascinating to watch was the insight we were given into the psychological make-up of each and the inner-workings of their organization. And that's the disappointment of Cooper's film.For the Whitey Bulger story, there are two distinct directions to explore: the building of Bulger's criminal empire, or the motivation of the FBI Agent John Connolly (Edgerton) as he juggled his job and relationship with Bulger. Unfortunately, the approach here is to show a hand full of cold-blooded murders to prove Bulger's management style, and a few FBI meetings that show the obvious uncertainty within the agency. Rather than a muddled mash-up, a more interesting movie would have chosen a path and dug in deeply.Despite the story issues, it is fun to watch how Depp and Edgerton tackle their roles. Under heavy make-up (wrinkles, receding hairline, hillbilly teeth, and crazy contact lenses), Depp becomes the intimidating force of Whitey Bulger. Just as impressive is Edgerton as Agent Connolly, as we witness the Southie neighborhood boys all grown up, but still playing cops and robbers ? and it remains difficult to tell who the good guys from the bad. Edgerton's cockiness and strutting capture the ego and ambition necessary for a federal agent to bend so many rules. In fact, despite the vastly different approaches, it's not entirely clear which of these two fellows possesses the greatest ambition.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother who became a State Senator. We get very few scenes featuring the brothers, and in fact, Cumberbath's best scenes are instead shared with Edgerton. It's difficult not to chuckle at their first meeting in a restaurant as we watch a Brit and Aussie talk it out with south Boston accents. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott play Edgerton's fellow FBI agents, while Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane (especially good) and W Earl Brown make terrific Bulger crew members. Peter Sarsgaard leaves quite the impression as a doped-up associate, while Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple provide the film's minimal female presence. Corey Stoll storms onto the screen as a Federal Prosecutor who is not amused by the relationship between Connolly and Bulger, but this movie belongs to Depp and Edgerton.The concern is that any viewer not already familiar with the Whitey Bulger story may find the story not overly interesting, despite the terrific performances. Fortunately, this viewer was mesmerized by last year's exceptional documentary entitled Whitey: United States of America v James J Bulger ? a must see for anyone who wants full details into the Bulger reign of crime and terror, as well as his 20 years on the lam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I lived in Jersey for thirty years and got use to the dialects or reading about the mob in the newspaper over a cup of coffee at Dunkin Donuts. But to me Black Mass was about as exciting as watching a bad night of karaoke when you've promised yourself you weren't going to drink or smoke anymore.Truth be told, I didn't even recognize Johnny Depp - that's how great an actor he is, but sometimes even a great actor can't save a movie from oblivion.Of course, I realize critics love this type of movie for all the logical reasons they learned in film school, but really, if I hadn't been invited to see it with a friend I would have walked out halfway through.Like I said in the opening, maybe it's just me or maybe the king really isn't wearing any clothes ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing crime-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boston, late-1970s. The FBI are looking to break the Mafia hold on the north of the city. Agent John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton) is on the case and is willing to go to any lengths to achieve his aims. A South Boston native, he decides to "ally" the FBI with South Boston crime kingpin James "Whitey" Bulger (played by Johnny Depp), as his main enemies are the Mafia. Approaching Bulger via his brother Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), a Massachusetts State Senator, Connolly is successful in gaining Bulger as an informant and ally against the Mafia. However, this alliance only seems to embolden Bulger in his quest for power and wealth, as he is able to operate with impunity and utter ruthlessness. Not realising he is being duped, Connolly finds himself backing Bulger, rather than law, order and justice.An engrossing crime-drama, based on a true story. As far as gangster dramas go, it's hardly in the league of The Godfather or Goodfellas, but it's entertaining and, besides, not much is in those movies' league. Superb performance by Johnny Depp in the lead role. His choices of movies of late have been sub-par but this is a fine return to form. Very convincing as a ruthless crime lord, with his alternating between mob boss and doting father quite breathtaking.Good work too from Joel Edgerton.</fullReview>

He is contacted by FBI agent, John Connolly, who grew up in the same neighborhood and they have respect for each other. He wants Jimmy to give intel on the mob- less competition then. So he gives them the address of the mob boss and from there he takes over the streets. Jimmy becomes more powerful while Connolly keeps him safe from prosecution. One rule-no murder. Of course, doesn't take long to break that. Soon, others in the FBI realize they aren't getting intel from Jimmy and that one of their own is in too deep.

		<shortDescription>Depp's Performance Worth The Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This is actually quite easy to review for you: How much do you like Johnny Depp as an actor? He is one of my favorites, so naturally, I gave this movie a borderline recommendation. His Bulger is cold as ice with a penetrating malevolent stare that will freeze your blood. Be warned: this is one dark, brooding look into the 'Winter Hill' gang of Boston. Devoid of the humor of The Departed, this crime drama is deadly serious, I did not think there was even one scene of levity in the entire movie. Actually, one of the creepiest scenes is where Whitey asks one of the Fed's what the secret sauce on his steak was; when the guy first tells him it is a family secret, but then relays it, Bulger glowers at him,"You would give up your F family secret that easily? That makes me wonder what the F else you would give up about me?" What is great about Depp's performance is how understated it is; there are no wild gesticulations, yelling or screaming, he is pure intensity with this laser beam stare. Unlike most mob movies, this one, to its credit, portrays crime as it was: a business. The movie follows Bulger's Machiavellian use of the Feds to destroy his Italian competition; in effect, he uses them to wipe them out while feeding Connolly nothing about his organization and continuing his own nefarious operations out of their vision.There are a few 'Departed' moments with the head Fed Bacon yelling, cursing and charging that felt phony. The main complaint you read here from the detractors does obtain, it is quite slow. The movie is more a look into 'Whitey' and his use of people. Those of you expecting a fast paced action crime movie like GoodFellas are going to be disappointed. Depp's Bulger is best in his quiet malevolence, this seething presence that creeps everyone out like Connolly's poor wife who makes the mistake of retreating from the dinner party which catches Bulger's attention right away. One of his best scenes in the movie is this ominous one with Connolly's wife. Bulger continues using Connolly, and his state senator brother, to protect his operations and destroy the Italians. Not remotely for children, it features some grisly killings performed personally by Bulger. What I did like about the movie was the lack of glamorization of the Mafia. We don't get catchy background classic rock where killings are cool and idealized. One of the most disturbing is a prostitute who heard too much. Bulger takes her into an apartment, pretending it is hers and kills her. We can not see it but we hear it and it takes awhile.The look on the boyfriend's face is what I thought made it unique. Bulger's Evil is not theatrical and just horrible things happen to him. His son dies from an allergic reaction to aspirin, his family dies, there is this sense of his deeds returning back upon him. For all its flaws: slow, dark and depressing, find me another modern American movie that shows the Mafia without the usual making it look cool? If you are a Depp fan, like me, you will not want to miss this performance. Again, it is quite a Hellish journey into Night; you will not be whistling a happy tune when it ends. There are some killings but, really, it is a study of a legendary criminal who was Death walking. Just one outburst, by a drunken associate, was enough to earn you a bullet in the back of your head. I actually preferred this performance to Donnie Brasco. I thought this was a much more mature, skilled Depp reading. For all of its Night, the horrors that came back upon Bulger provided a moral base deep underneath the narrative. It is not nihilistic, Bulger loses everything with a shot of him sitting in his ghost house, everyone dead now. Above all, an honest appraisal of the existential costs of killing others for money.

A well told story, evolving around the main subject Whitey Bulger, in my opinion, opposite of many criticizer's, the movie unfolds brilliantly without necessarily providing a sublime story or plot. Instead the movie is well produced to follow the outcomes of being around or against Whitey Bulger, and how his grab on the Boston streets expands further. An outstanding movie, providing excellent acting well deserving of more recognition. Especially Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton put all of their talent on display.A very underrated crime gem, highly Recommended.Simon B. Nielsen</fullReview>

We see right from the start that "Whitey" is willing to rat out his own kind, mobsters, to the FBI in order to be free to do his dirty work without any interference from the law. "Whitey" has his brother big time state politician Billy, Bennie Cumberbatch, stick his neck out for him that in the end destroyed his meteoric political career.As For "Whitey" himself he just goes through the movie doing his thing in breaking skulls shaking down business with his protection racket and murdering his victims mostly doing it close and personal with the law not for a moment laying a glove on him. At first it was the FBI's attempt to use "Whitey" to get information on his fellow gangsters that seemed like a good idea but later that's turned and bit "Whitey" on his behind with his fellow mobsters, those that he was ratting on, ratted on him to save their own hides.It's when Kojack look alike FBI section chief Fred Wyshak, Corey Stoll, took charge that things start going sour for "Whitey" and his boys or those that were still willing to put up with him and his back stabbing as well as murderous antics; That included shipping arms, as a patriotic juster, to the IRA in its war against the British Empire's occupation of Northen Ireland. On the run for some 15 years "Whitey" finally gave himself up to the FBI that for years covered for him. In the end we see Whitey as an old and broken down man soon to serve two consecutive life sentences for as many as 11 murders as well as the many crimes that he committed through the years from murder racketeering down to public intoxication and shop lifting that dates back to the early 1940's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Mass (2015)Well, Johnny Depp is amazing?almost unrecognizable in this role as a psychopathic Irish mobster. And the vivid realism of lat 1970s and 1980s Boston is impressive?really gorgeous and believable. These are the strengths.The story is, however, another mobster movie where one group is out to get another, and there are betrayals and revenge killings and beatings and a kind of unraveling of the underworld as it gets more and more extreme. Sometimes there's pathos or ironic beauty, but this is no "Godfather" nor "Goodfellas." The characters blend together and so we never quite identify with anyone. And Depp plays the main bad man and, unlike Marlon Brando (for example) he lacks anything even remotely human or admirable. So the viewer is left cold, watching things happen at a distance. It's not unemotional?sometimes it's horrible and shocking?but it's not about feeling for the characters in their brutal, calculating desperate situation. And there is a lot of violence of a very unflinching kind, harder to take than, say, Tarantino's where it's over the top and theatrical. I think this is a kind of good movie that just doesn't rise above. And there are so many movies like this it makes it unnecessary. Good, yes, but old territory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shocking Depiction of a Life in Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp's portrayal of Boston crime boss James "Whitey" Bulger must rank among the most repellent characters in recent Hollywood films. Perhaps the film's greatest achievement is to dramatize how Bulger escaped prosecution for blatant lawless, including racketeering and multiple murders for years. Incredibly, he lived undetected for sixteen years in an apartment in Santa Monica, California, prior to his arrest and conviction to two life terms in prison.One of the themes of the film is the loyalty that existed among the Irish men from South Boston. Bulger had lifelong ties to his childhood friend John Connolly, who became a career FBI agent and protected Bulger for years as a presumed informant. The sleaziness of the FBI agent, the associates of Bulger, and Whitey Bulger himself are a great accomplishment of the filmmakers.While much care went into the recreation of the period of the 1970s and '80s, the pacing of the film was slow and there were too many extraneous subplots and incidental events portrayed. The editing could have been tighter to focus on Bulger. Except for the depiction of his devotion to his mother and the tragic death of his young son, Bulger's personal life was not fully developed. It was not clear, for example, why he would not be a pallbearer at his mother's funeral.Despite its shortcomings, the film was a compelling portrayal of a life in crime and the shocking incompetence of the police and the FBI to allow Bulger to create mayhem and madness in Boston for so many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not that great of a movie. For a story that is supposed be on one of the most dangerous gangsters in U.S. history, it lacked suspense. The story went on at an incredibly slow pace. There was not anything happening that would keep interest for what was about to come.It was weird to have two brothers on opposite sides of the law. Whitey Bulger, played by Johny Depp, is the gangster. William Bulger, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is a senator of Massachusetts.It did not make sense that providing the FBI with valuable information to take down the mob is considered as business because it meant saving your own life. But if someone else had spoken to the police or law officials and gave up any information it was considered snitching, and it resulted in that snitch being murdered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's forget for a moment that this is a movie about real (and still living, at least some of them) persons and concentrate on the "movie" part. This is one of the flick perfect for generally underestimated actors to show what they can do when given an opportunity. Depp is excellent and everything else is on a high professional level. Story is a bit depressive (and confusing at moments - apparently you cannot encompass such a complex man/story in so little given time), but I guess that's how it was, more or less. And it was a pleasant experience to see J. Depp in a such demanding role doing an excellent job (even with blue contact lens). Not DiCaprio excellent, but close. Worth a watch, but not many times.</fullReview>

Julianne Nicholson and Joel Edgerton as the Connolly couple.There was nothing sentimental per Bulger - a foul human being from the get go -a loser and one committed to infecting all with his twisted psychopathic homicidal mind set.No cutsie sarcasm or 'insert the racist, ethnic or fag joke here' as Scorcese is want to do - rather a gritty dusty wind blown accounting by former associates and flunkies that did Whitey's bidding.A great film and Depp should be proud of his performance.The Departed had the hip: crew, music, director, sarcastic ridden script all of it. As time wears on that very Scorcese trait will sink it below 'Black Mass'.</fullReview>

This is based on the true story and like any true story it is boring and long winded, Whos life have you ever listen to that is more interesting? I never met a person that had a movie quality life, it is all Hollywood and they did a great job with this one. rent it and buy it if you're a gangster aficionado. The movie starts off with a good story line and starts to roll uphill into the American dream for anyone bold enough to grab on to it. You can say that the business gave him the strength and just like politics it kept getting bigger and bigger where there where loyalist helping him to become the one crime family that they can control. It is crazy that this man was never murdered in jail for working with the feds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure at first about the choice of Johnny Depp to play the infamous Boston mob kingpin "Whitey" Bulger, as it seems of late his cinematic output has been at best , uneven, and at worst, abysmal. Under Scott Cooper's direction, though, Depp turns in a performance that is truly astonishing. Depp manages to convey both unbridled mob violence with scenes of domestic tenderness, often within mere seconds of one another. He is ably supported by the fantastically cast Joel Edgerton as the not-so-upright FBI agent who nails a perfect Bostonian accent in addition to the nuances of his conflicted relationship with Bulger. In fact, all the supporting roles are faultlessly cast. Benedict Cumberbatch-who seems destined to become the all-time winner of the Cinematic Workaholic Award at the rate he's racking up roles-is exquisite as Bulger's social climbing yet loyal brother, and Kevin Bacon and Peter Sarsgaard both give their brief appearances wonderful texture and depth. My one negative is the failure to really flesh out the female characters, with the exception being that of a young hooker who has one of 2015's great dramatic scenes. I love love love that particular scene both for the heartbreaking emotion and self-assured camera work. Hopefully this is the start of more good work to come from both Depp and Scott Cooper.</fullReview>

Depp was controlled, measured and sweeping against all odds. But the main sad thing was,it was not more than an alliance between two southies in boston, it delivers a vile piece of criminal story with gloomy performances from the solid-rock actors.

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp gives a cool performance in this misguided mob flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whitey Bulger is one of the most notorious American criminals in history. His story is meant to be recorded on the big screen in order to document the overwhelming power and influence he had on the Boston mafia and on America. Sadly, "Black Mass" fails to do so. Even though Johnny Depp gives a cool and menacing portrayal of Bulger, the writing and directing is misplaced, focusing more on the cops than the criminals. If more focus was taken away from the FBi who negotiated and bribed the Boston gangster and was directed towards the man himself, then you'd have a story. Instead you get cop cliché's and the same broken record of a story played out that leads just as expected. Bulger's story is unique and dark, great material for a film. It's a shame that opportunity was missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Bulger's playing us, making a fool of the Bureau. We're in too deep, and he knows it! God help us all.'Director Scott Cooper brings us via screenwriters Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth the true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf. It sounds impossible but the tale is true and the director makes sure every detail of every person involved is summarized at film's end. If Mafia type crime films are your cup of tea BLACK MASS will certainly satisfy. For most, despite a huge case of outstanding actors, the story is so fragmented that it seems an ongoing bloodbath and once again we are privy to the corruption within the law enforcement system ? especially in Boston. The synopsis pulls it together rather well: 'Based on a true story of James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp), an Irish Mob godfather and FBI informant who had a "secret trading" deal with his brother, William "Billy" Bulger (Benedict Cumberland), a state senator and a Boston public figure, and John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), an FBI agent. They planned to take down the Italian mob and mafia in Boston, which went awry and things turned massively violent. When the credence for each other began fading out, drug dealing, murders, and extortion started to rise, and forced the FBI's Boston office to confirm that Whitey Bulger was one of the most notorious criminals in US history and also one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals.'Take a look at the cast ? Peter Sarsgaard, Kevin Bacon, Dakota Johnson, Juno Temple, and an array of bit part players each with viable varying accents of Boston areas ? and you can see how this violent evening would work. History here ? and it still is going on.</fullReview>

After I get the story, it is captivating because of the moral decisions of the characters in the story. It is captivating to see Jimmy Bulger getting increasing distrusting, killing everyone who he suspects might be in his way. The fact that John Connolly blurring what is right and wrong, and forgetting where his loyalty lies is also very captivating. I find the film rather violent, and it made me jump quite a few times.

		<shortDescription>A very solid true story movie, not the best gangster movie by far, but a very descent one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Black Mass" (2015) is a very true story about a local mobster in Boston, who by the help of FBI ruled the streets for some time. This is a very good movie, absolving one, with great acting by all involved, very solid directing, engaging script that never isn't boring, and is involving from start till finish. That said "Black Mass" isn't "Goodfellas" by any means, because you can re watch "Goodfellas" again and again, and "Black Mass" is basically a one time movie, but nevertheless it is a very solid one. The best acting in this movie was not Johnny Depp's (altough he is VERY good in here, haven't enjoyed Johnny Depp's movie in very, very long while now), but from superb and always reliable Joel Edgerton. He creates or recreates in this case this FBI guy, who is as much as a good guy trying to do good, but at the same time he is more then an friend to James 'Whitey' Bulger - and that isn't a really good thing considering the circumstances, but he was as he was. This is a very solid performance. And about Johnny Depp - in the beginning of this movie noticing his eye lenses and make up - it was a bit to heavy in my opinion even distracting, but it grown on me during the movie, it is a very solid performance.Overall, Scott Cooper, a great director (of a brilliant "Out of the Furnace") does a very solid job in recreating true events. I liked this movie very much, it not a classic by any means, but just a very solid film. I also liked that this movie never tried to show any glimpses of Whitey's redemption or anything like that - he was a bad guy at the beginning, middle and the end - he is just a bad guy. All in all this is a very solid movie for one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome Return To Form For Johnny Depp In A Biopic Marred By Uneventful Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bolstered by a truly magnificent performance from an actor who has a penchant for playing larger- than-life characters, Black Mass is another entry into last year's long list of biopics and although it paints a gripping portrait of a notorious crime boss, it's also marred by its generic plot &amp; uneventful storytelling.Based on a true story, Black Mass chronicles the criminal life of infamous Irish-American mobster Whitey "Jimmy" Bulger and focuses on the years when he became an informant for FBI for his own self-interests and assisted them in eliminating the rival gang while carrying out his crime business under federal protection at the same time.Directed by Scott Cooper, there isn't really anything worth mentioning about his latest movie other than Depp's show-stealing work which is probably the only thing that keeps this film afloat for the majority of its runtime. It's a shame considering that Depp gives one of his best performances in a very long time and yet everything else in the movie stays on base level.Production design team does well in recreating the timeline its story is set in, camera-work is finely carried out, Editing isn't that special for the plot unfolds by putting one factual event after another without any sort of build-up or elevation. The background score by Junkie XL also fails to add any excitement to the story and from a technical standpoint, this is mediocre work.Coming to the performances, Black Mass packs a terrific ensemble in Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon &amp; others but it's only Depp who leaves a lasting impression. It actually feels good to watch him play an interesting character once again and like his best works in the past, he overshadows everything &amp; everyone. The supporting work, however, is disappointing.On an overall scale, Black Mass isn't by any means a great crime drama or a fascinating biopic but it works as a welcome return to form for Johnny Depp whose career had almost faded into oblivion. While it certainly wasn't as underwhelming as I was led to believe, it's still an empty picture whose only saving grace is the vicious, intimidating &amp; charismatic performance from an actor who was in severe need of a role like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Mass could have been great. Like American Hustle, it's great true crime material. South Boston Irish mob, psychopath ultra violent gangster, brother of a senator, gang war with the Italian mob, ambitious and corrupt FBI agents. However, unlike American Hustle the screenplay just plays out like a loose documentary, with no real sense of drama or emotional character development. I kept thinking this should be great like American Hustle, but instead of getting sucked into it's world and caring about the characters like in American Hustle, I just felt like I was watching a docudrama. There were many opportunities to develop deep empathy and emotional ties to John Conley, Billy Bulger, and Steve Flemmi. But the writers or film makers just provide a superficial glimpse into their internal conflicts and flaws, and never develop them enough to build a relationship with the audience. The writers also never explore any kind of background on what made Whitey Bulger, Whitey Bulger. He's just a mean criminal thug, and that's it. And it's not for lack of circumstance. South Bronx, brother of a senator, friend of an FBI agent... This could have been so good. Johnny Depp and the make up artists on the other hand deserve Oscar nods or statues. I'd forgotten how good of an actor Johnny Depp was when he's not playing a feminized drunken pirate in every movie even when it's not Pirates of the Caribbean. I forgot this was Johnny Depp so many times, and just some unlikable middle aged Irish thug. Depp's acting and the makeup artists were amazing. Completely believable. But not enough to make this more than an interesting documentary. Oh well. Entertaining enough for streaming, but not for $11 tickets or blu-ray purchase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Johnny Depp steals show, but the show is so very lame. Bunch of mafia clichés, hollow characters, no genre expected suspense. The movie wants to build idea of mafia friendship, followed by betrayals (this is shown on start already). But relationships among main characters aren't well defined, there are no connecting stories to make bonds believable. I like most actors so i was not prejudiced. I read somewhere Joel Edgerton was good in Black mass. Perhpas that is true, but John Connoly's dialogs were so childish, his actions that should be sneaky, scheming and cunning were simply transparent and unbelievable. No, i did not buy the story for a minute. Which is strange since the story is true. The good part, which isolated could be given high scores: Jimmy Whitey Bulger Johnny Depp looks scary indeed. The empty bright eyes could fit the horror flick. Strong occasional resemblance with Christopher Walken made me think Johnny studied him for this part. He did good job, but director could benefit from mafia classic recipe with Joe Pesci being the funny little guy made scary as hell by the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was more about style than substance and even the style was lacking.The substance issue comes from the fact that the story was not even close to being fully told. If I think about a similar type movie like Goodfellas I can only say that this movie pales in comparison.It just left too much out and instead concentrated on just a few intense moments of the main character's life. That doesn't work. For instance, we didn't get any view into Bulger's personal life during all of these events. The FBI agent Connolly was covered a bit but not Bulger. Think of Henry Hill in Goodfellas and how we got a pretty decent view from start to finish.Perhaps I'm expecting too much as I'm sure it wasn't meant to be a biography but it's a fascinating true story that needed more coverage. It was like eating a bland plate of food and still feeling hungry afterwards.The neighborhood shots and overall feel of the movie for that time period was done well so I'll give it that. The negatives were a plenty though, in addition to the swiss cheese story. The accents were awful, especially Cumberbatch. Casting an English actor to play an Irish Southie was just wrong on so many levels. The makeup was also quite off for a few of the characters like for Depp and the Jesse Plemons character.There was quite a bit of buzz and critical acclaim for this movie and I have to think that it was mostly due to the cast. It is indeed an amazing cast but at the end of the day the movie doesn't tell the story so it doesn't matter who's in the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp will forever be one of my favorite actors. I have always been blown away with how he can completely disappear into characters, bringing to life some of the most eccentric, vibrant characters that cinema has seen in quite some time. However, a recent string of disheartening duds left me doubting Depp's acting prowess as he continues aging (I mean, Mortdecai? Seriously?) However, Depp's turn as the murderous Whitey Bulger might possibly be the finest performance of his illustrious career. I forgot that I was watching Johnny Depp once the movie got going, instead focusing on Whitey Bulger himself menacing from the other side of the screen. The best performances are ones that help you see characters, not actors in makeup or wigs. However, the problem with Black Mass as a whole was that aside from Depp's wonderful portrayal of Bulger, there wasn't much here to entertain. The other performances were either unremarkable (Edgerton, Johnson) or too brief to be of any consequence in judging the film (Scott, Harbour, Stoll, Bacon). The story was solid, but at the end of the day, it's simply something that we've seen countless times before. Thus, I recommend at least one watch to see the best performance that Johnny Depp has ever graced us with. The rest you can judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Film, Great performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only ever seen Johnny Depp in two roles where I believed he was brilliant. And this is one of them, the other being Captain Jack Sparrow from the first pirates movie. Being in a lot of Tim Burton flicks and occasionally popping up in other things now and then it seemed like Depp needed to find a new voice and I believe he found it here. To be fair I haven't seen many recent films of his but this one truly stands out from the ones I have seen. This is his best film in long while and I wont be surprised if he is nominated for the academy award for it. He gave atmosphere in every scene he was in and gave a less is more performance which worked really well. There are a couple of scenes in particular where it felt like he truly knew who he was playing. He definitely is the reason to see this film As for the rest of the film, it is pretty decent but not great. Everyone plays their parts well such as Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger and Joel Edgerton as John Connolly. No one seems Miscast for the film. Apart from the performances I cant really think of much more reason to watch the movie. The biggest problem this movie has is that the story (being of true events) seems to be more a template for a character study of James whitey Bulger (Depp). Everything seems brushed over which doesn't give a movie like this justice, especially since this is a movie based on a true story. The violence is shown in a very gritty and realistic way, and gives it more of a stylised look rather than the other exploitive representation in a lot of gangster movies. The film was shot really nice and a few of the scenes were really nicely composed, it all looked smooth and I saw no issues. The biggest problem is the story as it isn't very informative and really focuses mainly on the main character. If you want to see a character study of a dangerous criminal, then you may enjoy this. Its no Goodfellas but its not a terrible gangster film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black MassThe Irish make the worst bootleggers because they drink all the moonshine before it can be sold.Thankfully, the felons in this drama are more partial to racketeering.As a means of eliminating his Italian adversaries, south Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) becomes an FBI informant for his office-bearing brother's (Benedict Cumberbatch) childhood friend John Connolly (Joel Edgerton).With his newfound federal protection Whitney strengthens his stranglehold on the city. But a pertinacious prosecutor, Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), refuses to let him get away with this, or ignore Connolly's obvious corruption.While Depp turns in an intimidating - and potentially award-winning - performance as the mad dog assassin, his true to life exploits don't come off as intense or as grandiose as the filmmakers would have you believe.Incidentally, the best way to kill your Sicilian rivals is to hold a Godfather screening then firebomb the theater.

		<shortDescription>A Fascinating Addition To The Gangster Lore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.This is one fascinating story which took place in the 1970s, so much so, that at times it's hard to believe it's true. Much like this years Sicario it tackles the issue of government intervention in current affairs and the blurred line between antagonist and protagonist. It documents the rise of Whitey Bulger in a realistic and catastrophic manner. Director Scott Cooper's style may be lacking but his presentation of individual characters is transfixing.Much discussed, Johnny Depp inhabits the dead eyed gaze of Whitey Bulger with the talent previously shown in performances in films like Donnie Brasco. Even though his make up and prosthetics may be slightly theatrical and even distracting, he simply amazes in his most realistically dark role yet. The ensemble cast in general is quite terrific, with all round knock out performances from the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Jesse Plemons and Rory Cochrane. However the true stand out besides the obvious Johnny Depp, was for me, Joel Edgerton, who is phenomenal as FBI agent "John Connolly". A man who is constantly bordering the unspeakable while trying to take down the Italian mob. He justifies his partnership with "Bulger" and effectively makes him untouchable. It's his spiral into the immoral that makes him so enthralling to watch.It plays out in an increasingly intense way, with certain stand out scenes that left me second guessing ever character decision. Some of the best sequences come from John Connolly's interactions with Bulger where we feel utter skepticism for Connolly's actions. It's this blurred line dynamic that truly sells this motion picture.However, this feature film is not without its many flaws. The pacing is sometimes off with too much emphasis put on certain scenes and not enough put on others. The dialog detracts from this film, apart from a few sequences, it is very procedural. The direction is also a bit lacking in style and certain shots come off repetitive at times.Nevertheless, it is a hard task to create yet another gangster tale set in this era, with films like Goodfellas so perfectly defining what it is at its best. In my opinion Scott Cooper has made a film that should stand apart on its own right, with enough elements to make it feel fresh. It's success can be clearly attributed to the talent of its ensemble, Depp and Edgerton in particular. I am going to give it an 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, we're told, is the true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp with a dubious hairline), an Irish American crime lord who 'ran' South Boston with savage ruthlessness in the 1970s and 80s but turned informer to help the FBI clear out Cosa Nostra rivals who were threatening his 'turf' in protection, gambling, drugs, all the usual rackets. So far, so familiar. The unusual element to this story is that Bulger's brother Billy was a rising figure in the Massachusetts state senate. One of the movie's great flaws is that it never makes clear why James's criminal activities, which regularly made the newspapers, had no apparent impact on the senator's career for more than twenty years.The movie's other great flaw is the "so far, so familiar" element. Stories like this have been told before, with repeated scenes of violence and fusillades of f-words, in GOODFELLAS and with a lot less profanity and a lot more style in the GODFATHER trilogy. We see James ordering and even carrying out brutal killings, but despite the weird hair and weirder expressions Depp's performance has a slightly pantomime air about it: you don't feel the incarnate evil of Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST or Sean Penn in DEAD MAN WALKING. Cumberbatch has a good stab at Bobby Kennedy Boston, but does not look comfortable in the role. Joel Egerton is probably the best thing in it as the star FBI agent who finds that dancing with the devil puts his soul in peril. A gripping movie, even enthralling, but short on originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp back on form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is supposed to be Johnny Depp's return to form. After the dismal Mortdecai earlier in the year, Depp has got some making up to do. His take on the notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bolger is one heck of a performance, one that's expected of his caliber. His transformation far exceeds the act. His piercing blue eyes is enough to make anyone flinch.This movie follows the chunk of Bolger's life accredited to his relationship with the FBI, chiefly agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who he knew growing up. They strike a deal; the Bureau will leave Whitey alone if he gives up the location of rival gangsters. This gives him free will to do whatever he likes, whenever he likes.Black Mass has an open narrative. A select few of Whitey's men tell stories of their time they spent with Bolger. Just as much focus goes on Edgerton as it does Depp, which greatly hinders the man we want to know more about. What we do see though, looks fantastic. The low-key lighting and the dark, gloomy exteriors fit Bolger's ever cloudy mood. This is a gangster films that broods and will be remembered for its main performer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too well made to be bad, but sadly far from the sum of it's parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger, who, in 1970s Boston, quickly rose through the ranks to become the most feared gangster on the scene...with some assistance from the FBI. Bulger's Winter Hill mob are claiming their territory, much to the annoyance of their rivals, who are sure to have them wiped out. But FBI Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who grew up on the same streets as Bulger and his lawyer brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch), but took a rapidly different path, spots a chance to take care of Bulger's adversaries for him, by having him become an FBI informant. However, he underestimates the man's capacity for acquiring power, and before long finds his world crumbling down around him.It would seem rival gangsters controlling various territories in towns and cities across America was pretty much par for the course for most of the twentieth century, if the depiction on numerous films is to be believed, but the ones that make for the best viewing are the ones that make fact seem stranger than fiction. Out of the Furnace director Scott Cooper has dug this promising but not entirely delivering offering out of the mire. Introducing us to a character in the world we've probably never heard of, but whose exploits were so fantastical it's amazing we didn't, it's too well made to be absolutely awful, but it's faults still make it well less than the sum of its parts.While many haven't raved about the film, they have had a lot of praise for Depp's lead performance, but personally I felt it lacked true conviction, and failed to really unnerve me or come off as cold or calculated as Denzel Washington in American Gangster, or even Michael Shannon in The Iceman. It maybe got a little chillier toward the end, after he's killed a ridiculous amount of people, but on the whole nothing that great, despite the impressive lizard face transformation. A bit more impressive is actually Cumberbatch, who just owns his role a little more and manages a fine Boston accent, while Rick Astley alike Edgerton functions fine as the guy on the right side of the law.The film has an interesting and complex story to tell, but in all honesty it tries to cram too much in, and it ends up becoming laborious, poorly paced and, as a result, unengaging. While its fine points cannot be ignored, it comes off as a serviceable film rather than a great one. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass (Strictly Criminal)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.Black Mass is a horribly watchable gangster picture taken from an extraordinary true story and conceived on familiar generic lines. It's the portrait of both men's worlds - in some ways diametrically opposed, in others oddly similar. Each has his own crew. Portraying these men Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton both give richly absorbing performances. In fact, after too many Caribbean holidays, Johnny Depp finally gets back down to some serious business. His mesmerising performance is a return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires. He is the chief selling point of this film. With his nearly bald head, weird icy blue eyes and deep voice like Ray Liota in Goodfellas; he perfectly embodies a fully accredited sociopath. Less is more. Depp more than rises to the occasion, doing career-best work as a man who emerges as complex and an undeniably charismatic figure. The viewers also experience an oddly tender side of Bulger himself: a devoted son to his mother, a loving sibling to his state-senator brother - Billy (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch, as per usual) - and a protective father who even indoctrinates his young son in the ways of the streets. Plus, Whitey and Connolly - played with equally impressive skills by Joel Edgerton - share a sentimental sens of Irish neighbourhood loyalty and tribal paranoia. Moreover, Joel Edgerton is superb at showing how his ambitious character is seduced by the decadent gangster lifestyle, his professional ethic muddied by the clan loyalty and street justice that, in some corners of Boston are more sacred than the Constitution. The script introduces some satisfying nasty twists, turns and shocks. Director Scott Cooper and his screenwriters have something substantial to add to the genre: making the point that gangsters do not arise from nowhere like comic-strip villains. They are the symptoms of political corruptions, parasites created by agencies of the state and by weak, accepting law enforcement officials who are content to sub-contract policing to the bad guys. Lastly, the violence in Black Mass, when it comes, is swift and brutal but nothing here is more startling than a single sudden lock at Bulger eyes across the room. This film isn't just taking place in the late 70's and early 80's, but seems to have been made then also. Overall Black Mass is a pessimistic tale about how gangsters are nurtured by corruption. This film is both directed and acted with tremendous confidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable and riveting, true life gangster drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some strangely negative reviews on here which are completely baffling to me. I found Black Mass absorbing, not least by it's relentless violence, brilliantly filmed. But it's not the gripping action scenes that hold this together, but the all round superb acting. Johnny Depp is menacing and intimidating as James 'Whitey' Bulger who ended up one of the FBI's 10 'most wanted'. This is maybe Depp's best performance to date in my opinion but I want also to mention Joel Egerton in particular, as a corrupt FBI agent. I haven't really noticed him before, although his name has appeared in a couple of movies I've seen, but here he gives possibly an award winning support performance. Have to wait and see. Surprisingly too, British actor, Benedict Cumberbatch is very convincing as an American senator and Depp's younger brother, who ignores his sibling's criminal ways. Dakota Johnson as Depp's wife and Juno Temple for the ladies, both stand out for me in small support parts. Even Kevin Bacon sneaks in as Egerton's FBI boss. Scott Cooper the director has drawn wonderful performances all round. Maybe he's an actor's director because I've just noticed he directed Jeff Bridges to an Oscar win for Crazy Heart and this is only his third director's movie. The other thing I want to mention is that I could hear every word of dialogue and that is a real luxury in today's movie market. In so many films today, I have to resort to the internet to find out what I've just watched as I can't understand half of what the actors are mumbling. Not so with Black Mass, it's completely coherent. This is and actor's film of the highest calibre and yes, I have seen The Godfather, Goodfellas and The Departed that other people keep comparing it unfavourably to, but then it's not really like those pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mobster James "Whitey" Bulger" is pressed into service by childhood friend and FBI man John Connolly to be an FBI-sponsored informant in order to shut down the Boston mafia. Having done so, Bulger then uses his immunity to build his own criminal empire up.This true crime drama features impressive performances from Johnny Depp as Bulger, Joel Edgerton as Connolly, Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's senator brother Mickey and, in fact, pretty much everyone in a fairly starry cast. It is grim, gritty, and very violent and, yet, not without some moments of genuine emotion. Depp's Bulger is a monster, yet there are times when we feel real sympathy for him.Unfortunately, Black Mass (why is it called Black Mass? This is never made clear during the film) wants to be Goodfellas, but it isn't. Despite the great performances, it suffers from an air of inconsequential rambling ? there is little sense of urgency and, quite frankly, I got bored. Had it been 45 minutes shorter its events would have held my attention a lot better (there were a lot of shots of Rory Cochrane looking moody and troubled, all of which could have been trimmed to half their length, for instance).There seems to be a consensus that it is good to see Depp doing decent dramatic work after so long hiding behind funny teeth, hair and costumes, and I can understand this. It's just a shame it's not in a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked Johnny Depp for the first time for his performance and Joel Edgerton should win an Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw 'Black Mass' today and enjoyed the film very much. I liked Johnny Depp for the first time for a character he chose to perform and showed his real talent and proved that he is a good actor. He has been doing all these crazy Pirates movies and never looked at him as an actor with substance who is careful of picking his roles. But Johnny Depp has proved that he can give a great performance once again. He can be a great antagonist who you can root for. Usually in a movie like this , director forgets that people want to relate to someone. I could totally relate to Whitey Bulger as a father and a guy who loves and gets along with his family including his mother and brother. That made me totally root for him but at the same time I know that this character is a monster and he will meet his fate and get caught. I thought Scott Cooper truly did a great job by bringing all these stories together into a cohesive plot. I could totally relate to the character of young man in the beginning who was hit by a bunch of guys and slowly I was introduced to Whitey. The actor Joel Edgerton totally stole the show. Every scene he was in, he put his heart and soul into it. I know Johnny Depp did a phenomenal job but I thought Joel totally surprised me by his performance. He should be nominated for an Oscar for such a brilliant performance and win.Scott Cooper! I congratulate you for doing such a great job for making a film which gives me hope that Hollywood can still put money behind good films. Do not pay any attention to all these people who only want to see cinema just in one way. They just want to see one character on the screen all the time and if you don't give them that , they get lost and complain about character development because Hollywood has trained their mind to look at films just in one way. You told the story in such a great way that it all made sense. You brought in the characters into the plot where they were needed and you just gave enough character development so that I could relate to them but at the same time your film kept me glued to my seat with powerful storytelling, stunning cinematography, incredible music and a strong ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the last months of every year, the "prestige" films aspiring to Oscar nominations start to get released. Sometimes, they are period dramas; sometimes, they are biographical dramas; and sometimes, we have films which combine both formulas (but they always have to be dramas; otherwise, the Academy won't take them seriously). The latter is the case of Black Mass, a boring biopic of a criminal without any energy or enough narrative connection to wake the audience's interest. Among the few positive things I can say about Black Mass, I have to mention the brilliant performance from Johnny Depp, who didn't rely on his heavy makeup, but he brings genuine psychosis and intensity to his character. Joel Edgerton made his best effort in his role, but his character is very poorly written. The rest of the cast is relegated to brief or irrelevant roles, and that includes excellent actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott (I think Scott says only one line in the whole movie, and he's almost always standing on a corner, watching the other policemen discuss... he's basically an extra with a better salary). And the actresses are given the disposable roles of suffering wives/girlfriends or victims, such as the great Juno Temple, who shows up for three minutes in order to immediately die in the hands of the main character (I don't think that's a SPOILER, because it's completely obvious, and I don't think many spectators will be still awake by the time she shows up). Director Scott Cooper didn't bring any energy or vision to this film. While Black Mass was boring me to tears, I remembered A Most Violent Year, another period crime film which also portrayed the corruption and violence of the criminal underworld. However, that film kept me very interested with its solid screenplay and tense direction, completely the opposite to the listless and tedious Black Mass, which I can't recommend, despite Depp's work; this is a clear case of an excellent performance stuck in a weak film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a crime drama starring Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon. And its a true story about Whitey Bulger, he is a violent criminal that becomes a FBI informant to take down a mafia family invading his own empire. Johnny Depp is amazing in his role, he truly become his character with the make- up and performance. He is a really disgusting man and it proves that he is a leach-like human. Joel Edgerton is also great and he is really showing that he can act really well. Basically all performances are very good. But in its story, there is a hollowness in the script as all of them are bad persons and you really cannot find a good person and root for them. Also there are some pacing issues that derail the main plot. Other than that I really enjoyed Black Mass easily proving Johnny Depp can actually win an Oscar. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently watched the excellent film Legend I was a bit unsure what to expect from this film. By looking at the trailer I was not sure if I would like this film at all. However the performance of Johnny Depp put my worries completely to shame. The same goes for the other actors as well, a quite impressive performance from all.I kept reminding me that this movie is based on a true story. When you keep that in mind Depp's performance is chilling at times, but to my surprise he is also able to portray a character that is both pure evil and surprisingly caring all in one nice package.What made me like this film is that I did not notice any fancy CGI effects, the film felt natural and believable and not over the top. When watching the end credits I needed to remind myself that the main character here is actually the same man who portrays the innocent Edward Scissorhands. A unforgettable performance, a interesting story and a good pace throughout the movie. Well worth the enjoyment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real story should have provided a great script yet it's at times terribly violent but overall simply dull. I'm giving it 5 stars solely for the great performances by Jesse Plemons (who looks nothing like FNL's Landry and it took me a while to realise where I've seen that face before!) and Johnny Depp, whose artificial blue lenses are so obviously fake it's a testament to his enormous talent that I found his character at all convincing. Just you know, maybe blind, since his eyes are made of glass. The brutality is sparse but gut-wrenching and yet it fails to add anything to the plot or characters. There is nothing redeeming about any of the villains, and the good guys are even duller than the bad ones (Kevin Bacon has very little charisma as the cliché shouting boss, and Adam Scott doesn't even get to utter a line for the most part of the film, just sits pointlessly in the background) Overall it feels like a massive waste of actors' talent, potentially great plot and viewers' time and money. Avoid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Black Mass" is the newest movie by writer and director Scott Cooper although he "only" directed here. I quite enjoyed his previous works "Crazy Heart" and "Out of the Furnace", so I was pretty curious about this 2-hour movie here. After his takes on alcoholism and revenge, he gives us an insight into the world of crime in 1970s' and 1980s' Boston. The main character in all this is James Bulger played by Johnny Depp. I must admit I am not the greatest Depp fan, but he is okay in this movie. Again, it is much more the makeup and the ruthless way (with murdering people left and right) he was written than Depp giving a truly great performance, but still he is fine overall.The MVP, however, is Joel Edgerton as John Connolly and I can totally see why he is considered for his first Oscar nomination here. He is the epitome of a sleazy unlikeable federal agent in here, who is not afraid at all of getting his hands dirty, even if he does not in the physical sense. However, he refuses people protection after they testify against Bulger and he is really close with the ruthless criminal himself. The character of Connolly's wife played by Julianne Nicholson is actually the appropriate reaction towards a man like Bulger, which is staying as far away from him as possible. Cochrane is fine too. I am a bit biased on him as he's an actor I like. Sad to see he does not have that much to work with, but he is still pretty good. Actually, early on I had to think of him in "CSI: Miami" when he is the aide to Horatio Caine and in here Depp is almost the evil equivalent. Everybody fears him 8unless they're drunk), nobody dares to say a word against him and even his girlfriend/wife (played by the stunning Dakota Johnson) doesn't really dare to interfere when he tries to get their son on the path of crime.I felt that "Black Mass" needed a bit to get going 25-30 minutes, but afterward, I watched a very solid crime thriller, which is even more interesting as it's close to reality. Basically all the major characters in here, including the 2 Bulger Brothers, are still alive today. Talking about the brothers, Cumberbatch disappointed me here. He had quite a bit to work with to make this an even better movie in terms of solidarity and respect between brothers, but it never was an interesting topic and the film would not have been worse without him. So, my final verdict is that I hope Edgerton gets an Oscar nomination as he carried the film nicely (without Depp's heavy makeup and costume and truly baity material). His arrest near the end was the finest moment of the film. I recommend "Black Mass". Certainly worth a watch if you like historic crime thrillers.</fullReview>

Now I'm not a huge fan of films on content such as this but the story flowed very nicely and kept my attention very well. In the beginning I didn't even realize that it was Mr. Depp at all, great makeup work. This film had a very strong documentary based feel to it though still the vibe of living in the shoes of each character as the story progressed. The acting from all actors and actresses within the movie were totally on point and presented their characters very well. This wasn't a film in which I'd thought it'd be as the given film description and trailer just didn't catch my interest at all.If you're a fan of the mobster movies with some sort of "based on real events" hook to it, this one is just right for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the comeback of Johnny Depp, but he's not solely to blame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since it was announced Johnny Depp would be playing hardened criminal James "Whitey" Bulger in Black Mass, there's been some debate on the merits of Depp's career. One camp thinks that Depp's been wasting his time (and talents) with all those Pirates and Burton films while the other camp is occupied by those who feel that even in those films his acting skills were on display. Nevertheless, Black Mass was intended to be a return to form for Depp.We start in the present, in a police station where a former 'associate' of Bulger states he's willing to provide information against him. He says, however, he doesn't consider it to be snitching. (We will see other like-minded individuals testify against him as well as their reasons for doing so as the film continues.) We flashback to Boston in the 70's when Bulger was still small-time. We get a sense of his violent ways and how little things can set him off, particularly if he suspects betrayal. We also meet his brother, state senator Billy Bulger, and FBI agent John Connolly who grew up with Whitey. Connolly meets up with the reluctant Whitey and proposes a deal: Whitey will provide information on his competition (the Italian mob) and the FBI will use that to build a case against them. It'll make the FBI look good and Whitey will be rid of his competitors. Connolly manages to convince his superior, McGuire, to try out this idea for a while and Whitey agrees as well, though he (also) emphasizes the 'fact' that what he's doing is not snitching. Things escalate however as Whitey realizes he's got some leeway with the FBI due to his 'informant' status while Connolly gets in way over his head, hanging out with Whitey, covering for him, all the while rationalizing his behavior by emphasizing the long-term advantages of his 'deal' with Whitey.So, the million dollar question: is this the return of Johnny Depp, the actor? Mostly no, I'd say. While he's not bad, Depp just isn't all that threatening a presence. Compare that to, say, Pesci's performance in Goodfellas or Mikkelsen's turn as Hannibal in the eponymous series. Sure, the makeup is good, but makeup does not a great performance make. Decent? Sure. The Oscar-worthy turn we've been expecting? No.Depp isn't solely to blame, however. Black Mass, in the end, just isn't about Bulger. He adorns the poster, but the real drama ultimately lies in how the film depicts the controversy around the FBI. The film tries to add some character development to Bulger, but since he's a violent criminal both at the film's opening and closing, it isn't very effective. The film appears more interested in the goings-on at the FBI. Connolly becomes a real sleezebag when he's constantly having to convince a colleague and his superior they're doing the right thing. When McGuire and particularly his next-in-line, Wyshak, call him on his bullshit, it's incredibly satisfying. The moral conundrum of making the deal with Whitey to capture other mobsters despite the controversy it raises. The following protocol versus getting great results question is interesting. Meanwhile, whenever Depp appears (particularly in the film's second half), nothing really happens. Sure, he has someone killed or does the killing himself, makes threats and so on, but the real drama in the end takes place in FBI HQ.Speaking of drama, whenever the film tries to paint a picture of family life, it falls flat on its ass. This is the kind of film that opens the relationship between Connolly and his wife by having them get ready for a little of the ol' in-out, in-out on the kitchen counter. Yeah, because why spend time showing the bond they share, thus laying the foundation for future tensions, when you can show them getting ready to have sex? It really makes me care for them... The same applies to Whitey and his wife. It feels like these underwritten scenes should counterbalance his tough-guy persona, to show how his family tragedies only made him a better crime boss, but in terms of drama, it's thin.In the end, Black Mass is a very run-of-the-mill crime drama. It feels like the end result should have been infinitely more compelling than it is. Definitely less than the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out in September (I'm writing this months later, in Nov.), it never occurred to me to pen a review. If you haven't seen this movie, catch it wherever it is showing. This is a very, very good crime movie. It's extremely brutal but it's due to how horrible a person James "Whitey" Bulger was (or still is) and why he was on the FBI most-wanted list for so many years. I can't say enough about Depp without mentioning his co-stars, as Joel Edgerton shines as the corrupted FBI agent Connolly as do everyone else in their respective roles. Depp, however, disappears not only because of excellent make up but some really kick-ass acting that makes one remember why Johnny Depp is so highly acclaimed. He goes from a nice guy to cold-blooded killer in mere seconds. Based upon the book Black Mass, from what I remember, the film does a good job with what it takes from the book. I would have liked to have seen what ended up on the cutting room floor (a scene with one of Whitey's girl friends for one) because that might have warranted a 10 instead of a 9 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A crime thriller/drama based on true events starring Johnny Depp as the main character James 'Whitey' Bulger. The rise and fall of the famed gangster ? a theme that has been dealt with over and over in Hollywood. While I have seen my fair share of gangster movies, Depp being cast as the lead role is what drew me to the theater.Johnny Depp shines as Bulger, showing finesse in handling a character that is split into two equal halves ? one that is unpredictable with his retribution and the other that is a doting father and loving husband. It is this very contrast that lends his character a sense of credibility and helps the audience relate to him, despite him being someone that would typically be considered as "bad" or "evil" on the moral scale.Continue reading the review at my blog below: https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/11/09/black-mass-film-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mobster story that flows even if you've seen something like this before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've already seen "The Departed", Martin Scorsese's Academy Award- winning film loosely based on the Whitey Bulger story or the excellent documentary by Joe Berlinger, "Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger," you might ask if there's room for just one more film about the notorious criminal who wreaked havoc in South Boston during the 1970s and early 1980s. The answer is that "Black Mass," director Scott Cooper's new entry in the Bulger pantheon, fits the bill pretty well, even if you're already familiar with most of the facts regarding the turf war between Bulger's Winter Hill gang and their notorious rivals, the Angiulo brothers.Black Mass makes its case against Whitey in the style of a police procedural. It begins with flashbacks set forth in a series of FBI interviews of two Bulger associates, right-hand man Steve Flemmi and neophyte Kevin Weeks (who unfortunately end up with light sentences due to their cooperation in bringing Bulger down). Bulger's brutality is highlighted almost immediately after he takes revenge on an associate who beat up Weeks up in a confrontation outside a local pub. Soon afterward he murders one of his own enforcers, Tommy King, who disses him while intoxicated inside a favorite watering hole. Johnny Depp finally finds his stride in a welcome bad boy role as Whitey and the script wisely highlights a confounding kind side-- Whitey stops to help carry packages for an old lady in the neighborhood, is attentive to his elderly mother and feels real despair when his young son falls into a coma. He's not all that kind to his wife however, by threatening her when she refers in a moment of grief to the dying child as "my son," and immediately wants to take him off life support.Bulger the sadistic psychopath is not what makes Black Mass so interesting. It's really the story of renegade FBI agent, John Connolly, winningly played by Joel Edgerton. Connolly was a childhood friend of both Whitey and brother Billy Bulger, who became president of the Massachusetts State Senate. Connolly really shouldn't have become an FBI agent in the first place given his close ties to Whitey and disposition toward the criminal life. The FBI ended up giving Connolly free reign to use Whitey as an informant who eventually convinced Whitey to provide the FBI with a wiretap location for the Angiulo brothers. Seduced by Whitey, Connolly invited him over along with his associates, much to the chagrin of his wife Marianne, who soon became decidedly distressed over her husband's most apparent change in personality.The tension in the Black Mass plot escalates when Whitey decides to murder the new executive of a Jai Alai arena in Florida who refuses to take kickback money. Whitey pays an associate, Halloran, 20K to keep silent but he ends up going to the FBI who refuse to use his testimony after he refuses a polygraph. After Whitey gets wind of this, Halloran and a friend, are murdered in broad daylight.The stakes are raised when Bulger questions Flemmi's stepdaughter prostitute girlfriend whether she revealed anything about the Winter Hill gang to the police. In a great scene, the prostitute, Deborah Hussey, seems convincingly innocent when she answers Bulger's questions about her police interrogation. But after taking her home, he strangles her in front of Flemmi, who does a good job at hiding how appalled he is at Bulger's viciousness.The denouement is set in motion when the informant McIntyre is forced to confess to the rival DEA that he was responsible for the intercepted arms shipment to the IRA, ordered by Bulger. McIntyre is then tortured and murdered by Whitey a la Hannibal Lecter. Pitbull prosecutor Wyshak, along with Connolly associate John Morris, realize that Connolly's "tips" are a cut and paste job from past reports of low-level informants.After Morris spills all the beans to two Boston Globe reporters, the ensuing news exposé leads to the collapse of Bulger's empire and his subsequent exile. Connolly's arrest is foreshadowed by the scene in which his wife locks him out of their house (preceding this turn of events is the best scene in the film when Whitey both caresses and threatens Connolly's wife after she refuses to join him and his associates at the dinner table).Some critics complained about a failure of to show how Bulger's empire operated?they wanted more scenes involving the shakedowns, etc. Instead what was proffered was simply a short montage. It seems to me that such an abridged gambit was superior to the suggestion of added footage. All in all, Black Mass is a well-done recapitulation of the story of the twisted relationship between Whitey Bulger and John Connolly. Even if one was familiar with this story from previous attempts at chronicling it, the story as it's told?a straightforward police procedural of sorts? keeps one interested to the end. There might be little new here but Black Mass is a narrative that flows in an admirable way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie overall. Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Whitey Bulger. The rest of the cast hits the nail on the head as well. Be forewarned that the music in this movie is so ridiculously loud you will have a hard time hearing the dialogue between the characters. This movie would have received a 10/10 except the music brought it down 1 stars. The other star loss was due to Joel Edgerton's terrible Boston accent. He really needs to work on it. It was not convincing in the least bit. Other than his accent, he played a great part. This movie will pass two hours by pretty easily. I don't think it's ever going to win any academy awards for best picture. Not with the type of editing it received. The music really annoyed the group of friends that I viewed this movie with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spaceship flying at cruise altitude, but at least we can see Johnny Depp in his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black mass is a good film, unfortunately it could have been great. There's tons of great material to achieve an unforgettable film, but watching black mass is like watching a brand new top of the line airplane that can reach altitudes like no other yet it still only flies cruise altitude. It looks great, but never leaves that level to achieve something that could blow minds. It is highly entertaining, thrilling, interesting, and it grabs you, but you cant shake that feeling that its missing something, and this is more apparent when the film ends, because it just seems to go by and end in the exactly same level it began rather that achieving a crescendo that would end with a bang. But sadly no. It's easy to resume what the movie is missing to one word: energy. It needed an adrenaline shot. No let me rephrase, two words; Martin Scorsese! He would have done amazing things with this, that is what this film really needed. The cast is by far the best thing, and this is one of those films, that while, once again, good, it all comes down to the ensemble cast. I think that the academy will have a huge day with this film in the acting categories, because every actor/actress gives an enormous performance. There's two huge main performances, Joel Edgerton, that deserves a supporting nomination, and of course the grandest of them all, the return to form, Johny Depp. This is a leading actor winner right from the first frame with him. And if you really want to resume things, this film is Johny Depp. The production values are great, but the score could, like the film overall, be more energetic. Jimmy White Bulger is very easily one of the grandest real life villains of all time, a terrifying person that can put on a smile and say everything is alright in a second and kill you in the worst way possible in the next. The greatest moments of the film is when he kills someone, because each death is more terrifying than the previous and with each death you get to know more of the killer. And while we see plenty of crime, we never really see what seems to be the best parts of the story, we should have seen more of what this gangs really does, where the money comes from. But all we seem to see is the backstage of one of the biggest crime reigns in America. And this weakens the film a lot, because the story loses some light for not showing what the fuss is all about. You hear he is one of biggest crime lords of all time, that Boston has crime at every corner thanks to him, but you never can quite see this.In the end this could have been a huge film. There's material for it, because the story is epic. But it doesn't bring anything new, it just is what it is, a common good film, with a grander than life performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The True Story of an alliance Between the FBI and the Boston Irish Mob.Director Scott Cooper offers an intermittently ultra violent, well acted and staged film, the Black Mass is strong gangster film with a large scope. While not reaching the heights of the Godfather parts, Goodfellas or Once Upon a time in America, it's certainly up there if not surpasses the comparable Donnie Brasco and Casino.There's a strong supporting cast of actors, lead Johnny Depp is steely and downright intimidating as "Whitey" Bulger. His brother Bill, a politician is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and (even though top billed) has limited screen time. Joel Edgerton is FBI agent John Connolly and steals the show. Notable is Kevin Bacon.Depp is fantastic right down to his shoddy teeth, the aged makeup as it flips between time periods, not just on Depp, but the other cast members is terrific. The set design, locations and music captures the period back drop flawlessly.While some of the accents may not be perfect, Cooper and writers Jez Butterworth Mark Mallouk based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill offer a deeply engrossing shocking gangster tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An acting showcase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing any promotional material will make it clear 'Black Mass' is an obvious award season bandwagon that, thankfully, boasts substance in its a-list cast. Trumping them all, however, Depp is frighteningly captivating. The actor's deep, wide eyes compliment the criminal's more touching moments, such as playing cards with his elderly mother, in addition to several menacing metaphorical speeches that he reminds those around him, including one notably unpredictable scene with Kevin Bacon's Charles McGuire, about the importance of keeping your mouth shut. Validating these moments, Whitey isn't afraid to get his hands dirty ? strangling enemies with his own bare hands, and even appearing as an exterminator with an assault rifle trying to clean his streets of filthy rats. Depp embodies this newfound R-rated freedom, becoming physically invested in a handful of gruesomely grounded killings, along with a generous supply of f-bombs. This isn't Captain Jack, folks.Like his counterpart will likely do for lead actor contention, Edgerton will make a compelling argument for supporting cast discussions come February. Subtlety evolving his posture, stride and mannerisms Edgerton does a magnificent job in adjusting Connolly's behavior as his fortune grows. Yet, when his character's confidence is tested, Edgerton shines. In a torrent of noteworthy scenes that catch Connolly conflicted between the morally perplexing obligations of the law or his loyalty to his childhood brother, Edgerton emanates shaky uncertainty by enlisting a stutter that seemingly breeds in authenticity the higher the stakes become. A fantastic third-string cast aids many of these confrontations, illuminated by a fierce Julianne Nicholson adding some welcome femininity to the overbearing testosterone. Jesse Plemons, who I was for some reason convinced was Matt Damon under all that make-up, did a fine job narrating the first act and bringing more depth to his typecast henchman role. And Corey Stoll makes a disappointingly brief appearance as a new FBI head Fred Wyshak, supplying his 'House of Cards' brand of leadership ? an element that would have livened a climatic confrontation if the narrative continued to follow his pursuit of Bulger and suspicion of Connolly.FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/09/18/black-mass-review-indieadam-tiff- 2015/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The two lead actors and the complexity of their involvement to each other carried my interest almost entirely throughout an untidy but compelling and gruesome crime opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of Scott Cooper's effective, violent and atmospheric crime drama Black Mass has several meanings. The first is a reference to the Irish-Catholic values of the film's real life subject, the gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, whose violent actions in South Boston from the 1970s to the 1990s were a terrifying contradiction of his religious upbringing. The second meaning is a scientific and philosophical viewpoint, reflecting how matter or mass can never entirely disappear but becomes invisible to the human eye. Invisibility was imperative for Whitey because according to the film, his attitude was that if no one witnessed a crime, particularly a murder, it never happened. The merciless brutality of Whitey is embodied by Johnny Depp, whose wicked performance and hideous transformation ignites a desperate victory for this once inventive character actor. He is matched by a colourful turn from Australian actor Joel Edgerton, who plays self-interested FBI agent John Connolly, a childhood friend of Whitey. Connolly represents another form of darkness. Money and status encourage him to sweep away the devil's crimes, meaning Black Mass is a film that draws from the Old Testament, warning us about how people of power and status succumb to life's temptations. The two lead actors and the complexity of their involvement to each other carried my interest almost entirely throughout an untidy but compelling and gruesome crime opera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass the Second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second review on Black Mass. After having seen the German version and leaving the theatre rather disappointed and empty, I thought I give it another try. And watched the OV in the cinema. So the whole crime story of an unholy alliance between FBI and mobster Bulger again in Boston American English. I must admit, despite much, maybe too much cursing and blood splatter, the film grew on me. Depp's performance as Bulger definitely works for me (despite the original Bulger not being amused about his portrayal). Maybe the whole thing works best when not related too much to some "true story". True stories and Hollywood - let's face the facts, it's an oxymoron... Taken as a mere gangster movie, it works. I didn't learn very much about Bulger's character or his motivation. The movie is still a collection of murders, crimes and curses. But the somewhat creepy alliance between James "Whitey" Bulger and his boyhood friend John Connolly evolves slowly and subtly from a "friendly" cooperation into a misunderstood loyalty and disaster for everyone involved. Loyalty is the glue and the bomb. But while Connolly insists on his loyalty to Bulger, Bulger stays rather loyal to himself... His criminal energy is always present, perfectly embodied by Johnny Depp. The whole cast is brilliant, may it be main characters or supporting actors. Watching the film a second time gave me a better overview and understanding. And more thrills, despite the movie going at a rather slow pace, and still somehow missing a plot. Yes, it's different than the usual Hollywood Bam-Boom-Bang, smart characters, explosions and car chases. But once I got used to the rather narrative, documentary and distant style, I was at times sucked into the film. Maybe I should watch it a third time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear the Gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass retells the events of James "Whitey" Bulger's association with the FBI as an informant. It is a controversial crime history that the film portrays with real gritty atmosphere. It doesn't provide much of an exact narrative, aside of just following the accounts of Whitey's involvement with this conspiracy. It often feels like it's just selling the fear of this man and not quite a personal depth. We explore his personal life and the people connected with him, but the center of the attention is just the crimes he committed. While it's still ultimately gripping, the movie doesn't lead to any satisfying core whatsoever.The story is mostly told by Bulger's associates who were interviewed for telling the full information about the activity of the Winter Hill Gang. It's pretty much just documenting the events of what crime and conspiracy that involved Whitey. Sure, there are moments that involves his personal life, but much of the focus is his criminal and informant years. It's just digging into his career rather than his humanity. It's not bad, but we seem to concern more about what a dangerous man he is than knowing him more as a human being. It doesn't have an exact point- of-view either. Despite of being narrated by various witnesses, these spectators aren't the center, either. The FBI are also just rigorous work in narrative detail, doesn't exactly talks about the ethics, it's basically just a sideline from the crimes being committed outside. Otherwise, it's an engrossing study of a dirty plan gone wrong.The direction is slick, in a classic gangster movie way, breathing into the darkness beneath the exteriors. And everything sure looks stunning. It pictures its gritty setting so well, that the only nitpick you may utter is how over-the-top Johnny Depp's makeup is. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't look awful, but for a movie where everything looks so convincing in its time, that transformation is the only one that takes the contrary. But again, I'm just nitpicking. The acting is also splendid; and while the makeup is a little too much (I'm sorry, I never stop,) it doesn't take away Depp's attempt of humanity towards this role. He is effectively frightening, externally, and cold-blooded, internally, and that's pretty much what we expect for a criminal like this.Black Mass is terribly straightforward, its aim is basically just displaying what a ruthless criminal Whitey Bulger was, and although we see his personal life, it doesn't get flourish, because this movie is all about uncovering his bad deeds and the FBI letting this man slide. The movie looks beautiful, the atmosphere is, again, quite gritty, and fans might be pleased that its lead actor is not as cartoonish as his cosmetics (I never learn.) But there are crime biopics out there that have better intentions, Black Mass is just a rotten portrait of a once most wanted man. There is no denying that it's a pretty interesting story, especially in cinematic form, but it needs to be more engaging than this.</fullReview>

Make up or not, crazy eyes or whatever, he was phenomenal in this role! I adored the scenery and the whole 80's-90's feeling of the movie. Really well-directed and with an excellent cast of really talented actors! Interesting faces, so much that you actually think that these guys were the actual gangsters. The violent scenes were really plausible yet tasteful enough to remain within what you could handle seeing. I can't find anything wrong with this movie leaving the theater. Nothing. I am not a big fan of the genre but I enjoy similar movies, so it's an easy eight for me. I can't say what it would need to get to 9 or 10. I think that this is the ceiling here, and it's not a low one. It's a movie that you will definitely enjoy. You will be afraid of this guy for sure, cause the makeup alone was enough to terrify, even not throwing the crazy look into the equation. This is a must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a straightforward and faithful adaptation of Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neil's book on the infamous Boston gangster, James "Whitey" Bulger and his partnership with FBI agent, John Connelly. From 1976 to 1994, Bulger and his Winter Hill gang ruled the streets of South Boston with violent intimidation and Irish charm. As Connelly, a childhood chum of Bulger's, takes the credit for taking down the Italian Mafia, Whitey's criminal enterprise grows along with his psychotic tendencies. As the body count grows, so does the suspicion over how deep Bulger has the FBI in his back pocket.Scott Cooper does a solid job in diverting from the tropes of the Scorsese-styled gangster flick by presenting Boston's criminal underworld with a composed and chilling style similar to Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle. However, the film does veer off into domestic, eye-rolling melodrama reminiscent of Donnie Brasco. Fortunately, the melodrama is overshadowed by the documentary-styled narrative penned by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth along with the crisp and steady cinematography of Masanobu Takayanagi.Johnny Depp gives a good and non-glamorous performance as Whitey Bulger. Apart from a stake dinner scene reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's flamboyant gangster in The Departed, Depp shies away from a Gonzo- esque performance as he invokes fear with his piercing blue eyes and rough exterior. Australian actor Joel Edgerton swaggers onto the screen as John Connelly with a mix of bravado and paranoia as the FBI agent who made a deal with the devilish Bulger. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Whiteys brother and state senator who tries to look the other way when his brother is in the newspapers. Rounding up the cast are some memorable performances by Jesse Plemons, Peter Sarsgaard, and Rory Cochrane as Whitey's crew. For publicity leading up to the film, Warner Bros. made Black Mass look like a cross between Heat and The Town, yet the film is calm and reserved to some extent. Even though there's nothing that really jumps off the screen, the film is a solid piece that combines journalistic inquiry into Boston 's criminal underground.</fullReview>

If nobody sees it, it didn't happen."Black Mass is a film based on true story about a gangster named Whitey Bulger, who makes a deal with the FBI to take down his competition.Now I was really looking forward to watching this because it looked like this will be the comeback of Johnny Depp, and it certainly was. All the acting was top notch but Johnny Depp was the obvious standout. His portrayal of the gangster was chilling, intense and at times creepy. He was again wearing tons of makeup but it added rather than distracting. Easily his best work in years.The movie was also really well shot. Great cinematography. This, and Johnny Depp's acting really made some scenes really great and intense, and made you go "I want more of those". And I wish we had gotten more such scenes instead of the other stuff we got.The problem with this movie was that it lacked focus in its story. Events are happening but you don't really feel invested in them. Most of it felt empty. There was no emotional attachment to it. The whole movie had this anti-climatic feel to it. You get scenes with great performances and all but the linkages don't carry out well. It was also predictable at times.In the end, you just get this hollow feeling, like there was no payoff, and that was a disappointment because the movie definitely had the potential to be a great gangster film. The acting was great, the premise was interesting and it was shot really well. And is definitely worth a try for that, just don't get your hopes up for this being something spectacular.7/10</fullReview>

I think the director did an incredible job shooting the film and loved to see the local places on the North Shore outside of Boston where they also filmed scenes from American Hustle. I've read the book Black Mass and other books on Whitey Bulger, but I found that the books gave a more accurate portrait of Bulger than the film. I also wondered if the movie would be as easy to follow without reading the books and having some background knowledge on the events in the film.The film scratched the surface of just some of the crimes that Bulger and the Winter Hill gang committed. I was also surprised at the prominence that Whitey's son and his death was given in the film, as it was not talked about much in the books. I'm guessing this was done to dramatize the story and make it more cinematic. There is a lot more to Bulger's story and the heinous crimes he committed than was shown on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great material delegated to an engaging but generic execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Announced as Johnny Depp's comeback venture en route to Oscar glory, it's a such a shame how underwhelming Depp is in Black Mass. In the past decade since his last best turn in Sweeney Todd, he's often overcooked roles catering to his arsenal of tics. Here he's more restrained, but while the material offers a clear and enticing character arc, Scott Cooper's approach regrettably blunts that down. Black Mass is simply aiming to be a boilerplate Boston crime drama, as carved by Scorsese's The Departed. It's solidly made, but it's more or less a series of neat murders. Makes it hard to really invest in any character. It's otherwise engaging just to watch it unfold despite clichés, though it's littered with missed opportunities for how taunt it could have wound things. Depp's Whitey Bulger is often sitting with the enemy, yet it treats it as any other scene.Perhaps that's just part of the point, as the film operates on the macho code of loyalty, and how fragile that truly can be when crossed. It should just be like any other scene. While that theme comes through, the characters don't. At least it has an interesting structure with how it's framed through men informing on Bulger while the main narrative is Bulger informing for the FBI. Meanwhile, the supporting players far outshine both Depp and Joel Edgerton, who unfortunately overplays his hand while Depp stays relatively reserved. Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane, Juno Temple and the underused Jesse Plemons all make larger marks, leaving Benedict Cumberbatch and Kevin Bacon wishing they tried something else. The production is solid, though the wigs and makeup can be distracting at times, especially when it comes to Depp. Engaging enough, but I'm definitely not visiting Boston anytime soon.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp shines in this otherwise flat gangster drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My final venture to the London Film Festival this year was to see Black Mass and despite hearing not such positive things, I still had high expectations for this film. Unfortunately, Black Mass ends up being another case of a fantastic performance in a not so fantastic film. James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) is regarded as one of the most notorious gangsters in United States history and headed the Irish-American Winter Hill Gang in South Boston for a number of years. In 1975, Bulger struck a deal with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton); a native of South Boston and friend of Bulger and his brother, Senator William Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), to become an informant for the Bureau. In return, Bulger wanted the FBI to take down his rivals, the Angiulo Brothers, who were connected to the Mafia and formed direct competition over territory for the Winter Hill Gang. With the film focusing on one of the most notorious gangsters in U.S. history, Black Mass had the chance to be this generation's Goodfellas. It just doesn't feel as if they took full advantage of that opportunity and at times, Scott Cooper's film feels like a Goodfellas wannabe. Then you realise that nobody does Scorsese quite like Scorsese.Black Mass feels bloated and at two hours long, ends up dragging towards the end. Lacking the style of other gangster films such as Goodfellas or even Legend from earlier in the year, I was a little relieved when the end credits started to roll. Not that Black Mass is by any means a terrible film, because it isn't and there is still a good film to be seen here.At the centre of the film is a brilliant performance from Johnny Depp. As Bulger, Depp blows away the cobwebs and delivers a performance that might be one of my favourites of the year so far. Depp's filmography has been rather goofy in more recent years but in Black Mass, he more than makes amends for that. Depp, under a load of prosthetic make-up, is intimidating as the the cold-blooded Bulger.It's a shame though that the only other actor who raises their game in Black Mass is Joel Edgerton as FBI agent Connolly. Considering the cast that Cooper has at his disposal, the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Corey Stoll and Jesse Plemons all feel underused and it plays a part in holding Black Mass back from being great.The score from Junkie XL a.k.a. Tom Holkenborg is one of note and shows complete contrast to his score for Mad Max: Fury Road earlier in the year, a sign that he has a future in composing film scores for sure. I also really liked the production design by Stefania Cella, her work really bringing 1975 Boston to life amidst Bulger's criminal activities.While Black Mass is certainly a return to form for Johnny Depp, I can't help but feel a little disappointed when I think about the film as a whole. But please, Mr Depp, more roles like this in the future would be very welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that i expected more from this film, it's not bad, it's just not very exciting and kind of just plods along at parts. The film just had so much potential, the best scene was the one that i had previously seen in the trailer, it was very tense and uncomfortable to watch and left me wanting more. The actual film appears to be lacking this tension. There was also a lot crammed in and i kept finding myself getting a little lost and confused about what was happening and why? (didn't help that i almost dozed off at certain points, that's maybe why?). I think a lot of this is down to the films short run time,but even though the run time was short, for me, i think the film felt long. My husband felt that this story would have worked a lot better as a TV series and i do agree. Now onto Johnny, is he back to acting greatness? HELL YEAH! he was amazing! I can't fault his performance at all. He could flip from friendly to menacing in a second and he played a very believable James "Whitey" Bulger. I felt that all of the acting in this film was brilliant but Johnny was definitely the stand out performance for me and i'm hoping that everyone else will agree and Johnny can get back to being that amazing actor that he was always known as. There were also a few camera shots that i thought looked brilliant. So my final verdict is that it was a good movie but i wasn't blown away. I was, by Depp but the film itself not so much. I have definitely seen a lot better gangster movies than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having "The Departed" on my top 10 list definitely speaks to my interest in this movie. An organized crime movie set in Boston, showing a clash between the feds and the Irish, what a depiction. Johnny Depp delivers a creepy yet solid performance, but I could see some people going through the whole movie and not knowing who Depp is playing. I was not a big fan of the contacts they had him put in but in some cases you do what you gotta do to make the film as real as possible. The rest of the cast delivered respectable performances as well. Joel Edgerton was one of my favourites to watch on screen, as well as Benedict Cumberbatch who had a surprisingly good Irish accent for a British actor. This was definitely my type of movie and if you were a fan of "The Departed" then definitely check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kind of a mob movie by rote. Every killing is telegraphed and the performances are better than they really should be for such tired material. Take away the contact lenses (or was it CGI?) and I wonder how intense and scary Mr Depp really would've been, though. There is very little involvement from the women in this one, which may be a blessing in disguise since they do the typical thing women do in mob movies - actually, make that almost all movies - and just stand around looking worried and begging their husbands to stop doing the Wrong Thing. Hate to see a little variety from female characters in these things, eh? Would it be too much to ask for some actual characters?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Black Mass' is a fascinating story that falls into the trap of having too much to say and not enough time to say it. The original cut was apparently close to 3 hours but was cut down for pacing reasons. Some films can get away with this, others struggle to. This is the latter. The story feels rushed and clunky. There isn't that patience that the likes of Martin Scorsese bring to the table. There isn't that classic scene ("How am I funny?") that people will remember and reenact for years to come. There isn't even always an explanation as to why a character has disappeared from the story. Having made this point though - that really is the only problem with an otherwise very fine film.The acting is terrific across the board. Johnny Depp is obviously the stand-out in the lead role. He's as captivating on screen as always and I suspect he will receive an Oscar nomination when January roles around. The only thing that will hold him back from winning it is a lack of punchy dialogue. Every scene he is in is brilliant but feels too similar to the last one. The rest of the cast are faultless and make every scene very enjoyable.It's a brutal film with no holding back on the violence whatsoever. Director Scott Cooper, in only his third film at the helm, does an adequate job but I can't help but wonder what someone with the class of Scorsese could have done with this script. It's a solid movie there's no doubt about it, but it won't go down in the history books as a classic which is a shame because the story had the potential to do just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best performance ever from Johnny Depp. He created a simply perfect character, one minute making small talk with somebody, the next one killing in a brutal manner. FBI agent John Connolly, played by Joel Edgerton, is excellent as well. However, his mindset might have been illustrated a little bit more. Why did he want to form the alliance with Bulger, simply for furthering his career or for protecting Bulger since they were childhood friends? The major take away from Black Mass are its themes of corruption and power. Most people from Boston knew who Whitey Bulger was but they didn't know for sure that the tax-payer funded organizations, designed to stop people like him, didn't do that..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Mass is one of the best movies to hit movie theatres in a long time. It is a gangster style biopic of the famous South Boston crime lord, James "Whitey" Bulger.This movie essentially has two protagonists, Whitey and John Connolly, a lot of side characters, and no clear antagonist, however there are clearly a lot of guys looking to take down Bulger and Connolly. Essentially the storyline puts a lot of emphasis on the relationship of Bulger and Connolly, one being a crime lord and leader of the Winter Hill Gang, and the other an FBI agent. Both of them use and abuse this relationship as Whitey essentially has immunity, and Connolly looks like an all star agent for the info he gets. In the beginning, the alliance is formed to take down the Italian mafia. Eventually they succeed and Connolly is promoted and praised by the FBI, while Bulger wins the street war he had with the Italians. All is well for both sides, until Bulger's son becomes sick. Following the death of his son, he becomes a heartless, cold- blooded, manipulative crime lord. He kills anybody, and for any reason. Naturally this takes a toll on his fellow gang members, particularly his number two man, Steve Flemmi, who has to helplessly watch as Bulger murders his girlfriends daughter, as he watches and then has to "clean up". Eventually, the bond is found and both are taken down by the FBI.The acting in this movie was out of this world, and I would not be surprised to see two or three Oscar nods towards the cast, namely Johnny Depp, Dakota Johnson and possibly Benedict Cumberbatch. Johnny Depp has always been my favorite actor, and this is one of his best performances to date. I was extremely surprised to see the casting of Dakota Johnson as Lindsey Cyr, Whitey's girlfriend and mother of his son. I only knew the name because of the 50 shades movie which frankly I had no desire to see. She delivers though, with a breathtakingly emotional performance, and she is believable in every word she says. Joel Edgerton plays John Connolly, and is perfect for the role. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Whitey's brother Billy, a straight edge politician. He again, plays the role to perfection and I believe this is one of his better performances over his already great career. On top of that, Kevin Bacon, Rory Cochrane, Corey Stoll, David Harbour, Adam Scott and Julianne Nicholson are absolutely fantastic and add to the overall enjoyable-ness of this movie.This movie is a classic and deserves to be treated like one. An absolue must watch for anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another crime drama/gangster film that succeeds in being a well crafted two hour movie, with even a couple of good cues for discussion, but doesn't reach a status to which you can point at anything original, particular or genuinely interesting that will distinguish this from the bunch.Yet, not to discredit this film, it does have many points to its favor. Firstly all around we have a cast built of well know actors, but at no point you feel like its only for shock value. Everybody is really good, there are a string of well crafted performances. Honestly I have never been the biggest fan of Johnny Depp, his role as Jack Sparrow is something unique in my opinion, but for the rest he never really left my mouth open. Now, this is definitely one of his better performances and a really good one on its own, but it is nothing earth shattering. He manages to give his character a presence on screen that feels the way it should, but there is no heavy weight that really makes you sweat or sit on the edge when he is on screen. The standout is definitely Joel Edgerton and even if this isn't his best work, he proves the talent that he has been accounted for many times. Plus you are treated with a couple of scenes where the actors are just shown playing an interesting setup out and those are where you truly get the creeps, unfortunately there really aren't enough.Sticking to why the film is actually good, it takes advantage of its story to put forward moral dilemmas and discussions that don't feel forced and are welcome to the conversation. Now, there isn't anything really deep or something that will keep you thinking for days, but the thoughts it stirs whilst playing are captivating and will keep you going through the whole film. At no point you will be shocked, but at many points you will feel a good dose of adrenaline and tension that will keep you sticking with the characters and being interested in the final outcome. It is just a dynamic that works for storytelling and the filmmakers don't get in the way of it with pointless or overly emphasized stuff.That by the way could also be the big negative the film bears: it simply isn't exciting and it isn't exciting because the filmmakers don't really put a passionate effort into it. It plays as you expect it to and there isn't anything to be found that gives it an interesting beat or a through line for it to be stimulating once it ends. It shamelessly copies, yes copies not imitates or quotes, "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" in some scenes and the fact that I noticed it so clearly really says something since I am not a fanatic of those films to being with.If you are a fan of the crime-drama genre you will certainly find something to sink your teeth in, but on the other side you will be served a good piece of filmaking with some standout moments and performances, but will leave not sure you got what was promised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp excels in a movie that is serviceable but forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand now what everyone means when they say they've come away from Black Mass feeling pretty much nothing. I place blame for that with Scott Cooper, who is the perfect example of "safe" director choice. He can pull out great performances and construct solid scenes but he has no flair or trademark to his ability. Just as Crazy Heart was a less interesting rehash of The Wrestler, Black Mass is a less fun, surprisingly less compelling version of Goodfellas. That's not to say Black Mass is bad. It is throughly well put together and honestly I can't point to a flaw, its just that with only one exception, nothing in this movie is particularly memorable. That exception is the acting. Boy oh boy how happy I am to say that I like Johnny Depp now. After a decade defiling our screens with excruciating melodramas, unwanted Pirates sequels and Tim Burton colour-gasms, his performance as James Whitey Bulger is easily the finest of the year. He wears his dead tooth, slicked back hair and skull makeup like a crown and owns every single scene of this film. He's cold, collected, brutal and completely remorseless. He has no qualms about killing women or coaching his son to assault other children. Not since Javier Bardem's Oscar-winning turn as Anton Chigurh have I been so thankful this guy can't come up and speak to me in real life. I would honestly not know what to do. However, it is the tragically too few scenes in which Cooper lets Depp tap into Bulger's human side (his relationship with his son) that Depp really shines. A look of haunted hope or grief crosses his face very briefly, before he buries it down beneath the surface of evil. Just as Cooper finally won Bridges his Oscar, I think and hope that Depp ascends to the stage next February.Black Mass is definitely an acting vehicle. Joel Edgerton is also very good here, transforming from FBI nobody to cocky top man as he coasts through the ranks. Dakota Johnson is great in a small role as Jimmy's girlfriend - it takes a lot of skill to look at Depp's Whitey Bulger and show convincing affection and love in your eyes. Julianne Nicholson's holds up her end of the bargain in a scene that allows Depp to really show Bulger's sick mannerisms. Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Saarsgard, Corey Stoll and Jesse Plemons are all great, though I wish Kevin Bacon had been given more to do.The film's pacing is excruciating, probably the longest two hours of my life. The story of Black Mass is fascinating, but surprisingly I found myself bored by the film's screenplay. We jump from event to event just before each murder or crime is committed, not really understanding why its happening. Its as if Cooper was more interested in showing the murders than explaining why they happened. There's some great dialogue in here, particularly a line about playing cops and robbers in the playground and in real life, but not enough to keep the film moving along at a steady pace. I still love the "family secret" scene, although I know is less effective than the one in Goodfellas - and for some reason works less effectively than in the trailer. Beyond that, though, there's little to criticise about Black Mass. Its serviceable enough to recommend for Depp's performance, and I hope that he and the makeup artists get the recognition they deserve, but beyond that I can't help but feel let down by a film that was in my top three anticipated of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited when I saw the trailer for the movie, being a Johnny Depp fan. What I got was a bitter disappointment. The movie was long, unoriginal and a bit boring.The characters were two-dimensional, clique and just plain unlikable. I did not relate or care about any of them, including Jimmy's young son and girlfriend. The relationships in the movie were undeveloped and did not evoke any emotions whatsoever. The movie did not bring anything new to the audience. It was like "Goodfellas" and "The Departed" had a baby. It sounds awesome but it's not. It's dull and has already been seen. I expected much more violence and gore, like the trailer implied, another disappointment I guess. The only good part of the movie, is the reason I watched it. Johnny Depp. Although I don't think his character reached his full potential, he still gave a great performance. His character was unsettling and straight-up creepy. Granted the great special effects and makeup did help, his acting was phenomenal. The only emotion I felt, besides disappointment, was actual fear when he was on screen. Overall, I give this movie 5 stars out of 10, solely on Depp's performance. This is a kind of movie you would watch if nothing else was on.</fullReview>

Uneven account of Boston's Public Enemy #1, John "Whitey" Bulger (icy good Depp uncannily looking like Ray Liotta) and his connection with the feds including childhood bud John Connelly (Edgerton equally good) who is part of a task force after the Mafia in the 1980s relying on the dubious 'help' of Bulger. The screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth (based on Dick Lehr &amp; Gerard O'Neill's book) trips on itself in the fledgling relationship between its two principals but Scott Cooper's Martin Scorsese-lite direction could have used some more urgency to the proceedings at hand. A fine ensemble - some largely wasted (hello, Scott) - make up for the otherwise better-than-average but could've been better movie.</fullReview>

Why did he do that? Sometimes you figure it out on your own and sometimes the movie tells you the details later.

		<shortDescription>Despite it being fast-paced with lot of violence, it becomes repetitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this is actually quite interesting, especially about how the FBI backed up mobsters that turned informants. In order to wipe out and take down other criminals and in return get protection from the FBI through that process. It being based on a true story gives it more of a momentum. However the way the story plays out, becomes quickly repetitious. And sometimes just didn't flow very well with it's inconsistencies. At it's core it's a fairly simple story, I am sure their is more to the actual truth. But when it comes to the plot of this film, it's a simple story. But it sometimes seemed to drag and felt like it was all over the place at times, because of the pacing. It's a fast paced movie, but still seemed to drag. Unlike some other movies that deal with the criminal undergrounds, this one was difficult to get invested in. It was difficult to care about what was going on. All the actors did a good job and Johnny Depp finally after quite some time got to show off his acting chops. As this silent loose cannon, a ticking time bomb you don't know when he is going to go off. Overall, this is a movie that is worth seeing once if you like mafia and crime movies. But it's forgettable and you probably won't view it twice.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though marketed as this dark crime thriller, Black Mass is more of the drama biography type with little action or suspense. Though the story is something new and our crime hero is what I'd say unheard of, the entirety of this film does feel old and slow. On the topic of slow, this film feels long and drawn out, with a slow pace and a lot of uneventful scenes. However, what Black Mass achieves is something of an entertaining adventure, despite all of its flaws. At first this film is hard to get into, but if you hold it out some reward is granted. The pacing and action is what makes this film suffer, giving the audience very little to invest in, but Johnny Depp's acting (though not his best performance) is something that does make this film pop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp's the star of this unspectacular crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something somewhat unspectacular about Black Mass. A strange thing considering the material at its disposal and the cast of A listers that adorn it's scenes, but Black Mass never makes the most of the tools as its disposal and while ending up as an enjoyable and a sometimes downright intense watch, you can't help but escape the feeling this Johnny Depp renaissance led mob film missed an opportunity to become a downright classic.Tusk, Mortdecai, Transcendence, The Lone Ranger, Dark Shadows, countless Pirates of the Caribbean forgettable's and Australian dog law problems, it hasn't been a great period of time to be Johnny Depp or a Depp fan but when the first clips of Black Mass appeared earlier this year and advance reactions to the film overwhelming positive, the general consensus was that Black Mass could be the career saver of the dwindling star.While the film around him suffers from a general lack of heart and soul that would've made it a truly audience grabbing event, Depp is without a doubt the MVP of the show. His portrayal of real life Boston mobster James "Whitey" Bulger is one of his most instantly memorable screen incarnations even though by the films end you feel his turn was underutilised by director Scott Cooper. Whenever Depp's on screen, all menace and fiery from within, Black Mass is elevated to another level. He shares in a few scenes that will make you straighten your back and be glued to the screen. It's an impressive turn but not one I'm convinced will garner the actor his 4th Oscar nomination.Surrounding Depp's turn is a hugely loaded cast that bar Joel Edgerton's FBI agent John Connolly get a pretty short shift of proceedings. Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Saarsgarrd, Corey Stoll and Jesse Plemons all impress but don't get much to do while the females in the picture Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple get an even shorter straw with mere minutes of screen time in what seems like a boys only adventure.It's a real shame Cooper couldn't draw more out of this loaded tale and his star studded cast and it's curious that such a thrilling story on paper can at times become such a lacking and uninvolving event on screen. Overall there's a real lack of emotion here that holds back much investment the audience would've otherwise afforded this mobster tale.It's great to see Depp once more deliver on his talent and there are scenes within Black Mass that rank as some of the year's best but at the end of the day this highly watchable and finely filmed story is a bit of a soulless affair that missed its opportunity to become something truly special.3 ? leather jackets out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so looking forward to this movie and was so disappointed! Many of the actual events took place within a mile or two of my apartment and one scene was shot a five minute walk away. A dozen or so people I know took part in the filming, which was a big deal in Boston and seemed like a huge amount of fun. But the result is dark, dreay, and really, really slow.I read the book while the movie was being filmed at found it to be a real page turner. Almost none of the drama and suspense, though, made it off the page. Everything seemed completely predictable, I would think, even to someone who had never heard of Whitey Bulger and his exploits. Even the violence was tedious. The film is less than two hours long and seemed more like six.The acting was fine. Some of it was even quite good. The cinematography was excellent. But the general effect was gray and lifeless, almost plot less, very odd for a gangster flick. I've actually met Billy Bulger and he is a much more vivid character than appeared in this film, no fault to Cumberbatch so far as I could see. If the book is anything to go by, the other characters were similarly dialed down. The mournfully tasteful, softly sobbing violins of the sound track set a mood that seemed afraid to get above a grayish whisper.And, aside from a couple of skyline views and City Hall, which incongruously plays FBI Headquarters (the real thing is in an office tower next door), there is almost nothing recognizable as Boston. The gritty, contradictory texture the city had in the '70s, the high contrasts between the old and grand, the glittery new, and the old and just run down are entirely missing. Huge chunks of the original script, including whole days of shooting and many characters, were cut out altogether, allegedly to quicken the pace. Alas, a sacrifice to no end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and Nick were really excited to see this movie! It looked like it had something really unique to offer! And on the plus side, it had Johnny Depp, so what could go so wrong? Sadly, A lot went wrong! The script is just horribly written. It tries too hard to be Goodfellas. Example, it had non stop swearing in it, the stylized violence was the same, and they do it with narration. All the characters are so unlikeable. They all just swear and insult each other, both the gangsters and the cops. There were was just so intelligence put into it at all.Director Scott Cooper (who also did Crazy Heart) did an okay job, but I felt at times he just did not know what he was doing. The cinematography was decent, but again, felt extremely rushed.The acting was top notch, especially by Johnny Depp who plays gangster/criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger. Depp brought so much to this man who he is impersonating. He is both creepy and unpredictable. However, he is also a family man and a gentlemen to the ladies! One scene that was just pure brilliant was when everybody was gathered around the dinner table and a subject of steak turns into a huge, creepy, I am going to kill you scene. That scene truly was the best, because it was showing just how much of a psychopath James 'Whitey' Bulger really was, and sadly it didn't explore it enough! There was just no character development! Overall, Johnny Depp will at least get another Oscar nomination, and hopefully he will win, because this is definitely his best performance and he just shows us that he does not care what we think of him and goes ahead and plays whoever he wants and shows us his true talents! Overall, is it watchable. It is not horrible. But see it for Johnny Depp's performance. He is just brilliant! 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping, intense Johnny Depp performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a Biopic, a Crime Drama, that follows infamous crime lord James "Whitey" Bulger and his involvement with the FBI during the 70's and 80's that led to him becoming one of the most notorious and violently dangerous mobsters in history. This for me is one of the films that is leading the Oscar race in multiple categories. Maybe not for Best Picture but as of today, this film is a strong contender for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and i reckon even Best Cinematography. It was an incredibly gripping story that was told, it started off a little slow but once it found its feet around 30 minutes in it just got better and better right to the very end. There were occasional moments where it started to look like it wasn't really going anywhere but it quickly gets back on track. It was intense and such an interesting and surreal story that i really knew nothing about. Like i said, there were a couple of moments where it was beginning to lose me a little but there were so many big events packed into this film that if you walked out for even a minute you would miss something. And that just shows a great adaptation of real life events and displaying them in a dramatic way with a very very dark tone that doesn't lighten up at all. But lets talk about the star of the film, the man who elevates this film so much and gets you so engaged in what is going on, the man who is leading the race for the Best Actor Oscar this year...... Johnny Depp. He is such and absolutely talented actor and this is his best performance in a long time and is one of his best ever because he hits it out of the park in this role. Johnny Depp did such a fantastic job at playing this violent, deranged mobster that 10 minutes into the film you completely forget you are watching Johnny Depp. Almost instantly, he completely disappears into the role and then there is no Depp, only James "Whitey" Bulger. He transformed and became this intimidating monster and he really allowed you to see how so many people at the time would fear him and have nightmares about him. An incredible performance and as of today a strong Oscar contender. But why stop there? If we're giving away Best Actor Nominations, i thing we should give away a Best Supporting Actor Nomination to the amazing Joel Edgerton. He was so great in this film that it is so hard to believe that even with Johnny Depp in the spotlight he manages to shine almost just as brightly. His character was so much more complex than Depp's, he wasn't just crazy, there were so many layers to his character and decisions he has to make and problems he has to overcome that made him an equally interesting character. Just a truly fantastic performance and you cannot help but to be on this guys side for the entire film. Those were the two big guys but then you also had Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Rory Cochrane, and many more all putting on a show. There were so many great performances and they all made for the best parts of the film. The cinematography was also amazing, very well framed shots captured the tones of the scenes exceptionally well. So well that it may be in the running for Best Cinematography at the end of the year, but we'll have to wait and see. Well an intense story that has its ups and downs in conjunction with some of the best performances of the year puts this film in strong contention for some Oscars. - 7.9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Gangsters Are Actually Terrifying!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass, Hollywood's newest mafia entry directed by Scott Cooper, follows the true story of Boston's baleful phantom during the 70's and 80's: Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp). Hearing his name now just chills you to the bone. The film commences with an FBI interrogation with one of Bulger's crewmen, Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), and as the conversation carries on, it slowly builds up to finally saying that name. "I need to know everything you know about the Winter Hill gang?and, specifically, what you know about your former boss?and now fugitive? JAMES WHITEY BULGER." As soon as you hear his name uttered in such a solemn tone?mixed with Weeks' dour countenance?the exact significance behind this legend is impactfully conveyed.Told through convenient voice-over, we retrace Bulger's beginnings all the way through his rise and, eventually, his downfall. Initially, the film's flaws were drastically more pronounced for me: it was quite unfocused in its direction, telling an overly familiar gangster tale that felt slightly messy and poorly-paced in its execution. Too much screen-time is paid to some of the rather uninteresting elements of this otherwise endlessly fascinating history. What kept me genuinely enthusiastic and engaged though were the incredible performances across the board, the majority of which are unfortunately brief but exceptionally memorable from the likes of Dakota Johnson (as Whitey's wife), Julianne Nicholson, and Peter Sarsgaard in particular. In addition, Joel Edgerton continues to prove his pure thespian prowess; he's just utterly captivating and dedicated in every role, and here, he becomes just as detestable as Matt Damon in The Departed?a foolish yet manipulative weasel. Of course, the other standout is Johnny Depp's terrifying portrayal of Bulger?easily his best showcase in the past five years.Now, the cast and crew seem to be flip-flopping on their intentions in terms of properly handling this character. Suddenly, they're clarifying that they wanted to humanize Whitey, and that has ultimately become the annoyingly uninspired cliché of modern biopics and cinema, in general. Everyone has to be humanized; the most despicable figures in our world's history have to be humanized because it makes it oh-so-complex. Regardless of what the filmmakers claim, I saw little to no humanity in Bulger's face?his irritated mannerisms and enigmatic contemplations? which was certainly fitting in this case. It makes for a more unique venture in a genre that always tries to create sympathy and relatability out of the criminals?yes, he's soulless; he's morally vacant; and he is just as shallow as you would think. And like most biopics, the film is more so a rushed series of events in this subject's life, followed by the usual verbose "what happened to everyone afterwards?" outro before the cut to credits, rather than actually thematic and narrative cohesion.With that being said, it's been six days since I viewed Black Mass but the more I reflected on its substance since, the more eager I've been to write up a review and get some things off my chest. As a result of the frankly unoriginal criticisms that have been thrown at this film (accusing it of simply mimicking Scorsese in a fruitless way), Black Mass's refreshing inventiveness to the genre remains understated. The fact of the matter is that never (or, at least, rarely) do we get to see actual anti-gangster pictures. No, we have Goodfellas and The Godfather and The Departed?all films that either create amusement and fun out of such twisted individuals or, essentially, turn them into dignified badasses for entertainment sake. "Man, these guys are so cool; they're alpha-males with so many friends and so much power and bam bam bam!" Black Mass, however, treats this environment like an unmitigated horror movie. There's nothing romanticized or hilarious about the disturbingly authentic murders here, not to mention the totally demented look on Depp's face?his decaying teeth biting his lip, and those frightening deep blue eyes forever widening?as he mercilessly chokes the life out of a possibly innocent young woman. The powerfully haunting and sinister score by Tom Holkenborg superbly complements the arrantly dreary atmosphere of South Boston in these times.Much like Foxcatcher was a downright condemnation of (competitive) sports, the similarly morose grayness in the shot compositions here makes Black Mass an undeniable condemnation of this community (even though it's not nearly as thematically profound as the former). There is absolutely nothing cool about these people. Perhaps you'll lambast Depp's overt make-up for making him appear a whole lot like a vampire? even if that's true, in a way, that's certainly an interesting and effective way to exhibit the sheer eeriness of this unbelievable being; in fact, it might as well parallel the bloodthirstiness of a vampire, lurking in the shadows and prone to attack when you least expect it. Aside from Al Capone, he was the most notorious mobster who actually found his way atop the FBI's Most Wanted list right next to Osama Bin Laden?a mythic unstoppable figure that signaled dark times for Boston indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass (2015) *** (out of 4) Violent telling of Boston criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) who started as just a small crook but quickly rose to be one of the biggest crime lords out there. A lot of this was due to his childhood friend John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a FBI agent, who began working with the criminal in exchange for information.BLACK MASS really wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be but there's no question that it's a solid film that managed to features some very good performances. I think the film falls short of being great for a number of reasons but one of the biggest is the fact that we've seen this type of gangster film countless times before and there's really nothing here that separates this film from various others out there.I will say that the best thing about the film was the performance from Depp who really sinks his teeth into this role. Depp had been criticized for some of his film choices over the past few years but this is certainly him jumping back into the game and showing what he can do. I thought he was extremely good here and especially with that coldness he brought the character. He's surrounding by some nice support from Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane and Dakota Johnson.The gangster genre has delivered some of the greatest movies ever made and it's created some rather by-the-number films that were quickly forgotten. I wouldn't say this film is going to be forgotten but it's certainly not going to reach the levels of GOODFELLAS, THE GODFATHER or WHITE HEAT. With that said, there's a nice little story here, some great performances and some graphic violence that makes it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly i won't fill an A4 page of telling you all about the film for you to then go and watch it know every twist and turn. a review to me is a outline and small snippet of info with regards acting and content and so what about Black Mass? well it tells the story of James "Whitey" Bulger, an Irish Mob godfather and a true story. Films based on true events are usually enthralling and pull you into it if they are well written and this was an example of great writing coupled with good directing. The Acting was out of this world, i mean Johnny Depp always pulls an audience but this was a much different role to his normal acting parts and he was the best. Not only credit to Depp is Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson and Kevin Bacon who all made a great cast and a film i would recommend to anyone. its a 2 hour film but would have gladly sat in the cinema for another hour it was that good. i gave this film a 10 star but would give it over that any day. just go see it or get on the Bluray.</fullReview>

The moment I saw his face with a balding head and grey hair, I thought: let's give this a chance. And it proved a great thing to do.We all have seen mafia movies many times, and this in a way doesn't bring anything too new to that list. Turns out, you sort of expect the all too familiar spaghetti dinners, shots in the back of the head, and a police department that is more corrupt than you could imagine. Still, these elements always work. If they didn't, they would not continue to make movies out of it. Let's make some more really, I still enjoy them, especially if based on real events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is excellent. I'm not a huge Johnny Depp fan, but this is his best movie EVER. And while some may think it moves slow, etc. this movie is an accurate depiction of Whitey Bulger's life as one of America's most notorious gangsters. Remember 'The Departed?' As you may know, it was 'loosely based' upon Bulger - although many facts were altered. The reason why: Whitey hadn't been caught by the FBI. Martin Scorsese didn't have the stones to use Whitey's name. He called Jack Nicholson 'Frank Costello,' aka the crime boss in New York, circa 1950. Whitey was finally captured in Santa Monica in 2011 by the Fed's. It was only after he was behind bars for life did anyone DARE make a true to life movie based upon him. Can anyone blame Scorsese or anyone else? Whitey was a ruthless, cold-blooded killer. Black Mass shows this in fine detail. In my opinion, while 'Mass' isn't 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' quality, if you know and follow gangster movies as I do, 'Black Mass' is most certainly in my Top 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As it says on the title of this page,genre :"BIOGRAPHY, crime, drama" This is not fiction, this is based on a true story.Most of the times, reality is not as interesting as fiction.I judge it as it is, it is not rightful to compare this movie with Scorsese or Coppola's masterpieces which were dealing with mafia and other stuff. "GODFATHER", GOODFELLAS, CASINO, those were masterpieces, however, it was fiction. I strongly believe that this is a great movie, close to masterpiece. Johny Depp gives one of the strongest performances of the decade, he was frightening and breathtaking, scaring as hell.He was not a gangster caricature nor pompous,he was flesh and bones, crime incarnate. He should be nominated and rewarded. I watched "THE MARTIAN", it is a good movie and Matt Damon is fantastic but it's a shame that he is nominated and Depp is not. Edgerton is also great, i understand the character, his motive and why he did the things he did.Overall, this is a great and flawless movie, there is nothing that Scott Cooper could have done it better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Edward he was soft, as Jack he was funny, but now he's deadly.Johnny Depp returns with a mind blowing performance as Boston gangster Whitey Bulger in thrilling crime drama Black Mass.The film focuses on Bulger's alliance with the FBI to catch a bigger gangster, however things get out of control as Bulger brings his killer attitude with him. Also starring Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon, the film provides varieties of five star performances, and scenes.When you meet Bulger on screen, it's not Johnny Depp it is Whitey Bulger, and he has a danger zone cover his entire body space, one you cross it, you will be in the ground. He's scary, and a nightmare for a neighbour, and if you think that sounds negative, it's completely far from it, if an actor achieves this description in a film, then you know a great performer.If you want to know more on Boston's gangster history, then Black Mass is a film that will peak your interest, but also make you discuss. Although it not be as acclaimed as classics such as the Godfather, and Goodfellas, this film is still a brilliant biography of a dangerous criminal.Black Mass is a must see performance by Depp, although maybe not being the absolute must see film of the year, but still a thrilling, magnificent piece of work.

		<fullReview>James "Whitey" Bulger, the kingpin leader of the "Winter Hill" gang, was a notorious criminal from South Boston responsible for many deaths. He was a fugitive for many years until he was found and arrested in Santa Monica, California in 2011. Bulger was as vulgar as a criminal could get. Bulger was also an FBI informant revealing info on mafia organizations in North Boston, but that didn't stop Bulger from orchestrating his own mass killings. Director Scott Cooper has organized a crime film on the story of Bulger's violent ways in South Boston called "Black Mass". The film was a surefire hit with me, and I thought Cooper did a sensational job in orchestrating it. Johnny Depp's performance as Bulger was the best of his career, and you could "depp" on it that it will garner him a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Joel Edgerton was also on his game as FBI Agent John Connolly who protected Whitey for selfish career purposes. Peter Sarsgaard provides a scene-stealing performance as a drug-dealer paranoid that Bulger will assassinate him. Benedict Cumberbatch did a nice job imitating a Massachusetts Senator who also happens to be Whitey's brother, ouch! Mark Malluok and and Jez Butterworth's screenplay of the picture was worthy and on its mark with its authentic narrative on the crime world of South Boston and of course Bulger's rise &amp; fall. However, in all, it was Depp who was the biggest hit of the movie, and Johnny being bad was very very good. So witness it for yourself and then tell the masses about "Black Mass". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James "Whitey" Bulger is one of the most interesting phenomena on the American crime scene. Not only that he is a colorful character, but also his criminal career was quite distinctive, as well as later life. For 20 years he ruled the Boston underworld, and then he spent 16 years on the run. He served as a model for Martin Scorsese for the character of Frank Costello in The Departed, the eccentric mobster who put their his spies in the police, masterfully played by Jack Nicholson. Here we have Black Mass by Scott Cooper with Johnnie Depp in the role of James Bulger. Deep finally has a chance to really play a character. Black Mass is not a boring movie and a movie without style, but it still lacks that certain something. You can find it in few individual scenes, but it was not enough to improve the impression of a film that lasts two hours.</fullReview>

Rest assured, Johnny Depp plays an amazing Whitey Bulger. His Whitey is beyond creepy and unstable, just as he should. The rest of the movie really was disappointing for what I was expecting. The writing got stagnant and really lacked development at points. As a viewer, I really had a hard time keeping my attention on what was going on as the movie progressed. The supporting cast looks great on paper with Joel Edgerton, Bennedict Cumberbach, Dakota Johnson, and Kevin Bacon. Unfortunately, The rest of the cast underperformed, essentially wasting how great Depp performed. Joel Edgerton was the most disappointing of them all. He overacted on a lot of scenes and really didn't seem to fit the flow of the movie. Bennedict Cumberbach had a chance to really step up for the rest of the cast as well, but just gave an average performance as Whitey's brother. With all this in mind, Johnny really did come through and save an average movie. His performance is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James 'Whitey' Bulger is a name that I had been unfamiliar with and even after a quick google search whilst waiting for the film to begin, Boston's most infamous Irish mob boss was still an unknown quantity. My lack of knowledge into the life and crimes of Jimmy Bulger worked in my favour, enabling me to sit back, relax and enjoy the film without the inevitable comparisons that Depp was receiving in his portrayal of the 'Real McCoy'. I made a mental note to allow the film to naturally unfold knowing that most mob/crime genre films are immediately compared unfairly to such classics as 'Goodfellas' and 'The Godfather'.'Black Mass' deserves a good write-up because it is simply a good film. Depp's impeccable performance as the psychotic Bulger shows the doubters how good an actor he really is when given a character full of meat and less salad. Depp's scary portrayal drives the movie to heights that it otherwise would not have got to with a lesser craftsman. Johnny may have not looked exactly like Bulger but he wasn't far off it and his manner might of reminded us all of Ray Liotta out of 'Goodfellas' but the way in which he delivered his character was nothing short of superb. Depp's blue-eyed stare would have been disturbing for anyone on the receiving end and the ruthless nature that he goes about eliminating anyone that crosses him would have the best of us packing up and flying to a different planet. Johnny Depp may fall short of the ultimate gong at award season time but a nomination would not be unjustified.Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) hasn't done his Directing any harm with a film that won't look out of place in its genre. It may not get the same kudos as the mafia classics but it has a sound narrative driven by some outstanding talent. Cooper's main goal was to highlight the ferociousness of one of America's most dangerous men and the alliance he had with the FBI. Bulger becomes an informant for the Fed's so they can bring down rival mobsters that ruled the city of Boston in the 1970's and 80's. For the information that Bulger provides, he and his Winter Hill Gang are able to rise up from Boston's 'Southies' Projects and stake a claim to being the city's number one mobsters. Australia's very own Joel Edgerton plays the corrupt Fed, John Connelly, who is able to keep the aggressive Bulger in business. Edgerton is now at the top of his game in Hollywood and carries himself well along side the tremendous Depp. Benedict Cumberbatch brings star quality to his role as Jimmy Bulger's politically aligned brother, Billy Bulger and Kevin Bacon has a nice solid performance as Charles McGuire, an FBI Taskforce leader who is at loggerheads with Connelly about Bulger's involvement with the law.Go and see this film for Depp's performance alone. His portrayal is first class all the way down to the idiosyncratic mannerisms. He looks psychotic, sounds psychotic and even feels psychotic. Cooper has given Depp free rein to develop a memorable character and it is backed up by an array of talent that makes 'Black Mass' worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do I smell an Oscar nomination?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp has spent the last few years ruining his career with films like "Alice in Wonderland" (2010), "Dark Shadows" (2012) and "The Lone Ranger" (2013), his roles in which reduced him to caricatures of his own talent. He's been little more than a novelty as of late, all because he hasn't had a truly legitimate role since he introduced the world to Jack Sparrow in 2003 ? until "Black Mass", that is. Almost as if the sole purpose of his role was purely to silence his critics, Depp provides arguably the best work of his career in "Black Mass", and for those of you who have at least seen the trailer, this should come as no surprise. Depp is completely unrecognizable as Whitey Bulger, the single most notorious gangster to ever come out of Boston. The syrupy voice, those icy blue eyes, the bravado in his gait; every aspect of his performance is the categorical opposite of Depp himself.Needless to say, I'd put my money on Depp earning an Oscar nomination, and he might just win it depending on the other contenders. But Depp's performance seems to be the only thing people are talking about when it comes to "Black Mass". There are other characters and a plot to boot, but even the film itself doesn't really seem interested in much other than showing us just how fantastically talented Depp really is. As far as modern gangster flicks go, "Black Mass" feels pretty familiar. This is in part due to the fact that the film is very much like a documentary. It provides little insight beyond what much of the public already knows, mainly because, like many biopics, it tries to encompass 40 years of Bulger's life in a two-hour runtime: a feat that is rarely achieved gracefully. Bulger's inner workings are explored, but only briefly, never with any true depth or analysis. We follow him as he runs his business, racketeering, selling drugs and murdering those that get in his way, but most of this information could be found on his Wikipedia page. The real psychology of the man behind the monster is never really discovered. This is partially because Bulger isn't really the protagonist of "Black Mass", which makes sense when considering that he's basically a super villain. Many biopics about the seedier individuals in history will employ this technique; instead of making the biopic's subject the protagonist, we see the whole story through the eyes of one of their close associates. "Black Mass" makes an attempt at this method but never really establishes a clear lead character to take the audience through the story. Instead of seeing through the eyes of one character, we are given the perspectives of several, which reduces the clarity of the plot. This could partially be due to the fact that director Scott Cooper has never dealt with a subject of the same magnitude as Whitey Bulger. His previous works, "Crazy Heart" (2009) and "Out of the Furnace" (2013), were much simpler stories dealing with love and loss, and even though neither is as taut as they could be, both are more focused and fleshed out than "Black Mass". But I don't mean to be a downer. "Black Mass" is definitely a great film from a director on the rise who has proved time and time again that he's capable of pulling out the best in his actors. Thanks to Depp's towering presence, the film contains many incredibly tense scenes and one of the most interesting characters of recent memory. "Black Mass" may not be revolutionary but it's certainly worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Acting; Lackluster Writing, Could have been so much more interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All actors in Black Mass are really working it, and for the most part the acting is very good. However, if you are from Boston you will have a hard time not focusing on how incorrect the Boston accent is on just about everyone (except Connelly and Depp does okay with the Boston accent but he's mostly growling and being menacing rather than really trying to claim a true Boston accent. Kevin Bacon, on the other hand, can't even seem to land one single line with an authentic accent).Anyway, the writing and story line are slow and I'm not sure anyone who isn't already familiar with the case of Whitey Bulger, the FBI, his brother Billy Bulger and the whole sordid scandal will come away with sufficient information or anything interesting here.I kept asking Why? Why is James Whitey Bulger doing this - what has he done - what's the background here with the Bulger family - tell us more about Anjulo, give us more detail on his associates and the connection with his 2 brothers. The movie just gives us a very broad overview of a sad and fascinating criminal case. I think this story would be much better served by a miniseries rather than a film where time constraints seem to make it impossible to bring the fascinating details to light.The kid who played Landry on Friday Night Lights (Jesse Plemons) does a great job. He's great in Breaking Bad and also great in Black Mass. I don't understand why Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott wanted to be in this. Depp and Joel Edgerton (FBI agent Connolly) do an excellent job with their characters. Benedict Cumberbath as William (Billy) Bulger is just silly; I've never seen Benedict be so awful and ill suited for a role. The female actors are just there to be wives and a step daughter/hooker, not much to note here.Overall uninspired writing and boring story - zero entertainment value. With such a fascinating true story to tell I don't see why this happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Strictly criminal"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gangster film is a notoriously hard nut to crack these days, as there's the constant threat of being in somebody's shadow. In reconciling the juggling act of the inherent fun of criminal transgressions and the necessary solemn Hollywood moralizing hangover from the James Cagney days, do you opt for operatic and lyrical (Coppola), showy, stylized and irreverent (Scorsese), or flinty realism (Michael Mann or The Wire)? Even worse ? are you audacious enough, in the face of the omnipresent elephant in the room (what is there left to say, apart from the time-worn moral of 'Crime pays until it doesn't'?), to try something new in the pressure to avoid standing on the shoulders of giants, all without cracking under the pressure? Fuggeddaboutit! Thankfully, director Scott Cooper isn't fussy about trying to turn the genre on its head, focusing less on innovation and more on doing it really well. As such, Black Mass, despite being a tale as old as time, is a steady, solid, immaculately stylistic, and impressively emotive gangster film. Changing the setting to Bahstan (what's The Depahted? This is a fah*kin' TRUE story!) lends fierce energy to the familiar ideologies of family and betrayal in the mob, while structuring the story around retroactive testimonies of Whitey Bulger's former associates lends the film a fresher framework (just don't say it rips off Citizen Kane, if you don't want to be buried under the dahcks). Cooper is an expert at pacing, injecting bursts of furious violence into innocuous scenes to give a sense of the palpable tension inherent in being in the presence of the temperamentally psychotic Bulger, with everything from offhand comments to bad table manners being grounds for a bullet through the head. Cleverly, however, to counterbalance Bulger's inherent trashiness, Masanobu Takayanagi's crisp cinematography and the engagingly somber musical score by Tom Holkenborg (building off his more bombastic work in this year's Mad Max: Fury Road) lend the film a distinctly classical feel not dissimilar with the title's theological allusions. While the screenplay occasionally dips too liberally into 'trailer sting expositionary one-liners' territory, for the most part, things crackle with enough impressive verisimilitude that, apart from a brief third-act lull, command attention throughout. Why Cooper decided to shroud Johnny Depp in such distractingly flamboyant makeup and electric blue contact lenses is beyond me (the real Whitey Bulger didn't look that corpse- like?), but thankfully Depp is a skilled enough performer to own his sallow lizard look, rather than being out-acted by his makeup. Conversely, this is the liveliest and most riveting we've seen Depp in years of drowning in Disney sequels and spinoffs ? charming (the film's most poignant scene is an unassuming Bulger allowing his mother to win against him at gin, or pressing pause on a heist to help an elderly lady carry her groceries up the stairs), haunted, and savage, sometimes all simultaneously, Depp's Whitey Bulger is an incendiary performance, and it would be a genuine shock to see him go unrecognized at this year's Academy Awards. Keen to not be overshadowed, the stellar ensemble cast all sell their character vignettes with aplomb. Joel Edgerton offers a deliciously jeer-worthy cocktail of simpering and swagger as the FBI agent who enlists Bulger as an informant out of a misplaced sense of childhood reverence, only to be exploited as Bulger bloats his criminal empire under the FBI's nose (the always excellent Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott add gravitas to the grimacing in these FBI interludes). Slightly hammy Bahstan accent aside, Benedict Cumberbatch is thoroughly charismatic with only a whiff of sleaze as Bulger's senatorial brother, while Dakota Johnson is 50 Shades of assertive here, fuming with increasingly fearful contempt, as Edgerton's wife. Rory Cochrane and Jesse Plemons carry an air of sadness as Bulger's second-in-command confidants, ashamed of what they've been sucked into yet aware that failure to commit would mean death, while even Juno Temple is a heartbreaking (single) scene stealer as Cochrane's underage prostitute girlfriend. Finally, in the overacting department, Peter Sarsgaard quivers with barely grounded manic paranoia as a dimwitted Californian witness testifying against Bulger, while Corey Stoll, still exuding Ant-Man levels of nuance (sarcasm), does more yelling than acting as the DA determined to bring down Bulger. Don't start throwing out comparisons to more revered gangster pics, or Black Mass will only, inevitably, suffer by comparison. Sometimes, it's enough to take a familiar recipe and marinate it in basic ingredients with consummate skill. Just don't disclose the recipe to Whitey Bulger, or that could get you buried real quick. Just sayin'. -7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLACK MASS: Bravo to Johnny Depp, unrecognizable (kudos to the hair and makeup people) for his Oscar worthy, chilling performance as real life Boston gangster Whitely Bulger, a small time gangster used as an informant by the FBI to bring down the Mafia, thus clearing the way for his own criminal operation. Finally, Depp gets to display his magnificent abilities and conveys the character's quiet menace which redefines cold blooded. Director, Scott Cooper takes a page out of Scorsese's Goodfellas playbook telling the story in narrative style. Joel Edgerton (recently of The Gift) plays the ambitious get- ahead-at-all-costs FBI agent who handles Whitely but gets himself in so deep he has no way out. The supporting all star cast (Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson) is stellar, the true story is better than fiction and the production values are off the charts. Score: 9. GO! Ya can't trust anybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SUPERB performance from JOHNNY DEPP !!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black mass is a great Gangster movie !!! But in some ways could be better. Great story,cast, and directing. Johnny Depp is the one who took the performance to the next level. He and Scott Cooper were the key factors in this great movie based on a true story. The story is about one of the biggest criminals of all time who starts off as a small time thug and turns into an FBI informant and becomes one of the greatest kingpins on a great edge of your seat thriller. With humorous/and horrifying lines. A lot of vulgarity but overall a pretty good movie. I see the who the next Oscar will be going to. Yep. JOHNNNNY DEEEEEPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas, meet Black Mass!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this review short. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, American Gangster, Donnie Brasco, and Blow, then you're going to love Black Mass. In terms of style and direction, it feels a lot like American Gangster with shades of Donnie Brasco. Black Mass is by far the darkest of the aforementioned movies -- it makes The Sopranos look like The Simpsons -- but Johnny Depp proves once again he's one of the most talented and versatile actors alive. His portrayal of Whitey is downright scary and deserves an Oscar.Now, I've got to say the critical reviews below are ridiculous. I'm reading comments like this movie doesn't bring anything new to the genre of gangster movies. By that logic no movies should have been made after The Godfather or The Goodfellas. This is a true story about Irish gangsters in Boston who colluded with the FBI during the 1970s and 80s. These are scary, unlikable people -- you know, like cold blooded killers actually are. If you want realism, and you're not squeamish, then this film delivers. A solid 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would put this alongside Donnie Brasco and Casino. Not quite as good as The Departed but it's not too far behind. Watch this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If nobody sees it, it didn't happen." James "Whitey" Bulger (Depp) controls Boston. He runs the most powerful mob in the city and his brother is a powerful state Senator. When he is approached by John Connolly (Edgerton) with an offer of an alliance with the FBI he thinks of it as a business deal. Now, free to do anything he wants, with the protection of the FBI, Bulger rises not only in the mafia power structure, but also to the 2nd most wanted man in the country, behind Osama Bin Laden. This is a movie I was really excited to watch. I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan but the mafia genre is my favorite. About 20 min in I have to say that I was very impressed with Depp and I think this is the best acting I have ever seen him do. For an actor like Depp to disappear totally into a character is difficult to do, but he pulled it off. The contacts helped, but his expressions and actions were unlike anything he has ever done, to the point of it being disturbing. I love all mafia shows but unlike the majority of them (Sopranos, Godfather, Goodfellas) this one makes you root against the main character. Overall, one of the best movies of this type to come out if a very long time. I wouldn't put this on the same level as Godfather or Goodfellas, but I would put it alongside Donnie Brasco and Casino. Not quite as good as The Departed (Nicholson's character was based on Bulger) but it's not too far behind. I really liked this. I give this an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre "Lead Perspective Gangster-Drama Style"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well.. In this decade, it was seldomly we see a movie like this. Cooper try to made a movie focusing on lead character with gangster- drama. He wanted to make a movie with Johnny Depp digging the Bulger character deeply. For a few years back, we could see only small amount of movie with this typical such as "The Wolf Of Wall Street", "American Hustle", and "Winter's Bone". I would say that this movie was not on par to these 3 movies, especially Scorsese's Direction. Of course if we see the experience aspect which Scorsese had, Its not even fair to compete this 2 director. Cooper is a young director and Scorsese is a legend and we should appreciate what Cooper could do to make such a movie at this time where movies are in crisis. Why in crisis ? Because i think movies nowadays taking the wrong path. Director's priority is not making a good movie, but it is how to make money from movies.Firstly from the acting. When i see Bulger character, i see Jack Nicholson in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Bulger's character is not even original (for classic movie viewers). Johnny Depp was not in his best potential as an actor. He is not good in this kind of typical character. Also when i see the supporting, all of them were just average (even Cumberbacth). But i give an appreciation to Joel Edgerton who did such amazing performance.Then the cinematography. Typical static shot, unworthy close-up shots, classic wannabe, empty establishing shots. Blunt writing with no memorable dialogue. Unoriginal narration style with forth-back plot.Art-Direction ? No no no.. I couldn't say anything which can make this movie feels artsy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is about James "Whitey" Bulger, the notorious Boston mob leader. It ought to be better than it is. The style and subject matter are chiefly from Martin Scorsese, just as the musical score borrows heavily from John Powell's score for "The Bourne Identity." There are several of Scorsese's familiar overhead shots of table tops, amusing scenes of Bulger playing gin rummy with his mother, and so forth.I'll have to guess at why it doesn't entirely clear the bar. It's certainly not the subject matter, which has been a popular movie subject since the beginning of the talkies in the early 30s. Oh, we LOVE gangsters. The casting is flawed, for one thing. Johnny Depp looks rather like Bulger but he's so inexpressive that there's hardly any way of knowing what the character is feeling, especially since he lies so often. He wears the same expression whether he's kissing his son good-night or shooting a traitor in the back of the head.Dakota Johnson looks sweet beyond comparison but it remains to be seen whether she has chops. The figure who is almost as central to the story as Bulger himself is Joel Edgerton, and he's not very convincing as an FBI agent. It's unpleasant to watch his character and listen to him. The whole movie is unpleasant. The opening shot is a close up of a battered, ugly, snotty, pitted face -- poor Jesse Plemons.Since this is "based on a true story," we expect the narrative to be messy. That's life, right? But this story is sometimes hard to follow because the continuity is weak. Not by design, I don't think, as it was in Stanley Kubrick's work, but because the script was faulty.What the movie DOES deliver on is gore. People are battered to death, blood splashing all over the place. People are constantly being shot, sometimes for reasons that are obscure. And they're almost all head shots, except for somebody like Peter Sarsgaard who gets riddled with bullets and dies shrieking with pain, rolling around in a parking lot. (Cf., Joe Pesci beaten to death with baseball bats in Scorsese's "Casino.") The FBI is involved in all this, one way or another, but they're hardly sympathetic figures.The reliable Kevin Bacon emerges with his dignity intact as does Sarsgaard. It's curious to see Benedict Cumberbatch in an American movie. He's a fine actor, though his accent sounds generically urban rather than Bostonian. Nice location shooting, by the way.It's not a bad film, not insulting, but it is sluggish and a little dull, uninspired except for the murder scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mostly true story of the rise and fall of South Boston gangster Whitey Bulger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was able to watch this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife chose to NOT see it, she doesn't care for this type of movie.First the title, I was able to find this online, "Black Mass" is a phrase, which essentially represents "a perversion of the Catholic mass,'' is a metaphor for the FBI's corruption, with Bulger as the devil. "It plays in the idea of an unholy alliance.'' Johnny Depp received a Best Actor nomination for his role as Bulger, complete with prosthetic makeup which, according to those who knew Bulger in the 1970s and 1980s, was eerily reminiscent of Bulger himself. The look, along with Depp's acting, was genuinely menacing to some of the cast members, according to the 12-minute feature on the DVD extras.Is it a good movie? Well yes if you believe that it is primarily factual. As we see in the movie Bulger leaves Boston and travels the world under assumed names until captured some years later and he is now in prison for the rest of his life. He disputes the content of the source book, as do several other key characters. Depp requested, through his lawyer, a face-to-face with Bulger, but was denied, reportedly because Bulger was not happy with the story being presented.The movie has lots of bloody violence and foul language throughout, as might be expected of ruthless mobsters. I choose to believe most of it is factual and as such is a fascinating look inside organized crime, informants, and FBI connections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining with great performances! 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I quite enjoyed this film because I did find Johnny Depp's character, James "Whitey" Bulger, quite intriguing and there is a sense of intensity throughout the movie, but it wasn't in the same league as Goodfellas. Johnny Depp played the leading role quite well and his brother, Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a weird choice but he still put in a good performance but it did seem like Whitey bullied his way into the underworld, more than using an intelligent mind to get to the top. Don't get me wrong, he did fool the FBI by giving them old information, so they could get away with there brutal and vicious behaviour but they done a lot of there murders in broad daylight and none of Whitey's team were that loyal. After the death of Whitey's son, he seemed to go a bit of the rails and he was killing random people for any reason. His close friend, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who worked for the FBI, was literally letting Whitey get away with murder and I honestly can't believe that he never thought that he would get caught. What also amazed me, was that everyone became a "rat" towards the end and no one seemed to try and hold back any information. Anyway, the make-up department really did give there all, by totally transforming Johnny Depp into a 70's thug. Some of the scenes are very brutal so it's not a movie for the squeamish but there is a lot of political footage, which I found uninteresting. The fact that Whitey was on the run for 16 years whilst being on the FBI's Most Wanted list, is truly amazing and with so many people turning against him, he will be living the rest of his life behind bars as a lonely man. His close brother Billy was an inspiring senator who everyone looked up to but when the FBI found out that he had been in contact with his brother, he sadly lost everything that he had worked hard for. All of his fellow criminals also had to pay the price for Whitey's action, by getting hefty jail sentences, so the question remains, was it really worth it! I suppose the buzz of having loads of power and money can get to your head but when your living on the edge, especially when you don't know when Whitey is going to turn on you, I'm not surprised that they all took the easy way out by confessing to there crimes. Anyway, it's definitely a watchable movie which I found quite interesting but I have seen better films in this genre. Enjoyable!Round-Up: For Johnny Depp's preparation for this movie, he asked Whitey's lawyer if he could have access to the man himself but he didn't want any connection to the book, which is the basis of this film, so I'm just wondering, how much of it is true. The director, Scott Cooper, did have access to some of Whitey's fellow work mates, who actually showed up on set and the movie was made in Boston, we're a lot of the real events took place, so that will explain the realism that is felt through the film. Anyway, Scott Cooper has only directed 3 movies in his career, including this one, and I must admit, they have been pretty impressive. He first hit the scene in 2009 with the Academy award winning Crazy Heart and he also made Out of the Furnace which starred Christian Bale and Casey Affleck. After playing the leading role in Donnie Brasco and playing John Dillinger in Public Enemies, I'm not surprised that Scott picked Depp for the leading role and you can tell that he was fully committed to the movie but it still felt like there was something missing. It is put together well and the various characters were great but I was left feeling that it could have been better.Budget: $53million Worldwide Gross: $100millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/crime/drama movies starring Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Adam Scott, David Harbour, Corey Stoll, Juno Temple and Julianne Nicholson. 6/10</fullReview>

Definitely not award worthy. Poor script, stereotypical gangster movie. Decent plot but too long and drawn out. A tad on the boring side. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theatre I would of been bummed out. Very underwhelming. There was a lot of fight scenes and killing which is always nice.

		<shortDescription>No Insight About the Story &amp; Adds Nothing to the Gangster Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Matter of Fact, sometimes very Intense Bio-Pic of the Infamous Criminal, don't call me "Whitey" Bulger. Left to "Run Amok" in His Southie Neighborhood of Boston, because He allegedly is supplying "Information" about His Rival Italian Gang.Ever since "Whitey" was finally Caught after 12 Years on the Lam, there have been No Shortage of Stories, Documentaries, and Dramas about His "Collaboration" with the FBI and His Brutal Gang Activities on the Streets of His Home Town.Anyone Aware of the Story will find this Rendition a Repeat of the Already Familiar. The Movie does Nothing to make it seem Fresh or Wanting. Aside from Johnny Depp's calculating and Effective Performance, and a full Cast of A-List Stars and Familiar Faces who all Perform Adequately, there just isn't enough Insight here to make this a Must See.As a Real-Life Gangster Film it is OK, but Certainly Nothing to attract Attention and most Definitely has Nothing New to Add to the Genre. It goes for a Flat Look and Stylization is Nowhere to be seen. It even has some Dull and rather Routine Scenes that make for a somewhat Facile Film.Those Unfamiliar with the Facts and anyone who has not seen a lot of Gangster Movies might find it Dramatic with Spurts of Street Violence with Characters that stare with Blank Eyes and Black Souls, with Perverse Loyalty and Attachments that Fade Quickly when the "Chips Are Down". The Film is a Nonstop Parade of Unlikable Characters on Both Sides of the Law and its a rather Depressing Dramatization of Despicable People. There are a couple of Futile Scenes Sprinkled in that tries to Humanize these Thugs and Cops, but the Good Cast is ultimately left with Shallow and Uninteresting Ugliness.Note...The Documentary..."Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger" (2014)...is an excellent Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Performances but Ho-Hum, and a bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers) I was expecting a bit more from director Scott Cooper's "Black Mass". It is repetitive in a poor way - featuring murder scene, dialog/exposition, repeat again and again. It hides under real events rather than illuminating them. Acting is satisfactory, but by the end of the movie it didn't matter. The movie was a mild bore. Moreover Johnny Depp's performance is decent, but overrated, and the screenplay is unoriginal - this is no "Goodfellas". There is little surprising, interesting, or fresh; and the movie just ends on an epilogue note. The production design, sets, and editing were pretty good but the violence was gratuitous and also repetitive - so altogther a little disappointing, but maybe worth one watch. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scott Cooper has me on the outside looking in. I can't seem to get close to the main character, Whitey Bulger. Upon reflection, the director presents a main character whose look is hard to accept. Most everyone else in the film looks normal, but the Bulger character is almost like... maybe Benjamin Button-maybe not that overstated. But after I slept on it I am convinced that this choice holds the film back. A different choice would have been to let Depp just play the part virtually looking like he does in real life. That's the other extreme anyway. As it stands I have trouble approaching this Bulger, so I remain at a distance, watching but never am I inside, immersed. The film as it is leaves a lot of potential untapped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets under your skin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over his impressively long career, Johnny Depp has adorned make-up and a variety of wigs, contact lenses and outlandish costumes to deliver a plethora of memorable (and not-so-memorable) characters, performed with a trademark flamboyance now simpatico with the actor. The success of these films, which are often seen through the Gothic lens of Tim Burton, makes it easy to forget that there is a good- looking actor capable of a fantastic 'normal' performance in there somewhere. Black Mass shows a bit of both sides. He has once again donned a rather distracting appearance - a set of pale blue eyes, a receding hairline and bulbous nose - to portray James "Whitey" Bulger, but there is also a terrific and unseen intensity to Depp here, convincingly scaring the s**t out of anyone he comes across.Clearly channelling Scorsese visually, director Scott Cooper of Crazy Heart (2009) and Out of the Furnace (2013) fame skips his main character's rise to criminal overlord in favour of showing us just how much of a b*****d Bulger was (and probably still is). His otherworldly appearance, with blotchy skin and a mouth full of wonky brown teeth, is not how the real man looked but instead serves to highlight his monstrous nature. Bulger's activities are recollected by his former gang members Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) and John Martorano (W. Earl Brown), who all have their own bone to pick with him by the end of their story. His willingness to murder and threaten whether it be for business, pleasure, or to simply stay out of jail led to Bulger becoming one of the most notorious criminals in Boston history.In the beginning, Bulger is approached by FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a local boy, who offers him a free ticket to the top of the criminal underworld. It's not snitching, but a deal that benefits both sides as Connolly is served rival gang members on a plate, and Bulger gets to carry on with his illegal activities without the prying eyes of federal agents. Only Connolly seems to be enjoying peeking into the criminal high life a bit too much while Bulger gives him diddly squat. Bulger plays him like a fiddle, managing to silence a dinner table with murderous threats thinly disguised as jest in one stand-out scene. And Black Mass is at its best when the film moves into darker territory, cruelly teasing the inevitable brutality to come whenever a disposable minor character shuffles onto the scene.Narratively, it's all over the place and tends to neglect detail in favour of more conventional biopic storytelling. In the few scenes he has, Benedict Cumberbatch oozes a subtle sliminess as Whitey's Massachusetts State Senate President brother Billy. The vastly different paths these two brothers took could have made for engaging drama and given the film more balance, but strangely Cooper chooses to almost ignore the relationship completely to concentrate on Bulger's dealing with the FBI, so Cumberbatch is criminally under- served. However, as silly as he looks, Depp is genuinely unsettling and, like the film as a whole, gets under your skin. Black Mass sounds like it should be a horror, and as the creepy real-life security footage plays out over the credits, its hard to deny that in many way it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Like A 60-Minutes Story With A Big Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Black Mass one has a detached feeling. A feature length film about a real criminal who had a long reign of running a criminal enterprise should seek to invest the viewer into the events as well as the man, Black Mass seems more like a glimpse that never reels one in to the time, the crime, and, most importantly never exposes much about the central figures. You really do not know more than, say, what a 15-minute 60 Minutes expose would reveal.The frustration begins with the use of Johnny Depp's James "Whitey" Bulger character. Depp does an excellent job of creating the image of Bulger, but somewhere the writers seem to gloss over what his reign of crime in Boston was actually costing in depravity and murder. It was a truly bizarre reign with a psychopathic Bulger controlling everything the FBI was pinning on the Mafia. How did a government agency with the power to clean up both The Mafia and Bulger get so used? Whatever was going on was somehow made possible by one John Connolly who for unknown reasons, other than what we're told is Southie loyalty, constructed a false story of Bulger being a high-value informant. One can only deduce Connally was, in reality, also a member of The Winter Hill Gang who idolized Bulger and ruined his life to "impress" the man. Joel Edgerton, like Depp, delivers shades of brilliance as Connolly only to be let down by what the writers glossed over. I simply think as viewers we aren't allowed to know these men in any revelatory way. Jesse Plemons portrayal, with limited screen time, as Bulger's lackey Kevin Weeks is far more revealing. We actually feel who he is a rough street kid without anything other than his devotion to Bulger. The same can be said for W. Earl Brown's dumb murdering thug Martorano and David Harbour's FBI agent John Morris as the we know better what kind of men these were even without lengthy development. It makes the omission of what and who Bulger and Connolly were all the more frustrating.So, if you want to see Depp really bring Bulger to the full light of day you simply won't get that. One feels Depp had the goods, and was in the mindset, to do so, but the writers failed to use him properly. This was just a recreation of an extremely topical overview with A-list talent instead. For those with an avid interest it may still, however, be worth a watch, for others not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Flick: About as true as it gets, which makes it boring at times...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up around this life, first in Queens and later when I moved to Southie to reconnect with the guys that I served with in the Marines. This is about as true as it gets. It misses the dramatic thrill of 'The Departed." It does not have the compelling power struggle of "The Godfather" movies. It is sort of a poor-man's Goodfellas in that the criminals are typical Irish gangsters of their era. They do not wear suits and get all dolled up. They kill, steal, and scheme - in jeans and bad jackets - that is what they do. In this regard, if you are looking for a movie that will end with some extraordinary dramatic flourish, you will be disappointed. The Godfather or the Sopranos are not the real life of these guys or most mobsters - Irish, Italian, or otherwise. The movie sucks you into the day-to-day existence of a guy who many questioned as to whether or not he was more psychopath than sociopath, and it makes you decide which was he. The one issue I have is that it allows other guys to walk away cleanly. Steve Flemmi is especially given a pass, when everyone knows he was a mass murderer and rapist of women. In the movie they make Flemmi out to be a sympathetic figure (probably because he was hired as a consultant). But in the end, you get a real picture of Whitey. He never really had to kill a lot of folks to get ahead because of the Irish Gang wars of the 1960s and 70s left him as the last man standing. Since the Italian mafia was the Federal focus of the time, he gets the deal he wants from the FBI and the local PD - especially in an Irish Boston that hated anyone with a vowel on the wrong side of his name. He sort of plods his way into power and once he is there, he holds it through pure and justifiable fear. In the end, you see what really happens - no drama... Whitey just committed crimes as easily as he breathed. It was natural for him. That is what makes this movie awesome. Johnny Depp really captures the essence of a guy that just kills people - sometimes for no real purpose. If you like the history of Organized Crime, you will love this movie. If you are looking for a two hour shoot 'em out, you will not. If you like your gangsters in suits and ties, you will hate it. If you like your mobsters in their real element, you will love it. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but Johnny Depp's make up artist should be fired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are into gangster movies like 'GoodFellas' or 'Casino' then you'll love this film. However this film is dedicated to telling the true story of the Irish-American mafia - not so much the Italians. Johnny's acting is superb. The story line connecting Bulgers life events, connections to the IRA and all his extortion and money laundering rackets has been clearly depicted throughout the film. The story is easy to follow and the violence scenes are very entertaining. Most of the actors were faultless throughout the film and can't be criticised. Only issue I had was the obsession by the make-up artist to make Johnny look so much like Bulger with the receding hairline, that they made him look unnatural. Also why was he so pale? Also why did some of the villains have such dirty greasy faces?Bulger was made to look more like The Bogeyman than a natural Boston city villain. You couldn't look at him straight in the face and take him seriously. If Johnny's acting and the story-line wasn't so good, it had the potential to ruin the whole film. Still I saw past the ridiculous make-up and really enjoyed the film. I learnt something new about history of crime in Boston too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something was missing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't argue with the fact that Black Mass achieved commercial success. It also managed to transform you into the time and place of the setting and wrap you around the prevailing mood. It was good direction in my opinion. The director achieved what he could achieve with the tools he had.My criticism comes in two broad veins: (1) casting/appearance and (2) script.Jonny Depp is an excellent actor but the prosthetics used on his face made him look like Jonny Depp but not like Jonny Depp at the same time. And I couldn't help but get distracted by it perpetually. Those blue contact lenses were the worst offender. I was waiting for the point where this piercing "blueness" was weaved into the story and the character of Whitey somehow - and whilst subtly this was achieved - it wasn't enough to take away from the distraction. In addition why on earth was Benedict Cumberbatch in this film? He looked woefully out of place. He didn't look like his family in anyway and his role appeared to be to just remind everyone Whitey had a brother who was a politician. Alternatively it was just a name to add to the credits and posters. An unknown would have been perfect for this. The "pulling power" of stars like Cumberbatch has its place in cinema (rightly or wrongly) but this was a film about Whitey and the focus should have been on his story. These two issues served to stir you back into reality every now and again and the story (which I'll come to) lost its grasp on you.The story. I mean it is what it is right? Whitey was a gangster, loved by most of his community, made a pact with the FBI, fell out of favour with the FBI, went on the run, got caught. There's not much variation to work with; but the film was crying out for a big scene or a middle or an end. There were none. In fact I was so surprised that the end of the film arrived that I double checked that people were leaving. It was almost as if production went sh*t - lets end here. There was nothing about his life on the run; nothing about the fates of the major characters (other than the text on screen); the film demanded that. We got no "fall from grace" and hardship. Instead we got high life, trouble with the law, the end.That said, Jonny Depp's performance (prosthetics aside) was fantastic though I wouldn't rank this alongside The Departed, Goodfellas, Godfather etc...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect 'biopic'? Or teeming with sub-genre pastiches and a protracted plot line? ? I'll let you decide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classy yet ultra violent gangster biopic, which has become something of a cult classic of late, is fortunate enough to make yet another appearance with the release of Scott Cooper's Black Mass. As an aficionado of the sub-genre, I eagerly anticipated a familiar assemblage of voice-overs, a dynamic non-linear narrative and a reproachable yet oddly admirable focaliser who, come the denouement, is stripped of his political clout and sent to prison to answer for his crimes. Suffice to say I was not disappointed by what I saw. Despite getting a little lost among its midriff, as does so often happen when filming an episodic multi-decade flick, Black Mass holds up as both a confident and dynamic feature with an interesting political backdrop in Bulger's IRA relations. Following his 2013 thriller; Out of the Furnace, Cooper brings us yet another all-star cast in which Johnny Depp's sterling performance steals the show. Depp's stylish yet chilling rendition of James Bulger marks his return to the big screen after what has arguably been a series of clunkers, the likes of which include Mortdecai and Transcendence. Moreover, Depp's take on Boston's unlawful kingpin 'Whitey' Bulger heralds his reappearance in the biopic style and in a role of some familiarity; playing the charismatic John Dillinger in Public Enemy and Joseph D. Pistone or 'Donnie' (his alias) in Donnie Brasco.For my part, Black Mass seems to be a picture inspired by the Neo-Noirs of the early 1980's. Whether or not I would classify Black Mass as a Neo-Noir, or even a Neo Neo-Noir I am ambivalent, however Scott Cooper's own taste for the stylish Hollywood crime dramas of the time, such as John Huston's Neo-Noir Fat City, have certainly rubbed off on his own film making ideology. The conflicted antihero (Cooper), the striking use of light and shadow, and the low-key lighting are all elements playing homage to the style. Yet Cooper's steady cinematography make it difficult to deem the film a definite Neo-Noir, as some of the distinctive visual elements attributed to the style rely upon unusual camera placement and movement. Rather it makes the film seem a bit more like a documentary; much to the distaste of some viewers. It can be said that Cooper presents us a sense of verisimilitude worthy of a 'biopic', yet wrapped in a Neo-Noir like shell, reflective of his own work as a director and an appreciator of film. Although arguably it is too early in his filmmaking career to tell, Scott Cooper seems to be becoming an auteur, whose work and influences reflect real life themes and events. Both Black Mass and Crazy heart, his 2009 musical drama in which he produced, wrote and directed, are testament to this dogma.The sense of gravitas ascribed to Black Mass in presenting a more biographic interpretation of South Boston's unholy alliance, is oddly unique and charming. Black Mass exposes us to the cracks that could so easily infiltrate Federal Law Enforcement agencies in the United States during the late 1900's. Personally, I have not seen a film with a better take on the dark side of American community values since Sidney Lumet's Serpico, in which all but one cop in the New York Police Department succumb to the temptations of the job and are twisted by the system's corruption. I remark the charm of Cooper's work because it has become something of a platitude recently to retrofit the 'gangster biopic' with excessive hyperrealism and the natural propensities of its directors. Whilst this can be a good thing, providing an entertaining experience for the viewer, it can sometimes take the 'bio' out of the 'biopic'. Cooper's Black Mass stays true to the sub-genre's codes and in some ways is an example of a perfect 'biopic', with a neat and intriguing blend of classic gangster movie drama and an intimate Bulger biographical experience.Nevertheless, Cooper's depiction of South Boston's crime syndicate is not completely beyond reproach, and for some moviegoers you can be sure that the slow-moving theatrical cut (which is roughly 45 minutes shorter than Cooper's director's cut) will be subject to audience appraisal, critiqued for being a little too realistic a portrait of Bulger's criminal empire. Several other reviews have been quick to denounce Cooper's Black Mass as not only protracted, but largely an imitation of Martin Scorsese's own oeuvre, and I wouldn't totally disagree with this assertion. Typical genre archetypes and a predictable plot line all make the film seem rather unoriginal, and Black Mass's John Connolly, who seems to be merely a more callow pastiche of The Departed's Colin Sullivan, is testament to Cooper's imitation.Overall, Scott Cooper's Black Mass offers us a stylishly dark package under the umbrella of an intriguing picaresque gangster biopic, in which the collaborative effort between leading cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's and musical producer Tom Holkenborg stand out profusely. Masanobu Takayanagi's moody photography and Tom Holkenborg's tense musical choreography act in congruity, injecting even more insipid and sullen imagery into the disturbing milieu that is South Boston. But even if that doesn't quite do it for you, how can you turn down Cooper's all-star cast! The likes of which I have not seen for quite some time; Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Adam Scott, Joel Edgerton, Dakota Johnson, Peter Sarsgaard? it seems an endless list to which the movie belonged to Johnny Depp. It is a role that he has had some experience dealing with in the past and it is within this confident framework that Depp does his deepest work in a very long time. Yet whilst Cooper's rendition of James 'Whitey' Bulger and John Connolly's fall from power will certainly win the vote of those looking for a complete 'biographical crime thriller', alas it's run time of 122 minutes, comprising of what some may call sporadic scene jumping, an episodic narrative structure and an amalgam of crime genre pastiches, is certain to question some viewers loyalties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While his brother Bill remains a powerful leader in the Massachusetts Senate, hoodlum James "Whitey" Bulger continues to pursue a life of crime in Boston. Approached by FBI agent John Connolly, the lawman convinces Whitey to help the agency fight the Italian mob. As their unholy alliance spirals out of control, Bulger increases his power and evades capture to become one of the most dangerous gangsters in U.S. history.....Oh hurrah, it's Oscar baiting season again, and here's this years a-list star wanting to be taken seriously in a role that is a million miles away from what we all know and love. It the fact is that Depp doesn't need to be taken seriously. Yes, the past few years have been a little unkind to the actor, but before Jack Sparrow sailed into shore, Depp had a wonderful range of beautiful roles that defined him as a true Hollywood star. And since his big transition to mega-star, his kookiness has since become lost in translation.And here, while the true story of Bulger is terrifying and an important part of Bostonian history, the film is a predictable affair, trying too much to be like goodfellas and ending up just a profane almost chore like effort to get through, but, the performances are good, despite some questionable casting.Depp is good as Bulger, but the make up is terrible, he looks like a cross between Klaus Kinskis' Nosferatu, and the bad guy from Thor: The Dark World, and it really takes you away from the narrative, and the psychotic tendencies that Bulger obviously has.It's a shame that the second two acts really get bogged down in so many sub plots, as the first act is truly remarkable, especially when tragedy hits Bulger.So all in all, it's not a bad film by any means, it's just that we've seen this true life crime story time and time again, and they can be wonderful at times, but this has an element of déj? Vu to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad.. But not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a lot of hype in the first weeks of its release. After reading some reviews here saying that it was great and that Johnny Depp would win an Oscar/getting an Oscar nomination at least, I decided to watch the movie and realized 2 things: The movie is not great, and Depp will not have a nomination. Yes it is true that his acting was good. In fact, it was the best of Johnny Depp's acting for a long time. But I don't see any reason why the Academy should nominate him for best leading actor, considering that the movie didn't force him to be great. The script was not hard at all. It was well written though, and the cinematography was OK. The rest of the cast was good as well, since they were almost all great actors. I would say this movie is fun to watch, but in my opinion it should have more violence and explicit torture, since this was a movie about a Gang. Overall I will rate this a 7/10 Doesn't deserve more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musing the fact that the 45-year-old director Scott Brooks has only 3 motion pictures to his name, BLACK MASS being the 3rd one, I am lost for words in the effort (please note: I state "the effort") that is involved in the biography of Whitey Bulger. Scott Brooks displayed an extensive creative capacity when he teamed up with Christian Bale in 2013 for OUT OF THE FURNACE. Endeavoring to reach further he perhaps may have crafted his best work up to date in BLACK MASS. This biography that unfolds a smidge of opaque American history is a near masterpiece of story telling if the soundtrack to the picture took a more powerful tone. When tales of turf wars are told and when the word mafia comes into play in any context, and if your experience to cinema stretches further than DC &amp; Marvel, then you are now toying with the name Corleone (Which isn't so ? characters fail to grow around Depp as the screenplay stubbornly clings onto him). Set in violent times BLACK MASS is a gruesome memento of the vehemence and goriness of turf squabbles starting in the early 70s. Johnny Depp is no Marlon Brando. However this is arguably one of the finest bit of acting Johnny Depp has done since his Caribbean ventures. Depp who is unequivocally one of the most adaptable actors of today fits the role of Whitey Bulger like a glove. I can only think of Leonardo Dicaprio, Tim Roth, Ray Liotta &amp; Oscar Isaac who could have even attempted this role apart from Depp. The Irish American convicted criminal and murderer (not at the time the movie is based) is brother to Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) a senator and friend to John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). Connolly who is an FBI agent brings in Whitey as a top echelon informant to the FBI. Whitey on the other hand goes along with this only in the interest of business. Trading secrets to gain turf over the Italian Mafia of Boston and being the top dog is his only interest. Somewhere in this saturnine screenplay BLACK MASS loses momentum. Characters fall off weakening the plot and the movie as a whole. Kevin Bacons presence is authoritative and concentrated but is felt ill used just as Benedict Cumberbatch keeps popping in and out of the picture (What a waste of characters). Cinematography is poor and has room beyond it ever-even attempts. Shots of Boston, grim insights to what goes on after sunset are key elements that are overlooked. The audiences demand this. We know Whitey does, we wish we see more. Credit is to be given to Depp for he is the glue that keeps BLACK MASS intact.Went in hoping this is a contender for the big show in February 2016. It wont be! Johnny Depp may get a nod for his acting but isn't cut out for the win. Illustrious cast, phenomenal display by Johnny Depp but still I lost interest.TITLE: BLACK MASS DIRECTED BY: SCOTT BROOKS STARRING: JOHNNY DEPP, BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH, JOEL EDGERTON, PETER SARSGAARD AND KEVIN BACON RATED: R RATING: 07/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's easy to connect the dots between the Bosox, Patriots, and the . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . Cradle of Corruption, a.k.a., Boston, MA, after viewing BLACK MASS. Known as Satan's Playground since its suburban Salem witch &amp; warlock days of the 1600s, BLACK MASS documents how James "Whitey" Bulger is one of the Devil's top Earthly minions, exporting his Evil Deeds to places as far-flung as Tulsa, Miami, and Ireland. In the 1900s, America's original "Title Town" sports capital was Detroit, MI. But now, as the Tigers and Lions languish, Bostonians Lord it over the rest of us with three World Series wins and umpteen Deflategators' triumphs in this End Times Century. Anyone who watched those eight-hour games between the Bosox and the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series could see plainly that "the fix was in." The bribed umpires gave the Bosox an average of four outs per inning, while finding some flimsy excuse to nullify most of the Yankee hits and runs. It STILL took an eternity for the lesser team, famously cursed by the Bambino, to "win." This is foretold 89 minutes, 20 seconds into BLACK MASS when Bulger's pet FBI-agent-turned-convicted-murderer John Connolly tries to bribe the incorruptible non-Bostonian federal prosecutor with Bosox tickets to a game in which the infamous Curt Schilling is pitching. "Boston Strong" sounds like one of Voldemort's mottoes from Harry Potter, when viewed in the context of BLACK MASS. Thanks to this movie, we have proof positive that Bulger is STILL corrupting America's sports scene from his prison cell with his Parseltongue messages to henchmen such as MLB umps, Schilling, NFL refs, and Tom Brady.</fullReview>

He was mighty impressive, totally inhabiting that character and proving that yes, he still has it and he needs to stop making bad films. The film around him, even if with an impressive cast, was just sort of there. I'm not huge on the gangster flick but most at least make me feel something.

		<shortDescription>A film that doesn't know what it wants to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would you write a love story without love? An action movie without action?Then why do a film about a gangster without crime? Yet this is what Black Mass is. You might see a few murders being committed, but you never see what makes Whitey Bulger a gangster. You never understand what caused him to become one, or how he subsists. A few passing references to vending machines, some nonsense about the street value of loyalty (repeated about 20 times in case you didn't get it the first time) but nothing about the organised crime gang he leads, how its income is generated, the system behind it, its hierarchy. The classics of this genre all adhered to this principle: show the crime, show the system. Casino, Goodfellas, The Departed, Scarface. What's good enough for them ought to be good enough for Black Mass, which strangely departs from the principle and offers nothing in exchange.What's left is a disappointing mixture of characters and plots that fail to deliver any dramatic tension. In this context, the mis- casting of Cumberbatch and Bacon is even more blatant ? but none is worse than that of Depp. He is not terrifying at all and his make-up is a constant distraction. The mascara is even flagrantly visible in some scenes. Even when he was committing awful acts of violence, he was not believable. A very sad failure for what could have been a new classic gangster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's not what you do, it's when and where you do it, and who you do it to or with. If nobody sees it, it didn't happen." Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) Black Mass is as amoral as that quote and grim?a true-story as brutal as the murders committed on the screen. By "brutal" I also mean the cinematography (as was the case with director Scott Cooper's "Out of the Furnace"), which depicts a somber, dark South Boston, where danger comes from every opening a street might have.The story of notorious gangster Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) carries much of the darkness, if not all. Whitey's role as kingpin mobster and informant for the FBI requires deftness only actors like Depp can carry off. Yes, as the gangster formula usually has it, he evidences warmth and compassion at moments, but his operative emotion is anger.Similar to the gangster actors like Pacino and De Niro, Depp brings a quiet menace to the screen, whereby even the audience must respect the boss, Bulger. Depp is far better than he has been in years (no tics, no phony accents, etc.), underplaying a role Pacino might have chewn up along with the scenery. His humanistic interactions like caring for his son or an old lady are few but reveal a nuanced character not just a murderer.The film gives full characterization to FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) but skimps on others such as Whitey's state senator brother, Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). Seeing more of the two brothers would have been rich both for the acting and for depicting the unusual power held by two very different brothers. I was working in Southie in the mid-seventies, and the Bulger name was becoming legend. The different power held by each brother was arresting. This film tries to depict that anomaly with limited success.Among the film's few other weaknesses is the heavy-handed Junkie XL soundtrack, emphasizing each important moment with obvious meaning. Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott as agents are underused, though Scott's role is almost laughably a victim of editing. However, my comment underscores how rich the film is in acting and the right actors to play the parts."Take your shot but make it your best. Cause I get up, I eat ya." Whitey Bulger</fullReview>

It could be better as it tries to reach for the mob classic. It falls slightly short of that because Bulger's true story does not reach as far as the fiction.Still this one has a good cast, and a young director who is building an impressive resume. Depp brings something to Bulger which is a more controlled felon. Is this violent world enjoyable? In a more Blue Collar Type of way.

		<fullReview>This is mayhaps the first film I have seen THIS YEAR with a cast that brought the project from a poor-old cliché-thing to ann instant success!Johnny Depp, of course, IS over-rated, but plays well for himself in this film; taking the roll of Jimmy "Whitey" Bulger, a crazed, killing mobster back in the middle 1970s. The story follows mainly from his point of view; // making arrangements with his brother, Billy Bulger (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), who is a trusted governmental worker.It is until an old, childhood friend of theirs, John Connolly (Joel Edgarton), who works for the law, tries to reconnect with Jimmy who is a very cautious recluse; only hangs around with a small amount of friends; people he can trust. He makes a deal with the mobster where he will give away certain high-rollers so that the federal bureau and Bulger's crew can work together and keep each other from getting exposed.This movie reminded me very much in the style of Martin Scorsese sort of. I mean rooting for the bad guy (Depp) who you love to hate, seems already covered enough in the cinema-world. But none-the-less I really enjoyed this flick. Even though, it was more about the Irish-Americans rather than my Italian-Americans, it was still action- filled and had badass dialogue throughout the who film.If you guys read my reviews, you would know that I am one who is not about "action" in movies, but Black Mass did everything so subtly, and unexacting. I have a real positive experience.</fullReview>

He takes a fair share of stylistic cues from Martin Scorsese, including multiple storytelling points of view that make the film feel like a second cousin to Goodfellas or Casino. Cooper continues to prove himself a remarkable actor's director, with Edgerton's performance standing out in particular. His John Connolly is a man who can't come to grips with who he is or even wants to be, putting on airs of false confidence and bravado to convince his wife, bosses, and colleagues of his sincerity and innocence ? constantly spinning plates until the Bulger investigation brings everything crashing down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a decent film, but there could have been so much more to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the brilliant performance given by Johnny Depp, I actually expected many more aspects of this film to be just as excellent. Scott Cooper and his team of screenwriters knew they could have done anything they wanted with the material at hand, but their efforts can only be described as 'decent' at best. Half the time, I felt like I was watching separate segments of a miniseries edited together than a movie with a naturally flowing narrative. Each time a sequence - which is equal to an important event within Whitey Bulger's life - fades to black, the film jumps across a considerable amount of time (usually years) before focusing on the next important event in his life. This same structure can be also found in the film 'Goodfellas', but the only difference is, that film is better paced, and as a result, has a story that feels more coherent and whole.I also felt that most of the ensemble cast was wasted. Many of the supporting actors are fantastic in their roles, but their screen- time is limited to such a degree that they barely leave any sort of impression on you. It may be easy to say that Depp's performance overshadowed everyone else's, but that doesn't explain why the film cycles through most of its characters without going into much (or any) detail of their lives.Yet for some reason, the film still feels like it tries to squeeze too much into its runtime. There were times I had trouble trying to follow the plot all because I couldn't keep track of the sheer number of cardboard characters that were seemingly appearing from out of nowhere. That said, 'Black Mass' would have worked much better if had been adapted as a ten-part miniseries than a two-hour film. At least that way, the book would have received the justice it truly deserved.</fullReview>

It offers a lesson in the damage that can be unleashed upon the everyday citizens when our civil servants put personal gain ahead of the public good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping biopic complete with an outstanding performance by Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the height of Oscar Season, Johnny Depp brings what might be his most outstanding performance of his career in this biopic drama of the one of America's most notorious gangsters in history. Depp plays James "Whitey" Bulger, an Irish mob boss in South Boston in the 70s and 80s, who stops at nothing to take down a group of Italian mafias that wreak havoc in this town. His violent duty leads him into jeopardy when he becomes a prime target of the FBI, with no one to trust but his childhood friend John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton) who becomes a prime figure in the FBI. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, his younger brother who works as the state senator. This film also features of the likeness of Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgood, Jesse Plemens, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, and David Harbour. This is directed by Scott Cooper who did Crazy Hear (2009 and Out of The Furnace (2013).To be honest, this film does not rise in the level of Martin Scorsese's works such as Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), and The Departed (2006), it certainly has the feel of a classic mafia crime- drama film. The movie does its best on giving a gritty and violent portrayal of the gangster life as well as criminal underworld in Boston, similar to what Martin Scorsese showed in The Departed. James Bulger is shown be very violent and unflinchingly ruthless as he murders a large number of people, whether it is from shooting, torturing, or strangling. Nearly everything he does in this movie is unpredictable and shocking. There are many scenes with him that shocked me to the core, then other scenes that left me at the edge of my seat. Bulger is very powerful and mind-blowing character bringing a grim atmosphere to the story, and Johnny Depp is definitely brings him to life. Depp does a fantastic job at adding suspense and chills in this character, and he makes him so believable. I did, however, find the makeup done on his character to be somewhat distracting. While it does make almost unrecognizable, it certainly didn't take away from the outstanding performance he delivers. Joel Edgerton, who plays John Connolly also brings an terrific performance as Bulger's childhood friend who hides the secret of his dirty work. Another great aspect of the film is how it runs at a steady pace and always keeps the story alive, even when the pacing seems to slow down. Black Mass is certainly isn't a groundbreaking picture for the crime genre, but it is a movie that definitely deserves the attention of many. Johnny Depp's performance is fantastic and has a strong possibility of landing him an Oscar nomination. I believe this film will land several Oscar nomination including Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No coherence..poorly told story with loose connections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directors too often focus on individual scenes trying to milk their actors nowadays. This often leads to movies with seemingly no cohesion. Whether it's a style or something they think resonates with a certain crowd is hard to say. What is easy to remark is that this is a movie that has many pieces without a string. You're left with a yearning for a 'mov'ie but presented with something akin to stills. Sure it has one or two moments, but with such an excellent ensemble, you expect good things from the movie and it just fails. It could have been a great crime drama..look at departed or Donnie Brasco. It never really gets going and is quite boring</fullReview>

Yes we have a few years ago when Martin Scorsese made THE DEPARTED a film heavily influenced by the real life activities of Whitey Bulger and his posse of violent thugs The Winter Hill Gang . BLACK MASS tells the true story of Bulger and his gang but quite often fiction is better than truth , either that or this story hasn't been told well in a cinematic way . Director Scott Cooper isn't Martin Scorsese and the way the on screen story is drawn up is rather uninvolving Johnny Depp has won some critical acclaim as Bulger but let's be honest here and say that Johnny Depp has built up a reputation playing quirky characters in films that aren't usually pitched to mainstream audiences . Here he's cast against type in a relatively commercial studio picture . As it stands Depp might pick up an Oscar nomination but the prize will probably go to that other talented pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio for THE REVENANT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an American anti-hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The season for screening films with ambitions for Academy Awards must have started. Black Mass is directed by Scott Cooper - a relative newcomer (this is only his third film) but a rising star among directors at Hollywood if we are to judge the impressing cast he succeeds to enroll - better and better and certainly more expensive from movie to movie. It seems to meet at least a few conditions to enter the competition for Academy nominations. It stars Johnny Depp in a role we barely recognize him which may well get him into the Final 5. It tells a story that captured at some point in time the interest and imagination of big audiences, and it deals with a Big American character. The fact that this character is a despicable gangster, who was in control of one of the lead Mafia gangs ('the Irish one') in Boston in the 80s and early 90s and was responsible for numerous murders and organized crime felonies may eventually matter when the jury will debate. Or maybe not. Until then, let us take our places in the theaters or download from the Internet and watch the movies.James 'Whitey' Bulger now serving a couple of life sentences is the kind of anti-hero America is fascinated with. The story starts in 1975, when Bulger is enrolled as an informant by the FBI - a status which together with the family ties (his brother played by Benedict Cumberbatch was a state senator) ensured him two decades of immunity and the almost total dominance on the crime industries in the Boston area after eliminating (with the help of the police and justice system) the Italian rival gangs. The story on screen mentions nothing about the still not elucidated episode of the murder of the "Lady of the Dunes" that took place a year before, but does include the death of Bulger's only child that actually took place in 1973. From this episode we may or maybe are supposed to understand the motivations of his violence and lack of respect for law or human life? Quite thin for an explanation in my opinion. Despite Depp's fantastic acting the man behind the crimes remains an enigma.The rest is a 'true crime' story (the film is inspired by a true crime book) with the relations between the boss and his acolytes, the treason and executions of the traitors, the have-heard-it-already rants about the Mafia honor code, with corrupt cops and victimized girlfriends, and with a twist towards Bulger's support for Irish nationalism and terror movements, which was part of the reasons that led to his eventual fall. It started quite confusing to my taste, it improved as the story grew and the relation between characters became more clear (and the number of characters decreased :-) ) but it did not reach any of the peaks of the genre like in Scorsese's films or in Mystic River. Depp's performance is hypnotic, I will try a metaphor and say that he brings death to his hero on screen. Cumberbatch on the other hand will not get another Academy nomination for his role here. I know nothing at this point about the other candidates, but in an average to weak year I would bet for a couple of awards.</fullReview>

With a star studded ensemble to large to single out (all with terrific performances), this true story about South Boston's infamous criminal turned FBI informant Whitey Bulger hits all the right Irish mobster moments. Screen writers Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth set the characters in motion in an "All the Presidents Men" behind the scenes fashion. You may think you don't know this story.

		<shortDescription>Black Mass Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While his younger brother Bill (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a powerful part of the Massachusetts Senate, small time Irish gangster James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) continues to live a life of crime during 1970s Boston. Approached by an old childhood acquaintance and FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), he convinces James to align himself with him to help the FBI apprehend the Italian mob of North Boston. As their unorthodox partnership gets out of control, Bulger increases his and his gang's power while also evading capture thus becoming one of the most dangerous gangsters in U.S. history.When one thinks of great gangster films, you think of The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Departed, etc. While it would be difficult to reach the caliber of those films, this one comes close. I thought the film did a great job at setting up what it would be like in 1970s Boston. From the gloomy and dirty locales, the clothing, etc, the film was very authentic and viewers should get the style quickly. The story was not as deep as I would have liked it to be since all of the gangster-related subject matter was mostly just mentioned and never showed but it did have some great moments that kept me engaged. If I had to use one word to describe it, it would be intense. This is because of the great acting on display in this film, Boston accents and all. But the best of those are Johnny Depp as Bulger and Joel Edgerton as Connolly. Depp is unrecognizable here as Bulger. From the aged look, the receding hairline and those piercing blue eyes, his transformation is a great example of excellent makeup work and manages to never look out of place. He really just disappears within all of the prosthetics. Depp has not had a good run of films recently but he has definitely made a comeback here by giving his best performance since playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the original Pirates of the Caribbean film in which he was nominated for an Oscar. I would be shocked if he wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar for this next year. He transforms himself into the psychopath Bulger was, able to go from charming and charismatic to scary evil and just plain dangerous on a dime. Edgerton was also great as the ambitious agent Connolly. After those two, it does drop considerably, however, as they are the only characters that seem to have some depth. I also found it a little odd that there are no real female roles in this film as the only ones we get to see are relegated to the background. I'm not trying to be a chauvinist but that was what the world was like back then so I didn't mind that too much. Criticisms aside, this is Johnny Depp's film because he is the only one you're paying any attention to since his performance is so great. No this is not like any of the films I mentioned at the beginning but Depp's performance alone is why I would recommend this film.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'BLACK MASS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Crime biopic based on the life of notorious Irish-American mobster Whitey Bulger; detailing his relations with corrupt FBI members, including an old childhood friend. The film is being called a comeback, for lead actor Johnny Depp (after five box office and critical failures in a row); and he's also now considered the frontrunner, in next year's Academy Awards Best Actor race. The film costars Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, Dakota Johnson, David Harbour, Kevin Bacon, Adam Scott, Corey Stoll, Peter Sarsgaard, W. Earl Brown, Julianne Nicholson and Juno Temple. It was directed by Scott Cooper (who also helmed 'CRAZY HEART' and 'OUT OF THE FURNACE') and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth; the screenplay is based on the 2001 novel, by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. I found the film to be a little uneven, and slow-paced, but for the most part enthralling. The story begins in 1975; when James 'Whitey' Bulger (Depp) was already a well known gangster, and infamous crime boss, in South Boston. He worked closely with his cohorts: Stephen Flemmi (Cochrane), Kevin Weeks (Plemons) and Johnny Martorano (Brown); to organize most of the crime there. Whitey's leadership was challenged though, by another Italian-American crime group (from the North End), called The Angiulo Brothers. So when his old childhood friend, turned FBI agent, John Connolly (Edgerton), returned to town; Whitey reluctantly agreed to an informant partnership, in order to takeout his enemies. The film follows all of the bloody and horrendous events that followed. The film is very slow paced; but it's also informative, intense and involving. I knew little about the real Whitey Bulger, before seeing the movie, so the story always kept me (at least somewhat) entertained. I'm not a big fan of biopics but it's hard not to find such larger-than-life characters fascinating. Depp's performance is the highlight of the movie (and it's great to see him back in top form) but the supporting cast is all impressive as well (the makeup, on Depp, is superb too). I also really like Cooper, as a director, and have immensely enjoyed all of his (three) films, so far. The movie is definitely worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/a2oJP7OqaOg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Black Mass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Godfatheresque. Goodfellas: The Joe Pesci Story. A Mystic River makeover. These are the words I would use to describe Black Mass (the flick I'm about to review). Is it my pick for best of the year? So far. Will it sustain Academy Awards momentum right into 2016? That remains to be seen. Either way, it's a knockout, a small-time mob yarn with plenty of attitude. To quote the Standells, "love that dirty water, oh Boston you're my home".The direction in Black Mass is pragmatic and crisp. And although I've never seen Scott Cooper's earlier work, I liked his 2013 release being the Christian Bale vehicle, Out of the Furnace. In "Furnace", Cooper made it all about the performances while letting the conveying sensibilities fall into narrow territory. With "Mass", he now gets everything just right. There's a flowing timeline from the year 1975 all the way up to 2011. It's safe to say that real-life gangster James "Whitey" Bulger, gets his rightful, Hollywood due (don't worry folks, this dude is still a despicable human being).As for the lead, well Mr. Johnny Depp sports hair-raising contact lenses and a grayed-up, receding hairline. He plays the Bulger character the same way Daniel Day Lewis took over the proceedings in There Will Be Blood. Both troupers are in almost every frame, both of them hold the screen as if it's a thimble, and both are larger than life. Truth be told, Depp's been a bad guy in other films but for some reason, this is his most vicious turn I can think of. He's certainly not likable, you don't root for him (you don't really root for anybody in this thing), and when he strangles a teenage prostitute after posing as her confidant, it just breaks your heart. Honestly, Johnny boy goes so far down the rabbit hole with Bulger's intellect that you forgot it's actually him. Good old Edward Scissorhands is too nice of an actor to kill someone and then tell everybody he's about to take a nap. Right?Anyway, "Mass" with its Bostonian setting, its multiple scenes of people dying in broad daylight, and its freewheeling, seventies soundtrack, runs mostly in flashback (this does in fact, work to its advantage). Nobody and I mean nobody, does gloom and doom or dirty and grubby like Scott Cooper. The present day sequences which are inserted throughout, involve FBI interrogations with various members of "Whitey's" delinquent crew (they are known as the Winter Hill Gang). Unabashedly, the movie begins in the mid 70's as it chronicles Bulger's rise via the criminal food chain in Southie. He's the upper echelon of savagery, he's a murderer, he's a drug dealer, and he becomes an eventual informant for the Feds. Why you ask? So he can take down a fellow mafia chain trying to cut in on his regional turf.Now a lot of critics and audience members (around the world) have touted this cinematic conch as quote unquote, "Johnny Depp's movie" or "Johnny Depp's show". I have to digress. It's much more than that. Many great actors here fade in and out. That in no way diminishes the effect of "Black's" stagnant (and straight ahead) entertainment value. Benedict Cumberbatch plays effectively, Bulger's senator brother (William Bulger). Dakota Johnson is solid in a couple of scenes as his girlfriend and mother of his dying child. Then you have Kevin Bacon in rage mode playing a torn FBI boss (Mr. Charles McGuire). Finally, you get a quiet, off-kilter hit-man in Rory Cochrane. As Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi ("Whitey's" right-hand man), he doesn't say much yet his screen presence gives off apprehension in the worst way.So for what's it's worth, "Mass" has the cojones to kick in the door and possibly kick you in the teeth. It's a gangster pic scaled down to the bare minimum (for my money, that's a good thing). Bottom line: A great cast, a few Scorsese-like exterior shots, a top five performance from Depp, clean editing, and some tasty Massachusetts locales give you the final rub. Yeah it's violent, yeah it's unforgiving, and yeah it's altogether antagonistic. But Black Mass checks in as a winner pretty much the whole way. My rating: 3 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass is by no means an original gangster film, but I still enjoyed this workingman's Godfather</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never lived in a metropolis-like environment, so I can't say I've had the experience of living in tight corners and nearby Chinese food places. The idea of living in high rises certainly doesn't frighten me or even annoy me, but it's certainly nice to look at a forest rather then brick and steel. The only time in my life that comes close in my one year of schooling in Tucson, but it's more of an extra large town then a metropolis (that's what Phoenix is for). Cityscapes come along with the stereotypes. The bums, the workaholics, the rich yuppies, the underprivileged artists, and of course, the mafia. One continues plot in many city police stories is going after the mafia. It's rarely set against the Italian mafia or Irish mafia, but just THE mafia. The best movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas and The Departed have drawn exception to these standard in order to project realism. What's frightening is that the more real these gangster movies become, the more your optimism for the city deflates to be replaced by the image of organized crime running the show, What's worse are the stories that show the armed forces involved. Black Mass tells the real story of the Irish mafia in Boston. The movie is told from the various flashbacks of criminals that have worked for main character, James "Whitey" Bulger.Starting in 1975, Whitey (played by Johnny Depp) is a small town crook in South Boston who has a small crew and works his numbers, but still isn't a kingpin yet. On the other side of the law is John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), an FBI agent who was friends with Whitey as a kid growing up in Boston. Connolly gets the idea of having Whitey coming on board as an informant for the FBI in order to eradicate the Italian mafia. Whitey's brother William Bulger (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) isn't enthusiastic about the idea and neither is Whitey. The later gets on board to protect his family, though dismisses the idea that he's "ratting". Though given rules against killing and committing crimes, Whitey does so any way, but provide enough information just so that he still technically helping the FBI. As Whitey become further detached from his humanity and Connolly brushes off all the violence as "getting closer to the enemy", the FBI starts to debate what's ethical to catch brooks with more crooks.The story of James "Whitey" Bulger is an interesting one; so interesting that many movies, including The Departed were inspired by this criminal. Does that mean that there's room for the real life story? Yes, there is. Black Mass is an enjoyable crime thriller that's more about the crimes then so of the character. Johnny Depp still gives it all to play a scary man that would have had me running out of the building. Even though were given a more over-the- top design then an over-the-top personality, he's still fascinating enough of a character to see him as he rises in the crime world. Now unlike something like Scarface where our criminal is wealthy, Black Mass is more of the workingman's godfather. It's not a bad thing, but since we've received movies like this before, Black Mass feels like it could get lost in an ocean of more iconic criminal stories. I can't feel like that this kind of story has been given to audiences hundreds of times before It's not bad, but it's a movie that came a little late or at least put a different spin to make it stand out more. I'm not sure if the answer were to have gone darker, but it might have helped.I'll give this seven welcome to Boston signs out of ten. Black Mass isn't good because it's a fantastic gangster story; it works because it's adequate. I think I respect the history more then I do for the final product. If you like gangster or crime thrillers, then you'll probably like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I blame Whitey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the friends I saw this with has read two books about Whitey Bulger, and said after seeing it that it was very close to the facts with one exception: in real life, the sequence in which two men are shot to death in a moving vehicle involved one of the men getting away and having to be murdered at a later date. This confirms my overall impression that this film does a pretty good job at representing the reality of Whitey's life of crime within the framework of a Hollywood movie. In fact everything about it is well done, and as my friend observed, the people who designed and applied the prosthetic makeup on Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch should get all the awards, because it's literally seamless. (I suspect a touch of CGI went into it too.) The story itself is one that deserves to be told, about the FBI's disastrous decision to use the psychopathic Whitey as a tool to take down a rival gangster, which entailed letting him get away with whatever crimes he felt like committing under their protection. The problem is that real psychopaths, unlike Hollywood psychopaths like Hannibal Lecter and Frank Underwood, aren't interesting people. They don't have normal emotions or motivations so it's impossible for a normal person to relate to them. So the story revolves around the complex of people around Whitey who enabled his crime spree, particularly the main FBI agent who personally profited from setting up Whitey as an informant, i.e. another psychopath. I suspect in real life most if not all of the main players in this story were psychopaths to some degree, and I think this is at the heart of why this perfectly well-made film is lacking a certain something. It would take a lightning bolt of inspiration to strike any screenwriter to give them what it would take to make this story about the stupid and mean adventures of a gang of douches thrilling or poignant or mesmerizing. And really, inspiration would be better spent on a more inspiring story than this vile and contemptible shambles of aimless greed and cruelty.Johnny Depp does a fine job of conveying the alien psychological state of a psychopathic criminal. Whitey refused Johnny's request to meet with him while he was preparing to play him on screen, so the blame rests on Whitey that Johnny has had to invent his own Whitey rather than model him on the real man. The revelation at the end of the film that Whitey was ultimately brought to justice and rots in prison to this day is the most satisfying thing about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp, as Whitey Bulger, is scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scott Cooper, the director who gave us "Crazy Heart," and "Out Of The Furnace" came back with this ambitious film, and I say that because Jimmy "Whitey" Bulger" is among the most famous of all gangsters in the entire history of crime families in this country. His name is up there on the same level as Al Capone and the rest of those scums. So it's good that this movie doesn't glorify Whitey Bulger in any way.As I've said a thousand times before, I'm a sucker for mob stories and police corruption stories because a). they're a perfect example of a villain, acting nice in front of people but doing other wise behind closed doors and b). the unholy alliance between the two like the one depicted in this film is kind that unfortunately will always continue to happen in many other places. It will always exist, no matter how many crime 'heads' you try to cut off.BLACK MASS takes instruction from Martin Scorsese's manual book, as does any other gangster movie that has been made since "Goodfellas." It starts out with a young kid who gets to join the Winter Hill gang, but the focus remains on Whitey Bulger, brilliantly played by Johnny Depp, an actor who I think hasn't been in touch with his dark side since 2007's "Sweeney Todd," (let's forget that whole mess "Transcendence" ever happened) so it's nice to have Depp back as the baddie. And boy, as Bulger, Depp immerses himself and strikes fear into the hearts of the people around him. He's like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito in "Goodfellas" but times a hundred, BLACK MASS even has Depp's Bulger intimidate a person sitting across from him; that person thinks Bulger is angry at him, reminiscent of Tommy's "What's so funny?" scene. This is Depp's best performance in years.Those of us fans of gangster movies know how the game is played and so does BLACK MASS, you just know when somebody would get whacked, you just know when somebody says the wrong thing to a boss, you just know when the noose is tightening and their empire starts to crumble. In this case, Joel Edgerton plays FBI agent John Connolly who helps Bulger, hoping that Bulger would help him in return but instead Bulger uses him. The way Edgerton plays his character is that he's not your traditional 'dirty' lawman, he's not planted there by winter hill gang. He's a cocky, incompetent lawman, he in way over his head, the kind of guy who'd rather make excuses than face up to his own blunder and it eventually bites him in the butt.My thing is that if the government has to settle for torture session or if law enforcement has to settle for cooperating with the mob, if those are their last resort, claiming that there's no other choice, then they're actually just lazy and unwilling to put the time and effort in good old detective police work. BLACK MASS gives you a brutal inside look at one of this country's most notorious monsters.</fullReview>

Which, of course, was how Bulger got by while on the run for all those years. Given, I don't think Bulger was willing to contribute to the movie. But I would have loved to have seen the story of how he got by while evading law enforcement. Frankly, that probably would have been more fascinating than the story that led up to him leaving.

		<fullReview>Why is this not a great movie? The movie plays up the wrong character. It should have played up Connolly instead of Bulger. That Connolly became corrupted is actually what this movie is about. Connolly is a detestable character. At any given moment, there are people in society committing crimes, some relatively minor and others far more serious. That's a given. Their actions have been depicted in so many movies and television shows that it is no longer novel. But an FBI agent becoming corrupted? That's a completely different, and far more dramatic, story. When that happens, the entire country is placed at risk. The FBI is supposed to be the bastion of law, the country's protector against those who pose a threat to public safety, and when that deterrent gets compromised, as happens in this movie ? well, the social and political implications should be the story. The movie touches on the subject but does not develop it further, instead choosing to showcase Bulger's violence, which is depicted repeatedly and graphically throughout the movie. That the FBI provides cover for an entire criminal syndicate is alluded to but remains undeveloped. Nevertheless, this movie is good. The story is intense. The acting is powerful, and the movie grabs the audience's attention. Johnny Depp does an excellent job portraying a psychopathic killer. The performances of the rest of the cast is equally excellent, especially that of Joel Edgerton as the corrupted FBI agent.</fullReview>

It stars Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Rory Cochrane, and Benedict Cumberbatch along with Dakota Johnson, and Kevin Bacon.Black Mass the true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.What would happen if you mixed Good Fellas, Wolf of Wall Street, Casino and the Departed minus Scorsese plus a non-linear format?- Black Mass.Black Mass has quite a few strengths under its belt to justify quite a few of the flaws it garners. For one the direction is rock solid. With some inventive shots that I've never seen used in a Gangster flick. For example in the first 30 minutes the camera is placed on the trunk hood of a car, in just the right angle to hide the faces but show the actions of Bulger's gang. Too add on to the direction was a good script that got a ton of support. But, by far the greatest asset of the movie is its performances. This has got to be the greatest screen ensemble cast of year by a long shot. Everyone was absolutely brilliant. There wasn't a single bad performance in the entire movie. The best of these is clearly Johnny Depp. He was perfectly cast. Meeting Ian McClellan in brilliance, Depp has become one of the head runners for best actor. He was subtle at times and volatile at others. He portrayed the smarts and nefariousness of the character masterfully and deserves more than some praise for it. He was nuanced to the point in which I thought I was watching a real Gangster at work. From the quite grin that meant lights out to the mournful tears Depp deserves the Oscar nod.Joel Edgerton Was brilliant as well giving a an understated but slippery performance as the infamous F.B.I. agent, John Connolly, who helped Bulger get out of a lot of misdeeds. Along with Edgerton was a beautiful performance by Cumberbatch who through subtle implications showed the audience he was as corrupt as the rest of the bunch. Rory Cochrane gives it his all to portray a sympathetic mobster and largely succeeds. This very well may be his best performance to date. Even side characters like Kevin Bacon and Dakota Johnson give it their all to make their characters as believable as possible.With all that said I did have ONE major problem with the movie, the non-linear format. I feel that all gangster and con movies should be told in some kind of Chronological order to show the audience the full picture and keep the attention to the central plot. The format in this movie is very if-fie most of the times. Through interviews they successfully make the movie feel like a documentary which is a a good thing and a bad thing. These said Interviews either make the things that Bulger do too small to be noted or inflate them to unbelievably degrees therefore splitting the audiences interest and making the movie duller than it really is.With Stellar acting, Great Directing, and Good writing Black Mass is one twisted ride but one I recommend taking. Black Mass Gets an A- or an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances all around but slower than expected 7.4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good gangster flick and in a fair amount of places this film fulfilled that bit and let me down quite a bit as well. For the positives you have Johnny Depp in an awesome performance and as a matter a fact everyone in this film did a great job acting wise. The film is technically well made as well with good cinematography. However it needed more than just that.The movie although fairly interesting in retrospect isn't as thoroughly interesting as I was hoping. The dialogue is decent throughout and I would go as far as to say it was great in a couple of scenes but at other times it wasn't as interesting. But the major drawback was the pacing, I was hoping for something similar to a Martin Scorsese gangster flick where it's fast paced and interesting from first frame to last and I didn't get that. Instead this film has lots of slow moments and I was actually dozing a bit and I don't get bored easy at all I love slow movies just as long as something semi interesting is happening.I enjoyed the movie but as I said the pacing had me wondering when it would end. If you anticipated this movie like me I highly recommend you to get your mindset for a slow pace so you don't get too let down. I would say rent it to see if you like it. If you want to see it in a theater then as I said before I recommend you to get the mindset but even then I can't guarantee you'll enjoy this and to be really honest I don't know when or if I'm gonna watch it again even though I enjoyed it to a fair extent. If you loved it then I'm glad for you and more power to you and if your disappointed whether it be on my level or on a worse level then I'm sorry but I hope you can find some way to enjoy this film if and when you watch it. That's all I have to say thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night is Back, and Now, Johnny Depp is Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Scott CooperWriters: Jez Butterworth and Mark MalloukStarring: Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benidict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Palmons, Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, Dakota Johnson, and Corey StollRelease Date: September 18, 2015MPAA Rating: R for brutal violence, language throughout, some sexual references, and brief drug useRuntime: 2 hours and 2 minutesStudio: Warner Bros. PicturesJohnny Depp is pretty much the M. Night Shyamalan of acting. He used to play in great roles, such as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Now, he has been taking roles in terrible films, such as The Lone Ranger, Alice in Wonderland, Transcendence, and recently Mordecai. This is the new movie starring him, Black Mass. However, also like Shyamalan, with The Visit, Black Mass is definitely Johnny Depp's return to the acting chops.The plot of Black Mass is based on a true story. It follows FBI Informant and Irish Mob godfather James "Whitey" Bulger, as well as his brother, State Senator William "Billy Bulger (who is also a Boston Public figure), and FBI Agent John Connolly. They had a secret trading deal with each other, and planned to take down the Italian mob and mafia in Boston. However, the plan went wrong. To make matters worse, things started turning violent, with the rise of drug dealing, murders, and extortion. This would ultimately lead to Bulger becoming one of the FBI's top 10 most wanted criminals, in their list.First off, I'd like to say that Johnny Depp gives possibly the best performance in his career (I think it is even better than his performance as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies). Most of his roles are either comedic roles, or silly roles, with only a few serious roles. This is his most serious role yet and he completely nails it, capturing the menace and danger of the real-life criminal. The character of Bulger is a dangerous, cold, and quiet killer, and the character also gets lots of development.I also really liked the plot of the film. Sure, it can get a little complicated at times, but I was still completely engaged. There are many moments that I was caught off guard and never saw coming, giving the film an element of unpredictability, at points. However, I will admit that one of my problems with this film was some of the plotting, because the films does try to cover many aspects of this story. Honestly, if it wanted to do that, then the film should have been longer than around 2 hours, which is the runtime, because the addition of multiple plot elements kinda made the film slow, sometimes.The rest of the cast, consisting of people, such as Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon, all give strong performances, as well. To be honest, though, the only character that I found well-developed, aside from Bulger, was John Connolly, played by Joel Egerton. The rest of characters are given little to no development, which doesn't really work for the film all of the time, because some of these characters are extremely important (Benedict Cumberbatch plays a state senator, who is also Bulger's brother). The rest cast still give it their all, though.On top of all of that, this movie is pretty well directed. Director Scott Cooper brings a sense of grittiness and realism to this film. It really engages the audience into the film, and he handles the source material very well. The cinematography is also great, perfecting the look of the city, during the times, of Bulger's rampage.Overall, whilst Black Mass may be a bit too overcrowded, at points, it is still a very compelling gangster film. With, a great story, strong performances, and smooth direction, this is definitely Johnny Depp's return to his acting form.FINAL VERDICT: B+ (GREAT)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White Mass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass (2015): Dir: Scott Cooper / Cast: Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Rory Cochrane: True story account about the power of James "Whitey" Bulger who, for decades, avoided arrest because of FBI. Agent John Connolly looking for promotion decides to take advantage of his childhood friendship with Bulger and his brother William "Billy" Bulger who is now a Senator. John approaches William in hopes of having James be an informant in hopes of bringing down mafia groups. Reluctant, the FBI accepts this notion, but this only opens opportunity for James and his gang to commit further crimes while Connolly turns a blind eye. Directed by Scott Cooper whose credits include Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace. Here he captures the era of this series of crimes but the problem is that there is no strong central protagonist. Johnny Depp gives a menacing performance as "Whitey" whose morals have long decayed. Joel Edgerton as Connolly has crossed the line from FBI to crime associate and struggles to maintain innocence in view of his fearful wife and glaring co-workers. Benedict Cumberbatch as William is torn between being a Senator and his brother's criminal reputation. Dakota Johnson plays Bulger's wife who tearfully decides to pull the plug on their son who is hospitalized. This act plus the death of his mother puts Bulger over the edge. Rory Cochrane plays Bulger's right hand guy Steve Flemmi who even stoops to a situation that results in the murder of his stepdaughter. It shows the rise and eventual fall of a criminal mastermind whose ceremony came to close in 2011. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers for Black Mass made the movie look interesting. It's been awhile since Depp has been in a good movie, and has been contributing to recent flops like Dark Shadows and Mordaci. Black Mass tells the true story of notorious gangster Whity Bulger, and how he got away with his actions, and teamed up with FBI agent , John Connlly. The acting in this movie is top notch. Everyone does a fantastic job. Johnny Deep needs to stick with roles like this, and do less of that Alice In Wonderland garbage. My only complaint is that the story is not as new or shocking as it could've been. It felt like something was missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to form for Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time now Johnny Depp has been relegated to roles as quirky, off-beat, and often silly in nature characters that do not do him justice. Black Mass is his first film in a while to truly capture his excellence again.Johnny plays James "Whitey" Bulger, a notorious mob boss from recent history. Strongly supporting are Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, Rory Cochrane as Steve Flemmi, and Benedict Cumberbatch (who does an unsurprisingly convincing job during the small amount of screen time he is given) as Billy Bulger. The story itself is hardly embellished at all, and provides a very objective, accurate look at recent history. It also serves to highlight John Connolly's gradual change from a cop trying to do his job to a cold man out to save his own skin. Though the screen time is split between Depp and Edgerton, Depp really is the star of the film. He gives a convincing and chilling performance and, as usual, seems to really understand his character's mentality and personality. The rest of the actors do a great job, and it's tough to pick out anyone who didn't perform at least moderately well (although Erica Mcdermott's Boston accent is unconvincing and some of her delivery was a tad more comical than it was meant to be). It's rare nowadays to find a film where every actor is equally good at their roles, and even more rare to find a film that presents a true story so raw and unedited. This film is a dark, grim, and often times brutal tale, but it is one that is most assuredly worth seeing at least once.The soundtrack is also worth noting, as it does a sublime job of enhancing the mood with deep bass sounds and a generally excellent composure.I highly recommend this film to people who are looking for a change of pace from Hollywood blockbusters, and want a nice crime drama that doesn't sugar coat anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near Classic; Strictly Criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is strictly criminal; if Black Mass is a color specimen, then the canvas made out of it will be of grey, black and blue, so dark (read serious) is the movie. And, this seriousness is around the rise and characterization of James "Whitey" Bulger, one of the most notorious crime lords in US history and a strange alliance the FBI makes with him, which opens new chapters of loyalty, corruption, greed and betrayal with flavors of thrill.Getting into the detail, the basic story is interesting, though I thought it to be a usual gangster rise and fall drama, Black Mass opened to be something different, it was more of a crime drama around Boston than a character centered biopic. For the story itself being 'stranger than fiction' stuff, the writers, Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk didn't have to make serious changes in the original plot; still certain things needed clarity. Though the emotional side of infamous agent, Connolly is dealt well, that of Mr. Bulger didn't have that impact; maybe he wasn't worth it. At the making side, Scott Copper paints the movie in grey, a mode of violence without any bloodshed. He was able to offer that generic feel of gangs around Boston in the latter half of 20th century; the presentation was damn too serious, perfectly fitting the narrative. Frames by Masanobu Takayanagi were of superior quality, certain slow paced shots had a classic feel. Music by Tom Holkenborg was matching Copper's narrative style without any heavy stuff; those score in climax were a scream. The movie was technically sound with appropriate color gradient. Dialogues were sharp enough to offer loud ears. The makeup team requires applause for offering that devilish look to Depp.Coming to the acting side, Johnny Depp offers a high level performance as James "Whitey" Bulger; though his flexibility in pulling off different roles is known, this one will stand novel for its brutality of character and flawlessness in presentation. Those scenes where he panic John Morris and threaten Marianne just elevate the genius of an actor in him. While Depp exposes such versatility, there is Joel Edgerton who offers an equally brilliant performance as John Connolly, who too shares an equal space on script. His performance came out as a surprise package and offered an unnoticed emotional inclination for the plot. In addition to them, there is Benedict Cumberbatch as Bill Bulger, a role suiting him very well, though less on screen, he was good. Dakota Johnson, with appealing lips, seemed unused in a smaller role while Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons and David Harbour did their supportive roles well.Overall, Scoot Copper's Black Mass is an engaging crime drama that throws light on the mobster activities around Boston in the second half of 20thcentury; though the movie has a slow paced narration, the amount of reality in theme makes the movie an enterprising watch.Final Line: One of the best movies released this year; must watch for the ones who love serious movies..!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to form for Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I am biased towards crime-drama films, I have grown up on Godfather, Goodfellas and Once upon a time in America and they have had a huge influence on my liking for crime movies. So my approach towards Black Mass was already a bit biased to begin with and how did Black Mass fare? It did great, i really liked it. I always note the level of accuracy in a film and this film nails the 70s-80's era, the hairstyles, the suits, the cars and the Boston accent (though Benedict Cumberbatch's Boston accent was a bit distracting). I must say the director Scott Cooper really studied all the Scorsese master crime films before approaching Black Mass and you can see the influence in the shots and sometimes even in the script (has some shades of Scorsese's The Departed, the voice-over narration in a crime film is a style made famous by Scorsese in Goodfellas and a scene is almost ripped straight off from Goodfellas). The film feels very authentic and it did an excellent job of making the audience understand it's backstory and aspects which a non Boston person (like me) could understand and appreciate like the turf war between Irish and the Italian Mafia and their natural hate and dislike for each other. The lead actors are terrific, Johnny Depp showed some of his old acting chops which I thought he may have lost since he became a pirate; but he is in full form here, truly menacing and if you are in a room with his James "Whitey" Bulger, you will be too scared to make an eye contact with him and will try to slip out of the room asap, very intimidating. Joel Edgerton plays the second lead, he is the liaison between Bulger and the FBI so that Bulger gets protection and he gets to nail the Italian mafia, a common enemy of both the FBI and Bulger's Irish Winter Hill Gang. Edgerton's Agent Connolly plays a very interesting character and shows that it's not necessary that a criminal is out there committing crimes, sometimes the criminal is in the system manipulating it to suit his needs. The politics in the FBI maybe the dark horse aspect of this film that only crime drama veterans may appreciate, all the talking and manipulation (aka boring stuff to casual movie goer). Rest of the cast is good and do their roles well but nothing home to write about.There are some scenes which were a tad bit over the top and some logical loopholes arose but trust me I did some light reading about the film after watching it and yes it is factually correct. It's an imperfect world sometimes even criminals get lucky and catch a break even after taking totally unnecessary risks or murder jobs. Lastly, I made the Scorsese comparison earlier but I don't think this film will have the longevity of Scorsese films, this film has a great script and some good scenes but the shots are never visually rich like Scorsese's, you still remember everyone's death scene from The Departed but Black Mass will not enjoy that long lasting appeal despite having an arguably better story. I can't wait to see the final cut of the film when it will be released, the original movie was nearly half an hour longer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp gives a chilling award worthy performance as Whitey Bulger in this violent crime drama.There's a supporting cast of almost too recognizable stars all competing to do their best Boston accents. At times the violence is so extreme it borders on unwatchable. Product placement is a distraction. It's a rough time at the movies, but the Depp performance is worth the price of admission.Along with acting award recognition, the movie deserves technical awards including make-up. The movie plays well with a shared audience. See it in a theater. Be warned the language and violence takes this out of the date movie category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boston criminal psychopath exploits FBI connection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title suggests, Black Mass exercises a Satanic evil ? in a character paradoxically named Whitey. Like the real-life character, this Whitey Bulger is a killer with reptilian charm whose psychopathology goes far beyond the proffered explanation of LSD experiments at Alcatraz. He's driven to build and secure a criminal empire but relishes torture for its own sake.While Bulger is careful not to be seen taking a satchel of money, we see him strangle and shoot people. He has a limited fastidiousness. The genre usually has the boss delegate such hands-on work. These graphic scenes connect Whitey to his crimes, even as he's coldly detached from any emotional connections other than his mother and son, who both die early. Even when he offers his young son guidance it's on how to get away with violence not to eschew it. Whitey hates rats but he can rationalize turning informer for the FBI. it's a business arrangement, by which the feds will help the Irish gang boss wipe out his rival Mafiosa. The film's central theme is the antithesis of connections and "pulling the plug." That phrase recurs. Whitey implicitly pulls the plug on his girlfriend when she explicitly says she'd pull the plug on their brain-dead son. There's a constant tension between a character's respecting his bond and breaking it. Hence the narrative's structure, reminiscences by his gunsels turning state's witness against him. So, too, Whitey's frequent strategy of pretending to forgive and accept someone immediately before killing him/her.There's a wide range of connections here. Whitey's brother is a leading state politician who steers completely clear of Whitey's criminal life. But he has to resign from his university chancellorship when he's found to have been in contact with the fugitive Whitey. In that fraternal connection, he failed to pull the plug completely enough.The third of these childhood friends is FBI agent John Connolly, who uses his old connection to enlist Whitey as informer. For failing to pull the plug he goes down. So does fellow agent John Morris, who moves from tentative conspirator to terrified. Typical of Satanic evil, Buiger has a seductive pull that enables a rationalization of justice to gloss the self-interest. The dapper suit, gold watch and new-found swagger are but signs of Connolly's corruption by his fidelity to his old friend.The Bulger boys' mother loves both, obviously, and may or may not be guilty of cheating Whitey at gin. But Connolly's wife pulls the plug on their marriage when she's exposed to Whitey's insinuating evil unmasked. As described above, Whitey pulls the plug on his relationship before his girlfriend does.Whitey and Connolly ? but not Whitey's legit brother ? make a big deal out of their old friendship and their connection to the neighbourhood. Here loyalty covers a multitude of sins and moral compromise. So, too, Whitey's brief service to the IRA's cause, an extension of his role of Irish warrior against the Italian gang, the South Side of Boston against the North. Where you're from is a much-touted bond, to compel loyalty, but the truly moral will pull that plug when virtue requires. Gunsel Steven is connected to his girlfriend's daughter but overextends that connection in their sexual relationship. When the cops probe her connection to Whitey's gang he strangles her. When Whitey turns against Morris for revealing his family's secret marinade recipe, he demonstrates the sinister danger in any connection to such evil. The scene ends with Whitey's even more chilling violation of Connolly's wife. The only healthy character in the house, she pleads illness. There are two humorous replays of the theme. An end credit promises no profits have resulted from the film's use of cigarettes. That is, nothing is connected to the smoke. And the film's most senior law officer is played by Kevin Bacon, mister six degrees of separation/connection himself.Obviously the film's subject goes beyond Whitey Bulger to America's knotted and inextricable binding of good and evil, the criminal and the law. One hand washes the other. The film derives not just out of the gangster genre but out of the even more characteristic American tradition, the Western. There American civilization is rooted in the gun and the noose. Gunmen brought "civilization" to the wilds and gunmen secure their families and relationships in the urban jungle. These days that paradox extends even further, to the international tyrants that America befriends and supports in its own thus morally compromised interests. Hello Saudis and Iran. Goodbye, naive confidence in any easy honour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I am one of the biggest fan of John Christopher Depp II. So When I was about to watch his next after the disaster 'Transcendence', i was overwhelmed. Little did I know that the star cast is consists of, Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard and Corey Stoll.In a word the movie is fantastico. The way Hollywood keep coming with movies about true stories is a example for the world cinema.About the story, it's all about how a psychopath small time criminal claimed the ladder to the highest star simply cause FBI let him, especially his childhood friend in FBI played brilliantly by Joel Edgerton. To my opinion, Kevin Becon and Peter Sarsgaard are wasted in the role of FBI chief and small time hit-man respectively.As for Benedict Cumberbatch, he played his role perfectly as the brother or crook and yet a senator of the states.At the end, I don't think anybody could play 'James 'Whitey' Bulger' like Johnny Depp did. He is truly a living legend.So if you like crime drama and if you liked 'Public Enemies' of John, you should be watching this...... Highly recommended.</fullReview>

I don't think it's okay to make a movie where they say the f-word for gay men so often. It made me really sick. Not even Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch can make that remotely okay. Plus there were barley 10 sentences in the whole movie, where they didn't use the f-word multiple times. Don't waste your time with it.I only managed to watch one hour of the movie before i had enough of getting insulted. The actors performances were without any doubt great.

		<shortDescription>Depp is scary (and scary great) in this mostly-ensemble crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene in Black Mass where James Bulger (aka Whitey, though you just call him Jimmy, of course) wants to find out what's wrong with John Connolly's wife. He's over for dinner and she's upstairs the whole time, supposedly not feeling well (in reality, she hates his guts, and is growingly resentful of her husband for associating with him). He goes up the stairs and knocks on her door - she's reading The Exorcist, by the way, probably unintentionally getting her in the mood for something frightening - and she opens to door to Jimmy. He touches John's wife's face, holds her neck (or, rather, just barely misses choking her) in checking to see if she's warm or hot or whatever. And it's in a moment like this, not the only one but clear as day, that Depp's performance as Bulger turns into something out of a horror movie: his Bulger is scary as f***, and what's most scary is the seeming lack of anything human outside of the darkness of the soul.It doesn't happen like that form the start, however; Bulger's darkness deepens as the film goes on - in this version of events, going from about 1975 to maybe the mid 90's or the late 80's - due to the deaths of two of his family members. One of them hits him harder than the other, but with each one he smiles less and less (as one of the informants being interviewed - one of the connecting glues of the narrative is the voice-over testimony of those who built up the Bulger case, only the IRA makes him happy), and he even has the look of Nosferatu. The contact lenses, the flaky white skin, the hair pulled back - this is Depp immersing himself and creating a different kind of crime lord.While he starts off as a guy we've seen in other movies, as the man who won't take s*** from any low-lifes and has no compunction about beating a guy's head in or shooting a man in broad daylight in a parking lot, somehow his presence grows more ominous in Black Mass. Even the title evokes something that Mario Bava might've made in the 1960's, with only a vague connection to religion. To put it another way, at one point he's lying back, resting with his eyes closed, and his arms and hands over his chest give the impression of a vampire inside of a coffin.This is a crime epic, however, so he is not the only character of note. On the contrary, it may actually be more FBI agent John Connolly's story, here played by Joel Edgerton, as he is the one who is really having to give some more subtle acting here. OK, maybe not all the time - it's often a nervous, forceful performance, and Edgerton, as he's shown in Great Gatsby and (the best parts of) Exodus, has that to spare - but he is a person who starts off trying to use a connection to his advantage. He's know Bulger, and his brother (a local politician played by Cumberbatch), since they were kids, and there's a kind of street-level-South-Boston loyalty there. Also the fact of, you know, not wanting to p-off a volcanic force like Whitey Bulger. So an 'alliance' is made (not to be confused, were told more than once by Connolly, of 'informant'-like procedure) and a plan is hatched that his department reluctantly agrees to: Bulger gives the FBI info on Italian mob gangs and families, they leave Bulger alone.It's certain the filmmakers had to leave some details out - it's a two hour film covering decades of criminal activity and rocky investigations - and there are one or two moments things get conflated for dramatic effect, like when Kevin Bacon's FBI chief is about to throw out the whole case and at this exact moment a wire-tap with crucial information on the Italians comes through. But what's impressive to me about Black Mass is that director Scott Cooper and his writers are able to make a possibly convoluted story accessible and exciting and absorbing; only a section in the middle, about a scheme involving Jai-Alai, needs some close attention paid (and even there the presence of Peter Sarsgaard as a drug-addled killer makes things pop and entertaining). But with Connolly, there's an emotional core and conflict that helps to offset the hellish backdrop that comes with Bulger; do we feel sorry for this man, or perhaps enjoy his downfall, which we know will come? Edgerton makes him a little more sympathetic, or just understandable in his actions, than if it had been by another actor, though he's one of a piece of what makes the film work well.Black Mass, with its brutal killings and violence and deaths that come not unexpectedly but not less in a grisly style, doesn't reach greatness overall, but there's a lot of great things that come about it, individual scenes. Watch as Jimmy and his girlfriend argue as to what to do about their son (Dakota Johnson in a small but pivotal performance, like, good God she can act THIS well), or how Bulger taunts an impressionable Agent Moore at a table with a 'joke' over a family secret recipe. Depp is acting his tail off here - surely his best work since Sweeney Todd - but the rest of the cast is so strong that most of the conventional elements or directing decisions can be overlooked. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just recently saw "Black Mass" from director Scott Cooper and I must say that it's a well done and informative look at the life and times of real life Boston criminal Whitey Bulger(played to near perfection by Johnny Depp). The film goes thru three decades starting in the 1970's to showcase the rise and power going up thru the ranks of crime and it's very violent and blunt in the scenes of blood and murder. Yet along the way bad boy Bulger is helped along with his rise to power by being an informant to the police to take down rival street gangs and other Mafia members on other turfs. Slowly but surely South Boston is controlled by Whitey yet the FBI is showcased as corrupt especially agent John Connolly(Joel Edgerton)as he and others look the other way when information about Bulger comes in it's like fear with bribes and payoffs on the side! Overall good film of greed, corruption, violence that tells the rise and fall of one of the most known criminals ever. And thumbs up to Johnny Depp for a kick butt performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass was nightmarish. It took the gangster genre to the depths of insanity. A great powerful movie. I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This true crime drama makes for a very well-rounded film. Black Mass shows what happens when you make a pact with the Devil. Directed by Scott Cooper &amp; based on the 2001 non-fiction book, Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob, by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. The film tells the true story of James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp), one of most notorious gangster in American history -- and his relationship with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as an informant for the FBI. Can John Connolly control Bulger or will Bulger gain the upper hand? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I like seeing, the manipulation of the FBI as a means to eradicate crime rivals for control of the Boston underworld. It made for an interesting intense watch. Lots of brutal action, throughout the film. Not for the weak hearted. Johnny Depp is just wicked good as Whitney Bulger. As much, as his make-up work is somewhat distracting, I like how Johnny Depp was able to show a lot of range of emotions with this character. Any other person would probably, play this crucial role, a little way cheesy; with over the top, stereotypical one-dimensional evil, acting. While, the film doesn't shy away from showing Whitey's evil sins, I like how Depp was able to show Bulger's more human side, with the material, given to him. Scenes with his mother, wife &amp; kids, were really necessary to show, that there is a real person, within the criminal mythic. You really do feel a lot of emotional, through his performance. You feel the heartbreak, when the family man side of him, really dies. Don't fear, the movie wasn't going to romanticize him, so needn't worry. It was just nice to see, a bit of that. Scott Cooper was able to show, also Bulger's more Machiavellian side. This movie shows that James Whitney Bulger could teach Satan some new tricks. I just wish, the movie establish more of a connection with his younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) &amp; him. I really didn't see, much conflict or stalks, between them. Anyways, Benedict Cumberbatch still, did a great role, even if it was short-lived. Sadly, John Connolly felt more like his brother, than Billy was, in the movie. Edgerton and Depp play wonderfully off each other. Connolly was a great character study that really show, how heroes, can easily be corrupt, when they want power. He has the most tragic of fates. Joel Edgerton is wonderful in this role. Also, his Boston accent, pretty damn shot on. The rest of the actors were pretty alright for the most part. I just didn't like how, some of them, are always being typecast. Good examples are Juno Temple as the prostitution, Deborah Hussey &amp; Jesse Plemons as the criminal, Kevin Weeks. I kinda want them to step up, their game. The best of the minor supporting actors, had to be Kevin Bacon as Charles McGuire. While, his character is a composite of several Boston FBI bosses, he had some of the best harsh verbal exchanges. It was fun, watching him, play off, with Edgerton's character. I'm glad, they cut Sienna Miller as Catherine Grieg from the film, because her scenes weren't really needed. I'm also, glad, they didn't show, too much of senior-citizen, Whitney Bugler, because, the makeup work for age 40's Bugler is outrageous, enough. I glad, they kept, most of the film in the late 1970s/early 1980s. It would be, way too jarring for the film to have longer scenes in 1995 or 2011. For the most part, the movie is pretty accuracy historically. There are few things, worth nitpicking, like not going into much details of how Bulger was able to escape, how he was capture, and how his criminal operation works. Another thing, the movie didn't explain, is why certain people were kill off. I had to do, research on my own, to figure out, who and why John Callahan (Bill Camp) had a hit on him. The movie could had, been better if only the movie dug deeper. I wish, the movie would mention more of Bulger's LSD testing days, the Killeen-Mullen War, or even the Lady of the Dunes rumors. Still, the movie does have good pacing for what it is. I was never bored. While, the movie is grim. It does have some semi-funny moments with its strong language and mean-spirited comments. Some critics have accuse the movie, for trying too hard to be, like 1990's GoodFellas, but I rarely see any similarities, besides the dinner table scene. It didn't borrow, much of anything from Goodfellas. This movie is way more intense and scary than any of Martin Scorsese's gangster films. If any, Scorsese's 2006 film The Departed borrow, way too heavy on Bulger's exploits. While, yes, the plot of the movie is adapted from the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, but you can clearly see many similarities to that film with this. Overall: This gripping and unique crime drama about the duality of undercover work, works. A must-watch. I do recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid mobster crime drama with a stellar Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Black Mass" (2015 release; 122 min.) brings the story of James "Whitey" Bulger (played by Johnny Depp), the infamous Boston mobster. As the movie opens, we see one of Bulger's associates strike a deal with the FBI to spill everything ("I want it on record, I'm not a rat", ha!). We then flash back to "1975, South Boston", and we get to know Bulger and his small circle of trusted associates. In a parallel story, we get to know FBI agent John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), also a 'Southie' who has just returned to Boston. Connolly convinces Bulger to become an FBI informant (which Bulger hopes will help him eliminate the rival mobsters from North Boston). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, the is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Scott Cooper, who earlier brought us the excellent films "Crazy Heart" (2009) and "Out of the Furnace" (2013). Unlike those movies, he did not write the script for "Black Mass" not thought up the story (the film is based on the book of the same name). That does not diminish Cooper's merits with this one, as Cooper strikes the right tone and brings us a gritty and hard-as-nails crime drama. If tough language (the F bomb drops frequently) or violence (yes, people will get hurt and killed), then do yourself a favor and stay away from this. The best part of the movie for me is as we see the noose getting tighter and tighter around Bulger's neck (figuratively speaking) and options are starting to diminish. Second, the performance from Johnny Depp is nothing short of stellar, reconfirming our (ebbing) belief that this is a top notch actor,. It makes you cringe just thinking of some of the other recent movies he's done ("Mordecai", anyone?). Depp is almost unrecognizable as the infamous mobster. There are a TON of other noteworthy performances, including from Kevin Bacon (as the head of the Boston FBI), but also Adam Scott as another FBI agent, Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger (the bother who was a state senator), and Dakota Johnson as Bulger's girlfriend. Solid work all around. Kudos as well to the production team for painstakingly recreating the late 70s/early 80s, making the movie a true period piece. Be sure to stick around when the end credits start rolling, as we get a bunch of archive video footage and pictures from the real people, just fascinating.I had been looking forward to seeing this. The movie opened this weekend and I went to see it right away. the early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very well attended, somewhat to my surprise, given the tough nature of the movie. With the summer blockbusters in the rearview mirror, maybe people are ready for something completely altogether. "Black Mass" surely is that. If you are in the mood for a tough crime drama featuring Johnny Depp at its best, you cannot go wrong with this. "Black Mass" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp at his very best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an fantastic ensemble cast all around with even the smallest role being crafted by a gifted actor.The narrative was a slow ride filled with intense drama as Black Mass tells the true story of a small time gangster who was able to climb to the top of south Boston's underworld thanks to a deal he had with FBI agent, John Connolly. Sometimes the Boston accents seemed slightly too much, especially when everyone had the attitude down so well and really set up the gritty environment the movie was portraying. The cinematography even adds to it making every thing not so Hollywood beautiful but very real to the events that happen between 1975 to 1995. But the real magic in Black Mass is Mr. Depp who showed much depth in his acting. I've seen pictures where Depp would engulf himself into a character, Like with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were he also sports a bald head, but that was a black comedy that exploited his well documented sense of humor, but playing James "Whitey" Bulger, met leaving as little as Depp as possible,to become unrecognizable.Johnny Depp created an outstanding achievement in acting in this generation's version of Good Fellas. it's a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Black Mass" is James "Whitey" Bulger's Soul ? Assuming He Has One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this time we have an Irish-American gangster protagonist instead of the time-worn Italian-American one, "Black Mass" (hereafter BM) follows the usual rise and fall trajectory of all organized crime movies. However, what distinguishes BM from a lot of these "Crime Really Doesn't Pay" movies is actor Johnny- Depp's career-zenith performance as that Irish-American gangster protagonist James "Whitey" Bulger. Most gangster movies manage to find a smidgen of tenderness and caring in their mob boss heroes. In BM, that humanity is just about missing. With his slicked-back white hair, cold blue eyes, and stone-faced sneer, Depp's Bulger seems to be pure, implacable, death-warmed-over evil with no soul at all, or at best a black chunk of coal for a soul.During the mid 70's, Bulger and his "Winter Hill Gang" consisting of his lieutenant, unshaven and uncouth Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), newbie Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), and equally poker-faced and sloppy peanut-eating hit-man Johnny Martorano (W. Earl Brown) hold sway over South Boston (or South End or Southie). Bulger took care never to let the public see him rub out his enemies (advice he humorously but chillingly gives his young son, Douglas). Bulger justifies these tactics as necessary to "protect" Southie from the ambitious mafia-backed North Boston (North End) Italian-American Angiulo Brothers. Of course, it's just a turf war. In this war, Whitey seems to have the edge because he doesn't hesitate to kill not only people who mess with him or betray him, but also people he just SUSPECTS of doing the same. For example, late in the film Bulger strangles Flemmi's prostitute stepdaughter for talking to the cops, even though she swears she didn't squeal on him.Whitey Bulger is not the only one who wants to take out the Angiulo Brothers. A Southie native son, FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returns home because he is eager to rise in the ranks and thinks that icing the elusive Angiulo Brothers is the way to do it. Thinking Bulger has the "connections" to bring them down, Connolly wants Bulger to inform on them to the FBI. Even though Bulger's twisted sense of crime and Irish ethnic loyalty makes him initially refuse Connolly's offer, Connolly craftily appeals to that same loyalty to convince Bulger that being an FBI "snitch" is the only way to get rid of the Angiulos.Slowly and eventually, Connolly realizes that he may have made a deal with a real devil. Bulger blithely and savagely refuses to heed Connolly's warning not to commit crimes and/or kill as he keeps tabs on the Angiulos. On the contrary, Bulger coolly exploits this unholy alliance with the FBI to expand his influence not only in Southie, but even in Miami in a World Jai Alai embezzlement scheme, and as far as Ireland in an IRA (Irish Republican Army) weapons- smuggling operation. Only after Connolly's FBI boss, the demanding Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) rides him, and Connolly in turn rides Bulger does he finally get photographic evidence of the Angiulos' criminal haunts, which allows the FBI to nail the brothers through a wiretap.Bulger seems to have it made. His main opponents are out of the picture. His senator brother William Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) stays willfully ignorant about Whitey's activities. Helping capture Anguilo should keep the FBI looking the other way. But fate steps in as she always does. Bulger's fragile family life collapses as his son Douglas suffers Reye syndrome, goes into a coma and dies when his mom and Bulger's girlfriend Lindsey (Dakota Johnson) pulls the plug on him despite Whitey's raging opposition. She leave Whitey soon after. Bulger also acts irrationally and threateningly towards Connolly's FBI partner John Morris (David Harbour) in a "GoodFellas"-inspired "tell me the recipe" scene, and in an unbearably tense bedroom scene with Connolly's wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson). Even though Connolly is still in Bulger's corner, Marianne finally gets fed up with his slimy association and locks him out of the house.The beginning of the end comes for Connolly in the form of blunt, all-business prosecutor Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), who takes over the U.S. Attorney's Office and brusquely refuses Connolly's bribe of Red Sox tickets and basically tells him to stop his bullsh-t connection with Whitey and bring him in. When undercover agent John McIntyre (Brad Carter) blows the lid on the IRA operation, Bulger kills and buries him. Wyshak also learns the "assistance" Whitey provided to capture the Angiulo Brothers actually came second-hand from lower-rank informants. In return for immunity, Morris confesses the true relationship that Connolly and Whitey had. When The Boston Globe exposes Whitey's informant activities, the jig is up as the Winter Hill Gang abandons Whitey as a traitor, is arrested, and brings the movie full circle to their taped confessions. Connolly is arrested as well for his conspiratorial crimes. In the epilogue, Whitey becomes a 16-year fugitive, eventually captured by the FBI in 2011.Though cruising over familiar gangster ground, BM is a smoothly-paced, never-boring, and actually unnerving portrait of an unconventional, psychopathic criminal who achieves his murderous ends not so much through flamboyant anger (though Bulger does lose it from time to time) as through inhuman, selfish, enigmatic, unadulterated evil. Even when he is being "nice", like to his son or mother, it's creepy and foreboding. Again, Depp redeems himself after five movie flops to give an Oscar-caliber performance as a soulless guy that seems to have come straight out of hell. Joel Edgerton nearly steals the spotlight from Depp as the unscrupulous agent Connolly who justifies selling HIS soul by touting his Irish-based loyalty and friendship with Bulger and the old adage "it takes a thief to catch a thief ". Despite Depp's tour-de-force performance, BM makes me wish for a movie prequel detailing Bulger's young, formative years and the events that led to his criminal career, including stints at Leavenworth and Alcatraz. After all, no one is born evil, right?Right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass is a gritty, dark, biopic on one of the most notorious gangster to ever live,James "Whitey" Bulger. Depp is back with a Oscar worthy act!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would lie if I said I didn't have huge expectations from a film like Black Mass, the trailer was outstanding, the films cast boasts of actors like Johnny Depp,Joel Edgerton,Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon.The film had everything going for it, it was a masterpiece in the making. And did Black Mass ever meet those expectations,I mean don't get me wrong the film probably is not a masterpiece, but its easily one of the finest films, you will see this year. From the word go a dark eerie atmosphere is created in the film, and its maintained throughout. James "Whitey" Bulger easily becomes that one character you hate to love, and its all thanks to Johnny Depp's Oscar worthy performance, he has made a comeback like never before after many flop films, his performance alone is worth the ticket price of the film. I mean Black Mass is not as good but can easily be compared too gangster flicks like the Departed,Goodfellas made by Ace filmmaker Martin Scorsese, and thats saying a lot because those films are masterpieces, decade defining films. Black Mass is a gritty, dark, biopic on one of the most notorious gangster to ever live,James "Whitey" Bulger.Story wise the film is a biopic on the rise and fall of the Irish mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger, better know as Jimmy.Jimmy was involved in almost any criminal activity a person could name, from money laundering, to racketeering,murder, extortion,trafficking drugs, terrorism,etc you name it. The film starts off with members of his Irish mob, the main members turning informants and telling the story of how Jimmy became such a big gangster when at one point he was a nobody. The film talks about how Jimmy's younger brother Billy was a state Senator, a very affluent person in the southern Boston area. An area which Jimmy wanted under his control but the Italian mob was in his way. After a series of events Jimmy is introduced to James Connolly a former childhood friend, now turned FBI agent. He makes a deal with Jimmy that he can continue doing whatever he does, if he provides info on how to arrest the Italian mob, Jimmy looks at this to his advantage, and doesn't consider this snitching because he would not be ratting out anybody he is associated with. This deal somehow leads to James "Whitey" Bulger becoming the biggest gangster in America in the 70s, and 80s, and it also lead to him being on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list, how this happened is what forms the rest of the films story.Acting wise, as I stated before Johnny Depp has given a Oscar worthy performance in Black Mass, as James "Whitey" Bulger. He plays the dark character so menacingly, that at times you feel that Johnny is actual Whitey, and thats the highest praise any actor can get. Depp has hit it out of the ball park. On the other hand Joel Edgerton is on a roll with great performances, after the Gift, he has given another amazing act. Benedict Cumberbatch is good in his brief appearance. The rest of the ensemble cast is apt.Black Mass is a film that doesn't have any huge negatives,I mean you could look at the films pace and say that its slow, but for this type of film you need that type of pace, the screenplay could have been a little more novel, because at times, it does feel like the film is taking the route most gangster films do, but I mean as I mentioned on the onset the film is no masterpiece. However the director Scott Copper needs to applauded for getting the atmosphere right in the film, and never wavering away from the films true story. Nothing is glamorized in the film,Black Mass feels like a real, gritty drama.Overall I won't say much more other than if you want to see one of the years best films,head to a theater near you because Johnny Depp's performance alone is worth the ticket price the rest is a bonus in Black Mass. A must watch for people who enjoy films about the Mob and gangster flicks.4/5* or 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Depp film as iconic as his role as Jack Sparrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is a well known and praised actor for his work by portraying colorful various characters. However in recent years, many began to think Depp was running out of ideas on how to make his roles unique. A role many loved from his early 2000s was the lead role in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl as Captain Jack Sparrow. Audiences and fans a like began to notice that as time went on, Depp began taking liberties with his acting choices and translating many of Sparrow's mannerisms into his other roles. Although hardcore Depp fans do not mind this, objective critics were not impressed with all the doppelgangers. Then there's this film which completely flips the Depp perception of his usual odd and quirky roles into something that will truly showcase that Depp has more to add. There really isn't much to pull out on the spot for this project. Several of the elements in this production blend so well that it's very difficult to go back and think about what needed work or stood out as bad.Johnny Depp plays the Irish fist-throwing/trash-talking Jimmy "Whitey" Bulger, a real life small town gangster during the mid 1970s who ended up soaring to the F.B.I.'s most wanted list after the early 1990s. Competently directed by Scott Cooper (Out of the Furnace (2013)) and written by Mark Mallouk (his first credit) and Jez Butterworth (Edge of Tomorrow (2014)), this group of people and the cast tacked on make this story quite the watcher. The writing covers the material as if it were a documentary but does it in such a way that demonstrates to the audience what actually happened other than the people being interviewed giving it all away. It's not incredibly ingenious but it is smart because it gives the viewers a better idea of the people involved and how they dealt with the situation that was erupting during that current time period other than hearing from them decades later. The only thing that is worth mentioning that should've been brought up is how Bulger got his mentality that he was so infamously known for? There is no backstory for Bulger's motivations. Why was he the way he was?Other than this, everything else works great. Casting wise, Johnny Depp as Jimmy Bulger is jarringly different from recent acting choices and it is a delight to see him as the fouled-mouthed Irishman. Depp's voice is grainy sounding, his receding blonde hairline and cloudy blue eyes really make this something to remember. Even though the background to Bulger's eventual trademark characteristics are not expanded upon, Depp's performance is dumbfoundingly captivating. For such an antagonistic character, the writing and Depp combined are able to give even Bulger small tidbits of humanity that don't even seem possible. The reason why this is almost shocking is because most audiences are not supposed to feel sympathy for such a character. What's weird is that there are times where it seemed as if Bulger did have his soft moments. For example, when Bulger makes a promise about a certain topic, he honestly sounds like he's giving a scout's honor. Then again, it was hard to tell because of how deceitful his personality was. That alone is demonstrated quite early on. This is how devious the writing and the character is.Along side Depp is Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, an old friend of Bulger who feels he owes him a favor. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Bulger's brother Billy who also knows Connolly and frequently associates with him. Actors Jesse Plemons and Rory Cochrane play Bulger's henchmen who show they are just as loyal to Bulger as is Connolly and Billy. There's also scenes with Peter Sarsgaard, Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott who work along side Connolly in the F.B.I. agency. The majority of these characters get a good dose of character development and each actor performs exceptionally well. The violence although not gruesome, is certainly brutal no doubt. The killings are mostly direct and to the point about what the job is and there are some that will make the viewer hope they don't ever have a run in with a character like Bulger. Not even a can of spinach would save somebody against Bulger; contempt is what he lives on.The cinematography shot by Masanobu Takayanagi has a skilled visual flare to it as well. Since this film has two methods of story telling, there are also two methods of camera-work. For the documentary style part of the narrative, Takayanagi films those scenes completely still and close up like an interview would. As for the rest of the execution, Takayanagi films the rest of the scenes like other films. Thankfully there are no shaky cam shots, or disorienting continuous rotating 360 shots. Every scene is well lit and is steady no matter where the camera goes. The film score composed by Tom Holkenborg, better known as Junkie XL also brings in some nice cues to the table. It was a little questionable at first because of how Holkenborg likes to mimic several of Hans Zimmer contemporary synthetic type cues but here Holkenborg actually provided a enjoyable listening experience that includes strings and piano that emotionally capture the trouble that goes on throughout this crime thriller. It's tragic and sounds great.The only thing that sticks out as of needs for improvement was explaining how Jimmy Bulger got his motivations to become what he's known for. That's not much to say though with a talented supporting cast, gritty violence, effective camera-work, tragic sounding music and a defining performance from Johnny Depp that is quite opposite from the majority of his previous roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Should Get An Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Black Mass", starring Johnny Depp-Mortdecai, The Lone Ranger_2013; Joel Edgerton-The Gift, Star Wars:Episode 3_Revenge of the Sith; Dakota Johnson-Fifty Shades of Grey, Need For Speed; Benedict Cumberbatch-The Imitation Game, 12 Years a Slave, Oh yeah, he is playing Doctor Strange in 2016 and Kevin Bacon-The Following_tv, X-Men:First Class.This movie is based on the true story of James "Whitey" Bulger, who was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for 12 years. Johnny plays James and he does a really good job of it. His make-up, hair and eye contact lenses completely change his looks so much so, that he is fairly unrecognizable. Johnny and Benedict play brothers and Joel is a childhood friend that grew up with both of them in Boston, but they all took different career paths; Johnny as the head of the Irish mob, Benedict as a US senator and Joel as an FBI agent. Kevin plays Joel's boss at the FBI headquarters that wants Joel to crack down on Johnny and Dakota plays Johnny's wife. Johnny starts out as a low level Irish criminal in the 1970's &amp; 80's with the Italian Mafia edging in on his territory. Johnny becomes an informer to the FBI so that they will take out his competition, the Mafia, and gets immunity for his earlier criminal life, in exchange for it. The only problem was that Johnny continued with his criminal life. The FBI did not like being played as fools, so that is when Johnny had to go on the run and became the FBI's most wanted man-his $2 million dollar reward was the highest amount ever offered for a felon, except for Osama bin Laden. The movie is very violent with Johnny changing at the drop of a hat, between being nice and psychotic. As the end credits start, you see pictures and video of the real Bulger and his compatriots and they tell you where they are now and what happened to them or how many years sentences they received. It's rated "R" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 2 minutes. I would not be surprised if Johnny gets an Oscar for this role. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This role was already done by Jack Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's dark, dull, and boring. A lot of dark backgrounds and dark scenes. Even the music is dark. A lot of dark-sounding strings music. The soundtrack sounds like a funeral dirge. Scenes are so literally under-lit that it makes you want to turn on a lamp. Dark cinematography. Depp looks ridiculous and despite heavy make-up effects still doesn't look at all like Whitey Bulger. Different facial structures. There is no real character development in the script. From this movie I learned nothing new about Bulger. Nothing about how he became this person, his life before the events in the film, the nature of his personal relationships, how he became leader of his gang, his upbringing or anything else. It is an empty film with boring dialogue mixed with excessive profanity and occasional violence. The very few occasions when somebody gets killed are the only thing to keep you from sleeping. They don't explain in any depth the events that transpire in the film, and a viewer could easily get lost. They never fully explain who his brother was, so the one scene with him served no purpose at all. If you want to give this film a chance, do so with a cup of coffee. I almost dozed off numerous times. Ho-hum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deal with this devil garners a free pass to hell in south Boston</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scores a 10 out of 10 ratingThe crime film genre remains in good stead with the launching of director Scott Cooper's Black Mass which is a movie biography based on factual evidence of south Boston's number one crime lord of the 1970's and 1980's the vicious head of the Winter Hill Gang, James (Whitey) Bulger. To help prepare you for what type of crime boss Whitey Bulger really was there is an earlier documentary film released in January 2014 titled "Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger" that is well worth watching for its in-depth insight in to the real south Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger before seeing Black Mass and realizing how well produced and acted the film really is.Johnny Depp plays the lead role of James Whitey Bulger with a hard to achieve balance of rare human compassion for his family and as a fearless gangster who knows no bounds in maximizing the physical violence he will dispel on anyone who gets in his way.It is always difficult to take a true story of a mans life that evolves over decades and capture the essence of the man in a two hour film but director Scott Cooper does an excellent job in achieving just that. It is hard to fathom that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would make such a ridiculous deal with a devil like James "Whitey" Bulger and allow him to run rampant over south Boston in exchange for providing a continuous stream of confidential information that would bring down his competition in South Boston.Two primary reasons to see this film are the rich cinematography which is pure luster in color and the excellent script writing. There is also the benefit of a superior list of top notch supporting actors such as Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Julianne Nicholson and Kevin Bacon just to name a few. It is an all star cast with not one stand out performance since there are so many great scenes in this film.I would love to predict that there will be numerous Academy Award nominations for Black Mass but in my humble opinion the true way to assess most films authenticity of success is at the box office to which I predict Black Mass's gross sales over the next year will surpass all of its competition hands down, Academy Award winner or not. I hope I never encounter Johnny Depp knocking on my door playing Whitey Bulger with a deal of a lifetime...or with death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp is brilliant in a brutal epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most refreshing thing about Scott Cooper's Black Mass, the new biopic of the rise and fall of South Boston gangster James "Whitey" Bulger is that for once we get an unromantic view of a psychopath. As much as I love fine films like Silence of the Lambs and Psycho, I must admit that both films ask us to find some measure of admiration with their subjects. That's not the case here. In Bulger, we are in the presence of a human animal, an otherwise reasonable man who sends men and woman to their deaths almost as a part of his daily routine. The real mystery, of course, is how he was able to operate as gangster and terrorist for so long without, at the very least, being sent up the river.And yet, that's not really the film's trajectory, merely the template. Scott Cooper's film is tricky in that when it's all over we aren't asked to sympathize or admire Bulger, we are given a portrait of the wrecked lives that he has left in his wake. It's about a psychopathic gangster, yes, but it's much more about how his friends, his employees, the FBI, and his immediate family fell under his spell and paid the price. We feel for these people even though we understand that, simply by associating with a cunning gangster, they are the authors of their own broken destiny.Bulger ruled the underworld of South Boston with his Winter Hill Gang for several decades after a nine year stretch at Alcatraz. Played in a brilliant performance by Johnny Depp, the movie isn't about his rise to power, but about how he bent and manipulated the powers that be in order to stay in power. He became the most infamous criminal in Boston's history and ran his operation throughout the 70s and 80 using his talent for manipulation and his willingness to murder anyone for the smallest of reasons.In 1981 Bulger struck a deal with the FBI to be an informant, but by being an informant he quietly turned the bureau into his own private army and took down the Italian mob on the north side. It didn't hurt that his FBI contact was a childhood friend John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). The thrill of the relationship between Bulger and Connolly is that Bulger is smarter and quicker, while Connolly is a weak-willed and loyal to a fault. He was an otherwise good man who becomes corrupted by his association with Whitey, in spite of warnings from his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson) and just about everyone else.The general outlines of the film are painfully familiar. What makes it special is that director Scott Cooper refuses to glorify or glamorize this story or these people. He knows that Bulger is scum, and he never makes the mistake of romanticizing his acts of violence. Bulger responds to stupidity and acts of disloyalty with the barrel of a gun. A lot of people are shot dead in this movie. Bullets enter the body. There's blood. There's pain. There's death. There is nothing romantic here. The violence is sudden and frightening. Bulger is nothing short of a menace. In his track suits, his Foster Grey glasses (that make his face look like a skull) and his dead tooth that signals the rot from within, he comes off as a cold and vicious figure who buried so many bodies in one place that it became known as "Bulger Hill." He has a cold, dead stare and a way of turning and twisting words to turn innocent conversation into a threat. There are so many scenes in the movie when people are shot dead and the violence is sudden, bloody and shocking. Cooper doesn't use any camera tricks or slow-motion. We see the violence as it happens.The movie's success rests on the shoulders of Johnny Depp. When it was announced that a major studio was making a bio-pic about "Whitey" Bulger with Depp in the lead I wasn't exactly jumping for joy. Depp has been at the helm of so many bad movies lately that I had forgotten what a talent he really is. Like Peter Sellers, Lon Chaney, Alec Guinness and Eddie Murphy, Depp joins the short list of actors who can disappear behind heavy make-up. With thinning white hair, a palled complexion, a dead stare and an accent as thick as Boston Clam Chowder, he portrays Bulger as a cold, heartless monster or the devil in disguise. Bulger can make anyone do anything. There's a scary scene late in the film when he questions an FBI man about his grilled stake. The man claims it is a family secret. Bulger insists. The man relents. Then Bulger questions why he would reveal a family secret so easily. The silence that follows is as thick as pea soup.The film's only weak link is that it often seems too stuffed with characters. There are many players in this story and many of whom never seem to get more than one-dimension. That wouldn't be so unusual except that we get the feeling that their stories exist in some longer cut of the film. At 2 hours, the film does feel a little short, and the movie abruptly skips over what Bulger was doing during the 16 years that he was on the lam (he and his wife were raising pit bulls). But what you take away from this film is that great performance by Johnny Depp who disappears so fully into this character that I wouldn't be surprised if a second Oscar nomination didn't come his way next spring. Even when the movie isn't at its best, Depp is always at the top of his game. In a somewhat flawed but never-the-less entertaining gangster movie, he stands out and gives us a performance of pure evil that lingers in our minds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True stories often make great subjects for film. And the notorious, real-life tale of a heinous crime lord who rose to power in the late '70s through a collusive alliance with the FBI certainly seems like a promising foundation. And yet, though building upon favorable groundwork and populated with engaging performances, "Black Mass" loses much of its appeal by relating its shocking plot with a noticeable absence of panache. Despite a narrative involving vicious gangsters, corrupt officials, and flagrant homicide, the film often exhibits the straightforward style of a documentary; many of the moments that should evoke traumatic awe register much milder intrigue. For a movie relying heavily upon transformative roles by notable actors, "Black Mass" allows a stale structure and lusterless first impressions of its cast of dissolute souls to dampen the drama.When the Italian Mafia begins edging in on the felonious endeavors of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang, hoodlum James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) knows he must act fast to protect his territory. Forming an alliance with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), Bulger works as an informant, aiding in the Bureau's efforts to bring down the Angiulo crime family. But as his power rapidly escalates, Whitey and his merciless cohorts Steve Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), John Martorano (W. Earl Brown), and Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) embark on a rampage of unchecked atrocities that threaten to collapse their criminal empire.The film opens with the studying of faces ? faces that have been distorted by makeup and contact lenses and hairstyles, which aim to remove the baggage of the stars' previous roles but fail to do so entirely. It's a performance piece, with Depp heading an ensemble cast of actors donning unusual personas, but never do the leads disappear into their characters; lurking irremovably underneath those vampiric blue eyes and the appropriate creepiness of his actions is still a recognizable Johnny Depp."Jimmy's no ordinary criminal." Unlike "Goodfellas," from which "Black Mass" steals a key scene (involving a conversation that takes a turn toward the unexpected), the glamor and appeal of the gangsterism on display has been completely expunged. There are no shiny cars or exclusive clubs (save for a single scene in Miami, which exists mainly for a murder opportunity) or fashionable girls or lavish expenditures of money. Instead, the mobsters are grotesque, humorless, and unfeelingly violent, situated in a warzone of filthy streets and rundown bars. Similarly, their motives aren't exhibited as a chivalrous code of honor, but rather as cold psychopaths executing targets on a whim. The allure of the lifestyle is utterly absent; even the desire for money has no manifested bearing on their conduct.Just as no effort is made to define a revelatory purpose for this conglomeration of corrupt, embittered, backstabbing opponents, there's no artistry in the presentation. It's a cops-and-robbers procedural, where the antagonists are indistinguishable from the protagonists, and investigations and murders are conducted purely for a sense of faithfulness to the source material. The attention to detail is consistent and the recreations of a specific time period are convincing, but they're both mere visual gimmicks; the story and its impact aren't boosted to any degree. It's an examination of real-world monsters, stuck to a true-to-life basis and condemned to a sourly anticlimactic, un-cinematic outcome ? which is made worse by the narrative, structured in a hopelessly generic manner that reveals too much at the beginning, stifles drama throughout, and ends in a ridiculous series of codas (which are even interrupted by another parting shot). While the performances are intense and likely to garner critical acclaim, "Black Mass" is all fierceness and authenticity in lieu of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the start we have to be aware, the movie is not about one big event or the rise of James Bulger (Jimmy). Rather, the life of Jimmy. Scott Cooper has brilliantly left few loose ends in the movie, for that's not what he wanted to convey in a complicated subject like this.Johnny Depp &amp; Joel Edgerton make the screen their very own. The two main characters have been beautifully written and performed. Depp playing his part reminds you about his acting skills from pre Pirates of the Caribbean era. Depp plays the part of the vicious gangster perfectly. When he is at the neighborhood where the locals like their "southie" boy to the brutal murderer that made everyone fear him. One dinner scene at John Connolly explains the different shades of Jimmy. It is the same scene that also highlights Edgerton's performance that shows the mental struggle Edgerton is put through to pull all the strings. Cumberbatch as Senator Billy had nothing to offer in the entire movie. Just appears in bits &amp; pieces. Cooper could have done well had the script had more for him.On the whole it is a memorable experience you will walk away with. The story of a crime lord who disappeared for so many years after terrorizing the city of Boston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A average film saved by top-notch acting performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six years after Public Enemies, Johnny Depp Depp plays infamous Boston Mafioso James "Whitey" Bulger, an Irishman who rose from being a petty street thug to being No. 2 on the FBI's most wanted list just behind Osama Bin Laden.This role has once again put him in the limelight for a possible fourth nomination for the Academy Award for the best actor and if, he is lucky; his first and very well deserved win.Black Mass is a biopic on the life of Bulger ; a "Southie" gang-lord who formed an "Allegience" with the FBI to eliminate his own personal interests. There is Oscar buzz surrounding Depp's performance, and understandably so. His Jimmy is equal parts likable, stubborn, and monstrous. Depp captures the Boston accent, walk, and mannerisms we expect of someone in Jimmy's position, but what will leave movie- goers remembering the most are his eyes, which are steely, demonic blue beads. They suggest an omnipresent hardness about Jimmy that fits perfectly with his cryptic smile and sallow complexion. On more than one occasion Jimmy is friendly with someone, then kills the person moments later. It's frightening because it's the worst kind of menace: The kind that smiles to your face and then stabs you in the back, when you least expect it. I don't think we've ever seen Depp this cold and dangerous before.The screenplay of the movie is decent and keeps you on the edge of your seat for sometime. The direction is good, could have been better, though.Of the supporting cast, Joel Edgerton hits the nail on the head with his portrayal of the disgraced ex-FBI agent , John Conolly who in his attempt to impress his "friend" Bulger, ends up being charged for second degree murder. Benedict Cumberbatch as Whitey's kid brother also does an excellent job. It was hard to imagine that a person from England could shed his accent so easily and put on an impeccable Boston accent, one of the hardest to master. Dakota Johnson and Julianne Nicholson, both were fabulous in their respective parts. Kevin Bacon was okay.Coming back to Depp's performance and his chances of getting an Oscar,it is absolutely clear that this is the best acting performance of the year(YES, i have seen The Revenant,Steve Jobs,Trumbo,Youth,Concussion,The Danish Girl).In my opinion, he deserves the Academy Award, but, the whole whoopla around Leo "deserving" it for a one-dimensional role that could have been played by anyone and Depp's eccentric and carefree attitude that is not appreciated by most people,might see him miss this opportunity. On the whole; Black Mass is definitely a one-time watch. There is no way you can criticize the acting. The only thing that people may come out of the hall, cribbing about is the content of the film. To all the gangster movie lovers, I would like to say: THIS is no Goodfellas. It is very hard to replicate that. But it is right there at the top with the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>His Whitey Bulger looks so terrifying it gives you the chills. He is a viper that takes everyone down with him. That's the bottom-line! The crux of the biopic! James Whitey Bulger, the most notorious criminal was doomed, and he took everyone close to him, with him, to hell.Scott Cooper makes Whitey Bulger an unpredictable psychopathic albino criminal to make him look not only bad-ass but extremely dreadful too. Johnny Depp ensures he nails the character in Cooper's head to perfection. Scott does change a lot of facts and messes with reality to emphasize on his character. In doing so he misses out on a lot of crucial factors to wrap a biopic.At no point are we introduced to Angiulo or his involvements. What is quite surprising is the fact that Cooper chose to manifest dispensable characters like FBI Agent Robert Fitzpatrickand Lindsey Cyr instead. The editing of the movie isn't that great. You see a lot of characters in the biopic who are built quickly from scratch, but unfortunately are not handed enough. Cameos basically suppressed under Bulger noise!Who we must not forget in this rad Bulger tale, is the contribution of John Connolly played by Joel Edgerton. He is always there. The backbone of Jimmy's rise. The FBI behind every crime. He saves his ass literally all the time, and fights with Charles Mcguire (Kevin Bacon) and convinces John Morris (David Harbour) into helping him.There are frightening bits in the movie where Depp turns Jimmy off and then on just like that, characterizing his psychotic and unpredictable nature.The movie doesn't cash on its screenplay, and is entirely dependent on Jimmy Bulger and things that surround him. The score of the movie is great, as violin breaks the silence with its brilliant depth. Sometimes absent, the music is only played at the right areas for emphasis.SPOILERS AHEAD:So Cooper's Bulger isn't exactly smart. He is sleazy and basically rolls on favours of people close to him. The fact that he works under the aegis of John Connolly and Billy Burger, where John is ever ready to save Jimmy's ass is what gives wings and balls to Bulger. The movie doesn't highlight all his murders but depicts two or three. Others are shown being committed by his accomplices.A lot of fact changing actually steers the movie from a biopic to a fiction. It appears stale if compared to other great crime stories. The introduction and conclusion of Brian Halloran to the story was too distasteful. At one point you almost think, Jimmy has a plan when he asks Brian to take the bag of cash and leave. But then it was just plain talk! It was hard to imagine the character, who you were hoping doesn't do normal, to do the 'simplest of things'.If we don't look at all the minute details and enjoy the movie with a popcorn, we can see Depp's brilliant acting, Joel Edgerton's persistence and loyalty, Benedict's style and a great criminal story that reeks of perversion the moment it enters the police line. Overall the movie was good. If there was someone who was ensuring that, without much in their baggage, it was Depp and Edgerton all along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep, dark? Black Mass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is dark. Interesting name really. I quite like the title. I know it is based on a book, but still ? really catching and for me just the name invokes mystery and deep thinking. The movie is based on the infamous Boston gangster Jimmy "Whitey" Bulger of the notorious Winter Hill Gang. Most of the film takes place between the 70-90s. The reason to see the film: Johnny Depp. Reasons not to see the film: not a super-duper structured narrative some things just happen (like life). And it is quite dark (also like life). But if you would rather have a Nolan-esque/rainbows film, this is not it.MILD SPOILERS: Black Mass is a pulsating look into the life of a cold-blooded gangster. Most of the film, Whitey seems to be of the same demeanor, but worsening at the death of his son and the death of his mother. At the end of the film, Whitey's closest associate is asked by the FBI in seemingly current year about their relationship, and he remarks, "It was strictly criminal." What an intriguing way to describe a human relationship. I guess that is the mobster way of saying it was strictly business. Johnny Depp was truly incredible in this film. Overall, I like Depp. I think he is an incredible versatile actor (despite personally rebelling from watching any more Pirates of the Caribbean Films after the second film maybe third). I read somewhere that it took over 20 hours to apply the makeup to make Depp look the ghoulish part of Whitey.In a recent interview, Depp got some flack for "humanizing" Whitey too much while he was trying to prepare for the role. Depp stated that Whitey, had a cold heart, but a caring heart. Some of the victim's surviving family members of the real life mobster were quite incensed. But, should anyone have to humanize anyone else. I'm sure even the world's worst gangsters, dictators, and serial killers had fears, loves, dreams, and they wet the bed when they were little. People are human (full stop). Even gangsters. What lead to the creation of such a heinous murderer, which was Whitey Bulger? Who knows.I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes (which I used in my second feature film), "If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?" &#x2015; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping Story Anchored by Brilliant Performances From Depp and Edgerton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass tells the true tale of James "Whitey" Bulger's rise and fall with his gang in the streets of South Boston. In a war for territory, Bulger (Johnny Depp) and FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) create an unlikely alliance to take down an opposing Mafia family. As the story unfolds, each side is tested in how far they are willing to go to keep their relationship with one another.Director Scott Cooper brings out the best in all of his actors and perfectly captures not only the cold blooded essence of Bulger, but also the feeling of dread in South Boston during the time. The biggest selling points for this movie are actors Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, whose performance should easily be deserving of an Academy Award. However, others like Jesse Plemmons, Dakota Johnson, and Benedict Cumberbatch, while underused, manage to make the most of the time given to them.At roughly 2 hours, Black Mass does not overstay its welcome, in fact I believe it could have been longer and gone even more in depth as to the inner-workings of Jimmy Bulger's mob. From a technical standpoint, the movie was terrific as well. The cinematography was enthralling, the score enhanced the emotion of every scene, the editing was serviceable, but didn't detract from the movie in any way. The last part I will mention is possibly on par with the performances, the script. It was magnetic, and beautifully highlighted every aspect of every character. The greatest comparison I can make of this move is that of last year's Foxcatcher, brilliantly performed, moving at a deliberate pace, and with horribly detached, yet irresistibly engaging characters. Overall, while it doesn't reinvent the mob picture like Goodfellas, (nor does it try to) Black Mass is an incredibly solid and flawlessly acted portrayal of one of the United States' most notorious gangsters in history."It's not about what you do, it's about where you do it and when."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic gangster movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a true story of one of the most notorious criminals who operated in South Boston, James 'Whitey' Bulger(Johnny Depp). FBI agent John Conolly(Joel Edgerton), is given a job to take down the Mafia. John Connolly grew up with Whitey Bulger &amp; his brother Billy Bulger(Benedict Cumberbatch), who happens to be a state senator. Agent Connolly thinks it's a good idea to take Whitey Bulger's help, to eradicate the other criminal organizations in Southie(as South Boston is fondly called). His FBI boss, Charles McGuire(Kevin Bacon) &amp; colleagues, FBI Agent Robert Fitzpatrick(Adam Scott) &amp; John Morris(David Harbour) reluctantly agree. However, Whitey Bulger takes advantage of being an FBI informant &amp; soon rises to the top of the Southie crime scene by doing whatever he wants, legal or not. Black Mass is a flawless film. It's fascinating &amp; terrifying at the same time that, such an unhinged criminal ruled the streets of South Boston for years. The movie, more or less accurately depicts all that happened on the streets of South Boston in the '70s &amp; early '80s. People who are squeamish about excessive violence &amp; gore should not watch this movie. However, for everyone else this film should be a blast! There is not a single dull moment in the film. The script based on the book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob is incredibly gripping &amp; will keep you on the edge of your seat. Scott Cooper has done a masterful job, directing the movie. Despite everything, the reason Black Mass is a masterpiece, is because of the performances. Johnny Depp steals the show in every scene he's in, as James 'Whitey' Bulger. With heavy prosthetic make up, piercing blue contact lenses &amp; a receding hairline, Depp is almost unrecognizable as Whitey Bulger. Depp transforms from a man who loves his mother, brother, wife &amp; son to a ruthless psycho criminal in seconds, with absolutely no effort. The special effects &amp; make up department have done a good job in making Depp look just like the real James 'Whitey' Bulger. At the end of the day despite great make up, acting gets noticed &amp; Johnny Depp does not disappoint. Depp portrays the various emotions of Whitey Bulger with expertise &amp; panache. Johnny Depp is back &amp; deserves all the award nominations he's going to get for his role. Joel Edgerton is spectacular as John Connolly. Edgerton continues on a winning streak after The Gift(2015), which he directed, wrote &amp; starred in. He is a force to be reckoned with. Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant as Billy Bulger. Cumberbatch superbly recreates a Boston accent. Kevin Bacon is great as Charles McGuire. Jesse Plemons is good as Kevin Weeks. Peter Sarsgaard is awesome as Brian Halloran. Dakota Johnson is impressive as Lindsey Cyr. Corey Stoll is amazing as Fred Wyshak. Adam Scott &amp; David Harbour are effective as FBI Agent Robert Fitzpatrick &amp; John Morris respectively. Julianne Nicholson &amp; Juno Temple are awesome as Marianne Connolly &amp; Deborah Hussey respectively. Rory Cochrane &amp; W. Earl Brown are effective as Steve Flemmi &amp; John Martorano respectively. Mary Clug &amp; Luke Ryan are adorable as Mom Bulger &amp; Douglas Cyr respectively. Black Mass is a must watch, especially for fans of gangster movies &amp; Johnny Depp.</fullReview>

His mining of the underbelly of depravity and corruption, that was crime boss Bulger's very existence, shows his undeniable mastery of portraying the darker side of life. The movie, as a whole, is well structured and totally engrossing. The persona of Bulger well played as cold and calculating, a beast of prey... bone chilling. Depp's performance in "Black Mass" fully deserves accolades reserved for the greats of the motion picture industry. Perhaps, from this point on, J.

		<shortDescription>"Black Mass" Reminds Us Why Depp, Cumberbatch Are So Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* SPOILERS *I saw "Black Mass" yesterday at a matinée, with no expectations, even though there is some buzz about the film. I wanted to see from an unbiased perspective if Depp still had the brilliance he'd displayed in the early part of his career with films like "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", "Ed Wood", and of course, "Edward Scissorhands". I was curious if his tent pole films ("Pirates of the Caribbean") had made him lazy and cynical. The first thing I noticed was his hair (obviously), so turning the heart throb into an older, hardened criminal was completed. But what I then noticed was the subtle way they introduced his predator blue eyes. And as the film ran, his eyes became more and more evil - it was a great makeup job, and the way Depp used them to great affect was chilling.Another interesting thing about the film is the way they presented Jimmie Bulger at first as a sort of reformed criminal, having "done a dime at Alcatraz", and ever the Irish Catholic altar boy, looking after the elderly ladies, with whom he had a fondness for. Seeing him dote on his young son, you could feel his pain after his son's passing, where you almost feel sorry for the guy. But his anger and blood lust just keep on escalating, empowered by his cohorts and FBI friend, and as you watch him strangle the niece of one of his crew, any empathy you had for the man is rapidly torn away. He is an animal, predator, socio- ("or is it psycho-") path, murderer. So Depp indeed does show why he deserves his fame - and a good part of the reason is usually due to the director, as his recent performances have shown that a great actor is only as good as his director (what was Wally Pfister thinking in "Transcendence"?), so part of Depp's success in "Black Mass" must be credited to Justin Kurzel. Likewise, Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billie is barely recognizable, and holds to his reputation as one of the finest actors in the current era. The rest of the team is solid, if under-exposed - there are some excellent performances, notable Joel Edgerton as FBI mole John Connolly, and Julianne Nicholson as Connolly's stolid wife. The production design, sound, and other film technicals are ably handled, giving that cold, hard "Southy" Boston atmosphere. This was an excellent film, and held my interest throughout. And while the story was fascinating, Depp really shines, giving one of, if not the, the best performances of his career. And though not a lead role, Cumberbatch also really shines (let's face it, he always does..), as does Edgerton. If you are a fan of film, you must see "Black Mass".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An awesome take on a real life story of a Gangster. Really good direction. Johnny Depp has nailed it. Such intense acting should fetch him an Oscar! He can be scary and funny at the same time. Hats off to him. All other characters have promptly played the roles and have done justice to their roles. It's a must watch.After a three-year streak of box office flops and self-parodic performances, it is wonderful to see Depp return to the top of his game, even if this dramatic vehicle he performs so well in goes down many familiar and uninspired roads. "Black Mass" is most certainly Depp's film from start to finish. There is not a single second of his screen time where anyone in the audience will be able to resist his magnetic gaze. To see Depp restrain himself is also something of a miracle, since the man has played quirky characters a bit too often, thanks to his success as Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance as Whitey Bulger may not be as memorable as some of his earlier work, but it is without a doubt, one of his best to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really well-done movie! The cinematography is real eye-candy for the whole pic. And Johnny Depp and cast all do a fine job.If only there was more story to go with. Right from the opening scene you know pretty much what's going to happen, and you'll be right. There's no surprises, no plot twists, and not even much in the way of new information throughout the whole film.Whitey Bulger is a really bad guy and he has some really bad friends as well. There's lots of typical gangland violence, lots of ratting out one's buddies, plea bargaining, and psychopathic personalities and "Goodfellas" ripoffs, and only about 20 minutes or so of actual story to tell.Not awful, just not a lot there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black Mass is the best kind of biopic. One that tells a very specific story. It doesn't just exist in order to tell about a person for the mere sake of retelling their life story. We've all seen those before. At the end, you say to yourself that you feel like you know the person, but you're not really sure why you needed to learn about arbitrary snippets from their life.This film is about Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), a Boston crime lord, whom you can assume had some acquired some fairly heady anecdotes over the course of his reign. But Black Mass doesn't just start from his childhood. It focuses mainly on the latter half of his life--after he was already established as a feared man in the city of Boston. The film details how he becomes an FBI informant who helps end the Mafia invasion in his territory of rule. But it never really paints him as a saint. In fact, it shows him more as the villain he is. One who is ruthless and merciless and only cares about his own power. Towards the beginning, before a series of events happen that takes away most of the people he cares about, we see flickers of a loving person. It's after that when he becomes a monster.There is a secondary lead, John Connelly (Joel Edgerton), who works for the FBI but also grew up with Bulger. He has always been enamored with the criminal and secretly wants to be like him. He is in denial. Things start to change in his life when the FBI becomes fed up with Connelly always creating excuses for Bulger--a trend that may prove to work against him rather than for him.But Black Mass never chooses a protagonist for us. We root for certain characters, but then realize that they all may very well have faults of their own that make them unrootable.Depp is seriously phenomenal in his portrayal of Bulger. It may very well be his best performance in years, maybe ever. You forget it's him because it is so far gone from the typical roles that he takes on.The film is gripping from beginning to end. It proves how there are different levels of nefariousness and depicts Bulger's second tier of villain perfectly.Twizard Rating: 96</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp is electrifying as famed crime boss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic. Johnny Depp is absolutely at his best as Boston crime figure James "Whitie" Bulger. Depp is smoldering, menacing and terrifying. Bulger terrified his enemies as well as his friends. Hell, sit in the audience terrified. For about a dozen years, the only person the FBI wanted more was Osama bin Laden. This movie progresses through flashbacks of narration from Bulger's former associates, who have already served their time and in witness protection. BLACK MASS is based on true facts that transpired in the 1970's and '80s. Bulger on the rise as crime boss of Boston's south side ends up in an unholy alliance with FBI agent John Connolly(Joel Edgerton), who grew up admiring "Whitie" in the old neighborhood. They both wanted to take down the Italian Mafia controlling crime on Boston's north side. Why not feed each other information. Making the whole situation debatable...was Bulger an FBI informant or not? William Bulger(Benedict Cumberbatch), is a state senator that manages to keep his hands clean of most doings past and present in the old neighborhood. John Martorano(W. Earl Brown)was a go to man, when things had to be taken care of...you know what I mean. Then of course, there were times when it was some "hands on" by "Whitey". A pressuring FBI boss Charles McQuire(Kevin Bacon) becomes suspicious of Connolly's work...and soon dominoes begin to fall. Out comes deeply buried information concerning racketeering, drug dealing and murder, many murders. James Bulger goes on the run hiding in plain sight.Brutal violence and thick vulgar language throughout. This true biopic is held together with a super soundtrack featuring the likes of: The Animals, The Allman Brothers Band, Fleetwood Mac, Joe Walsh, Blondie, and The Rolling Stones.The powerful cast also includes: Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, Dakota Johnson, Julianne Nicholson, Peter Sarsgaard and Juno Temple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: A standard gangster film that goes above the standard due to a star performance and some fine filmmaking.GRADE: B+In Black Mass, Scott Cooper's chilling biography of psychotic killer, James "Whitey" Bulger, we follow a bloody trail of gruesome murders and assorted mayhem on the road to his notoriety. The film chronicles Burger's life and killing sprees, from his beginnings as a small-time thug in South Boston to becoming a dangerous mob leader and F.B.I. informant. Johnny Depp plays this central role and he is brilliant (but more on that later) and the film's other cast members are just terrific too.&#xfffc;Crime may not pay, but it sure earned Burger a nice living, before being apprehended after 30+ years of being a career criminal, even using the F.B.I. to help his meteoric rise to the Most Wanted list. The screenplay by Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk is so well written and researched. Their script focuses on the personal side of Bulger, with his Irish family ties, particularly his close relationship with his Senator brother (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his childhood friendship with F.B.I. agent, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). It also solidly interweaves his business dealings with other partners-in-crime. Dialog has a natural rhythm and all of the characters, both major and minor, are fully developed. &#xfffc;The director creates a realistic world of criminals and lowlifes. Although the story has a been-there-done-that feel and is too derivative of other gangster films, Cooper's vision is fresh and detail-oriented. Scenes bristle with tension and shocking violence, some merely suggested off-camera; others shown in grisly close-ups. (Be forewarned: The film is extremely gruesome.) He has assembled a top-notch ensemble that inhabit these indelible characters in many memorable moments. &#xfffc;This is, by far, one of the year's best acted films of the year. Delivering a break-out performance is the aforementioned Mr. Edgerton as the ambitious and easily corrupted agent and friend, hell-bent on making a professional career at the bureau and using Bulger as any means to accomplish that goal. Benedict Cumberbatch as Burger's loving brother shows his character's range of compassion in his few short scenes. Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, and Peter Saragaard as Bulger's cronies are excellent. Giving strong support in smaller roles are Dakota Johnson as Bulger's girlfriend, Juno Temple as an unfortunate prostitute, Kevin Bacon, Corey Stoll, Adam Scott, and David Harbour as F.B.I. agents, the latter encapsulates a good man caught in the web of corruption. Julianne Nicholson is superb as Connolly's wife, whose uncomfortable and noticeable dislike for Bulger leads to a confrontation scene with Depp that is totally mesmerizing.&#xfffc;But it is Mr. Depp who is a marvel of nuanced acting, so unlike his work in these past years. (One forgets his keen ability and talent as an actor with such debacles as The Lone Ranger, Into the Woods, Transcendence, Dark Shadows, The Tourist, so fresh in one's mind...need I go on.) In this film, his portrayal is more than a mere physical transformation with Depp's icy-blue eyes (contacts) matching his ice-cold bloodlessness. (If the eyes are the window to the soul, this ultimately leads to a man devoid of any humanity.) The actor's mannerisms, posturing, and unflinching stares communicate more than his character's hollow and insincere words. He oozes a creepiness with his balding skeletal facial expressions and exudes menace from every pore. His line delivery is deliberately flippant at times, and other times, hesitant with every calculated pause. He plays Bulger as a predator in search of any victim, trusting no one. It's an Oscar worthy performance.&#xfffc;Black Mass also has wonderful production values. The make-up and prosthetic work on Mr. Depp makes the actor unrecognizable, and while he does not truly resemble the real criminal, he makes this character a terrifying and totally riveting monster. The atmospheric cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi's and concise editing by David Rosenbloom make the film more compelling than most from this genre. There is fine period art direction and costumes by Jeremy Woodward and Kasia Walicka-Maimone, respectively. And Junkie XL's musical score heightens the suspense quite effectively.&#xfffc;Despite its conventional narrative structure, Black Mass is one of the best films of the year. Cooper and Depp bring new blood to the old aging gangster genre, even if the blood flows in buckets.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie about south Boston's Irish mob. Scott Cooper (director) was able to produce the grit and raw aggressiveness of South Boston with Black Mass's characters. The introduction of the bar bouncer's scene's dialogue and raw violence creates pace/feel for the entire film. I felt a cold chill from the beginning. Depp portrays a cold and harden criminal to perfection. F B I agent Joel Edgerton Depp's partner walks, acts, feels, like a jaded agent in it for himself. Edgerton should be nominated for best supporting actor. Black Mass's story about an unholy alliance between F B I (Edgerton) and the Irish mob (Depp) where an informant gives information for free rain while eliminating the criminal competition. Hence, the unholy alliance is a black mass which creates the story's title. A chilling true story, One could not make up such fiction. Proof real life is better than fiction. Nine out of ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film chronicles the rise and fall of notorious gangster James Whitey Bulger(Johnny Depp) and his Winter Hill Gang. Who in the mid 1970's became an FBI informant by agent John Connolly(Joel Edgerton) who is a childhood friend. Not to mention his politician brother Billy Bulger(Benedict Cumberbatch) who loves his brother, but chooses not to get involved in his activities.This was a very suspenseful film, it really pulls out all the stops of a true gangster film. Everybody delivers in there performances, Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon, and Benedict Cumberbatch. But it's Johnny Depp has Whitey Bulger that really takes the film, I mean he really knocks it out the park. Depp is so frightening, you'll be grabbing your seat in terror every time he's on the screen, cause you'll feel like somethings going down. I liked the 70's and 80's look also. I hope Depp will be nominated for a Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BLACK MASS - "Don't read everything it says in the papers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Told through the right hand men of FBI's Most Wanted for 12 years, only being second to Osama Bin Laden and with a capture reward that is as high as it gets. Director Scott Cooper's (Out of the Furnace + Crazy Heart) crime-drama biopic tells the story about three boys of the streets of South Boston that grow up to become the main men that changed the landscape of the city forever. In particular one person, the man that became the most notorious gangster in Americas history, James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp). The ice-cold ruthless killer that led the Irish Mob from South Boston known as "Southie" develops from a small time crook to become the true Kingpin of Boston while his brother William "Billy Boy" Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) becomes the other most powerful person of the city as State Senator. John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returns in 1981 to Boston as the top FBI agent with a mission to bring down the Cosa Nostra led by the Italian Mafia brothers Angiulo in Boston's North End. Allying with the boy that once saved him out of a fight during their childhood years, and helping his brother Billy run for office years later, while staying loyal to the law of the streets built on trust honor and blood, his respect towards the brothers together with their bond from their younger years creates an unbreakable pack. As Whitey tells it, " We will get the FBI to fight our wars!".After Whitey's son dies in 1982 and his mother in 1985 he truly looses it all and with nothing else to cherish apart from his crime syndicate he becomes the true drug lord of Boston and his alliance with the FBI makes him untouchable. The Irish psychopath was involved in everything from drugs, racketeering, inciting, and killing to joining forces with IRA supporting them in the fight against the English in Northern Ireland. When the real truth gets out exposing how deep and wide spread it was, it all starts spinning out of control and the people involved can't handle the heat when the people high up want answers. To protect themselves they start spilling the beans on everything and everyone. The American government want people held responsible and someone has to pay for it. Can the loyalty towards Whitey and between the three stay true or do they all loose out in the end?"You were just saying? "Just saying" gets people sent away. "Just saying" got me a nine-year stretch in Alcatraz, you understand? So, "just saying" can get you buried real quick."Both Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton do great comebacks with impressive Oscar- nomination performances based on the New York Times Best Seller "Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob" written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. Dakota Johnson returns as Whitey's wife Lindsey Cyr since her latest blockbuster movie Fifty Shades of Grey. Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game), Peter Sarsgaard (Pawn Sacrifice), Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Julianne Nicholson, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott and Corey Stoll also feature.I am no big fan of the praised The Departed which is another story based on Whitey with Jack Nicholson playing the James "Whitey" Bulger character and Leonardo Di Caprio with Matt Damon in the other lead roles. While Black Mass doesn't reach its true potential for me it still delivers a dark and grim true reality completed with good performances by the entire cast. I will definitely be watching this one again though when it is released on Bluray. Black Mass is a great film with some chilling scenes that gets you off your seat, though it lacks the natural flow and speed to hit the status of a true iconic gangster film. Saying that would Martin Scorsese(Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed) have made an even better film out of it?"Don't read everything it says in the papers" ?

		<fullReview>Being from Boston, I am very familiar with Bulger's history and despicable behavior. I thought this movie was less about Bulger and more about Connelly, which wasn't something I anticipated from reading other reviews, seeing the trailers, etc.They did show how vile and scary Bulger is, but parts of the story didn't go into enough depth to capture how truly horrible he was - there wasn't enough character build-up to really care about the victims. Even though they reference in passing the number of murders, and how he pushed drugs on teenagers, they didn't show that impact in the movie. This was the first movie about Bulger that vilified Connelly so much - they did a good job with that. I was distracted by Johnny Depp's hairline and how ugly Jesse Plemons looked - his hair looked like a BAD hairpiece and the dark hair/pale skin/eyebrows gave him a really sickly/bizarre look. He's good at playing bad guys and looked so different than he did in Breaking Bad. The Boston accents were good - which is something that can ruin a movie or TV show for me.Everyone talked about how horribly violent the movie was. Maybe I was prepared for worse, but I didn't think it was as bad as the reviews said. More *sounds* when people were being killed, which made it graphic and uncomfortable, but the visuals weren't as bad as I expected. The whole story is violent and brutal - even though I am saying it was less graphic than I expected, it is not a movie that kids should see, it is disturbing - it is based on a true story, these things really happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knew Johnny Depp had talent, but it had been so long since we had a great performance from him, that I think we all started to wonder if he was ever going to return to form. Well, I think Black Mass can put that to rest. Not only is Depp stellar, but the film is actually really well done. I was really impressed by the entire production of the film and it was such a relief to see that the film was well done after months of hoping.Even though James 'Whitey' Bulger is a real life person, I wasn't too familiar with the story behind his days in South Boston. I had seen what Jack Nicholson had done with his character in The Departed, which is supposedly based on Bulger, but not much else. Depp gives Bulger a less comedic and far more chilling side to him than Nicholson did. I think the more surprising part of the film was the performance of Joel Edgerton as the FBI accomplice, John Connolly, and partner in crime so to speak to Bulger for so many years. That was the part of the story that really grabbed me more than anything else. The relationship of Connolly and Bulger and just how manipulative the one side was to the other. But also that Connolly looked up to Bulger and got caught up in the lifestyle of getting promotions and going to high profile parties that he lost site of what the mission was. But also, that Bulger wasn't portrayed as an all out monster. I like that we get to see that he was a loving father and even family man. He did some awful things but we can't forget the part that some of the FBI played in allowing things to happen the way they did.The rest of the cast also deserves high praise. It was one of the best ensemble pieces this year. Heck, even Dakota Johnson was terrific in her small but pivotal role. But Scott Cooper, the director, may have been the hero here. The tension and pacing rivaled some of Scorsese's best mob films. I won't be surprised if the film is nominated at the Oscars and Depp is nominated as well. It was a really well done quote on quote biopic. Or at least as close as we will get to knowing what the streets of 'Southie' were like. Black Mass is one of the best films to come out in 2015.+Depp is back+Felt like Scorsese+Tension+Ensemble cast8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's okay to look at 'Black Mass' as a distant sequel to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. Both have bad guys, wars, guns, monsters, and Johnny Depp. Maybe I'm reaching a bit there, but it's still fun to think about them as distant cousins in movies. The story of James 'Whitey' Bulger has been told a lot, especially recently. If you're unfamiliar with who Bulger is, he was one of the most vicious and heinous human beings to ever walk the planet. He was even the FBI's Most Wanted man for more than a decade, as he spent most of his time in Boston as a mafia boss who committed murder amongst other things.Not only that, but he was also an FBI informant, who in turn the FBI let him and his henchmen do whatever they wanted on the streets of Boston. It wasn't until only in the past couple of years until Bulger, who was then in his 80s, was caught, tried in court, and sentenced for the rest of his so called life. There was even a fantastic documentary about him, which you can read about HERE, or more famously, the movie 'The Departed', directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio. In that film, Nicholson played a character that was based on Bulger. So you get the general gist of who this guy is.Director Scott Cooper ('Crazy Heart', 'Out of the Furnace') wanted to tell Bulger's story in the form of a feature film that tracked his start as an informant for the FBI and his rise to power as the most vicious kingpin and criminal we the world have seen. Despite an excellent performance by Johnny Depp (perhaps his best in years), 'Black Mass' is slow crawl to the finish line with episodic editing and far too much dialogue versus violent action sequences as the trailer would lead you to believe. Cooper even tried to mold 'Black Mass' as a Scorsese film in having his characters narrate over the film throughout the two hour run time.Even the narration was bland and unmoving. If you're looking for a 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' type of movie here, you won't get it, even though some of the performances from Benedict Cumberbatch (Bulger's senator brother) and Joel Edgerton (the FBI contact for Bulger) are amazing. The film slowly treads along and shows us how Bulger and John Connolly (Edgerton), two childhood friends, who form an alliance between the FBI and mafia in exchange for information to take out other mafia outfits out, notably the Italians, to which Bulger and his crew have free reign to wreak havoc on Boston without getting pinched.And yes, this actually happened in real life. As the film progresses, we see more and more FBI agents and officers asking many questions to why nobody thinks to bring in Bulger himself. Add a semi violent scene in the mix, the mix and repeat with the questions and dialogue for over two hours, and you have yourself 'Black Mass'. I must admit I was pretty excited for this movie, but its slow pace and mediocre violence made me only want to view this once and never again, as 'The Departed' or the Bulger documentary itself is a far better experience than this movie.The only real shining light here is Depp as Bulger. His emotional and physical transformation is nothing short of haunting and frightening. Those steel blue eyes are as cold as an iceberg when he stares at you, and Depp pulls this off very convincingly. There's a great scene at a dinner table where Depp scares the daylights out of you and makes you laugh that infamous nervous laugh, as you never know if he'll snap and viciously kill you. I would not be surprised if Depp received a trophy for his performance here come award season.Yes, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemmons, Corey Stoll, Rory Cochrane, and Peter Sarsgaard are in the movie, but their characters are only given a couple of minutes of screen time, that we never get to spend enough time with them to make anything work or feel any remorse, let alone anger. In the end, I wish 'Black Mass' was better, but at least there are other options in regards to this subject matter to watch.Worth a Look</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved this movie. I was concerned that "Hollywood" might have over- dramatized the events and the people involved, but they did not. After a bit of background checking on my part, I would have to say that if anything, Hollywood likely did not include all the gory details of Jimmy Bulger's life and crime spree !! This is also no "glorification" of any of the events that occurred, just a straight forward detailing of crime and corruption in Boston in the 70's and 80's. Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable - so I suspect Oscar will be looking for him !! Benedict Cumberbatch does a great turn as a Senator and politico. If there is one character in the story I would feel sorry for, it is John Connolly, the FBI agent who uses his old school connections with the Bulgers to feather his own nest !! He should have known that crime doesn't pay, and the bad guys always get caught - maybe not right away - but they always get caught !!</fullReview>

Trust was a major problem with Johnny Depp and dealing with it in this film defiantly grabs the audiences attention.

He has an excellent physique and I don't think he needs to change in too many ways to be good.I think the cast had it together very well.

		<shortDescription>Black Mass is Phenomenal in Every Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting some great things from this movie and did it ever deliver. This movie is excellent in every way I can think of. I literally have no complaints about this movie so this whole thing is just going to be me talking about how much I enjoyed this film. Scott Cooper directed this piece of excellent cinema and I have to say that I'm really starting to respect this guy. Out of the Furnace and Crazy Heart were both favorites of mine when they came out but this movie is probably my favorite of his yet. I'm a little biased though since I love a good gangster flick.The story of this movie centers around the life of James "Whitey" Bulger (Johnny Depp) in the late seventies to the late eighties. There's a lot more to the entire Whitey Bulger story but this movie tells about his relationship with the FBI and his increasingly violent actions after the death of his son. John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) is an up and coming agent in the FBI who has been given an edict to take down the Italian Mafia in Boston. It just so happens that Whitey is trying to protect his own turf from the Mafia so Connolly makes a deal with Bulger to gain information about the Mafia from Bulger in exchange for certain guarantees from the FBI. This turns out to be a somewhat one sided relationship as Whitey works to solidify his own power base and make more money than anyone in his group thought they could ever make. Bulger's reign of terror includes drugs, murder, stealing, and even providing weapons to terrorists, all while using his informant status with the FBI to protect himself.There are a lot of great actors in this movie but let's start with the obvious. Johnny Depp absolutely nails the role of Whitey Bulger. This guy is terrifying, dramatic, and even funny at times. The physical transformation is impressive but I forgot that it was actually Johnny Depp after a while. His interactions and everything just yell that this is not a man to be trusted. It's also nice to see Depp take on a more serious role after some of the goofier movies he's been doing. Don't get me wrong, I love goofy movies but Depp has some real talent but it's usually used on pirate or Burton films and it's just nice to see him take on a more serious role that reminds us just how good Depp really is. I'm also happy to see that Joel Edgerton is once again knocking it out of the park with his portrayal of Connolly. It's a little sad how much this guy is willing to do for Whitey, especially since he's an FBI agent. He has this weird obsession with Bulger and ends up becoming basically an active participant in many of his crimes. He doesn't show up and kill people but the information he provides to Whitey basically makes him an accessory to murder. Edgerton really impressed me earlier this year with The Gift and is quickly becoming one of my new favorite actors.There are so many great actors in this film that I know I'm going to miss a few but I"m going to try to mention the ones that stood out to me. Jesse Plemons is great as Whitey's muscle and enforcer Kevin Weeks and went through quite a bit of a physical transformation himself. He nails the voice and actions perfectly. He's also a Breaking Bad alum which means I'm a bit biased but he really does do a fantastic job. Corey Stoll also gives us a great performance as the stand up Prosecutor Fred Wyshak and it's entertaining to see him put Connolly in his place. Rory Cochrane impressed me with his portrayal of another Bulger enforcer named Steve Flemmi. This guy does some truly horrendous stuff in this film but you get the feeling that he's not happy about what he's doing or what's happening around him. I hate to cut this short since there are so many great performances in this movie but I could probably write one of these on just the actors.Boston is portrayed as being a bleak and dangerous place and it works perfectly for the narrative the film is going for. The area that so many of these characters was raised in helps us to see how they became the way they are. Even the city seems frightening at times. The music is moody and sets the scenes perfectly. There really isn't anything to complain about.In my opinion, this movie is absolutely phenomenal and I can't think of any problems that the film has. If I really sat here and tried to nitpick at it then I might be able to come up with something but the movie is just too good for me to sit here and do that. I have a felling we'll be hearing about this movie again come Oscar season. Please, do yourselves a favor and watch this movie. You definitely won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a string of critical and box office flops such as The Lone Ranger, Transcendence and Mortdecai, Johnny Depp was in need of a box office and critical hit. Some critics are saying that this new film, Black Mass, will be Depp's comeback role and may even net him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, but I think personally that those critics are being too premature. Thankfully for the most part, I tend to choose what I watch very carefully, so I have avoided those three recent Depp features that I mentioned earlier in this review. However, I have found that in the last 15 years or so, that Depp's roles and the movies that he is being offered are not what they used to be. I know that the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are really popular with fans of all ages and just recently I attempted to watch three of the entries in that film series with having the ultimate outcome of me caring very little for it. Some of the visuals and makeup and effects can be neat enough at times, but that is not what I look for in a movie. To me they are just more or less like big budget action films catered to a younger audience that despite whether critics love them, or hate them, they are going to make a lot of money. As for Depp in the films, I feel that his role as Captain Jack Sparrow is essentially a one note performance and while it may have worked in the first Pirates movie, I now think it is getting old and there is really nothing new, or relevant to say about what has become an iconic character, or films. The films themselves are just mediocre and the performance just feels old now because we have seen it so many times now and I feel there is nothing new, or revitalizing that they can now bring to that franchise. Despite my thoughts another film is currently in the works in that series which is slated to be released next year. I also find that other Depp roles recently have gotten too over the top and almost cartoonish in a way and I feel that it certainly hurts the films themselves and makes Depp often seem annoying, or really trying too hard for no reason. I'll list Tim Burton's failed Alice in Wonderland version as an example of this. I particularly liked Johnny Depp in the 90's where he was in a string of really original films, but gave great performances and depth to the characters as well. Think of films like Edward Scissorhands, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Ed Wood, Dead Man and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas just to name a few films from that time period. These films were actually great films and featured great Depp performances in them as well, but sadly it almost seems as if he is getting away from those smaller yet vastly better films. With, Black Mass it is possible that the film could earn Depp an Academy Award nomination, but for myself I would not nominate him personally. While he is good in the role of real life gangster Whitey Bulger, I feel that often the role is downplayed a bit and when Bulger, should be menacing and almost scary he comes off more subdued and even passive and I think the result of a terrifying and intimidating gangster is not really something the film, or the performance managed to pull off. I appreciated that the film showed different aspects of Bulger's character and not just as a violent psychopath, and I often found that some of the more quiet and personal scenes were more effective in both terms of acting and writing. Another thing I found that I think others will too is the fact that Depp's Bulger seems to be more of a supporting character and doesn't really carry the film in any way and is more of a background character. Whether that was intentional, or not I do not know, but the others characters when they were on screen did not seem to have quite as much screen presence and weren't as interesting to watch. I actually found the best performances in the film to be small supporting performances from typically great performers such as Juno Temple, Peter Sarsgaard and Dakota Johnson. Their roles are quite strong, but I feel are some of the best in the film and I almost wished they could have been in the film longer than they actually were because they were omitting off great performances and because of that they were fascinating to watch and added more to the film that sadly for the rest of it was missing. Black Mass, is not a bad film, but neither is it the great masterpiece I think a lot of people were hoping for. It is just simply an average film in pretty much every way except for a few bright performances which I mentioned above and also some of the cinematography was quite good at times as well. I think another thing that holds this film back is it really doesn't bring anything new to the screen. We have seen these type of mob films before and much better ones, so unfortunately there is nothing to distinguish this one apart from the countless others that have come out before it. It is a film that I think because it plays out like something you have seen before and also because it adds nothing new to the table that after it leaves theatres it will be a film you will see on television now and again, but will quickly be forgotten by a lot of people because there is just nothing really memorable about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A game of "cops and robbers" taken far beyond the playground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scott Cooper's "Black Mass" features arguably the best ensemble cast of the year, with Johnny Depp at the helm in perhaps his best, most convincing performance of the last decade. Following a string of financial failures and lackluster projects, particularly this year's "Mortdecai," where I proclaimed in my review that if this didn't kill Depp's assortment of eclectic projects, nothing would, Depp, like always, changes costumes and throws himself into yet another role. His performance as the notorious James "Whitey" Bulger should go down as one of the year's most haunting.In "Black Mass," Bulger is a cackling, dead-eyed, ruthless killer, bound to pull the trigger or get one of his goons to do so at the slightest sign of disloyalty in his inner-circle of equally heartless men. He often sits in stone-cold silence, and when he chooses to speak, he never misses a beat, stammers, or retracts on his statements; he's too assured and confident for that. He knows when to talk, he knows how to cover things up, and he knows exactly how to manipulate and stay in control.This is undoubtedly why he rose to prominence and became the leader of organized crime in South Boston. The brother of Massachusetts Senator Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), Bulger keeps his brother from having the state government infiltrate and corrupt his turf, in addition to being an FBI informant to help take down rival Mafia families. He provides tips and kickbacks to FBI Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a lifelong friend of Whitey and Billy's, who shares the same concepts of loyalty that Whitey does. With two divisions that could potentially send his Winter Hill Gang to jail taken care of, Whitey's biggest concern now is managing his team and making sure members of other Mafia families do not attempt to overthrow his power.In the background are people like Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Connolly's boss, who is dumbfounded as to why, despite all the effort and work Connolly has put into Bulger, he can't bring him down, Robert Fitzpatrick (Adam Scott), another coworker of Connolly's, Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), Whitey's right-hand man who usually has a rifle in his hand, Deborah Hussey (Juno Temple), a young prostitute who gets caught up in Stephen and Whitey's business, and Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), a young man who is taken under the wing of Whitey for his diligence and level-headed attitude, and whom eventually came through to the FBI to help bust Whitey in 2011.Many crime-dramas feel like vignettes of violence, drinking, negotiating, and cursing, and "Black Mass"'s pacing is a bit more evident of its looseness than other slickly edited pictures of the genre ("Casino" comes to mind, for one). However, the acting here is a powerhouse display of natural talent on everybody's part, even the lesser players like Scott and Temple, who are almost guaranteed to get minimal to no recognition.Edgerton's constant balance of working to assist his force and remain loyal to his lifelong pal is one that is shown through his character's high stress levels and constant workaholic nature, an acting challenge he handles beautifully by conveying just what his character feels smothered by. Cumberbatch, while a lesser pawn in this film, no doubt, is another incredibly watchable presence here, who is simply trying to do his job whilst ignoring the brazen criminal activity of his brother. Other supporting players, like Cochrane and Plemons, do a great job at just being very natural and human, thanks to Cooper's observant direction, which I'll get back to, and, finally, there's Kevin Bacon, who talks like a Southie victim to a year's worth of nasal congestion. A gripping performance from Kevin Bacon is hard to come by in this day and age, but he nails his character's attributes all the way through, by sometimes being as argumentative and dictative as the mob bosses he's going after.Moreover, while much of this acting comes together because of the actors' natural strengths, the film also works because Cooper (who directed 2013's tragically underrated "Out of the Furnace") knows how to handle over a dozen different talents at once, and how to showcase them. He takes the inhuman and makes them human, with lingering shots of facial expressions, particularly eyes (consider a key scene that focuses on Cochrane after an almost inevitable, but guilt-ridden death), and careful, mannered movements of his characters. Partly why I feel Depp shines so much in this film is because Cooper knows what to focus on with him when it comes to showing off his skills as an actor, and with that, "Black Mass" becomes an observant film of human sensibilities."Black Mass" is a great way to kick off awards season, and its ensemble cast, all of whom at different points in their career, makes the film hold a variety of appeal. Its pacing and structure may be a little loose, but its loose ends are largely held together by the powerhouse display of directorial and acting talent on display at all times here. We're lucky to get one good crime drama a year, and this year, we're very lucky to have gotten "Black Mass."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Mass was purely amazing and a EPIC return for johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scott Cooper direction is truly amazing. the pace of this film is excellent and truly unbelievably beautiful. the cinematography is great along with the acting. Johnny Depp kills it in this movie and shockingly disappears into the role, He's fully convincing and frightening. Joel along with Benedict, Kevin, Jesse and even Dakota were fantastic and emotionally great. the Boston accent were on spot and the score by Junkie XL is beautiful and epic, definitely tied up with his other score for mad max fury road. hopefully this film gets nominated for many Oscars especially Best Actor for Depp and Best Supporting Actor for Joel. this movie will have you to the edge of your seats and completely blown by the performances and direction of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and to the point biopic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film follows the book to a T. Not sure why anyone would rate this film under 8 points because it was so well acted you felt actually there. For those with expectations of a high end shoot out and police chase movie, it's not for you. The best part is how excellent all of the actors executed their parts. There was never an embellished moment nor any signs of over acting. The females. Mostly wives and girlfriends played their historical parts perfectly and my hats off to them as well as the poor ladies who had to endure Whiteys wrath for real.This film pulled no punches and was chronologically accurate, and to some this might feel that the script might of been unbalanced and not saturated enough.... Well too bad. Depp, beyond brilliant!!! Academy Award for sure</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chilling Mob Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black Mass is a completely enthralling biopic about one of the most violent mobsters in Boston history, but even more impressively represents a return to form for Johnny Depp. This film hinges on Depp's performance, if he's not good the film would come across as slow, but even when the film slows down Depp's chilling performance as Whitey Bulger keeps you interested. The film had to compete with the fact that the man James "Whitey" Bulger was a heavy inspiration for Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's "The Departed", however the film did a good job looking at the character in a different angle. Many of the other characters lack development, and the story wears thin at times, but for the most part the film is well constructed, and even better executed. Depps performance, the beautiful cinematography, dark humor, and the perfectly dark tone make Black Mass a really solid Mob drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mob Film We've All Been Waiting For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1970s Boston, FBI Agent John Connolly persuades Irish mobster James "Whitey" Bulger to collaborate with the FBI and eliminate a common enemy: the Italian mob. BLACK MASS tells the story of this unholy alliance, which spiraled out of control, allowing Whitey to become one of the most ruthless gangsters in U.S. history.Directing can be thought of like this: give a person various ammunition and gunpowder, and see how big of a bang he or she can make. And there's no doubt that the greatest weapon in director Scott Cooper's arsenal is Johnny Depp. His performance as infamous Boston gangster James "Whitey" Bulger is mesmerizingly haunting. With piercing blue eyes and an apt demonic appearance, the make-up team's magnificent work allowed for Depp to walk in and completely knock it out of the park. To those who're charging down the streets at 15 miles an hour, screaming, "Johnny Depp is back!" at the top of their lungs, I would ask: did he ever really leave? Or has he been here all along, tainted by the less-than-decent films he's appeared in? I'd put my money on the latter because, even with his most atrocious movies, he always loses himself in his characters. And that's what acting is all about.If there's anyone that can rival Depp's work here it would have to be Joel Edgerton, who actually ends up stealing the spotlight more than a few times and downright nailing it throughout. His character, placed at the center of the plot, is about as sympathetic as a corrupt FBI agent could possibly be, in a movie filled with unlikable characters. However, Depp and Edgerton aren't the only selling points here; Cooper is a filmmaker who's capable of working exceptionally well with ensembles. And with a cast as impressive as this: Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Corey Stoll just to name a few, it's hard to pinpoint a single weak link. This is the mob movie that fans of the genre have been waiting forever for; it is brutal, refreshing, and impossible to look away from. The story, however, is quite dense, and the occasional pacing issues didn't help. But the performances are what make it digestible, and what, ultimately, makes BLACK MASS one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating but screenplay is a bit unbalanced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fascinating true story about Irish gangster Whitey Bulger who is the brother of MA State Senator. Whitey becomes informant to the FBI to help take down the Mafia. In return they turn a blind eye to his shady dealings. The story requires some concentration as there are a lot of characters. The good point is that it's not too jumbled up. It's clear about the 'deal' and the character's motives and the gradual corruption of FBI agent John Connolly Whitey's childhood friend. The screenplay is a bit repetitive about these points and could have spent a little time on his early years and later fugitive years. Not enough of his personal life is shown as well. The focus is too much on the rub outs and the agents. There are several brutal killings but it's not too graphic by today's standards.The cast is stellar. Johnny Depp though not very Irish looking is quite convincingly made up and sinister with less hair and bad teeth. He is effective without overacting. Benedict Cumberbatch is a strange choice to play the senator brother, not looking like Depp at all and coming across quite British and reserved. Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons convincingly plays Whitey's sidekick Kevin Weeks. Joel Edgerton is well cast as the FBI childhood friend of Whitey. Corey Stoll has a small but effective role as a good guy who comes in to clean up things. Peter Sarsgaard is suitably druggie as the drug snorting associate. Dakota Johnson as the baby mama is surprisingly effective. More of Whitey's personal relationships could have been shown.Worth a watch for the fascinating true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great dark story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Black mass by no means is an action packed, shoot em up movie from start to finish but has a great dark story about James "Whitey" Bulgar and his vicious winter hill gang. It's closer to Goodfellas than anything which is obviously a good thing since Goodfellas is one of the best gangster movies of all time. The main attraction, Johnny Depp, is at his best with an unrecognizable performance. This movie has everybody in it from Kevin Bacon to Benidict Cumberbatch. With so many excellent performances it ties the movie together in a perfect way. Several candidates for best supporting actor in this movie. It's a must see for anyone looking for an intense grisly story.</fullReview>
