		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frederico Fellini's masterwork 8 ? is difficult to approach largely because of its reputation. Many critics also state that the film is so complex that it requires multiple viewings to understand, and this is likely to intimidate many viewers. But in truth, and in spite of its surrealistic flourishes, 8 ? is more straight-forward than its reputation might lead you to believe.The storyline itself is very simple. A famous director is preparing a new film, but finds himself suffering from creative block: he is obsessed by, loves, and feels unending frustration with both art and women, and his attention and ambition flies in so many different directions that he is suddenly incapable of focusing on one possibility lest he negate all others. With deadlines approaching the cast and crew descend upon him demanding information about the film--information that the director does not have because he finds himself incapable of making an artistic choice.What makes the film interesting is the way in which Fellini ultimately transforms the film as a whole into a commentary on the nature of creativity, art, mid-life crisis, and the battle of the sexes. Throughout the film, the director dreams dreams, has fantasies, and recalls his childhood--and this internal life is presented on the screen with the same sense of reality as reality itself. The staging of the various shots is unique; one is seldom aware that the characters have slipped into a dream, fantasy, or memory until one is well into the scene, and as the film progresses the lines between external life and internal thought become increasingly blurred, with Fellini giving as much (if not more) importance to fantasy as to fact.The performances and the cinematography are key to the film's success. Even when the film becomes surrealistic, fantastic, the actors perform very realistically and the cinematography presents the scene in keeping with what we understand to be the reality of the characters lives and relationships. At the same time, however, the film has a remarkably poetic quality, a visual fluidity and beauty that transforms even the most ordinary events into something slightly tinged by a dream-like quality. Marcello Mastroianni offers a his greatest performance here, a delicate mixture of desperation and ennui, and he is exceptionally well supported by a cast that includes Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee, and a host of other notables.I would encourage people not to be intimidated by the film's reputation, for its content can be quickly grasped. When critics state the film requires repeated viewing what they actually seem to mean is that the film holds up extremely well to repeated viewing; each time it is seen, one finds more and more to enjoy and to contemplate. Even so, I would be amiss if I did not point out that people who prefer a cinema of tidy plot lines and who dislike ambiguity or the necessity of interpreting content will probably dislike 8 ? a great deal. For all others: strongly, strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating and inspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellini's 8 1/2 opens with a stunning dream sequence in which a man is trapped in his car in the middle of a traffic jam. The doors and windows are locked and there is no escape. Other drivers simply sit and stare at him passively. The driver starts to panic as smoke begins to build up within the car. Propelling himself outside a window, he floats over the other cars and soars above the world until he is pulled down a rope attached to a tether on his ankle. The driver is Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), a film director at odds with himself. Shot in black and white, 8 1/2 is an exhilarating, confusing, irritating, and inspired journey into a man's consciousness. It is not just a look at the inner turmoil of one person, but also a commentary on each person's struggle to make sense of their life. The film's combination of kaleidoscopic images, evocative score by Nino Rota, and amazing performances ensure its place as one of the greatest films of the century.Guido is preparing to shoot a new film with an expensive budget. He constructs a huge spaceship launch pad that costs $80 million but he is unsure of what he wants to say. Guido's dishonesty in dealing with his marriage, his career, and the fact that he really does not want to make the film forces him to falsely mislead people as to his true intentions. He feels like a failure and is physically spent. He checks into a spa to restore his health and well being but the contingent of producers, actors, writers, and hangers on undermine his strength. His feeling of being overwhelmed by personal and professional obligations provides the catalyst for dreams and fantasies that take him back to his childhood.Fellini shows his encounter with the prostitute Saraghina (Eddra Gale) and the guilt he has to deal with in a confrontation with the Catholic Church. Guido invites his intellectual wife Luisa (Anouk Aimée) to the set but their relationship has turned cold and passionless, and sparks fly when she has to confront Carla (Sandra Milo), his buxom mistress. Guido is misguided but he has an innocence and charm that allows us to overlook his indulgences. He enjoys his pleasures but has a conscience and feels guilty about cheating on Luisa whom he loves and is afraid of losing. He fantasizes that all of the women in his life are together in a harem where they all dote on his every whim. When they finally recognize how little he cares about them, he is forced to suppress their revolt. As image piles on image and the fantasy becomes indistinguishable from the reality, the viewer may get lost in a maze of dazzling incoherence. Fellini, however, always returns to solid ground and the film offers not only a satire on the frenzy, the uncertainty, and the clash of egos involved with making a film but also a serious commentary on the importance of honesty in a relationship. If 8 1/2 is occasionally exhausting, the ending is invigorating, letting us know that life is a game in which each of us is on the stage performing our roles and the only sane response to its turmoil is to join hands in love and celebrate the moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8?: An Inner-Space Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(excuse me for my bad English)Thoughts on Fellini's carrier can be divided on people who think his peak was early neorealist phase (Vitelloni, La Strada, Nights of Cabiria) (do you remember the guy in the line from Woody Allen's Annie Hall?) and on the ones that praised his fantasy phase starting with La Dolce Vita and followed by 8 1/2, Roma etc.They are both wrong. Both periods and its films are very important, cinematically rich and skillful in directing. The fact that there are many followers of both periods and equal artistic success shows that the only real difference is among their aesthetics. And isn't that what makes a great director?This film is considered one of the best movies of all time among critics and directors. Many people have complaints of how this movie is difficult to understand. It is. When I first saw it, it was a rather very frustrating experience. But once you capture it fully its amazing. In fact, I fully captured it after the third viewing (and after that, every time I see it I can find something new or different). That's because this movie works differently. It works out of standard movie patterns and conventions we use to see in everyday cinema. Above, and most important of all, it speaks with the different movie language. And that is a real cinematic language, because 8 1/2 uses specific movie instruments to transmit it's content. It cannot be transferred in any other form, including literal. That's why it is so hard to put the plot into the words and that's the major merit of this film.After the tremendous commercial and artistic success in 1960. with his previous film La Dolce Vita, Fellini decided to make a film (8 1/2) about the movie director (played by Marcello Mastroianni as Guido) fresh from recent success who is not sure what to film next! And this egocentric director, under the pressure of his producer, actors, friends, fans and journalists, is escaping into the memories of his childhood, wishful fantasies and dreams. At the beginning of the film, there's a stunning famous dream sequence. Guido is trapped in a traffic jam. He loses his breath while unsuccessfully trying to escape from his car. People around (in their vehicles) are starring at him. The whole scene is mute (except the constant monotonous sound) and, from time to time, it freezes. Suddenly, he is free, and flying towards sky. Then, one of his assistants pulls him down to earth. And, he is awake. I think it's unnecessary to explain the meaning of this brilliant scene.There is also a scene where he is persuaded to ask a catholic priest for an advice about the content of his next film (since his films are widely released there is a moral issue). But he apparently has an aversion towards Church. And then, during a conversation with this priest, Guido suddenly associates his early childhood event (watching a dance of a prostitute Saraghina, and the subsequent punishment by one priest). So, the current event forces its cause to come out of his subconsciousness.Then, there is a scene ? quarrel between Guido and his wife (played by Anuk Aimee) while sitting outdoors. She is complaining about his mistress(es) and he is denying everything. Then, his mistress (Sandra Milo) suddenly arrives and, after she saw Guido with his wife, sits to one table not so close. Guido's wife noticed that and realized that woman is his mistress. So, she is continuing her quarrel with him. And then comes one of the most visceral and fascinating scenes in the Movie History. Suddenly, wishful fantasy starts? Guido's wife stands up, coming towards mistress. They are kissing each other like longtime friends and making a nice conversation. Then, Guido enters his house from the childhood (which is shown before) with some presents in his hands. And, there are like 20 women around him fighting for his attention. He is whipping them (dominate them). And there is his wife ? peaceful, calm, conservative, loving? So, under the pressure of all-around-him messes he is fantasying. This is psychologically known as the regression to the pleasure principle and is very common. This scene is known as "The Harem Scene" and like others is followed by brilliant, very suitable music score.From time to time, Guido is fantasying a beautiful young woman (Claudia Cardinale). She is another projection of his narcissism ? an ideal woman to please all of his wishes not making a single complaint.Rosella represents (symbolizes) his super-ego. Pay attention to their phone conversation. Also in Harem scene (harem is actually his Id, fulfilling all his infantile fantasies) she is ABOVE him making complaints.His producer is "paternal figure". All his father's wishes, demands to Guido are now "reactivated" with producer. Pay attention to very interesting first "fantasy" scene in the movie (on the grave). Father asks a man something like:" How is my boy doing"? and the man makes face like: "Well...". Later we discover that the man is his producer.Guido's wife and his mother, the same thing. And we discover this in the same scene when his mother turns into his wife.Critical writer may represent his raw intellect but also artistic vanity while Conocchia is his neglected emotional aspect.At the end of the movie, he eventually becomes aware of the causes of his confusion and self-deceptions (this sudden awareness is symbolized by "shooting himself", shooting his confusion that is) and having a final monologue: "...Accept me as I am. Only then can we discover each other..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie taught me a new "language"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been said before: Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a fictitious, 43-year-old film director with a personal crisis that stunts his creative flow and his inability to get on with his new film after the enormous success of his previous one. The character is iconically brought to life by the immortal Mastroianni with artificially greyed hair and is universally identified as an alter ego of Fellini himself.The first time I saw 8? I was in my teens and hated it. I then rewatched it only a few years later, in my early 20s, and something miraculous happened. It was probably a pivotal moment in my film-viewing experience: it suddenly gave me new parametres by which to judge movies and even art in general. I suddenly learnt this new language, so much more beautiful and sophisticated than anything I had heard before. What was most amazing was that after the first negative experience, I had somehow tapped into this language's secret, and it wasn't in the least bit hermetic or difficult, though more complex and sophisticated than other languages I already knew. Many of the movies I'd considered greats became amateurish or dwarfish in comparison.To me, this was no longer simply a movie, but Art in a more universal sense of the word, Art that just IS and has nothing to strive for or prove. Which is why I find it so nonsensical and contradictory to call something like 8? "pretentious" - to me, pretentious is when an insecure auteur is trying consciously and hard to be profound, difficult, original, ground-breaking, and you can see their intent clearly, and detect the effort behind the artifice. Nothing of any of this is anywhere to be perceived in 8?, which makes creating masterpieces look easy. I admit that 8? is not an easy movie, nor one for everyone. Visually, fewer movies are as iconic, memorable, original, poetic, funny, inventive, allegorical, exhilarating. The scenes I love are too many to mention, but here are just a few: The steam bath scene when in an odd procession/ritual, the patients are being led into what must be a Turkish bath. All the steam surrounding them, the men wearing sheets that look like shrouds or togas, all looking like mock-ancient Roman dignitaries... Then, through a loud-speaker Mastroianni-Anselmi is told the dried-up, turkey-like Cardinal, will now condescend to meeting him. Before Guido rushes off to meet the Cardinal, all his friends and colleagues beg him to put in a good word for them. This is such a gleeful stab at Italy's grovelling, nepotistic culture of ingratiating oneself to the powers-that-be by paying them lip-service even for the most petty personal advantages. Then Guido stands before the embodiment of Catholic paternalism and his obsequious minions. And everything is at its most pompous and lifeless - this dusty, mummified institution is less in touch with the humanity it's supposed to comfort and advise than it is possible to believe.I also love the character of Guido's mistress, Carla, played by Sandra Milo at her gaudiest and most voluptuous. Though initially it's difficult to understand what Guido would have seen in her, eventually it become more apparent. Meeting his wife Luisa, you see how well the two women's ways of being complement one another. See for example how she reacts in a simple, good-humoured, self-deprecating way when in the café scene, Guido's elegant, neurotic wife played by Anouk Aimée at her most androgynously attractive - mockingly compliments Carla's tacky outfit for its "elegance". In such instances one gets a sense that though Fellini is parodying his subjects, he also has a fundamental love and human compassion for them.The prostitute La Saraghina is probably one of the most memorable female characters put to film ever. She is probably somewhere in her 50s and rougher than sandpaper, overweight yet strangely fit and voluptuous, with lots of scary, wild dark hair, overdone raccoon eye make-up caked onto her aggressive, striking, sardonic face as she sits and dances on the lonely beach in Rimini next to her war bunker-home. Guido is fascinated by what is "young and yet ancient", eternal, meaning what is muse-like, archetypically, like the divinely beautiful Claudia character, perfectly embodied by Claudia Cardinale (the ultimate director's muse rather than a real woman or mistress). La Saraghina may not be a young woman like Claudia, she may not represent spontaneity and fresh, uncluttered artistic inspiration like she does, but she is also a muse of sorts - the muse of guilt-free pleasure and non-self-conscious, free, unidealised, earthy femininity. All this is La Saraghina - the town's young boys respond to this in her (including Guido as a child) and are bewitched by her and pay to her to see her demonic yet liberating, visceral dance.I have so much more to say about this movie, for instance about Nino Rota's memorable score, or how the movie's non-linear structure and juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated scenes emulates the rhythm and mood of dreams to perfection. Also, the scenes featuring Guido's parents and their embodiment of the emotional blackmail, that eternal sense of guilt and the stunting of individuality that the paternalistic institution of family at its most traditional represents in Italy. Or of Guido's touching childhood memories, of the wonderful way in which the movie ends, in a merry-go-round of what really matters in life, when all else has been swiped aside and all that remains is the desire to cherish (with all their imperfections) all those who have really mattered most in our lives...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impossible to discuss here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swirling, kaleidoscopic rumination from Fellini. The other user comments here (as well as many professional reviews) show how difficult it is to discuss this film briefly, so I don't think I'm going to try. I would only say that, like other films that push at the boundaries of cinematic greatness--`Citizen Kane,' `Nashville,' and `Brazil' are three others that come to mind--it isn't really possible to place `8 ?' in any simple category. It is a comedy and a tragedy, a satire and a celebration, a movie about love and about the lack of it, a movie about making art and a movie about living, an autobiography and the most challenging kind of fiction, a masterpiece of style and a movie that's really about something. It's not for everyone, but it should be, and it's quite possibly the single greatest movie I have ever seen. 11 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I certainly wouldn't be saying anything new if I said that "8 1/2" is one of the most unique, fascinating, and personal pieces ever committed to film. It has consistently hailed as such, and its influence on film is far reaching and undeniable. It is certainly not one of the most entertaining movies of all time, and is actually quite long and difficult. But it is an incredible piece of filmmaking, and a gripping look at the difficulties of creating not just a movie, but art in general.Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) is a popular movie director who is working on his new film. Along the way, he struggles with his screenwriter, producer, wife, and mistress. Each presents a different problem and obstacle. More and more difficulties arise, not just in his attempts to complete the movie, but in his own mind.Guido, although flawed, is completely fleshed out, and draws sympathy from the audience. Yes, he is an adulterer, but he loves his wife. We see all of his personal desires and agony. We see how he suffers when he struggles with his desire to create the ultimate piece of art, one that offers something to everybody.The movie is technically wonderful. The movement of the camera, the lighting, and the direction in general is top notch. The movie mixes in dreams with reality to create a dreamlike world, and put us closer into Guido's own mind.Somebody who is looking for a movie as a two hour piece of entertainment will not enjoy this. But if you enjoy a movie that truly satisfies when it is finished, this is for you. It is quite long, and somewhat loose, but that is part of the interest. Moviemakers, or artists in general, will find that this film has a great deal to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps, one of the greatest films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time I saw 8 1/2 over twenty years ago; I did not like it then and I did not care much for a confused director who did not know how to make his next movie or how to deal with all women in his life. This time it was different. I knew it from the opening scene, from the first sounds of Nino Rota's music. I wanted to know how Guido would balance the demands of his producers and the insecurities of his love life. I sometimes barely could tell the difference between the reality and Guido's surfing the waves of his memory or building the Utopias in his mind where things were exactly the way he wanted them to be ? and I really did not want to tell the difference. I just was there, following Guido on his journey where Fellini sent us. Then, that scene came, "La Saraghina's" lurid dance on the beach. There was something in that scene that made me return to it over and over again. What was it? The dancing woman was not young, pretty or graceful. On the contrary, she was fat and ugly but there was something about her ? that smile, resilience, the promise of joy that attracted eager schoolboys. It was a last time the young Guido felt happy without guilt and shame that inevitably came after the encounter and stayed with him forever; he learned that joy and punishment are inseparable? There have been fewer than a handful of films that affected me as profoundly as 8 ? did:Tarkovsky's "Zerkalo" ? when the master holds the mirror in front of you that reflects his soul and mind, open you eyes and heart, don't say a word, just watch closely.Tarkovsky's "Andrey Rublev" ? What is talent? Is it a God's gift or Devil's curse? Is an Artist free in choosing what to do with that gift?Bergman's "Persona" ? How far can one individual go in opening his soul to the other without losing identity and sanity?Fellini's ?"Nights of Cabiria" ? "Dum Spiro ? Spero" - While there's life there's hope.In 8 ?, Fellini explored all these subjects and in the final he took the idea of life and hope ever further: after all the characters in his film disappear from the screen, all what left behind is "a little orchestra of Hope with Love as its conductor". The last that we hear is the magic music of Rota, bringing affirmation, hope and love.Simply wonderful. Perhaps, one of five greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Five Martini Cinematic Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intellectuals have written volumes on this strange film by Italian New Wave director, Federico Fellini. I am not an intellectual, so my review will be brief. At its most basic, "8 1/2" (a.k.a. "Otto e mezzo") concerns Guido, a film director (supposedly a surrogate for Fellini himself), who is having what amounts to a midlife crisis. Guido is frustrated in his film-making, and by his relations with other people in his life. But the film's story does not proceed in a traditional, linear fashion. Fellini more or less abandons logical narration, in favor of "open form" narration, wherein the story's causal chain of events is broken.Thus, trying to figure out what is going on in this film can be hard. Guido's fantasies, memories, dreams, and reality co-mingle in a kind of cinematic stew. Fellini presents viewers with a kaleidoscope of surreal B&amp;W images of ordinary objects and eccentric, chattering characters which interact with Guido and with each other, in ways that defy logic, and give breathtaking meaning to the term symbolism. Followers of psychologist Carl Jung would have a field day. In style, the film is flamboyant. In substance, the film is maddeningly subliminal. And yet, even the most metallic cynic, Pauline Kael notwithstanding, must surely appreciate the rareness of Fellini's probing introspection.Given the bizarre, unstructured content of "8 1/2", I wonder about the issue of necessity. Suppose Fellini had added an extra ten minutes to the screenplay, or deleted ten minutes. Would that have made any difference? Apart from Guido, if this or that character had been deleted, how would that have changed the story's significance? And if, as some have suggested, the film is a mirror image of Fellini's own confused psyche, can the story be construed as an intuition of his future film-making?"Otto e mezzo" is not for everyone. Like a Zen koan, "8 1/2" invites frustration. It is above all else a celebration of ambiguity and abstraction, a cinematic experience to ponder, especially on the heels of four or five martinis ... or 8 1/2, if you really want to induce immense intellectual insight. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh cinematic miracle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 1/2 remains one of the most original and spellbinding films I know of. One of the beauties of cinema is to merge the artist's memory and fantasy; Fellini certainly utilized this magic to present his story and characters that embody both humanity and mystery. This film is an autobiographical piece (of Fellini himself) about a movie director named Guido, how his life is consumed by his increasing obsession with work. He avoids questions and problems as if they will go away somehow, only to experience more questions and problems. Ultimately, Guido realizes the only way to solve his problems is to face them rather than escaping, accepting himself instead of wishing he was someone else.The opening sequence--one of the most deftly crafted--is taken from Guido's movie (or his dream - can't remember for sure). The sequence brilliantly captures Guido's problems (which are dealt with in the rest of the picture) and exposes them metaphorically: him STUCK in traffic, TRAPPED in smoke, SUFFOCATING, wanting to escape, and pulled back down by his peers. Guido wants to make a movie about his (and Fellini's) MEMORIES: how once upon a time he learned about a chant that moves pictures, and the time he danced with the fat feminine prostitute figure. The other main component of his movie involves launching into space, a FANTASY that reflects Guido's (and Fellini's) desire to escape from worldly matters. In real life, Guido is having problems with everything from his wife to his movie. So he thinks a beautiful actress, whom he fantasizes but knows little to nothing about, will be the solution to all his problems. When Guido meets the actress, he realizes she can't solve his problems, only he himself has the choice. This realization leads to the film's closure, with Guido having learned what's important to him and the inevitability of taking responsibility.One of the film's powerful features is ambiguously blending Guido's world with his imaginations. Thus the audience is constantly deciphering the context of what's on the screen. This invitation to participate in the film is welcome, and if we think about it, a person like Guido who lives in his office might not be able to tell at times whether an event happened in his life or inside his mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Highest Point in Cinematic Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our tale begins on a congested road. Our Protagonist's car fills with gas. He desperately tries to escape. The camera gives us a claustrophobic sense and within the first few minutes I am on the edge of my seat. Needless to say our protagonist survives but the outcome of this scene reveals so much. Fellini's 8 1/2 is a brilliantly executed tale of a mans life crashing down around him. It is a semi autobiographical tale, Guido is a director who is in a bit of a creative slump. He is giving both the press and executives the run around in order to buy time--hoping to find inspiration. His marriage is shaky and his relationship with his mistress is complicated. Guido tries to escape by going to a spa but his escape is not so easy... This film portrays inner conflict through dream sequences and fantasies as opposed to Expressionism. It is these sequences that enlighten the viewer and add dimension to the tale. To me 8 1/2 is the greatest film in ever, eclipsing Citizen Kane (of course AFI's top 100 list is limited to American movies...) and proving to be enjoyable and insightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film About the Making of a Film Whose Director Can't Create</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are films that the viewer can assimilate and enjoy in one viewing. There are others that demand a second view, just to catch the missing clues or to re-live the story for the first time. Still, there are others, much better, who despite the plot revelations, despite knowing what will happen, produce the feeling of giddy anticipation taken to soaring heights.And then there are films by Directors -- monsters of film-making who even at their worst create compelling works of art that are the stuff of film theory. To see Federico Fellini's film 8 1/2 is to see such a creation. It is the gates of a Dalinian fun house where the past and the present and even the future converge into one intricate, tangled mess of a story -- but one that is beyond analysis, beyond interpretation, and exists in its own universe.8 1/2 is the story of a film director, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni doubling for Fellini), who is unable to continue with the production of a science-fiction movie due to his lack of interest in it. A tightening noose of people who demand of him is beginning to take shape and suffocate him. There is his mistress Carla (Sandra Milo) who throws her earthy neediness on him. A barrage of producers, film critics, and his insecure French actress (Madeleine LeBeau) increase the pressure. His wife Luisa (a severe Anouk Aimee) is estranged from him. Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele) is Gothic-chic incarnate and only succeeds to annoy to hell out of her surroundings. The appearance of two nebulous women: the muse Claudia (Claudia Cardinale, luminous and ethereal) and the mysterious actress (Caterina Boratto) spark some mystery, but neither manage to do more than that -- throw a net of feminine mystique.Guido tries to throw himself into his own memories and see if he can come up with something: his sexual awakening as a boy to the songs and the overpowering carnality of La Saraghina (opera singer Eddra Gale), a Rabelasian woman who lived by the sea, the sanction of the priests, and a fantasy in which he lives in a household of all of the women in his life who are at his feet ready to serve him with abandon. Despite all this it becomes clear that the film in itself will not be made -- more so when his muse appears in the flesh and tells him he "does not know how to love." Her statement becomes evident when he is given the chance to reconcile with Luisa but remains the Director -- a control freak -- even when he himself has lost all control.8 1/2 is one of those films that can be seen in multiple ways. An extended conscious dream fusing itself with reality, Fellini plunges everything he can into a sensory overload where one event which happens in reality becomes framed with another which is a part of a memory or a fantasy. Many characters from his own reality are mirrored in other minor ones. Carla and la Saraghina both reflect themselves in the flesh-and-blood Claudia who tells Guido he does not know how to love, Luisa sees herself in an actress on-stage and recoils but she also shares a lot with Rossella (Rossella Falk), Guido's conscience, Claudia the muse and the Mysterious Lady are two and one, and on and on. They themselves are harbingers of a vicious relationship cycle where Guido finds himself at Stage One and unable to act or give in. This is a film that is not easy to review because it would require an in-depth analysis which would take pages upon pages to write, but in short, it's the slow evolution of a film creating itself when its own director/creator is on autopilot and a whirlwind of activity follows him like a swarm of bees. A masterpiece of film-making, a study of obsessions and unexpurgated demons, a collage of memories past and present, and a wicked roller-coaster ride: this is what 8 1/2 stands for and is, alongside CITIZEN KANE, a flawless black and white film and the womb for all other "Proustian" films which have come out, most notable being Woody Allen's STARDUST MEMORIES. From its standout opening sequence in which suffocating traffic is the catalyst for Guido's escape into the skies (only to be pulled back down by himself), to the glorious moment when Jacqueline the showgirl and Saraghina initiate a revolt against his misogynistic behavior to the moving final sequence where Guido as a boy orchestrates the descent of every person in his adult life and reveals them dancing, together, in harmony, in a conga-line, 8 1/2 is an unforgettable experience of iconoclastic cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"8 ?," is regarded as one of Fellini's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini continued to create bizarre, highly personal films that were lavishly produced and immensely entertaining? "8 ?," so named because he had previously made six films and parts of three others, is regarded as one of Fellini's best? The description of 8 ?'s plot is a flagrant exaggeration, but no summary could precisely reflect the complexity of the film? Obviously autobiographical, the 1963 film stars Marcello Mastroianni as a major movie director unable to complete his new film due to creative confusion and personal crisis... It is a voyage into an explicitly autobiographical world... Among the most vivid scenes are an orgy in a wine vat, an interview with a cardinal in subterranean steam bath, and a sequence in which the director pictures himself as the master of a harem, cracking a whip over all the various women who have been important in his life? The film is like a carousel in a circus, bringing scenes, dialog, and characters in and out of focus? The best way to appreciate this dazzling epic is to see it more than once? On the first viewing, simply leave with your impressions about plot and people? There is enough richness to suffice, yet future screenings will simply add to the joy through understanding?</fullReview>

This is told with stunning visuals and great narrative.8 1/2 can be seen as Fellini's own autobiographical story and is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen.My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been in love with this from when I first saw it twenty years ago. It's not observant about life like Amarcord, which works with the same motifs (a hotel, a harem, a cinema, a beach, a whore). It's abstract and amorphous, and functions as an accumulation of moments that speak mostly about being a callous, privileged film-maker &amp; sex-hound who instantly converts life into his next movie. It's not to be viewed casually or consumed meaninglessly like movies today. It's conspicuously non-linear "art." But one doesn't generally look at a piece of art for two hours straight. There isn't a frame of this that isn't beautiful. Whether it's a near-Islamic view of Guido's childhood home, a fantasy traffic jam, or finding sublime beauty in something as trivial and provisional as scaffolding. After watching it again, there are definitely aspects I find to be unqualified successes (cinematography, production method) but I admire it, more than I actually enjoy it, or get into it. Liking it seems to be beside the point. You're supposed to declare Fellini a genius and be done with it. But it sits very outside myself. I doubt I'll ever watch it in one sitting again, since it's merits seem entirely about gorgeous and fleeting moments. I can imagine a use for it as Rorshach content for your screen that can be popped into a DVD player for viewing bits of pure detached sensation now and then. But because nearly every scene functions as a short essay about maximalization and lost momentum, I find it exhausting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artsy-schmartsy, pseudo-intellectual Fellini is one big yawn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellini's abstract, artful, surrealistic masterpieces certainly deserve their place in cinematic history, but "8 1/2" should not be among them. I know it's not posh to put down Italy's genius (I seldom see any critics having the balls to do so), but I cannot applaud a respected artist's piece of work simply on name value when, for me, it is meritless as entertainment, does little to stimulate the mind other than to numb it, or further the appreciation of film making. Mind-altering drugs should not be an option for getting through a difficult movie. As a result, all "8 1/2" did for me was induce drowsiness. Overlong, laborious, ostentatious, and utterly self-indulgent, this is the kind of movie to see if you are a chronic insomniac. Folks, put away those expensive and dangerous tablets and pills...try "8 1/2"..for a nice, safe and restful sleep.Supposedly, this is one of Fellini's most intensely personal projects. Big deal. Marcello Mastroianni portrays an obsessed Fellini-like filmmaker in the midst of undertaking a new project, enslaved by weird, warped, surreal visions and concepts that serve as motivators. A number of foreign beauties (Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee) are entrapped in subplots that go virtually nowhere. I remember "Fellini Satyricon" as being an equally difficult, visually-arresting piece, but at least the director had the sense to make it forbiddenly erotic with its bizarre assortment of characters prancing about in panoramic perversity.Self-analytical, psychological mumbo-jumbo goes just so far. You remember those inane "Saturday Night Live" skits with Gilda Radner that spoofed these heady, overblown Italian movies? They were pointing their finger at this baby, not "La Dolce Vita," a far better film.If ambiguous, esoteric, highly pretentious art is your thing...go for it. If not, but you feel you'd like to fit in and hold your own in a Fellini(esque) conversation, may I suggest his more plot-friendly "masterpieces" -- "Nights of Cabiria," "La Strada" or even the slim but delightful "Ginger and Fred," all showcasing the extraordinary talents of Fellini's legendary wife Giulietta Masina. Come to think of it, perhaps SHE is what this film is missing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreaming In Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, a 10/10 is not only deceptive, but also inaccurate. And highly inappropriate - how the hell are we supposed to talk about ratings for the greatest film ever made? Federico Fellini's signature dreamy style of filming reaches unprecedented levels in "8?". For one thing, his exceptional filming is combined with an "oh my gosh, genius" subject that the movie is all about: that is, the master's own lack of inspiration. The paradox follows life's own schema: The most inspired film ever deals with the absence of the artist's muse.Guido Anselmi, the main character and Fellini's own alter ego, is a famous and successful director in the middle of a "writer's block" crisis. Everybody is expecting another film, the audience, the critics and even the producer who has paid a fortune in order to set up the director's next creation, but the man feels he has nothing left to say. Whirling in the vortex of numerous faces, opinions and relationships, he simultaneously retreats in his own memories, combined with his present personal life topology - a faithful, sophisticated wife, friends getting old, a sexy mistress whom he treats like an actor or role. Jumping back and forth between reality, dreams and fantasies with Fellini's unique way, and with the guidance of his inspiration/muse/angel/icon of perfection, pictured by Claudia Cardinale, Guido finally manages to push through confusion and come to terms with the actors of his life as well as his own role inside this paradoxical movie. Even though this victory probably requires the sacrifice of his career and fame - but is that important when compared to creativity and defined vision? While I'm sure I cannot say enough to describe perfection, Fellini's "8?" is a reflection of the human conscious and subconscious, that I personally can perfectly relate to. Oh, the glorious confusion! The merging and intertwining of the dream and the reality, the faces and the voices and the female figures of our lives - other artists do it in a way that makes you stand in awe of their genius, but at the same time realizing you are very far from even contemplating all the aspects of their mind. Fellini, on the other hand, achieves to relate with everyone who is honest enough to admit all the nightmares, fears and obsessions that reside inside their heads. And what a trip it is - welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen. The only secret is that you're the captain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Fellini piece I watch, and it most definitely will not be the last. A lot of people call this boring. Let me make two things clear right off the bat: This is *not* fast-paced, and it is also not for everyone. There are a lot of characters, and it is not easy to immediately distinguish between "reality" and fantasy in what we are presented with on the screen. Also, this is a piece of meta-fiction; Frederico, whilst suffering from writer's block, made a picture about a director attempting to, yes, put together a movie, while experiencing that very same condition. Not knowing much about the artist's personality and life, I can't tell how closely this depicts either, but given that there is at least a resemblance, this is, in effect, a film that the man behind it put some of himself directly into, and its subject is, indeed, that very same thing. The cinematography and editing are excellent. Every acting performance is spot-on. The surrealism is impeccable, and marvelously implemented. This has undoubtedly inspired countless people who work in the medium. I understand that this gets better(some say increasingly) with successive viewings, and that anyone should at the very least give it a second one. For now, I take their word for that. I certainly intend to delve further into this. The DVD comes with a trailer and a feature entitled L'ultimate sequenza, or The Lost Ending, which I will review on its individual page. I recommend this to those who find themselves interested by reading either this review, or any other information they learn about it. Just don't take that as a promise that you will enjoy it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous Masterpiece from the Maestro!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini's masterpiece, 8 1/2, was recently thrust back into the spotlight thanks to the movie musical, Nine (though, I don't know if you really would say thanks if you've seen the masterful 8 1/2, remakes are always awful). Hopefully this new interest in the original film could bring in an audience that has never even seen, nor even heard of what I believe to be, the most philosophical, and most thought-provoking film I've ever seen.The film is in all actuality an autobiography detailing the mind and life of its director. It's a movie about a director without inspiration making a movie about a director without inspiration who's making a movie about a director without inspiration, and so on and so forth. It's part a movie about one man's mid-life crisis, part movie about the concepts of truth, life, and romance, and part experimental David Lynch and Terry Gilliam-flare.The director in the film (which is essentially Fellini, but in the film he is known as Guido) is stuck on his latest film. He has no story, constantly making new things up and telling his crew to go to work on it even though Guido has no idea how it's going to fit into the film. The producer is breathing down his neck and Guido is pressured with developing a story, so he starts trying to draw bits from his childhood and his life experiences, such as the impact of all the mistresses and loving women in his life.The film is so psychological and philosophical, your mind is always in constant overdrive during the film. It is a mentally exhausting film to watch, not only does it have subtitles, but the film is so rife with symbolism and little intricate details that it is hard to drink it all in with one viewing. I think it goes without saying, this is a very dense film, probably the most dense I think I have ever seen.It is a surreal film told through Guido's stream of consciousness. At times we're in Guido's dreams when we think we're in reality, other times were in Guido's childhood when we think we're in his dreams, and at other times it's a grand hybrid of Guido's reality, childhood, and dreams. Though, it is because of all of this that this film has such an all empowering emotional and philosophical impact. Every single image, every single line of dialogue in the film has a symbolic meaning of some kind, and Fellini never spells it out for the audience, we must figure it out ourselves.The opening sequence of the film really sums it up without any dialogue and just visuals. Guido dreams that he is locked within his car, the air unit is shooting out icicles. Guido manages to escape and soar off into the sky and to freedom. The film is a must see for any aspiring filmmaker. It is a film about the freedoms and confines of art, but most importantly of all, 8 1/2, is just simply an entertaining film. It is actually at times quite funny, and others beautiful. 8 1/2 is simply put, a masterpiece.I give 8 1/2 a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of art cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts off with a nightmare and ends with a hazy dream sequence. In between reality usually takes a back seat to the director/hero's memories, dreams and frustrations. That Fellini is basically making a movie about making a movie, that Marcelo is the embodiment of the director, that the movie is basically a cathartic process for Fellini himself, a necessary stop after the phenomenal success of La Dolce Vita, is well documented. I would disagree with those who say that it is a difficult movie and that deep psychological analyses are needed for someone to grasp the meaning of the movie.The movie is a visual pleasure today and its story is actually quite neatly organized around specific sequences: the dreams, the harem, the catholic school, the mistress etc. Fellini is quite aware that, deep meanings and intellectual status aside, a movie is essentially the dissemination of the director's vision to the viewers. Marcelo understands that the arduous process of making the film needs to finish once he fantasizes crowds of journalists hunting him down, asking for 'smart' and 'intellectual' comments on the most basic questions of human life. Fellini is making a film about himself - but one that can be acknowledged and enjoyed by all his viewers.The different sequences are like small paintings or postcards representing the director's memories and dreams laid down side by side. The viewer need nothing but look at them and enjoy them for what they offer at hand: the poetry of the fat prostitute sitting on a chair by the sea, Anouk Aimee being transformed in the same movie from a neurotic wannabe-emancipated woman to a patient 'manager' of the harem, the carnival sequence of the last 5 minutes - possibly the most beautiful 5 minutes in cinema history. The movie even offers a happy-ending - in the end, it's THAT accessible! In the end the catharsis Marcelo finds by not making the film symbolizes the catharsis Fellini himself finds by making 8 1/2: He knows he managed to produce a personal, self-analytical piece of work that at the same time is engaging, humorous at times, visually pleasing, touching on various important subjects through lively dialogues and pretty settings. If anything, 8 1/2 is a celebration of the liberation potential of cinema, both for its creators and its viewers. The end credits find Fellini celebrating with his viewers the pleasures of this art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The end of the movie really made me laugh, where his wife and mistress were so happy that he actually cared for them. How sweet! Its movies like this that bring out the feminist in me. The images in the film are sometimes fantastic and sometimes very annoying (which perhaps was Fellini's intention, but they were still annoying), but the actual story was just an in-depth piece on a self-centered narcissistic modern man that wallows in his own superficial despair. Was I supposed to be happy that he learned how to love at the end? Because frankly by that point I had stopped caring about him at all. In the summary of this movie it says that Guido is "misguided" but that he was so charming and sweet that we still liked him. Well, I didn't find Guido charming or misguided. I rather hoped that all his women would leave him in the dust and the movie would end with him sobbing silently in a dark corner, all alone. On a positive note, I did like the music in this film. It almost kept me more entertained than the actual plot.And just one more thing--I'm rather new to foreign films, but I don't get why they put white subtitles on a white background. If they are going to make the words impossible to read, then just omit them all together. Why don't they outline the letters or something? Just curious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fellini's films is one of the main reasons I came to love movies in the first place. I first saw 8 1/2 several years ago. I remember it quite clearly: I went to see it with a small group of fellow students at a friend's house. It was at the beginning of a now already long-since destroyed relationship. It was a cold day in early January. As the film started, a girl who was there, who happened to be a make-up artist and hairdresser by profession, remarked on the odd juxtaposition in the opening scenes of hair-styles and dresses from different eras, the 30's and the 60's. Surely, this was a strange anachrony?My friend calmly remarked: "Time doesn't exist."Heck, I won't pretend to know just what he meant by that, perhaps it wasn't as profound as it sounded. In any case, after that, no one spoke. For the next couple of hours, I certainly lost track of place and time, as I was hypnotized, mesmerized and amazed by the images on the screen. Since then, I've always kept a copy of it within reach (even though I am one of those people who can usually never hang on to my possessions for any length of time), and it has lost none of its power to continually amaze me. I've seen it more times than I can count, and yet, it must always be seen again. It's a movie about which everything seems to have been said, and yet, everything still remains to be said. Thanks to the wonders of DVDs and MPEG encoding, I can keep it one mouse-click away whenever I'm working on my computer. I must admit that by now, its already from the outset discontinuous and jumbled content has been spread all over the place for me. Unlike Woody Allen, I'm not anal. I've never had a compulsion to have to watch movies straight from beginning to end, without interruptions. Of course, that's how I watched 8 1/2 the first few times, but now it seems that I'm always chopping it up, skipping at will between my favorite sections, always moving around it and rearranging it in new and unexpected ways. I hope Fellini, in his Heaven, forgives me for it, because it seems to me that I'm in a way just continuing what he began. 8 1/2, even in its purest state, does of course blow the traditional temporal narrative, with a defined beginning, middle and end and a causal relationship between its parts, to complete smithereens, and in the jumbled landscape that is left behind, nothing can ever be as it was before, as what we are left with is a completely new world, of new possibilities and new kinds of beauty. It's a story of dream-logic, held together by different kinds of connections that transcend temporal sequence and causal relationships. It's a film that never begins, and still has always been there.It's a movie about the most glorious success that can only be brought around through complete failure. It's about how we can only find ourselves when we let go of ourselves - and discover that the only place we can fall is into ourselves, our true selves. It's the ultimate self-referential masterpiece, and the ultimate piece of self-reference, as it is, of course, about nothing except itself.It really is, in my opinion, the best movie in the world, and by now I can't even imagine a world without it. That's really all I want to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fellini is one of my all time favorite directors, my favorite Fellini film is La Strada, then And The Ship Sails On and Roma. Otto e Mezzo is not entertaining, yes this is obvious, I hadn't expected an entertainment movie, but besides being artistic, visually beautiful and stylish, The Ship Sails On is entertaining, Roma is the same, yes those films are also entertaining. A film does not have to be entertaining, artistic, stylish and has a strong ''cinema feeling'' at the same time, but at least it should has one of them. Otto e Mezzo has none of them. It is not artistic, because the story is extremely uninteresting except a two or three scenes like the scene which the fat woman dances for children on the beach or the director's dream about women and himself or the opening scene was interesting, impressive surrealism. It has not any other impressive or dramatic material. It seems that people don't use the term, cinema feeling, but as I know, there is such a term. Thus, Otto e Mezzo had not a (strong) cinema feeling. This is about a black and white life of a spiritually black and white man in a spiritually black and white world. Now, they have changed it, it is stylish, before the poster that you see now, there had been a black and white poster, the one which there is only the number 8 1/2 on. The film is like this poster. Direction was very tasteless. And The Ship Sails On has a taste, Roma has a taste, La Strada has a taste, but Otto e Mezzo had not. That's why I don't call Otto e Mezzo artistic. Because art (a work of art) gives you pleasure, it makes you impressed, it is beauty. This is the purpose of art, at least one of them. As I see, people interpret every single scene and find hundreds of meanings, sorry, but meanings do not make the work of art itself great or artistic. Thus, Otto e Mezzo is one of the hardest cinematic experiences of all time, so how can you call a torture-like film entertainment or art? The purpose of art, the purpose of entertainment are missed in Otto e Mezzo. At least Marcello Mastroianni's character might have been interesting, but Guido was a dull character. Honestly, after seeing Otto e Mezzo, I had taken a temporary dislike to cinema and I thought about it, how could I overcome this? Taking a break to watch movies or watching other movies to try to forget this experience? I chose the second. I watched a few films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film about the creative process and giving up control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellini's 8 ? is about as close as you can get to making a musical without the characters actually breaking out into song, which is perhaps why it was so easily adapted into an actual musical, Nine. It's musical score by Nino Rota guides us through the protagonist's fantasies and memories as they blur into reality. The film centers around a famous film director, Guido, who is suffering from "director's block." With time ticking away before production must begin on his latest film, he is faced with a cast and crew pressing him to make decisions that he isn't prepared for. As a reality he is increasingly losing control over suffocates and swirls around him, he retreats into his memories and fantasies, as well as his habit of womanizing. As Guido attempts to balance and control the female influences on his life, the film takes on a frantic pace, until he eventually realizes that he's in over his head and must surrender. It's a brilliant film about the creative process, but more importantly it's a film about human relationships. Guido is a misogynist, and the film mocks his attempt to control the women in his life, keeping them each in there own little box. The film makes it clear this is a harmful ideology with tongue-in-cheek dream sequences and also shows how womanizing has genuine human consequences in reality. 8 ? is ultimately a film about a man who is accustomed to having all the power recognizing that he is lost and learning that he must give up control, and the film depicts this with absolute beauty at the highest level of artistic achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puzzle in the shape of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies and movies. Many movies are "just movies", that is, perfectly ordinary, undistinguished movies. Many are bad. Many are okay. Some are great. Some are unusual."8?" (in Italian, 'Otto e mezzo') might just be one of those special cases. It is a brain teaser because it's spectacularly confusing. It is a jigsaw puzzle because it's extremely complex. It isn't one of those movies which you can say «Eureka! I got it!» at first, perhaps not even on a 16th or a 22nd viewing. It is possible to understand it better (more or less) with time and subsequent viewings. But it requires attention and patience, not only for being such a complicated film but also because it's a long one (2 hours and 10 minutes). Definitely not a film for people who are lazy to (or simply don't like to) burn their brains thinking.This is not an easy film to evaluate. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not when I first saw it. Meanwhile I've come to realize that I like it. It burns my brain yet I like that about it. It obliges me to reflect and to disclose its mysteries.The story is very strange and intriguing: Guido, a film director, is going through a crisis ? to be more precise, he is suffering from "director's block". He feels trapped while doing his latest film and his personal life isn't doing much better. Flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies, often shaping up with reality. As a result, it's almost impossible for the viewer(s) to distinguish reality from fiction. This brilliant concept was much later used in the great Spanish film "Abre los ojos" (1997). Attention, that I mean only the concept of being unable to tell reality from fiction."8?" seems to be unanimously considered Federico Fellini's best. It's a highly influential movie in many ways. In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed, the videoclip of the wonderful song "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M., is more than just a wee bit inspired by the traffic jam in the opening dream sequence of Fellini's "8?". And this in 1993, exactly 30 years later.Marcello Mastroianni is great as Guido. The gorgeous Claudia Cardinale does a great acting as Claudia (whom Guido casts as a movie star that represents his ideal of a woman).The use of music deserves a word or two from me. There is a musical score by Nino Rota, but the classical music draws the attention as well, such as the noted "Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner and, best of all, cream of the crop, tip of the top, the glorious "The Barber of Seville (Overture)" by Gioachino Rossini. This Italian piece of classical music is an underrated and often forgotten masterpiece and it was also used in one episode of "Tom and Jerry" before and much later in 1978 in the Italian TV commercial "Lancio Citroën Visa", a wonderful 10- minute long video about that very nice French car made at the time it was launched to the market.In conclusion, "8?" is a towering achievement and one of the great italians.Title in Portugal: "Fellini Oito e Meio".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious and Self-Indulgent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mastroianni plays Fellini's alter ego, a film director facing a creative block. At one point, Mastroianni says, "I really have nothing to say, but I want to say it all the same." This pretty much sums it up. Fellini has nothing to say but he rambles on for nearly two and half hours (although it seems as long as the title) not saying it. It's endless scenes of people blabbering about mostly uninteresting things. The dialog comes at such a rapid fire pace that those who don't understand Italian must exhaust all their energy reading the subtitles. Fellini is at his pretentious and self-indulgent worst, and of course the film is universally regarded as a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Petaled Swirl of Influences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I am generally not a fan of Fellini: his early work is too sentimentally trivial for his talent, and his later work is just lazy. But in this film, he reaches more than one height.In terms of basic worlds, it is radically heterogeneous: we have visions, memories, dreams, desires, films, reveries, imputed futures, fantasies, showbusiness abstractions: but all are treated with such fluidity that it seems whole. It is nominally about itself, but that is only one dimension of the reflexive folding we have. Many of the other dimensions involve us more than they do him: the sex, the fiction, the writing of a life.But at the same time it pulls off something that I think is unique: we are meant to assume that the assembly of this film was as accidental and chaotic as the one depicted. But it is clearly not so: like the Chopin piece of `Autumn Sonata,' it is something that comes from a coherent shaping of the ether by a single mind: but it displays all the qualities as if it simply emerged as an artifact of the competing forces shown. The filmmaker is both a result of God's caprice and is God himself. The sex is only there to engage us: the larger issue is the moist, engaging fecundity of creation.This is a touchstone for folded cinema. It changed everything that followed on screen and to a large extent in our dreams.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Random Thoughts on "8 1/2"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where, intellectually, I know it's a great film. Here's a film about a director with a creative block who retreats into his memories and imagination to escape the harried world of movie-making...directed by a director who had a creative block and decided to make a movie about it. It coils back on itself like the screenplay for "Adaptation." However, at an emotional level, my gut reaction on watching this film the first time was one of near-boredom. I thought it was a little pretentious and self-serving, but I loved some of the visuals. Especially the opening dream sequence in the smoke-filled car. And yet I was still not captivated by it. Perhaps this movie was not designed to wholly captivate someone, the way a movie like, say, "E.T." or "Harry Potter" is said to captivate the viewer. Perhaps this movie is like an entertaining research paper, discussing an esoteric subject in layman's terms so anybody can watch. Entertaining? Sort of. I had to watch it a few more times before completely understanding how self-reflexive the movie was, and how revealing it was about Fellini himself. For that it gets a seven. But it's not something to just pop in to pass the time. The movie demands attention, and without it, you're just looking at pretty pictures waiting for the closing credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film whose sole purpose is to justify its own existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I have nothing to say," the hero says at least 4 times in the course of this film. Nothing is more true of Fellini's masterpiece. But beginning with this notion, the director takes us on a 2.5 hour epic to justify why he must say it nonetheless. That itself is rather clever and original, but--aside from the autobiographical elements which some may find tedious--it comes across as simply a glorified self-validation.In this respect I equate Fellini to Salvador Dali (who is ironically my favourite painter). Neither artist had anything definitive to say, yet they did it in the most artistic way possible. Stylistically it's well crafted; images are stirring, masterful and expressive. But there is no backbone, no profound underlying message to tell the viewer except "I have nothing to say." Toward the second half of the film, this is voiced in a poignant monologue by one of the characters in the film (the film critic), and the hero's response is one of inarticulate exasperation. And so we see that, if anything, the point of this movie is to express Fellini's own purposelessness and ennui. This was the original "slacker film".This was my first Fellini film, and I'm afraid it was a disappointment. My second Fellini film was ROMA which was an utter disaster (even Fellini fans should avoid that one like the plague). I've been told that the ideal way to indoctrinate oneself to Fellini is to start with LA STRADA, then NIGHTS OF CABIRIA, then JULIET, followed by LA DOLCE VITA... and only if/after you've developed the taste for such things should you try 8 1/2.My advice to you newbies, should you decide to see this film anyway, is don't think too hard. Treat it as if you're watching an autobiography, complete with director's commentary reminding you why you're watching. This film is Seinfeld without the jokes... a show about nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine considers himself quite the art-house buff and as such has taken it upon himself to convince me to watch all the a u t h o r i (s) ed masters like Fellinni. He even prep'd me for it by saying "It's like a beautiful painting, you just let it in" which I thought was totally valid and cool. Until I saw the film. What is it about film-makers that makes them so stupid. Is it the fact that their livelihood relies so directly upon winning approval and like the fashion industry the best way to do that is to appeal to people's basest most ignorant tendencies? Are they trying to make us feel comfortable like the awful abstract art that is kinda cool because is doesn't aim too high, cos "I could do that". It takes real courage and discipline to be honest, to be vulnerable and to be willing to let people into that and be open to the risks that involves. This film is shallow, hollow and amateur. It's no wonder that most film-makers start off with horror. They don't generally start with philosophical reasoning and idealism. I told my friend if this was a book no-one would bother with it, if it was music we'd laugh at it, but he told me it's film and you can't, but I beg to differ. We are far too lenient with film, we let it get away with anything.The most banal pathetic tripe is elevated to the level of art and the utter garbage of Hollywood is seen as serious and legitimate. This film is no different. It is safe, self-indulgent and two- dimensional. Even as a satire it doesn't work. Satire is difficult and requires intelligence and insight, hence the few truly respected comedians. In summary: obvious and amateur, packed with awful try-hard symbolism and silly jokes, terrible over-acting, I feel insulted and demeaned for having to put up with this poor excuse for a film, it did nothing for me.

		<shortDescription>The Fellini Complex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After WWII, Italy went through a cinematic renaissance that shaped the way we've watched movies ever since. Italian Neo-Realism laid the groundwork for movies that dare inspire to feel real, and in the moment. No longer was the cinema an extended apparatus to the theater. The Italians made it possible to use the camera as it purely was meant to be, to capture reality. In walks Federico Fellini, the man, the artist and the noun. Generations from now, the name Fellini will still resonate with all moviegoers. Fellini had set a new standard for modern cinema, in a time when the standard of "Neo-Realism" was considered a new standard in itself. Fellini wasn't just own filmmaker. He was also his own therapist. From the minute he woke up in the morning, to the minute he fell asleep, nothing else in the world mattered more to Fellini than Fellini. Suddenly, he brought his own careless narcissism into his own pictures. Suddenly, cinema became self-reflexive. We're talking about movies about movies, and filmmakers about filmmakers. What a concept! Honestly, Italian Neo-Realism couldn't get any realer than that. The movie that caught the world's fascination over Fellini's self-reflexivity is what is widely considered his masterpiece, and one of the defining films of the 20th century, "8 ? ". To anyone with any knowledge of Fellini, it is practically his biopic. Nonetheless, whatever it is, it's brilliant."8 ?" centers on famed film director Guido Anselmi. Remember, Guido is Federico Fellini. The art world loves him, and he's about to make yet another astounding picture. The problem is, Guido doesn't even know where to start. He's completely run out of ideas. He has producers, actors, production crews and critics talking into his ear, asking him favors and trying to control him. It's the same problem over and over again, and Guido just want's to run away from it all. His only refuge is to spend time with his woman. But, wait, there's another problem. He doesn't have one woman (singular), he has women (plural). He's stuck in an absolutely mind-boggling love triangle between and intellectual, a stunning dame and a prostitute. Guido has nowhere to turn. He loves all of his women equally, and can't settle with just one of them, despite their advances on to him. Guido tries to clear his mind at a luxurious spa, but then that only leaves time for himself, and even Guido can't escape his own mind. Flashbacks of his childhood comes back to haunt to him, and every time, they remind him of how dysfunctional his love life has become. One flashback recounts the time he went with his friends to see a local prostitute, and was persecuted by his catholic school for escaping during class and giving into impure thoughts. Guido is at odds with his faith, his love and his work. It's all just driving him mad. Everything ends up coming to a head at the end of the picture, and instead of choosing what to do, he quits his massive, over-budgeted picture all together and decides to focus on himself and finding the true woman that he loves. Federico Fellini constructs this film as a free-form diary. Every last anecdote and mannerism about Guido, is 100% true to the man that Fellini is. He is neurotic about his movies, his life and his women. Fellini's self-reflexivity, to me, is very reminiscent of one of cinema's more contemporary masters, Woody Allen. Woody Allen, much like Fellini, always casts himself or a version of himself in his movies, and every time, that character has a serious problem with women. Fellini and Allen both see themselves as comical losers, and just way too fascinating to not make films about. Woody Allen even made a complimentary film to "8 ?" called "Stardust Memories", which is basically the Woody Allen biopic. While narcissism is arguably the fuel to a filmmaker's imagination, these fellows have cemented themselves as the biggest ones in the history of cinema. But then, is it any wonder why they turned out as legendary as they did? "8 ?" is a wonderful film, and includes some of my favorite moments in any movie. From the opening scene, Fellini had me wrapped into his world. I absolutely could relate to the kind of man Fellini is. Most filmmakers can, as I've explained. We're all aware to how making films, can literally drive you crazy, and in this film, it nearly breaks Guido. I will never forget the famous fantasy scene of Guido's kingdom of women. Guido hit's his highest moment of narcissism in this glorious piece. Almost as a wink to the French Revolution, his women begin a violent, feminist revolt against Guido. Let me tell you, there is nothing more priceless than a man who is frightened that his women are out to destroy him. I saw his three main women, to be very apparent to Guido's personality. Less Heart + Mind and more like a personified version of Id, Ego and Superego. The prostitute at the film's beginning was purely Guido's Id, as he is seen foolishly messing around with her, and even telling her to sloppily put her makeup like a "whore". Carla is like a fetish to Guido. On the other hand, Luisa is Guido's superego, or the person that he really wants to be like. She is a devout, intelligent companion and wife to Guido. I found his relationships struggles really funny and quite introspective. The ending, of course, is arguably the most memorable scene. It all ends in a giant circus, with clowns and horns and everybody dancing around in a circle. Fellini was always obsessed with the circus, and always gave it a place in his films. It's strange to wonder why, since Fellini never actually participated in the circus, and yet he thinks that he did. Perhaps it's an allusion to Fellini's mind itself. Perhaps Fellini's mind is one giant circus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intellectual crisis of artistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning "8 1/2" was probably the first movie to contrast art with the trials and tribulations of an artist's life. Marcello Mastroianni plays a director who watches both his movie and his life collapse around him. Overall the movie is about trying to find happiness in such a world. In typical Fellini fashion, we see past and present interspersed, creating a bizarre setting. The opening scene shows Mastroianni's character in a car which starts filling with smoke, the perfect metaphor for an artist's feeling of being trapped (so what happens next reflects the desire to escape this hectic world). And since this is Fellini, there's a scene that pokes fun at the Catholic Church.I understand that Fellini made this movie to reflect his own experiences as a director. It's safe to say that his tough experiences as a director contributed to his masterful output. "8 1/2" affirms him as probably Italy's greatest director ever. I have no doubt that he would still be making masterpieces were he alive today.I highly recommend "8 1/2".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Federico Fellini is a master of dreams and mind mischief. Each and every movie directed by him projects the viewer into an entirely disconnected reality, where characters and symbols take over and rule the scene. This particular side of his creations is the undisputed protagonist of 8 1/2. Starting from the very first scene, the environment and the situation Guido finds himself in are so strange and fantastic that you may as well see the entire movie as a huge dream beginning right in this scene. Not an ordinary dream, of course, but a dream with the precise purpose of helping the protagonist through his crisis as an artist. Guido is in the middle of a movie production, but he just feels lost. He has no direction, no inspiration. He's a half man with a half work. The title could be seen as an irrelevant detail, and as a matter of fact it was meant to be temporary: Fellini used to name the movie 8 1/2 because it actually was his 8 1/2 movie, since he had previously directed nine movies but only co-directed three of them. He declared that he kept the same title out of indecision, but it may as well be likely that his genius mind told him to do so because it actually has a relation to the movie. A half title for a half man with a half work. Guido tries to fill this missing half of himself by seeking answers in the past: his parents, his lovers, his childhood, and, mostly, his Catholic education. Faith and Church are recurring elements in Fellini's movies, but he never actually enhances or criticizes either of them. Not eloquently, at least. They're just way too important in Guido's life, and despite his continuous efforts of trying to pull out answers from them, he simply cannot. Not Faith, not Church; not his women, not his fantasies: as the movie goes on, nobody and nothing seems to be able to save him from his misery. Until, eventually, he understands that the only one standing in his way is himself, not only as his enemy, but as his only possible Saviour as well. "Guido" in Italian literally means "I drive": only by figuring out that he's the driver of his own life can he finally find peace and discover the Truth about himself. "All the confusion of my life has been a reflection of myself: myself as I am, not as I'd like to be. The truth is [...]"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potentially Unnecessary Personal Redemption Through Art Versus Mental Clarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, the story may seem straightforward if you read a synopsis of "8?," but once you actually watch this movie, it will seem like a convoluted mess that makes no sense. Heck, I found myself getting irritated trying to make sense of what is going on until I realized that this film is actually taking place inside of the main character's head, which means its filled with dreamlike fantasies which range from relationship issues and his childhood which seem to seep into his thoughts as he goes through the pressures of writer's block, coupled with the pressure from the public eye in trying to create a new film.I was expecting not to like this film at all, but unexpectedly I began to see something special about as I was watching this. This movie has a certain feeling to it that is different than a lot of movies. Sure the story may not be good as every other classic. Sure the story may not be dark and brooding. Sure the movie may seem redundant at times. The thing that I love is how the film presents itself. I was trying to figure out how to comprehend what's going on the same way I try to comprehend my own dreams.What I got from this is that it is a story of one's own confusion and the struggle to find clarity in a life where everyone is in your face. It's convoluted to the point where you sometimes cannot tell the transitions from dream to reality. Some are more distinct than others, but the beauty of it all is the beautiful cinematography that gives a strange atmosphere somehow throughout the film with unfamiliar settings and strange situations that is sometimes nonsensical. This is a very unique movie that is so idiosyncratic in its style and it's one of my favorite movies that I have seen and still want to see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was watching "Inland Empire" I was also observing how the brain struggles to solve a puzzle and capture the meaning. No matter how complex the pattern, there is one in "Inland Empire". However "8?" offered none, it was so difficult to follow the movie that the brain failed and shut itself down. (I fell asleep once.) So what was the problem? Or was there a problem? Or the "problem" itself was a remarkable clue? "8?" begins with a dream. What is the purpose or the meaning of this beginning? Usually artists are inspired by dreams. Fellini's case is different; he was inspired by the nature of dreams. For many of us, dreams are like films without a director. The fact is everything requires a direction or orchestration, our romantic or non-romantic relationships, our ideas, our memories, life as a whole. As a movie "8?" itself lacks the direction (and orchestration) until the final scene in which Guido finally grabs a megaphone and the orchestra and the walk in harmony herald us that the crisis is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand Epic Of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8? is an Italian comedy-drama directed by Federico Fellini.Fresh off of the international success of La Dolce Vita, the master director moved into the realm of self-reflexive autobiography with what is widely believed to be his finest and most personal work. Co-scripted by Fellini, Tullio Pinelli, Ennio Flaiano, and Brunello Rondi, it stars Marcello Mastroianni as Guido Anselmi, a famous Italian film director; together with Claudia Cardinale,Anouk Aimée and Sandra Milo.Guido Anselmi is a film director overwhelmed by the large-scale production he has undertaken. He finds himself harangued by producers, his wife, and his mistress while he struggles to find the inspiration to finish his film. He is suffering from "director's block". Stalled on his new science fiction film that includes veiled autobiographical references, he has lost interest amid artistic and marital difficulties. As Guido struggles half-heartedly to work on the film, a series of flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies; they are frequently interwoven with reality.Fellini jumbles narrative logic by freely cutting from flashbacks to dream sequences to the present until it becomes impossible to pry them apart, creating both a psychological portrait of Guido's interior world and the surrealistic, circus-like exterior world that came to be known as "Felliniesque."The marriage of Fellini's hyperreal imagery, dreamy sidebars, and the gravity of Guido's increasing guilt and self-awareness make this as much a deeply moving, soulful film as it is an electrifying spectacle. Mastroianni is wonderful in the lead, his woozy sensitivity to Guido's freefall both touching and charming--all the more so as the character becomes increasingly divorced from the celebrity hype that ultimately outpaces him.One of the greatest films about film ever made, 8 1/2 turns one man's artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The substantial built on the insubstantial.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about as tiring and confused as the narrator/protagonist. Just like him we know his project is doomed, but we can't do anything about it until he does something about it, so we plod along with him and hope that maybe someone else will work it out for him.It's a very intimidating film, I think even moreso for filmmakers. It represents just the fear they have, where they want to express something but have no idea how to do it, so try to pass off a bunch of vague and insubstantial images as a plot for a while until other people start getting serious about what's needed to be put in it to make it actually a film. In that way it's a lot like Adaptation, except Adaptation makes it colorful and zany in a twisted way while this makes it pretty dark and brooding. Both films are brilliant, if for no other reason in that I can't believe it actually worked out.In fact, one thing that's amazing about this film is that I didn't feel like I was watching Fellini (like how in Adaptation I felt I was watching Charlie Kaufman). Despite the inherent self-reflexiveness of having a movie about movies, this one didn't seem to bring attention to the camera or exposition at all, instead making the "movie within a movie" moments a product of the antihero's film-centric imagination (how his dreams are filled with set pieces, rigid cutting, and silent, visual aura while the real moments in the film are filled with sound, other people moving, longer, more flowing takes, and less dance numbers.) It also is very interesting to follow the supporting characters, how they all seem to have wives you never see and mistresses you see all the time, how they all do their thing without knowing what they're supposed to do, all because that's all they know how to do, and how they invest themselves with the director and he just pushes them aside. Then with all the introductions to women who want parts, the whole melange of faces and bodies all trying to get something out of nothing... it's a very exhausting film.But that's what it's trying to express, so it's amazing. I love the obvious and yet completely profound images of stuff like "The set built on sand" and "I need to include everything to express nothing." Good stuff.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, everyone will call this Federico Fellini's masterpiece and it's well-told so I won't go into too many retold details but small relatively unknown moments. It's autobiographic about a director struggling to make his next movie. His marriage is on the rocks and he has a mistress. He reflects on youth, women and guilt (Catholicism). Marcello Mastroianni plays the director (Guido) who wears Fellini's hat at times. During the filming, there was no script, but Fellini would talk to his cast and they would improvise and answer. Guido can't have a successful movie nor a successful relationship with women. Anouk Aimee is austere and stern and Sandra Milo is wonderfully carefree and sexy. Eddra Gale plays the infamous La Saraghina and Barbara Steele adds 60s sexiness. In order to create a successful movie, he needs a gorgeous movie star, his stunning ideal fantasy Claudia Cardinale dressed in white to save him. He has to wait (because in reality she was really filming another movie, The Leopard, with Luchino Visconti). But when she finally appears, she is in glamorous black and lets him in on reality, "Because he doesn't know how to love." The real Claudia replaces the dream and he suddenly realizes, there is no film. Instead, Fellini's love of the circus and cartoons, influences how he ends the movie in a grand circle of people. It's reconciliation with life's relationships that allows closure. Fellini's camera-work direction is a rare pinnacle as shown by his opening dream image of flying and his spa scene with everyone waiting in line. The use of black/white clearly delineates his intention, his mood, what's pure and what's real. Considered the best movie on the process of movie-making, there's less on movie-making (except for the press conference, the screen tests and parties) than on Guido's relationships with people and his fantasies. Perhaps justly so, since acting is blending reality and fiction. The famous Christmas scene with bringing presents to every woman and ending in a whipping scene is a typical fantasy. it's really more a introspective view of life, more representative of the abstract than reality. One can add more, but there's so much written on this film. It's as smooth, chic and cool as a movie comes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8? is deservedly considered to be one of film's greatest masterpieces. It is such a perfectly- crafted film. The writing is divine, balancing the despair and confusion of trying to understand oneself with glimpses of truly satisfying comedy. Each scene is well-balanced, providing both meaningful insight and a sense of being lost, as Guido tries to balance his past, present, and supposed future. Unlike the recent musical retelling, 8? features characters with actual depth. Guido isn't just a senseless wanderer trying to make sense of his life, searching for justification for his lifestyle, or making a picture simply because the studio wants him to. He has a message he wants to send, and in the course of relaying that message, he hopes to find some peace of mind. Guido here is a much more compelling character, because he is trying to do something, not passively watching the film taking shape and shrugging his shoulders.The women in the film also serve as more than objects used to define the director. Their relationships with Guido are more authentic, and it's clear how each one has influenced him. He's a man who loves women without really being able to love them, so instead of respectfully drawing inspiration from each woman, he instead tries to drain them of any compelling or exciting qualities. They aren't muses to be admired and translated; they're oranges to squeeze which will hopefully yield a meaningful juice.The collision of fantasy and reality results in the film's dreamy feeling, supported by the stylistic system. Every shot is beautifully executed, whether it's capturing something odd, like a body floating high above the beach, or something more grounded in reality, such as a dinner. The consistency of Fellini's shot, editing, etc. results in a seamless integration of the real and unreal, often making scenes open to interpretation. It's thrilling film-making, to be sure, especially when the film delves completely into Guido's fantasy world, where all the women he has admired move in together to pamper him.Ultimately, what makes 8? an amazing film is the focus on honesty. Guido himself is a dishonest man, but the film allows the viewer to see him for who he really is, and how he tries to be better through his art. He can't bring himself to confront his wife, Luisa, about their troubled marriage, so instead he writes a scene of the conversation they need to have. Film provides an escape for the viewer, but it's fascinating to see it from the other side: as a way for a director to vicariously live alternate versions of his life. Within the film-to-be, Guido can expose himself fully without the risk of being judged. It's a confession that will not, in the end, be taken seriously. Except by Luisa and the other women who see themselves in the characters, of course.It's Luisa's reaction to the screen tests that motivates Guido to try to be better. As a director, he has run out of things to say, because he has gotten to the point where his art and his real life collide. He has always lived in a world blurred between fantasy and reality, but now his art is too real to escape into. Guido comes to realize that he can't say anything more in his films until he says what must be said in his own relationships. Art is an expression, but it can never be as sincere as an actual act. The fact that seeing a man come to understand this truth is both moving and oddly cathartic. 8? is a masterpiece in the truest sense of the word.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A successful film director (Marcello Mastroianni), on the verge of a nervous breakdown and in crisis over his career, has conflicting fantasies about his life.Eight And A Half is director Federico Fellini's self-portrait: a coruscating, melancholy, self-reflecting spectacle of a man close to his wits' end, and wondering how to sustain his creativity and reputation - whether to repeat the style of his successes or strive for new areas of endeavour. It's necessarily self-indulgent, but heartfelt and true to itself, none the less. Acknowledged as a highly influential classic, the film was ranked 3rd best film of all time in a 2002 poll of film directors conducted by the British Film Institute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's visionary, autobiographical masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"8 1/2" is an extraordinary, visionary masterpiece from Fellini, and one of his best films. After browsing through the IMDb forums for the movie, it seems many people are upset about its low ranking on the site's "Top 250" - one fan noting it has dropped below "Pirates of the Caribbean." But does it really matter where it stands on a list that includes movies like "Lord of the Rings" in the top five? "8 1/2" concerns itself with a film director named Guido who has what Fellini described as "director's block" - he can't film anything. Stressed and pressured, Guido begins to retreat into his dreams and memories of passed relationships and experiences.This movie is mind-boggling from beginning to end - its opening in particular is classic, with Guido's dream, and the man in the car floating into the heavens and then falling into water.This movie has inspired many great directors of today (most noticeably Terry Gilliam, who has an introduction on the wonderful Criterion Collection DVD) and it would be a crime if you're a film buff and decide to pass on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews seem to break down into two camps: one says 8 1/2 is a fantastic film, the other that it's a snoozathon.Anything worthwhile requires you to work, too. If you just sit there and expect the director to point your skull for you, this film may put you to sleep.If you can handle ambiguity, resonance and getting up off your mental and emotional duff to work a bit, this film is an absolute comic feast that will richly reward you again and again.I saw 8 1/2 in its' initial release, and have marveled at how many other films have ripped it off in the years since. This new DVD has far superior video quality over previous incarnations in VHS, and is an absolute must for all but the most passive viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were two elements of 8 1/2 which left a lasting impression on me. The first is the music, which is often suggested as diagetic but which continues even when this has become impossible. Even in the dog-eared print I was watching, this was highly effective at dovetailing Guido's dream, real and all-points-inbetween liminalities.The second is the persistent, existentially arresting influence of the women that he has around him. Guido acts like Hamlet, unable to complete his task or make love to these women. His reputation and ambition is represented for him by his production team and sponsor: a colossal, grotesque and clearly overambitious phallic spaceship. Instead of rising to meet the challenge or adopting the humility that might foreclose the folly of it all he hangs on, waiting for something.Is it inspiration? Is this really a film about writer's block? I found Mastroianni's performance as Guido more interesting that that of La Dolce Vita in that there is no angst about his procrastination. He feels no pressure or remorse. I enjoyed his exchanges with Claudia Cardinale - mirrored successfully in the worthy but rather prosaic musical remake Nine by Nicola Kidman - in which the two simply seem to enjoy each other's company despite the contradictions of their relationship and its intractability.This is not as successful a film as its predecessor. It is however part of the sophisticated, dispersed-narrative cinema pioneered by Antonioni around the time. For all this - and for all that it has suggestions of other similar ideas (Bergman's Seventh Seal in the final shot?) it retains an originality which makes it worthwhile. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, for the most part 8? left me cold, one of those films where you get what is being done but it's just not on your wavelength. It's pointless to complain about it being hit-and-miss or confused, since erratic confusion is the nature of the beast as Fellini becomes possibly the first man to film his own nervous breakdown (or at very least his crisis of creativity). In many ways the turning point in Fellini's career where fantasy and grotesquery would become an increasing part of increasingly disjointed phantasmagorias with a design style as cluttered as a tart's dressing table, there are moments that strike home and the latter scenes with his wife and with Claudia work because there's a sense of self-awareness of Fellini's limitations not just as an artist but as a human being. But overall I was just left with the feeling that I'd got on the wrong train by mistake.(Incidentally, to strike a timely note, it's amusing to note that the producer's brainless bimbo girlfriend is the spitting image of Paris Hilton!) It's a shame Criterion's otherwise excellent 2-disc DVD couldn't locate the deleted sequences, although the Nino Rota documentary is interesting and has a wonderful moment where the composer accepts a proffered cigarette only to turn down a light because he doesn't smoke!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Was That All About?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first viewing of "8 1/2" occurred in 1965 at Bellarmine College in Louisville, Kentucky. To this day, I remember both my best friend and myself silently walking out of the auditorium while scratching our heads as we wondered, "What was that all about?" Hours....days....weeks....years later we were still talking about the film, and the impact it has made on our lives.Somehow the film had captured our soul from the very beginning when a man, Guido Anselmi (Marcel Marstroiani) is caught in a traffic jam while toxic fumes from the other cars begin to flood the sky. Suddenly, the man is mysteriously pulled up into the sky ... thus Fellini's masterpiece begins. From that point on, Guido spends his entire time trying to produce, direct, and write a film about his life, and doing so finds himself in the process of trying to figure out the meaning of his life.What is this really about? I have no idea, but I do know this. It is about all the things that are important in life; the people who mean so much to us during the journey, life vs. death, youth vs. old age, lust vs. love, the "reel" journey (art and the creative process) vs. the "real" journey (life), tradition and family as opposed to individuality and independence, and man as a paradox.To this day I am still scratching my head and trying to figure out what the meaning of this film is.....just as I am trying to figure out what life is. Perhaps, I am on to something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's Greatest Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this by saying I am a huge fan of master Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini and a large portion of his work, from the earlier ones like I, Vitteloni to La Dolce Vita, but 8 1/2 is by far the greatest film he ever created, and also high and above the best "film about film" ever.To watch 8 1/2, one will have to be a little patient and observant, and have to deal with the fact that: a.) the film is in Italian, and subtitle reading is necessary, and b.) to really understand to film, and to appreciate its visual mastery (because the first time you see it you might pay more attention to the subtitles) you'll probably have to watch it again.Following the chaotic retreat of a famous Italian film director (Fellini-favorite Marcello Mastroianni), 8 1/2 is a visually stunning mix of daydreams and real life, pulling the viewer deep inside the mind of the main character, and is supposedly a semi-autobiography of Felllini himself. Though many critics have scorned Fellini's dreamy, surreal style for confusing viewers as to which segments are real and which are dreams, I have no answer. I have always been able to tell clearly when Guido is slipping into a fantasy, and I don't think multiple viewings are necessary to understand the story, though I think it makes the movie more enjoyable.I don't want to give away any more of the plot line, but the fabulous mix of writer's block, nagging actresses and mistresses, impending guilt, religion, love, life, death, and anything else on the director's mind makes up the main storyline of a dizzying journey through his life. The movie is great to watch even without subtitles, just for its beautiful imagery and cinematography. For any real cinephile or anyone who just likes a good movie, I would recommend 8 1/2, though it will take some patience and will make you think. I still disagree with all of the criticism that it is ultra-confusing, and that an understanding of Fellini and his previous films is necessary to understand 8 1/2. It is simply a dazzling display of cinematic creativity, unlike any film I have seen recently, and ranks among my favorite films ever.</fullReview>

Why do I give this movie even a one on my persona 1-10 scale? That is also simple. There is at least a measure of genius at work when one can unleash 138 minutes worth of unadulterated crap and get people to lavish upon it grand measures of praise, simply because... well.. they think they are supposed to. "It's Fellini's masterwork" "all TRUE FILM fans must love this." I see all these grandiose comments and after having seen the movie I just had to laugh. Here is my rendition of what goes on in the mind of the trendy and oh so cool movie goer when seeing this movie. "I am so excited I have heard so much about this movie, I can hardly wait for the lights to dim... Oh boy here we go. Hmmmm. Man, I'm really not seeing much to this... zzzz zzzz zzzz zzzz zzz .. Oh sorry sir, I didn't realize the movie was over I'll leave right away. Well I must go to all my friends and rave about this movie. After all, Roger Ebert said it was one of the greatest movies of all time... Everyone on IMDb raves about it... it has to be great. I can't show my idiocy by letting anyone know how badly that 'film' blew." And so the myth gets propagated. It's a masterpiece because it's supposed to be. Well excuse me while I go break out my copy of House of 1000 corpses or Spiderman and actually spend some time being entertained rather than bored spitless. Spooky</fullReview>

It's a film that people tell you you should like, and it seems impressive and profound when you're a young lad studying film and don't yet have the courage to go against critical and popular opinion. But once you've gained some cinematic sophistication of your own, you realize what an empty-headed exercise it is.Federico Fellini is one of the most self-indulgent filmmakers who ever got behind a movie camera, and I simply don't have the interest or patience for the films of his later career. "8 1/2", again like "La Dolce Vita," is dazzling to sit through once, because it looks gorgeous and there's the promise that on a second viewing, once you're no longer distracted by the flamboyant and beautiful visuals, you'll be able to sink your teeth into the rich substance of the film. But then you realize that there isn't any substance, and the film's beauty is only, and sadly, skin deep. And then you're just cheesed that you wasted so much time on it in the first place....Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playful and Manipulative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This heretical extravaganza by Italian master Federico Fellini is cinematically inferior to La Dolce Vita -and arguably even Amacord- yet it remains Fellini's most authentic autobiographical testimony. Haunted by a creative block, director Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), escapes to an Italian resort, where he is aggressively pursued by his film crew and his rogue conscience. As in all of Fellini's works, the acting is subordinate to his direction, and the script is used simply as a medium for articulating his unsurpassed visual sensibilities. The film's slow-paced tediousness and Fellini's self-indulgence (the whole film is about him) will undoubtedly irritate many viewers, as will his unashamed chauvinist womanizing. Fellini, however, welcomes our outrage, carefully manipulating our emotions to a degree that few other filmmakers are capable of reaching. Overall, the film is a must-see for the genuine film devotee, but one must be in the right mood to enjoy it. Five 1/2 stars out of ten (one star solely dedicated to Claudia Cardinale's ethereal presence).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot, extravagant and obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, to start this off and be fair, I have to warn you that I am not a Fellini fan. This is to say, I don't dislike his films, but I don't love them either. Truffaut, Kurosawa, Ford and Kar-Wai all rank very highly in my heart, but not Fellini.Admittedly, this opinion was formed about 15 years ago, so I thought that maybe it was time to give it a second chance and see if my opinion changed with time, so I picked this one up (Criterion Collection DVD, to give it the best chances of success). Well, I find myself giving my 19-year-old mind more credit than before.My young adult mind has always found Fellini films interesting in pieces, but empty as a whole, and in particular his surreal dream sequences, to be self-extravagant pieces of nothingness that neither add nor subtract to the story, as being neither particularly deep nor particularly new. 8 1/2 confirmed this, starting with a scene in a crowd where the main character Guido Ansemi (Marcelo Mastrioanni) is stuck in a traffic jam and begins to drown in his car as others watch. He is then seen flying above the traffic jam, over the ocean, when suddenly his producer pulls a rope and brings him crashing to the sea. All of his dreams are basic, simple and straight out of Pysch 101. As an example, he has a sideshow magician as the creative side, and the critic therapist as his logical side, almost immediately, you know exactly what they represent and the enfolding seen is obvious, you know it's progression before it happens, so why not leave and get the popcorn. Even the famed sequence with all the women of his life both pampering him like a child and obeying his orders is pretty basic, and develops nothing of either the plot or the Guido's inner turmoil, merely restating what has already become obvious in the non-surreal world.After a while you get annoyed, the story is enough, and the interactions between the characters are actually quite funny, but suddenly, zip another dream sequence that in the end is redundant.I often felt that Fellini got away with this because of a naiveté we Americans have about Europeans, and thus Italians. `Ah, well the Italians are just that way', in terms of Fellini's sloppiness, and lack of any cohesion. But are they? Watch Cinema Paradiso, the Director's Cut, which is as tight and cohesive a film as you will ever watch, or even the neo-realists who delved into flights of Magical Realism, but in the end it always supported the plot. Fellini on the other hand, is all over the place, and perhaps this is where the film is most correct in having his creative side be the sideshow magician- he tricked everyone into making him an auteur.But again, this film is not a complete waste of time- the cinematography for this film is amazing, some of the best I have ever scene, and timeless, it is as stirring today as it was then, making the film age less then say, the French New Wave, and Marcelo Mastroanni is charming as Fellini's alter ego, Guido. His, and the other actors in the film give it an extra star.However, even given those pluses, I suspect that in the end, this film rates highly in many film polls because it is about film making, about a director in a creative crisis, and a much better movie in this genre would be Truffaut's Day for Night.I am glad I rented it, but I am also glad I that I only rented it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deeply personal and engaging, Fellini's story has an authenticityto it that is very unique. As we marvel at the method actors and oldAmerican films of the 50's &amp; 60's, it is in the foreign films duringthis era where the most impressive and innovative work wasbeing created (8 1/2 tops that list). I find films with stage-like acting, blatant morality, and little bits ofexciting action (like the American cinema of the 50's and 60's) tobe uncompelling. Personal stories are compelling. Personalstories that are well done and make the viewer feel what thefilmmaker feels are even better. And 8 1/2 has two personal stories. One story is the dilemma thelead faces: should he make another flashy, "hollywood" typemovie, or should he stay true to himself. The other personal storyis from the director himself. He's claustrophobic, caught in ahorrid web of making films that aren't true to what he FEELS isright. He must conform to producers' wishes; he must appeaseimportant people in the industry; he must make things flashy; hemust give away what he KNOWS is truth to survive in this industry. It is in Fellini's 8 1/2 where he and the main character of the filmsay, "Stop!" This personal story resonated with me. It subtly (and I can notstress any more the subtle quality of this film) spoke to me,instructing me to not follow what THEY expect. Do what you feelyou must do. Do what you feel that will fulfill your soul--not yourpocketbook, your sexual desires, or other pleasures. You can read my writing and that's fine, but you must see the filmbecause I am not doing Fellini's film any justice. It is in viewingthe film (and the long period after seeing it) that you will feel thepower of this film. As I am writing this review about 5 months afterseeing it, it has taken some time to settle in my head. Finally after5 months, the revelations of the film have settled, and I can nowfinally fully appreciate what Fellini has done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Journey of Federico Fellini to 8 1&#x2044;2"Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole, it would be about me." (Fellini, Holmes, 1965)This essay is going to analyze and determine how Fellini's directing style forms the narrative in 8 1&#x2044;2 (Federico Fellini, 1963, Italy). According to British Film Institute (BFI), 8 1&#x2044;2 is the 10th greatest film of all times (BFI, 2016). This film not only was critically acclaimed as an AVANT- GARDE piece of work in the 60's and even today but also had a considerable influence on the alternative ways that filmmakers tell a story. Analyzing the process of Fellini's approach in terms of directing this film helps us to understand how directors' decisions shape the unique narrative form of this movie. 8 1&#x2044;2 is known as Fellini's masterpiece. Using a new visual language, Fellini showed the psychological state of a character and used the medium of cinema in the manner of Freud's psychoanalysis chair. The narrative form of the film is completely rare and looks like an experimental film. However, the entire film, behavior of the actors, editing, dialogues, sound and etc. strangely feels familiar to the audience because it is an expression of the subconscious mind that we share. Fellini's works are highly influenced by psychoanalysts, especially Carl Jung (Murray 1990). In order to answer and understand the director's approach in 8 1&#x2044;2, we have to understand Fellini's style and 8 1&#x2044;2 itself. As a director who inspired by the NEO-realism of Italy, Fellini started his career as a filmmaker and used some elements of NEO-realism and fantasy into his films. His unique style is to play with the reality and fantasy. In order to analyze and recognize Fellini's style and evaluate how his style is presented in 8 1&#x2044;2, it is vital to consider two important elements of all his works; personal experience (memories and life experiences) and dreams. The aforementioned elements are always combined together in his films (Hayes 2005) Fellini introduced a new vocabulary and grammar for visual artwork by using the subconscious mind as the source of inspiration. He said: "What do we mean by inspiration? The capacity for making direct contact between your unconscious and your rational mind. When an artist is happy and spontaneous, he is successful because he reaches the unconscious and translates it with a minimum of interference... The transformation from dream to film takes place in the awakened conscious state, and it is clear that consciousness involves intellectual presumption which detracts from creativity."(Bondanella 2001) Fellini used many of his own life events and memories as the source of his filmmaking ideas. Dreams are the most influential element of Fellini's works and the way of understanding him and his style in directing and editing, is to consider the fact that he follows the rules of dreaming the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be an emotional roller-coaster ride. Many things are being said about the opening sequence. Terry Gilliam claims it to be the most important film sequence in his life, and I can see why. Like the overture of an opera, it captures all the conflict and all the drama that is laid out through the rest of the film. It grabs you and will not let you go anymore.It wasn't possible for me to sit through the first viewing, because I was too repulsed by all the sociable chatter in the first half of the film. I got the point Fellini wanted to make (I think), but I still couldn't take it. But the opening sequence was so incredible, that I decided to continue watching the film where I had last stopped. What I got was like a hot and cold shower.Alternating between the chaos and the madness that Guido's life is, and calm, isolated settings, the film comes at us like waves. In his more introspect moments, Guido is usually talking to a female character, and it is here that his visions and his demons are revealed to us. The way he opens up to his sister beneath the spaceship scaffolding reminds of the struggle of an artist who tries to create something personal which he beliefs will not only lift himself above everything, but others, too. His more stable sister just laughs at his pathos and self-pity.We also meet him as the egocentric, irresponsible character that he is. He discards women that do not physically attract him anymore with the strictness of a World War II general. Claudia Cardinale, his muse, confronts him with the sobering fact that he does not know how to love.It all culminates in a press conference that Guido is forced to attend because his producer is putting the pressure on him. Facing the whirlwind of questions from the reporters, and having no answers, he decides to escape by crawling beneath the table and shoot himself. Whether it is fantasy or reality, we don't know, and it doesn't seem important. The movie ends on an up because Guido somehow manages to find a way out of his isolation and to embrace the people, characters and collaborators that accompany and form his life.A very personal film. I think the opening sequence will be a good indicator whether you will relate to it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i think this is my favorite movie from Fellini, because hit me in the topics that i like. I like to see when the dreams or things related to these are very important in a movie, (remember Mulholland Dr.), in many parts of the movie is difficult to recognize what is a dream and what is the real life of the protagonist. The story of this movie is really good, but bizarre, and for me it was very enjoyable. This movie was a unexpected journey in how strong are the feelings in the life of the protagonist, i think the movie develops from this point, but this is an atypical movie because the way it is told, the dreams tell us what is really the protagonist, and see the mix between dreams, real life and feelings in the story is simple and awesome.

He is haunted by surreal dreams, memories, fantasies, and the many women of his life. Claudia (Claudia Cardinale) is his movie starlet. He flails to film a sci-fi movie building giant scaffoldings for a grand scene.This is a wondrously imaginative rambling mess. Fellini is indulging in some self-examinations. Marcello Mastroianni is sophistication personified. I've seen this a couple of times. As a plot, I want him to get the film made. It's frustrating to keep going on detours getting nowhere in the filming. As individual vignettes, they are great to be dissected. There are some terrific surrealism. Taken as a whole, it left me in awe, dizzy, confused and a little frustrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching Fellini for first time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with I want to declare something. I don't know yet if this movie is a masterpiece or garbage. So I will tell you my opinion about this film and I hope that I will conclude with a decision .First of all the movie is about a famous director in Italy who is coming up with a new movie. Then he gives his synopsis of his movie in a critic to assess it and he tells him that is awful and the characters are dark and confusing. Thus he suggests him not to direct this movie because he will destroy him career and the director goes by.As a matter of fact I can say that Fellini was undecided about 8 ? and he tries to show his thoughts. Fellini is impersonated by Guido Anselmi. We can see the behavior of people in the decade of 1960. I am glad to see that the cinematography has been evolving since then comparing with my country that never developed at the same level. The other thing I want to discuss is that : Fellini is a left or right- wing?. He endorses the role of church ,especially catholic church, about the excessive lifestyle of pure that faithful need to follow in order to go to the ''Paradise''. I can see from this movie that Fellini was intellectual and too front from his time. The way that thoughts emerge from his film is fantastic. 8 ? is a film that will make you think things. As a matter of fact we can see Guido's producer caring not for the quality of his scenery but only money. Fellini disapproves this and he is positive to quality cinematography and not the commercial in which the one thing that cares everyone is how many tickets will be cut.Fellini's love for circus is obvious. The last scenes were very good taken and I understood that circus keeps director in a good mode. Even if he ashamed on the reporters and his film will not be done he doesn't lose his amusement of circus. So, in the end, you will ask me : ''Is Fellini represented by Guido? '' The answer is yes. I believe that Fellini decided to direct this movie just to show his thoughts and the in whole the general statement that predominates in the decade of '60.Finishing I want to inform you that Fellini was in Christian democracy which was a political party with right ? wing ideas. Despite this in this party belonged both right and left ? wing people. Moreover DC characterized by factionalism and by the double adherence of members at the party in which a very important role was playing the affect from individual leaders who the majority contributed both ( right and left ? wing ) ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark in filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1960 Federico Fellini released La Dolce Vita, a film that received wide-spread praise. It unanimously won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival, and was nominated for four academy awards. After its release, there was a lot of pressure on Fellini to make his next film. But there was one small problem, he had no idea what he wanted to do. Fellini had a terrible case of writers block, and the pressure from the general public and the studios wasn't helping. Eventually Fellini decided to make a film about the only thing he really knew, himself. As if the plot of the film wasn't meta enough already, the title took it a step further, Fellini named it 8 1/2. Fellini named it his because, by his count, he had made seven and a half films before, so this would be his eight and half. About as good a name as any I suppose. I said that 8 1/2 was about Federico Fellini, but what does that mean? Well 8 1/2 tells the story of Guido Anselmi (played by Marcello Mastroianni, who played the protagonist in La Dolce Vita), a film director who has no idea what his next film is going to be. (Sound familiar) If all of that wasn't enough, Federico Fellini makes several clever references to his previous films. For example in one scene a character is talking to Guido about his film, and the character describes it as a serious of gratuitous images without any central conflict. This is a reference to Fellini's previous film La Dolce Vita. And in another scene two characters are conversing with each other when Guido comes in, and then one of the two says that Guido doesn't know how to make a love films, this could be a reference to either Nights of Cabiria or La Dolce Vita, both of which have twisted love stories. Or the comment about love films could even be referencing 8 1/2, after all Guido fails at every relationship with a women that he has in the film. It would be a nearly impossible task to try and name every single instance of 8 1/2 referencing itself, Fellini, or any of Fellini's past films. 8 1/2 is probably the first film to be meta. Yes there were films like Man With a Movie Camera, that acknowledged the fact that they were films, but there was nothing like 8 1/2. Every single scene in 8 1/2 has some sort of comment on the film industry, the director, or even the film itself. A good example of 8 1/2's self-referencing comes when Guido describes the opening of his new film to a young actress, Guido then describes something that is suspiciously similar to the opening to 8 1/2, and in that very same scene Guido admits to the girl that there really is no film. The way this scene is structured, and what it means, is mind-blowing to say the very least. First Guido, who represents Fellini, describes the beginning of his film and that description matches 8 1/2, so Guido's film, is Fellini's 8 1/2, and then Guido says that there is no film, which then forces the audience to question what they're watching. And that's just one small scene in the film. 8 1/2 is one of the most influential films of all time, because it basically invented the "meta film," or "self-referencing film" a genre that is still quite popular today.I spent most of this review talking about 8 1/2's genius meta structure, and have neglected to mention all of its other great aspects. Marcello Anselmi is one of the greatest actors of all time, and his role as Guido is one of his best. The transformation is so natural, and believable, that you actually think that he is a director who can't make a film. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the lighting in the film. The cinematography was shot by Gianna Di Venanzo, who also did Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits, and Michelangelo Antonio's La Notte and L'Eclisse. The film also has some interesting ideas about religion. First of all Guido, who again represents Fellini, is talking with a priest, and the priest asks him if the film, which again represents 8 1/2, is religious in nature and Guido's reply is, in a way. Later in the film when Guido is in the sauna, he is invited to see the bishop. What follows is a dark macabre montage of Guido descending deeper into the underground sauna to go see a bishop in a way that can't help but feel like Guido is descending into the depths of hell. During the filming of 8 1/2, Fellini kept a sticker on the camera that said, "remember this is a comic film." Fellini didn't want his experimental film of self-discovery to bore or depress audiences, because after all, even with how much I've been saying 8 1/2 is about Fellini, it is really about much more than it. Yes it is extremely personal, Fellini's most personal film actually. (well this or Amarcord.) But 8 1/2 is also about the creative process and if there is any real point to any of it. 8 1/2 lived up to the high expectations that had been placed on Fellini's next film. It was nominated for five academy awards including best director and screenplay, and won two. (Best costume design, and best foreign language film.) 8 1/2 is landmark in filmmaking, it was one of the first films to ever question why people make films, and if it is worth it.9.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, watching this movie really felt like a ride on a roller coaster. What a tedious ascent at the beginning to grasp what was going on there on the screen. Did I do right by stepping into this cart? Then on top you can already see a bit clearer and you start feeling comfortable to be taken along in the cart only to become surprised again and again by unexpected bends and loops that still make you dizzy until you realize in the end that the roller coaster is in fact a closed circle where all the parts fit together. After having digested the heavy meal one feels eager to take another ride in order to find out whether this time the dizziness will become less and in fact, it is so: details become visible that one could not capture before.Giving it a second thought it is quite surprising that the understanding of the movie does not come easier since the film is working in exactly the same way as our brains. Reality, memories, daydreams and real dreams, doubts, fears and wishful thinking all have their share and interfere with each other without warning. Actually, we are sitting in Guido's brain but we watch him from the outside. Hence, sometimes it is up to the viewer to decide whether something is fantasy or reality. Is Claudia, Guido's ideal woman, a real person or just an always-welcome daydream? Well, I think, she is most likely to be Guido's idealized image of a real person. Why would otherwise the ideal woman turn out to be a disappointment or at least very much the same and demanding as all the other people. Disillusionment, however, can also make free ? Is this what the movie suggests in its final scene? From Guido's perspective, most probably, the story line is less confusing than for the spectator, since he is sitting in his own brain, but I guess also for him it is still tiresome.Marcello's performance in its style of underacting is brilliant one more time. He actually does so little to express the emotions of his characters. He does just enough to feel with him and by doing not more than that, it feels very convincing at the same time.Master Fellini at its best. If you can relate to demanding story telling you should definitely give it a try. Yes, it is old, but for masterpieces time is no factor ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 1/2 is film of great visual expression but lacking a coherent narrative because Fellini made a film that mixed fantasy and reality especially those sequences with music which highlighted the new wave European cinema of the time that British and USA film- makers were in awe of.The title 8 1/2 refers to the fact by this time Fellini had made seven films and two short segments. The film is loosely autobiographical with Marcello Mastroianni playing Guido who is on a career high having come off a successful film. He is now struggling with his creative juices as actors demand work from him, producers want him to make the next hit movie and there is his messy private life with a wife, a mistress and fantasies of keeping a harem where he tries to keep the women at bay. There are also his recollections of events in his childhood managing a church upbringing and his early desires such as the dancing with the wild woman on the sands.The film has a lot of symbolism, it has been compared to James Joyce's novel Ulysses and it has also been influential, I can see the 2015 Best Oscar Picture winner, Birdman owes a debt to Fellini's 8 1/2. What I found was despite the artistic excellence the filmed lacked heart and it did not keep me focused, the reason being I am watching this film over five decades later where the structure of films have changed and you see movies with symbolism, a flowing story and visuals all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let go and give yourself over to Fellini, it's best that way. Fighting for meaning will only result in frustration. Some films need to seep into your dreams to bloom - this is one of those.Give it to your subconscious and let the imagery unfold and reveal the contemplations without the mental gymnastics. This IS a very straight forward film if you let it be and it begs for conversation so see it with someone that will enjoy a few hours of intellectual stretching. Fellini has grown on me but it took the interviews on the Criterion La Strada disc to make that happen. I highly recommend these if you're new to Fellini,they answer some of the questions a first time viewer could fall into without spoiling the films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guido is a burnt out film director who is being hassled by everyone about his next film to follow the success of his previous one. The trouble is that he is suffering from a creative block and can't come up with any ideas. As he faces doubts and eons from the outside and from within, he retreats into dreams, fantasies and memories.Said to be a semi-autobiographical picture of the director, 8 1/2 is a fascinating picture of an harried life, a need for escape and a strange surrealism in which the boundary between the real and the unreal is blurred. In fact, this blurring is done well enough that it is sometimes difficult for the viewer to distinguish reality in this film's universe, perhaps reflecting Guido's own confusion and delusions, and this is one of the things that I like best about it.Reasonably acted, nicely filmed, and with the lovely Barbara Steele playing a supportive role, I have enjoyed this on each occasion on which I have viewed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Oscar nominated director Federico Fellini (La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, Amarcord), this Italian film that featured in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book serves as probably the most personal of Fellini's films, the title is something to do with the amount he made, or something like that. Basically famous film director Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) is in the process of filming his latest picture, a science fiction film with commentary on Catholicism, it is potentially his most personal film as well. However, having had great success with his last picture, all he really wants is to have peace and relax, but this becomes very difficult with many acting and filmmaking staff coming to him, and he has lost his enthusiasm and artistic vision for the project. Wrestling with his conscience, personal demons and stress, Guido escapes these factors by entering his subconscious and having flashbacks to his childhood and relationships, and he imagines how certain situations could go in his mind. He tries in his real existence to relax at the spa, while also attending shoots at the sets, having sometimes odd encounters with his wife Luisa (Anouk Aimée) who he does not fully understand, his mistress Carla (Sandra Milo) who he does not love as much as his spouse, and actress Claudia (Claudia Cardinale) who ultimately gives him salvation. His imagination and fantasies become so intertwined with reality that he and you as the audience almost question what is real and what is not, or what would you like to be real and what would you not. Also starring Rossella Falk as Rossella, Barbara Steele as Gloria Morin, Mario Pisu as Mario Mezzabotta, Guido Alberti as Producer and Jean Rougeul as Writer. Mastroianni gives a marvellous performance who has numerous unwanted confrontations with those in his personal and working life while escaping into his subconscious, I will admit I did get confused by the dreaming and fantasy concept, but then I think that is the point of the film, to confuse you and make you question things, and this serves as a near autobiography about Fellini, it is a most watchable comedy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>81/2 is a movie about making a movie and not knowing what you are making is the way I would describe this movie. 81/2 is like watching a brilliant mathematician work you do not know what going on but you know you are watching something great happen. That is what it felt like to me watching this movie. I saw it in French and could not read and follow what was happening on the screen at the same time because of the way the film just kind of jumps from scene. 81/2 is one that you would need to watch a few time it get everything in it. This movie jumps around so much that I do not even know how to describe what I saw. The movie is about a director who has been given the money to make a movie because he is a big shot but the director has the equivalent of a break down, because he does not know what to make or how to make it. Through the movie, the presser for him to finish the movie builds. Ending with him getting under a table and shooting himself. The end of the movie I don't understand either that is just the entire cast walking playing like they were in a marching band at the circus. End the end the movie was something great but will I ever understand what it was or how and why Federico Fellini came up with the idea to make a movie this way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>unlike many viewers i've watched nine before 8 1/2 and because i loved it i thought i had to see the original. I was expecting a masterpiece and usually i get disappointed with such high expectations but still Fellini's magic totally captured me into his unique world.The film tells us a simple story about a great director who is so confused, falling under the pressure of film producers, press and of the people in his life while his subconscious is relating his actions to his memories and desires.The greatest thing about this film is that there are no apparent lines between what's real and what's fantasy, unlike films like nine, big fish and finding neverland; this is a film that simply offers you some vision that doesn't require knowing where reality ends and fantasy begins. it happens all the time, so simply, so swiftly and surprisingly it is not confusing either. it just fits.The main theme of the film is about confusion, and the greatest question that is there is, what if my confusion is what defines me? what if my confusion is what makes me what i am? can it then be accepted? I can go on forever about this film, so i'll try to add just one more comment, you have to see Saraghina, the best casting i've ever seen in any film.In short, you have to see this film, if you don't like it you'll not loose a lot,just the 130 mins runtime, but if you like it, it will amaze you, it will easily go to your all-time favorite list and it will haunt you to come back and watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic philosophy on the purpose of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many different ways to look at Federico Fellini's masterpiece, "8 1/2," and the one you choose ultimately determines how well you understand and enjoy the film. There are broad lenses that capture the bigger picture of fictional film director Guido Anselmi's creative block and the tighter lenses that zero in on Fellini's creative choices during imaginary sequences and their underlying messages. For the average viewer, the big picture lens -- if you can keep that perspective the entire length of the film -- will earn the more favorable response. It's the artist, however, anyone who watches this film that has struggled to create, ever, who will love it most.With the title actually referring to the number of films Fellini had made, "8 1/2" is clearly a personal endeavor. It is an acting out of his own personal struggles as an artist by having his main character imagine his own struggles. Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) has a number of women in his life -- a wife, mistress, a couple actresses -- even brief acquaintances that have stuck with him somehow. Juggling them all in his mind, he tries to make sense of them all together but can't do it without favoring certain ones and his attempt to use this as the basis for his film fails him.He also wants to create something meaningful to people -- something truthful. Nothing purely escapist, but still effectively consoling. Holding himself to this standard, he is able to achieve nothing artistically with regard to his "upcoming film," completely unable to satisfy himself, his producer or anyone else in his life for that matter. The result of "8 1/2" is a discussion of the purpose and role of art. Is it purposeful or purposeless? Meaningful or ultimately meaningless? The surrealist quality of the film reflects the chaos of addressing that very subject. There is a futility in attempting to create art that fully and completely encompasses and reflects truth and reality and that in itself is the point of art. It's the beginning of what could be an endless discussion and that's yet another characteristic of exceptional art.Fellini has made this discussion come to life in an evocative way and one that is just as cognizant of relationship drama as it is about relationships being artistic inspiration. There are countless aspects to analyze as a result and it makes "8 1/2" one of those "Film Studies 101" movies~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Portrait of the artist as a ring master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guido is stuck with writer's block. The world renown film director much to the dismay of his producers is spending lavishly on his next project and it doesn't even have a finished script. Retreating to a spa to recharge he is harassed by backers, the press, actresses wondering what their parts are, mistresses and ghosts from the past. From all the demands put upon him Guido state of confusion increases and he retreats even further. Federicco Fellini's 8 1/2 is a stunning cinematic achievement of seismic proportions. Sliding seamlessly between reality and surreality throughout Fellini's camera never rests as it gracefully pans and tracks through dream like sets moving in and out of the light transporting Guido from present to past, conscious to subconscious. It's a story about failure but Fellini literally creates a circus atmosphere to turn the tragedy into a melancholy comedy filled with clownish gargoyles, buoyantly prodded along by Nino Rota's joyous score. Clearly auto-biographical Fellini does not shy away from making Guido self absorbed, chauvinistic and insensitive much of the time but an exhausted looking Marcello Mastroianni plays him with such a charming impishness and fatigue it remains impossible not to sympathize. His battles with censors, producers, the Church and his obsession with women are vividly interwoven into the flow of the film which over a two and a half hour running time never takes a breath as the remarkable cinematography of Gianni DiVenzano transitions smoothly from one striking composition to the next changing POV from objective to subjective within shots.8 1/2 is cinema ballet of the first rank. The form is a perfect display of syntax employing no lab added dissolves or transitions as it moves through time and space presenting provocative tableaux awash in ambiguity and concrete symbolism. The story itself may be a tragedy (imagine it a Bergman : Sawdust and Tinsel ) but in the hands and audacious styling of ring master Fellini it becomes a bittersweet celebration of life as eye popping imagery and odd looking characters march across the stage mocking his crisis. Fellini wasn't the first to introduce surrealism to film but he sure bumped it up a notch with 8 1/2. His and its liberating influence over succeeding generations of filmmakers is well documented having been exhaustively emulated from present day masters to college film students. Time (and incessant imitation) has not lessened its impact in any way. It remains a tour de force work of cinema magic that merits comparison to Welle's Citizen Kane. 8 1/2 is as good as it gets.</fullReview>

Maybe I studied it deeply, so I can see all the subtle (or not so subtle) metaphors in it. And I can understand how people that goes to the movies in order to see absurd fight scenes and "a lot of action", or happy ending's love stories can find it boring. But I cannot accept people saying it is "junk", or "crap", etc. etc. Who are them? You can criticize. You can call it "self indulgent". But only for the camera and photography work, it deserves a high note. Even if you are so closed-minded you cannot see all the rest.

		<fullReview>I would definitely suggest watching this movie after reading the Republic by Plato, which I did. There is a lot of philosophy in this movie. I payed attention very closely, which you need to and I love doing for great movies. There is a lot to the meaning of life, but its also what you take out of it. I can definitely see how Fellini influenced David Lynch. Both of them never want to tell what there movies are about because, well first no one would understand them, and second because that takes away from the movie what he is trying to do, and he shows this through the work of the director in the movie. I don't think that the movie inside the movie is what is needed to pay attention but the movie as a whole. Like the ending when everyone is in a circle and holding hands, that is kind of cheesy. Right before that happened the guy in the the car with the director said that the movie could have ended right there, hes trying to tell you something. Also, its not the director in the movie that you need to pay attention to but Fellini and what he is trying to say. I loved how none of the directors friends knew what the movie was about, they were all asking him to describe it while everyone wanted to be in the movie. Everyone is always asking him, not themselves, what it means when they should be looking more deeper into it. At the end, when he supposedly kills himself and is in the car he very distinctively listens to the two construction workers and how they describe it, with the truth of the vision that he saw. Now he is finally happy because someone actually gets him. You may have to look hard or close to find someone that actually gets you but when you find it peace comes. Also I like when the director was talking to his girlfriend and said that she likes movies with nothing, and his movie is going to have everything in it, which is actually nothing. Sometimes the greatest movies are about nothing, because you can take your own interpretation to make it as great as it can be. There are many great lines in this movie that made me think a lot. In the beginning there are some people talking about TV shows and wondering if it is just for entertainment or is it to actually make you think. Well this film really does make me think a whole lot and I would definitely watch this many more times to come and see what my interpretation of this would be again.</fullReview>

In the dream you have producers and various department heads all hounding you for final casting decisions and or approval on trivial details you could care less about. What you do seem to be concerned with is woman...all woman. Woman in the myriad roles they have played in your life. If your dream was something like that only in black and white with everyone speaking Italian and looking extra hip then you have some idea what the movie 8 1/2 is like...sorta. Its a film that is certainly concerned with dreams and or nightmares that bleed into the waking state. Marcello Mastroianni portrays a protagonist who seems to be a passive participant in a nightmare of his own making. That nightmare being an artist out of ideas. The film seems to be a subconscious search for why the ideas have stopped...it has something to do with woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched many of Fellini's movies, I got ready to see 8 ?, probably his most famous work but, at the same time, the most psychological, unique, extremely specific movie where "religion of psyche and inner experience" reach the climax. While there are viewers who claim that it is one of the very best films ever made, there are also people who find it extremely weird and "unendurable." As there are such discrepancies among very learned audience, can we claim that this is a masterpiece or can we simply state that it's an individual movie understood by mere minority? Is 8 ? bound to be a masterpiece for some little elite group? Since this movie is a manifestation of personal art and artistic life, it can be analyzed at various levels, particularly the psychological one. Fellini at hardly any other moment, focused on the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung and his dream theory so much as here. 8 ? is a true exploration of "inner space," something that Jung analyzed. Throughout, we see the need for catharsis, for purification from social disorder, prejudice, fear adapted in religion and the upsetting impact of closed answers for everything. In other words, catharsis from all that comes from "outer space." What brings the relief? On the one hand, it is a beautiful girl at a source Claudia (Claudia Cardinale) who gives Guido (Marcello Mastroianni), the main character, a glass of fresh water. On the other hand, it is pure art from within the psyche deprived of all unnecessary limitations and condensations, just the one that can address humanity. The final symbolic procession of all characters appears to represent that salvation of art... Yes, symbols... they are another Jung's concept in which the director ranges from a dream, through fantasy to very personal memories and images. It all gains its realization in forgiveness, acceptance and self assessment. In this case, the key aspect is the presence of various characters.The characters, except for the director Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) with whom Fellini absolutely identifies, can be divided into two groups: the ones derived from his own memories and fantasies (at the same time belonging to Guido's inner space) and the ones Guido meets on his way of life and career. The people from the latter group all the time want something from him... they are mostly the staff of the film and audience who constantly want something from a director. Starting with his authoritative parents through the "diabolic" Saraghina, the wife Luisa, colleague Conocchio, the magician with his slogan "Buona Fortuna", conservative cardinal, sensual Carla to Claudia, a cure... they all, in spite of own shortcomings, have something to offer. The quintessential of Guido's-Fellini's interpretation of those characters are the words said in the middle of the film: "The world is too chaotic to have people of crystal minds." At the end, he accepts them all, he realizes every individual brought something to his life and invites them all to the "procession."However, like in all of his other films, Fellini also develops the social aspect. He never takes up escapist themes (listening to his mother who warns "Where are you escaping?") but has enough courage to address them critically. So here we get such themes like crowd pressure, blind assaults of paparazzi, strong superstitions of the Catholic Church... they all need recovery. Yet, some of these aspects are on the verge of serious controversy where Fellini becomes too subjective. Guido has a polemical argument against the Church referring to the conception of an artistic work. There is a visit at the cardinal's where Guido is prepared for a serious debate. However, all is soon interrupted by a mystical human cry of a bird. Here, one could draw a conclusion that the Church is not mature, it believes in myths and legends and higher intellectual horizons result in its escapist attitude. This controversy goes further and addresses the guilt of carnal sins in a young boy. Guido moves in his memories to his youth and the dance of La Saraghina, a harlot, a "diabolic" woman who constitutes visually carnal pleasure for the boys terrorized in the Catholic school. Then, priests inform parents and shocked mothers sit outrageously at the big picture of Dominic Savio, the symbol of chasten puberty. Finally, what is the fate of all who placed themselves "extra Ecclesiam"?But 8 ? cannot be treated seriously throughout. Although it is a psychological work, the movie is also manifestation of art executed in wonderful performances, profound images and excellent music by Nino Rota. The performances are perfect from great Marcello Mastroianni in the lead through Anouk Aimee as Guido's wife, Mario Conocchio as the producer, Sandra Milo as Carla to beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Claudia. In one of the most beautiful scenes, we see the closeup of her face which leads Guido to appreciation and a blissful prelude to salvation. I loved the musical pieces by Nino Rota, especially in the opening sequences but also at the end. The most memorable scenes in this movie, for me, were two: Guido in the recovery resort meeting various people there waiting for water and the harem scene which is very courageous for the 1960s but which very well depicts a man's desirous states for Jung's "anima" - a female.If someone asks me which is the most symbolic of Fellini's films, I will not hesitate to answer it is 8 ? (OTTO E MEZZO). Why? Because it is the Fellini's film and the film about Fellini, about his inner space, his personal, vague and mysterious "Asa Nisi Masa." See this and accept it as it is, in accordance with Fellini/Guido's request, and you'll find a masterful insight into a mind. The mind that, definitely, you don't have to agree with, but the one which asks you to be accepted for these 130 minutes. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guido Anselmi,Claudia,Luisa Anselmi,Carla ...\Still,my heart,or the dreamlike harem of Federico Fellini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A musical,eerie modulation of time,time molded in music?that is,in timelessness.This film is,indeed,one of the best metaphysical 'divertissements. It is,indeed,a scandal that after several decades,the surrealist work of FF remains still not very liked.When did FF's surrealism begin?In a certain sense,it is this movie that was received as the manifesto of FF's surrealist poetry.In various ways,almost unwillingly,I always come to test Averty's beautiful and meaningful word?yes,father Averty,FF was a director that never failed;that never made a bad movie.FF's surrealism is also a kind of irony?and irony implies romanticism,and the heart.And so,FF,one of the few cinematographic poets of the heart?of the direct poetry of the heart,remained one in his surrealist works?this means that his surrealism came in the direct prolongation of his previous stylistic choice, and is but a development of it?throughout his career,there is but one single FF.For those who still do care about surrealism's fate in cinema and in art,8 ? is a chart,a matchless one.In one certain scene,MM is in a necropolis. The first comparison that came to my mind was what else but the Spanish master,Luis Bu?uel.Like FF,Luis Bu?uel also had a very tortuous relation with Catholicism,etc.;yet,a capital difference subsists?LB's existential premise is an endless joy.The man was,fortunately, ascetic and frugal?and his work expresses this endless joy,on a vital and corporeal level?a very Spanish thing ?.Fellini's gist is a secret heartrending.This is the difference between them.Bunuel's necropolis was about the supernatural,I think,or,at least,about the enigma,the supernatural's enigma, while Fellini's is about the secret tears that ...I don't know--that traverse the heart--that transfix it.8 1/2 has not the silent and esoteric jubilation of The Voice of the Moon ,Juliet of the Spirits and Amarcord,nor the affectionate and caressing, witty, bitter,sometimes almost cheerful,tone of Intervista . 8 1/2 is bitter,colossal, rancorous and piercing.It inaugurates the style of the notebook;nothing here is,though,introduced at random.And then,there is also Saraghina's dance and anecdote,and the obvious defects of the Catholic education,and FF's hatred,and his acerbic anti-clericalism?the testimony of an intelligent and amazing man .Fellini mocks the sacrament of the confession;but he did not understand,I see,that this is the man's chance to exert freely the all-powerful mercy of God?that a man is allowed,for the benefit of his brothers,to dispose of the mercy of God, in an unrestricted way ?--if Fellini would of understood this,he surely would of liked it?that a man can forgive with the mercy of God.8 ? is FF's first very important,very strong charge against the Church. We are in '63.The Church is under siege.The Germanic prelates already accomplish its undermining,in the name of some empty words.In the '60s,Fellini directed only a few movies?5,and a sketch in the same surrealist vein.From '63 on,he is a pure surrealist.This second birth of the European surrealism passed,as such,,after all unnoticed.The philistines preferred to simply ignore this sample of pure surrealism:8 ?,and its astounding and unmatched intellectual virility.And that awesome collection of fabulous women (Claudia Cardinale,Anouk Aimée,Sandra Milo,Barbara Steele,Madeleine LeBeau).Guido's harem.The portrait of a sexually evasive man.This delicious,enchanting flirting with women means being evasive.This film,so fresh,so unconventional,seems made yesterday?today.It does not look ?it is not a film of the '60s;it is a film of today.These things are magical ?;they were filmed in the heart.What about this heartache draped ,wrapped, couched in irony and in the secret fluctuations of the time?One can refuse its concept,yes (the movies is yet,today as always, refused by the Ozu crowd);but no one can deny that it develops fully that concept.That it is an achievement within its intentions.It reverses that suffering and exhaustion that formed the substance of his previous films.It results that the surrealism is the form these sufferings take when considered in themselves .FF does not tell a story to express this illness;on the contrary,he tells the illness itself, directly (that is,independently from a narrative frame),emancipating it from the narration.All his previous movies were traversed by this wintry gale;his characters huddled in those nihilistic subtly decadent movies full of a furious irony,a potty outdistancing.With 8 1/2,FF goes beyond a threshold.Intead of labeling FF one way or another,it is more important to be able to classify each of his works in relation to the others--in their mutual relations.Labeling an author is but a preliminary and wanton phase of the critical thought;what matters,instead,is to elucidate one work's place within the ensemble.Anyway,how silent are all movies about the meek and the humble,about simplicity and the hope that takes man beyond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be easy to be put off by the oft cited notion that this is a difficult film to watch and understand - it really isn't.A successful filmmaker reaches crisis point when he is forced to seek meaning in both his his overindulged personal life and his career. Just like his film, the theme of which even he isn't sure of, his life is full of a cast of characters - from home life, school, church, loves - from whom he has taken but given very little in return As he tries to figure out the point of his latest, somewhat autobiographical film project, his mind takes him on a reverie of memories, fantastical ideals and a search for meaning.In the end, the beautiful and elusive young actress he wants for his movie but who seems to be about the only woman who is not in thrall to his charm, points out that his main character (essentially him) is an empty man incapable of love, for whom no one can feel sympathy.It would seem that, ultimately, his anxiety stems from the fact that he (the director), whilst still being indulged by actors, producers, friends, the Church and women, realises that he really has nothing particularly profound to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i begin to watch "8?" ( Movie that much says as Fellini's masterpiece - Although that other much says that is "La Notti di Cabiria") I don't think that this was a movie that impressed me. I think that this was a movie that i have to see, but sincerely i don't have any encourage to see. But when i finished to see "8?", this thought abruptly changes.The movies about movies are very difficult to make and see, because can be perfect and awesome or can be boring and wasted. " 8?" is an awesome movie. And at this moment i only have sen two work of Fellini: This one and "La Dolce VIta", but the both makes a similar effect with me. I know that i must see another great ones of him, like "Amarcord" , "La Notti di Cabiria", "La Strada", "Roma" and "Satyricon". But at this moment i think that Fellini (With Pier Paolo Pasolini, Tim Burton, Luis Bu?uel, D.W Griffith and Rainer Werner Fassbinder ) is one of the most important and best directors that i have ever seen. The story of " 8?" is about Guido, a director who wants to make a new film. But this time it won't be so easy." 8?" is one - With "All That Jazz"- of the few movies that told in a harrowing way the artist life, and how it can intervene with all the people, family and privacy, for good and for bad. "8?" is a slow but very, very interesting movie about the feelings of a filmmaker, told it sometimes in a surrealistic way that makes us treble, second by second, direct to a touching, cozy and unexpected ending. With Marcello Mastronioni (As Guido), Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimée, Sandra Milo, Rossela Falk and Barabara Steele.If is also one of the best movies ever made, is too an exciting trip through life, disappointments, loves and passions of -maybe- any real artist.*Sorry for the mistakes, well ... if there any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching "Nights of Cabiria" I really wanted to see this movie. I searched a lot to find but eventually I got one. In the end I have a feeling that is so satisfied and enjoyable that brings a gentle smile on my face.According to me movie starts of a little abruptly but eventually grips you and even haunts you in various scenes. It is very hard to show the mistakes you have done and a special praise too. There are lots of small things which are so innocent that you fall in love with them right away like the one scene in which one of Guido's co-workers asks him to say something harsh as he used to be. Not only this, the confrontation between Guido and Luisa and the full scene in which he shown that he has problems with not only his wife but with all.And music, it is soothing rhythmic and above all in sync with the movie. Acting is very good; especially Guido and Luisa rest is pretty OK.Now the direction: one of the most accomplished work I ever watched and very handsomely done.A must watch.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's shiniest gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini delivered an excellent and very personal film about how a filmmaker can sometimes be trapped between the people around him, a hard personal life that usually comes with the business and the difficulties to sometimes get artistic achievements. Marcello Mastroianni gives an excellent performance mirroring Fellini himself and the direction is excellent, sometimes making this film looks like some kind of ballet. The story is a bit confusing at first, making a little bit harder for the viewer what is truth and what's fantasy, but when you understand, you're rewarded. One of the best films of all time. 100/100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Otto e Mezzo" by Federico Fellini is about a film director who finds himself unable to complete the process of creating the ultimate masterpiece, a movie that is designed to represent his will to the world. The movie title symbolizes a miscarriage, because, unlike a mother, who, after 9 months of pregnancy, gives birth to her child, Guido is unable to finalize his project and kills himself when feeling at odds with the people around him and his own creation. But the failure to create the most impressive movie is just a pretext for Fellini to show that, although we may seem to fail in our lives, we are not flawed as long as we do not fail the second test and we are able to understand ourselves and the world around us after we pass away. Art cannot be seen as the giant spaceship, there is no art as long as Guido is confused, true art emerges when Guido is able to re-create his life, when he is able to understand what he has been through, when Guido can truly tell his tale. An argument to the fact that the film director physically dies and doesn't only suffer a spiritual death only to be reborn, cured and with a deeper understanding of his art, are the numerous symbols that appear only twice in the movie like: the peas, the resemblance between the boy in front of the council of priests and the mature man in the sauna, the wine bath and all the parallels drawn between childhood, youth and maturity. The film director actually dies at the beginning of the movie, but, instead of being allowed to observe the world from a superior position, he is dragged back to his life and he is forced to re-live it- see the fall into the ocean. He rememorizes his life from the moment of his birth, represented by his parents being together in the cemetery and the fact that he doesn't yet recognize their faces, as a fetus cannot remember a face simply because it is protected by a natural wall, the womb. After that come the memories about his childhood, youth, maturity, we are actually shown that he seems to have met many people at the spa before the time of the movie. The spa is in fact his collection of memories, his conscience, as every person and every detail resonates deeply in his soul. He is treated with spring water and seems to be the only one who enjoys its benefits (Carla falls ill after consuming the same liquid) and this water cures him, he is filled with water until he is freed from his memories and the water inside him balances the pressure of the outside ocean and osmosis, the merge between inside and outside is realized, only then he is free and able to choose to truly integrate into his past life, he can understand and he is capable of loving. The scene at the beginning at the movie is not cruel, as all the people around him are unable to understand why he does not want to be freed and gain access to a a superior existence. Nor is the human kite image a sadistic one, as Guido has to dive once again into the ocean of memories before being purified and offered the gift of flying. The mysterious girl that marks his way -the name Guido makes us think of a spineless and confused person, as Rosalla says when at the table with him and his wife, the beautiful, pure, young girl is his guardian angel, the daughter of the gatekeeper, she is the one to offer him the first glass of miraculous water and she is the one that delivers him from this world after the car ride at the end of the movie. Claudia also embodies perfection in life and in art( the after-life) and that is why Guido follows her and it is only with her that he discusses inmost things, it is only she that distillates his thoughts with her sheer presence. The film speeds up as we advance into the plot. If, at the beginning, all the characters are presented separately and their relation to the central character is clearly distinguished, towards the second half of the movie, the perspectives crowd and the plot becomes more intricate, culminating with the harem scene which can also be perceived as a precursor to Guido's death and the scene before Guido committing suicide. The film director seems unable to control his own creation, but in fact these are the moments when all confusions mix only to give way to demagogic understanding and to perfect harmony. The idea of circus that appears for several times in the movie is meant to suggest that life is a human comedy which is prevented from becoming a tragedy by the final revelations and the acceptance of one's inner self. If, during the movie, the crowd seems to irritate the central character, who is unable to concentrate and to surpass futility because of his interactions with various people that pull him in all directions like a storm in his ocean, at the end, the circus, the ultimate expression of the human comedy, a perfect mixture between grotesque and sublime, is designed to show that all things are settled and the central character is now cured, free and ready to accept the multi-valent relationship with creation, the fact that he can be the creator, a piece of his own creation and a part of an even bigger picture at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellin's magnum opus of self-departure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said that Fellini made 81/2, because he ran out of ideas. Because of course that is the film's initial plot; a director runs out of ideas. Within 81/2 minutes of the flick, (no cheesy pun intended,) I find these assumptions invalid. I was on the verge of going into convulsions in some parts of the movie for its embellished rapid fire ideas.Those ideas of course, come from dreams and fantasies the protagonist Guido has. I stated above I found the remarks invalid about why the film was made. That Fellini ran out of creative spark. Well, although I still find that wrong it is obvious that Guido is Fellini. He is a playboy Italian movie director who has misconceptions built around himself by other people. He is in the very early stages of production of a movie and runs out ideas. So he retreats to a spa to clear his mind while everyone he knows heckles him about something. The film is Fellini-esquire at its full flavor. It goes in and out of Guido's mind and reality with memories of childhood, woman he had, women he didn't have but wanted and things he wanted to do. I found this all very interesting, not because of the images Fellini puts on film, but isn't that what we all do whenever our lives becomes a wreck? We do our best to isolate ourselves and daydream to cope with some things.The flashbacks are what make the film famous. To me, the one that I appreciate the most is the first scene. It shows Guido stuck in a Rome traffic jam with other cars juxtaposed on all sides of him, when suddenly he realizes everyone is watching him and his car is being filled with a formidable gas. This can be described as Guido's life, everyone's life in general and how it is constantly pressured by oppressions. Even whenever we escape from own prison we created and are so happy that we fly around, only to be yanked back down by reality. All we can do is sing and dance and try to make the best out of life with those oppressions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, may I say that it took me three tries to finish watching this masterwork. The third time I began to appreciate the film on Fellini's terms. That was the key to getting "into it'. For the most part truly great films need to be viewed multiple times to fully appreciate everything. Then it was after watching the entire film, I began to go over all the things which separate it from just about every other movie ever made. There's the totally unique title. Fellini had made 7 1/2 films prior to this one. The dream scene with more than 10 different speaking characters is nothing short of amazing and totally unique in film at that time. What makes Fellini so different from all other film makers is his incomparable ability to use the advantages film allows over stage productions. Those advantages are the capablity to instantly change time, space and dimension. In addition, the acting in this film is superb throughout (especially Aimee) and this is overlooked by many who admire the film. Fellini presents each scene as if it is a separate "painting" on a long wall. One of the ten greatest films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fundamental piece of new cinematic expression ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- I want to write a smart review of Fellini's "8?", I can't consider myself a movie fan if I don't praise one of the most universally acclaimed masterpieces in the history of cinema. I loved the film. It's great, it's fresh, if Godard's "Breathless" brought the new wave, well "8?" is a cinematic tsunami on the field of inspiration, how about that?- You're an idiot if you try to compromise your feelings just in order to please a crowd that doesn't even care about you think in the first place, if you do so, then you're taking a major step in the road that leads to mediocrity, so you better express what you REALLY thought of Fellini's film. - Well, I remember, it was my first Fellini's experience, and it turned out to be disastrous. I didn't hate the film but didn't hate myself either for not grabbing the geniality beneath the story, or as a matter of fact, its absence of story. I ?honestly- thought it was a cinematic mess lacking in both structure and profundity. But somewhat I felt guilty about this gut-reaction, because many movies I loved owed their self-referential approach to "8?", and it would have been unfair to judge the milestone more severely than the imitators. Dammit, am I artistically obtuse, can't I see the genius even when it hits me? - You can't see the genius, it's something to be understood, it's an abstraction to be caught, a concept to be grabbed, yet it can't be an emotion, because people are easy to manipulate when it comes to emotions.- But it was not an emotional film, on the contrary, it was full of visual imagery, of childhood, nostalgia, guilt, hurts, grieves, passions, everything that cements one man's memories ? I think the genius is that Fellini was able to depict the content of his own mind while chronicling the process of his own creation, confronted to a major mental block. I was impressed by the way these mental blocks were invaded by all these subconscious elements, at one part, it's real, then it's fantasy, the film itself is pure mental escapism ? but I guess, everyone got that. - Even those who disliked it.- Sure, the essential lies elsewhere in my opinion. I read Roger Ebert's review and he was right when he said that cinema is an art of imagery, and the talent of Fellini as a film-maker is to privilege images over ideas, I'd go even further by saying he privileged images over emotions, in "8?" anyway. Remember the character of the writer, the Marxist guy who condescendingly describes the flaws in the script, it's obvious that Guido, Marcello Mastroianni as Fellini's alter ego, despises the guy and can't wait to get over him and make things his way. And Guido is man of images, not concepts, his vision offers an extraordinary kaleidoscope of different aspects of Italian culture, Latin lust, Mediterranean machismo, Catholic quest for redemption, Childish perversion with the fat prostitute dancing the rumba on the beach ? it's less about what these imagery suggest to us, but the way they condition an author and interfere in the process of his art?- Wait a minute, now you're analyzing while you were just talking about visualizing, you're being intellectual while the seen lasts longer than the meant? You see what I mean?- You nail it perfectly; your point leads me to my biggest problem with the film. Although I was mesmerized by some scenes, especially the extraordinary harem sequence where he's surrounded by all the women that counted in his life, his wife (Anouk Animée), his mistress (Sandra Milo), the prostitute, the French actress, it starts like a luscious fantasy and then turns into a hysterical and frenetic orgy of violence and domination, I thought this was the highlight of ? wait, I also loved the climactic sequence with the producer and the journalists ? the exchange with Claudia Cardinale, the ideal woman, figure of purity, was unforgettable too, the typical Fellinian parade ... Well, there's nothing wrong in the film except that I didn't find the whole experience enjoyable. - Even with Nino Rota's music, the creative costume design, the cinematography, the symbolism, it didn't impact you?- I thought it was a little bit overdone and extremely puzzling. I could tell the difference between reality and fantasy but the fantasy sequences were just too chaotic and confusing.- But maybe that was the only way to convey the apparent confusion of the director's mind, since he was victim of a mental block. Maybe it was the only way to remain faithful to his own vision even if it would puzzle the viewers, as you say. And at least, the use of music, the creativity of the imagery, the episodic structure, made it more cinematically viable, it's like the best film about a non-film, the best film about making a film.- Funny, you remind me of what I said about some other movies such as Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" and John Cassavetes' "Husbands". One was slow and full of nothingness, the other was unpredictable, childish and frustrating but they had to be these ways in order to illustrate the core of their message and the reason to be of their story. They are what I like to call "movies victims of their own greatness", they're great regardless of their enjoyment or not.- I think it's a good compromise. But you can appreciate "8?" but still wish that Fellini made it more accessible to the average viewer. It's even pointed out by the writer in the film, you remember?- Yeah, but it's better this way. After all, didn't you say that compromising oneself to please the others is the first step to mediocrity?- Touché!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frenzied Fantasies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"8 1/2" is probably Federico Fellini's most wildly imaginative and confusing movie. Nothing in it seems quite real. The setting is a resort spa where director Marcello Mastroianni is trying to finish a movie (something to do with a space ship) or at least START the movie. He can't get his joint act together because he's constantly pestered by people who want something from him.Well, we can understand that much. Some of the conversational exchanges seem naturalistic. The producer is on his back because he's spending too much. A French actress is chagrined to learn that she's only in five scenes. The local cardinal objects gently because he doesn't want to be portrayed taking a mud bath. His dumb, middle-aged mistress shows up and causes problems. An intellectual adviser insists there must be more ambiguity. Reporters keep flashing cameras at him and demanding to know if he's afraid of the atomic bomb. His elegant and beautiful wife (Anouk Aimee) appears and immediately castigates him for his affairs. It's autobiographical, obviously, along the lines of Woody Allen's "Stardust Memories," but not Fellini's MOST autobiographical. That honor goes to "Amarcord." Okay, all that we can grasp. But there's something off kilter with the film from beginning to end. Not even the settings look realistic. They all seem stylized. The outdoor café is too big and the tables and chairs seem placed for their visual effect. No women wear hats -- or outfits -- like those in this movie; it turns them into birds with plumage. People show up out of nowhere and are eclipsed by another emerging face. Everyone seems to be shouting at Mastroianni who, for the most part, nods and mutters reassurances -- before shutting the whole production down.Adding to the pandemonium is the fact that even those scenes with pretensions of realism fade insensibly into Mastroianni's fantasies. (In one of them, driven mad by the demands, he crawls under a table and shoots himself.) Sometimes the fantasies are childhood memories and one of them is as funny as hell. As a kid, Mastroianni and a couple of other delinquents from the Catholic school go to the beach and call Seraghina out of the cement pill box she lives in. They give her a coin to do "the Rhumba." Seraghina is grotesquely fat and clumsy, made up to look hideous, and she wriggles and grinds like an overgrown stuffed doll to Nino Rota's deliciously evil score. Two priests show up and chase Mastroianni's black-caped school child around the beach in accelerated motion until they tackle him -- right out of Jacques Tati. The sight of this diminutive flapping figure trying to escape the avenging Erinyes is hilarious.Sometimes the fantasies are just that -- wishful thinking. Mastroianni the adult is in some sort of steam bath with his black hat on. He's wrapped in towels like a Roman emperor and carries a formidable bull whip. Also in the steam bath are all the women he's ever had or desired. The two dozen women cater to his needs. They add warm water to his bath, carry him about, prepare his meals and do his laundry. He carelessly dismisses his aging mistress to the floor upstairs. But the others revolt at his cruelty. After all, everyone grows old. They scold him and shout names. Angrily, Mastroianni gets to his feet and whips them into submission like King Farouk in his seraglio. It sounds cruel but, believe me, it's a funny scene.What's it all about? I don't know. A man loves his wife but has trouble keeping his zipper up. And he can't finish some work that he's begun.Fellini has a way of telling the most tragic tale while undercutting it with irony. Eg., in "La Dolce Vita," Mastroianni is helplessly in love with the hypermastic Anita Ekberg and follows her, panting, slavish, up the stairs of the dome of St. Peter's. And she's wearing a black outfit, a wide-brimmed black hat, and a white stiff collar, the costume of a faux priest, and a viewer can't help chuckling over this travesty even while he sympathizes with the stricken Mastroianni. (Nabokov does the same thing in "Lolita," another tragedy. "I was a pentapod monster but I loved you.") There's less of that kind of subtlety here. It's tempo is vivace. It's noisy and full of motion, some of it pointless. I, for one, can't see why Mastroianni would want so many mistresses when he has the sensitive, intelligent, compliant, and gorgeous Anouk Aimee as his spouse. Claudia Cardinale, looking more attractive than in any of her other films, has a small role.It's not Fellini's best but it's light years ahead of most of the junk parading itself across our wide screen today. They just remade "Karate Kid."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As stylistically creative as Citizen Kane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the international success of Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1961), which was a departure in style from his previous, neo-realist techniques, he decided to use the more fantastical, personal details and stylings which resulted in the kaleidoscopic, beautifully seductive, 8 1/2 (named and it was Fellini's seventh feature - whilst he considered his three shorts as half each). Fellini's camera glides through the scenes. As do the actors, in a clearly choreographed ballet of acting.Guido (Fellini alter-ego Marcello Mastroianni), is a film maker hot off the success of a film, and under pressure to direct another. As Guido keeps producers, writers, actors hanging for any slither of information of what the film is about. He secretly internalises his thoughts that segue from fantasy to memories of his past. Guido wants to make a film that tells no lies. He is himself, a selfish, and unfaithful character. He can not externalise his thoughts to direct the film that he wants to. His fantasies and memories culminate in his power of a hareem of women: all of these women from his life past and present who are all faithful, loyal, and love him. Guido seems, within his fantasy, to be destroying his own ability to speak the truth, as he is told by the women.But one, elusive woman; his fantasy woman (Claudia Cardinale), seems to be the person (muse if you like), that will make the film happen. But she proves to be unattainable. This truly is "the greatest film about film making", as is so commonly stated. Guido's memories/fantasies are built within him to breakdown, and destroy his own creativity. This level of self-degradating of a block in creativity portrayed to perfection, both in dazzling cinematography and Mastroianni's laconic portrayal of an artist questioning his ability to create. Whilst this subject informed the creation of 8 1/2, it certainly does not display any inability in Fellini's startlingly beautiful, well crafted film; and quite often as stylistically creative as Citizen Kane (1941).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Intellectual considerations in 81/2 {Federico Fellini}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Fellini's eighth feature. My theory, is that he felt, that this movie, {81/2}, represented one and a half movies, hence the title. Fellini had been undergoing psychoanalysis, both out of intellectual curiosity and as a relief from bouts of depression, - by both Freudian and Jungian analysts. Accordingly, the themes and motifs, that are explored in this movie, are typical of the analysand's world. First, unsurprisingly, you have childhood memories, the culture of the family, schooling, religion, and the meaning of dreams - with all of this history interpreted as a text from which the sex drive and the general capacity, to gain meaning and satisfaction, from one's life, is revealed.Presumably, Fellini was not satisfied by the prospect of repeating La Dolce Vita {1959}, which was his first international success. Like Heraclitus, Fellini did not want to repeat himself.The central idea, as the lead character {Guido aka the "director"}, reveals, is that a huge set had been built on the sandy beach, towering 200 meters high, which was referred to as the launch-pad. We, {the viewers}, are advised that as the set is already under construction, this part of the story has been settled on. The launch-pad, will house a spaceship, that will transport the survivors of a radioactive, nuclear catastrophe. The survivors, are fleeing from Earth, to another planet. Guido has come to the date where shooting is to begin. Fellini, then introduces us to the "writer/ critic" character, whom the "director" has hired in order to be his conscience, or in more Freudian terms his "superego". The "director" asks him to read the script and comment on both the authenticity, and the minimum requirements, of a movie, that will not be seen as another false witness, to the facts of wonder, and the miracle of human existence. "How can I help" protests the "critic". "Yes you can, I have put off the start for two weeks", says the "director"The "critic" returns a few scenes later, having read the screenplay - he hands the "director" some notes. He critiques the movie as follows: "...a lack of a central issue, or a philosophical stance, ...a chain of gratuitous episodes,...ambivalent realism, ...a lack of poetic inspiration, ...the camera {cinema} is 50 years behind other art forms, ...it lacks avant-garde merits but has all its shortcomings". The "director" starts to read from the notes, ..."and the fanciful apparition of the girl at the spring, what does it mean? - an offering of pureness and warmth - of all the symbols that abound in your story, this one is the worst". The "director" throws the notes down in disgust but immediately retrieves them from the ground with an intense gaze.The "critic" reappears after the "Saraghina" scene, where the Catholic culture of Guido's childhood, is highlighted by an incident, with the whorishly portrayed woman, dancing for the sexually repressed young Catholic pupils at the teaching seminary. The rumba, {fantastically executed by actress Edra Gale, with music by Nino Rota}, leads to a Buster Keaton chase scene, after which, he is chastised in front of his mother, and made to take confession. Guido is firmly told, that sexuality is diabolical. The "critic" comments "...what does it mean? ...she's a character from your childhood memories, ...she has nothing to do with critical awareness, ...if you want to do something controversial on the Catholic consciousness, ...place yourself on a higher cultural level, apply lucid logic,...not these memories steeped in nostalgia, ...that make you an accomplice".Later the "critic" states "your task is impossible ....to give clear cut features to a crowd of characters ...so sketchy, hazy, non-existent. Guido/Fellini echoes this, when he boasts to Rossella, his wife's best friend, "everything happens in my film - I try to put everything in". In the final denouement with the "critic", Guido is quoted from Stendhal "...the solitary ego, that revolves around itself, ends up choked by tears and by laughter". The "director" then, solemnly places a mask over the "critics" head, and has him lead off and hanged - this is a great scene in the movie. The next scene, shows the "critic" still alive, and occupying his seat.The final scene featuring the "critic", comes as Guido, the "director", cancels the movie, whereupon the "critic" launches into a long monologue: " ...we intellectuals have to be rational to the bitter end ..... there's no point in adding muddle to muddle...we're stifled by words, images, sounds ...an Artist, who is worthy of the name ... should train himself to silence ...remember Rimbaud's decision to give up writing ...perfection is impossible ...it is the true mission of the critic, to sweep away the countless still-births, ...you are like the lame man that leaves his deformed footprint, ...what monstrous presumption ...your squalid catalogue of mistakes ...why should you care about stitching together shreds of your life, ... vague memories, ...and faces of people you were never capable of loving".I'd like to comment on a particularly moving scene in the graveyard with Guido and his dead father {"we never spoke enough"}, when the "producer" {referred to throughout as the "commander"}, enters. The father asks him whether his son Guido is a "good boy". The "commander" says he doesn't think so - Guido's father then re-enters the Underworld through a hole in the ground - I found this Jungian scene very touching.In conclusion, I would like to say, that the influence this movie has had on the modern movie is ubiquitous. Some movies not usually mentioned in the long list of mainstream movies, usually cited, are Dennis Hopper's, The Last Movie, Alexandro Jodorowski's, The Holy Mountain {see my review}, and Bob Dylan's, Renaldo and Clara {the full version}. I feel honoured to have been able to review this profound and entertaining work of Art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem with this movie is whether Fellini succeeds in making Guido a reflection of the movie's viewers or of the movie's director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out showing Guido Anselmi (played by Marcello Mastroianni) in a car in a traffic jam, suffocating, then being translated into heaven, floating into the sky, only to be jerked back to earth by his production crew.The movie is a meta-movie-stream-of-consciousness that only works if you see yourself in Guido. "8 1/2" is about a 40-something year old director who's hit a block and can't come up with a useable script that says something important. He's surrounded by fawning actresses who want to be in his next film and by a staff that expects the next profitable venture to keep the payroll running. Guido is looking for inspiration, he says, but he surrounds himself with distractions. Nobody ever shuts up. Guido's only silence comes from losing himself in his reveries, remembering (or imagining) his childhood when his mother loved him. He fantasizes being loved by all his women as he remembers his mother loving him. His wife (Luise, played by Anouk Aimee) clearly becomes his mother figure, and all his mistresses become his whores.From what I gather, Fellini had entered a dry spell himself, so he made this movie. Guido is clearly Fellini's alter ego in the movie, and my assumption is that the words Guido mouths come directly from Fellini's mind. For me, the movie is neurotic and so narcissistic that I had no connection at all with Guido. Others identify with Guido's search for a simple film with intellectual honesty that will "bury all that is dead."I understand the concept of having one's life driven by the crowds: Fellini had to top all his previous successes, he had to make not only commercial successes but critical and intellectual successes. His movies took on a life of their own, remaining as constant reminders of all that he could be and all that he failed to be. But Guido left me cold and unconnected. My impression is that Ingmar Bergman dealt with the issues much better in "Hour of the Wolf," a difficult film which I recommend.In my very humble view, "8 1/2" is a mess that directly reflected Fellini's life at the time he made the movie, reflecting nothing of the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw La Dolce Vita recently, and thought it was amazing. Then I saw 8 1/2 and was equally mesmerised. I cannot choose between which was the best of the two, both were equally outstanding and I would deem both as masterpieces as well. That said, I can see why people mayn't like this or La Dolce Vita, but I am not one of those.I loved the story of 8 1/2. It is a complex yet painfully honest and riveting story, that resonated with me admittedly. I also loved the mix of nightmares, memories, daydreams and frustrating confrontations, they alone made the film so watchable. Once again, Fellini's direction is immaculate. Like with La Dolce Vita, he may have had some troubles as he tried to expand on his reputation as a cinematic genius(a reputation that I think is deserved), but that didn't show to me, instead it showed a director who put so much heart, effort and soul into the film.The visuals are spot on. The production values and the like are beautifully realised and the cinematography is amazing. With Nina Rota, you get a wonderful score, as evident in La Dolce Vita and The Godfather. 8 1/2 is no exception. The music is beautiful, haunting and memorable and stuck in my head for a long while afterwards, actually it's still there. The acting I have no qualms with- Marcello Mastroianni is exceptional as the tormented film-maker while Anouk Aimee and Claudia Cardinale are equally superb.Overall, this is a masterpiece, I love everything about it. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

A day dreamy jaunt into the mind, imagination and history of a movie director and the pressures on him to create art with or without inspiration.From opening sequence to closing this film holds your attention with scene after scene of beauty and grace. Of all Fellini's Films this one holds a special place in my heart.Not for movie goers, This film will challenge and enlighten the viewer to a deep level of film making that portrays as many aspects of the characters as of the director. And in fact maybe of the viewer.This film reminds one of those lost childhood daydreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini points the camera inward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"8?" is widely hailed as Federico Fellini's masterpiece and, by extension, one of the the greatest films of all time. While I've only seen the film once (probably not enough to absorb all of it's intricacies) I'm a bit hesitant to dole out such high praise.The story revolves around director Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), a character obviously based on Fellini himself. As he struggles with indecision in his personal and professional life we get a window into the life and thoughts of a harried film director.With little in terms of a conventional plot it is a foregone conclusion that "8?" will not appeal to everyone. Personally, I found the film aimless and faintly pretentious at first but it slowly captured my interest. The later stages turned out to be both entertaining and thought-provoking, which is more than can be said for a lot of films.A solid cast helped to make the film enjoyable. Marcello Mastroianni ably carries the film and Anouk Aimée excels as Anselmi's neglected wife. Sandra Milo is also quite good in the part of Anselmi's mistress and the supporting cast is populated with numerous interesting individuals.From a technical standpoint, the film is near flawless. Whatever Fellini's doubts in terms of creativity, he exhibits a deft touch with his direction here. Further enhancing the visuals is the attractive black-and-white cinematography of Gianni Di Venanzo. Meanwhile, Nino Rota's score is exuberant and cleverly incorporates recognizable themes from Rossini, Tchaikovsky &amp; Wagner.Ultimately, I was impressed with "8?" but I think that multiple viewings might be necessary to grasp all of its complexities. In the end I was glad that I held on through the relatively slow start and I would urge others to do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What cinema is all about!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An opinion. Cinema is a medium where the viewer must see, feel and think. See: The visceral images and be immersed in their hypnotic insanity. Feel: Experience the realism enough to feel connected to the story and characters. Feel as though they are in the middle of things. and most important, Think: To be interpreting, questioning, and readily observing. To be a viewer of great cinema you must be an active audience. So here we have 8 1/2. A film that does all of these things! For a new viewer of the film you must remember a few things. 1. Cinema has changed since then and you will notice glaringly outdated special effects that look really bad. 2. You will be very confused by this film the first time you watch it. This could cause you to give up on it (I almost did). Just remember not to over think it, let yourself be caught up in the hypnotic imagery. Besides, you're supposed to be confused! The only one who fully understands the film is Fellini, and well we all know where he is! 3. This film is a comedy... only problem is it's a different style of comedy, fitted towards the particular culture. Since I have zero Italian blood in me, certain things have gone over my head. 4. For those not assosciated with Fellini, this film is very surrealistic. It jumps between reality, fantasy, imagination, past, and God knows where else. This was in fact my first introduction to Fellini and since seeing his other films, have been surprised at just how radical this film is. Anyway, just a heads up to people who haven't seen the film, on to a brief review. 5. This film is from a director's eye. It will cut away from a plot line to give a close up to a random person just to focus in on them or give them a few lines. As an aspiring director, I found this strangely relatable. The entire film feels quirky and frantic, much like the mind of a creator.Mastroianni's performance was stellar. A character both different and exactly the same as the one in La Dolce Vita. With wit and cynicism he travels with us on this strange journey. This was one of the first black and white films I've seen where I never felt like I was watching a black and white film. It is filmed in such a vivid and passionate way you never feel bored! Certain scenes are meant to wow you or shock you. A controversial scene that has something to do with a whip (no spoilers!) makes you feel filled with pathos, laughter, anger, and confusion all at the same time! That is much like this film, which fills you with odd, contrasting emotions that offer no simple answers and ask you to choose which ones to act upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 1/2: A true Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching 8 ?, I was confused at many different parts. The overall coherence of this movie, to me, seemed pretty vague. Although I must say it was pretty interesting after establishing the "why's" and "what's" that I was asking myself. It was well known that Frederico Fellini was a playboy and was known to be the master of flamboyant costumes, all of which can be seen in this movie. After watching the movie and learning about Fellini, everything comes together. The flashbacks are what make the film so famous. The first scene of the movie sets it all up and, in my eyes, is the most important flashback scene throughout the movie. The flashbacks in the first seen are easily paralleled to Guido's life. He is stuck in traffic and he cannot escape the smoke. Both situations are metaphors to how we are unable to escape the everyday oppression and pressures of life. In this metaphor, the line between reality and dreams becomes very vague. These dream-like sequences help to portray the movie to an even greater level at its fullest extent. The movie would not be as well looked up to as it is today if it weren't for Fellini doing this. It is still highly looked up to by many of film viewers and critics around the world for being the true masterpiece that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the supreme achievements in film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 1/2 is a masterpiece, there is no contesting that. It is the magnum opus of one of the great auteurs of world cinema, Federico Fellini. Fellini is one of those film-makers whose artistic vision is breath-taking and awe-inspiring, and in this film, that very fact shines all the way through. Almost every shot in the film is like a work of art. Despite all the greatness oozing out of the film, truth be told, I do not enjoy watching 8 ? at all, even though I am fully aware of, and appreciate, its greatness.Another very revered film-maker who is often compared to Fellini because of his deep artistic vision is Ingmar Bergman. Personally, I can relate to a Bergman film with much more ease, and to me, Bergman is much more poignant and touching. However, as a craftsman, Fellini, I believe, is superior to almost any filmmaker who has ever made a movie. The problem, however, is that I am unable to relate to Fellini's films. In 8 ?, for example, there isn't a single character that I can relate to, or sympathize with, in any way, shape, or form. I guess appreciating a movie like 8 ? requires a level of maturity that only comes with age, and so, I don't see myself liking this movie any time soon. However, as a student of film, especially film craftsmanship, this movie is the bible. There are some unforgettable moments in the film, like the beginning "claustrophobia" scene, or the majestic harem scene, or especially the brilliant, almost surrealistic, ending sequence. The score of Nino Rota reminds you of circus-music, and makes a poignant statement: life, after all, is a circus. I cannot decide what score to award this movie, so I am going to refrain from doing that at all. My last advice: watch it for intellectual stimulation rather than entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult but fascinating and at times uncomfortably honest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"8 1/2" is a difficult and ambiguous film, but its works all the better because of it. Its constantly fascinating and a compelling character study even when it begins to become progressively more and more random towards the end. Like any true work of art, just what the final meaning of the project is is left entirely to the audience. Also, the fact that Fellini had the guts to make such a personal film is commendable. The character of Guido is obviously based on Fellini in many ways, and while its a likable character, hes certainly not presented as the best human being imaginable. The film seems to hold a stark mirror to Fellini's existence, and even in its most surreal moments, it remains an honest portrait.Fellini's direction of the film itself is fantastic. While he became far too self-indulgent after this (his films became just a bit too bizarre), "8 1/2" never comes across as being over pretentious, just extremely ambitious. The film is slowly paced and difficult to make it through, but its certainly a rewarding experience by the end. I still prefer "La Dolce Vita", just because I feel like I can relate to the central character more, but "8 1/2" equals it in all technical departments.The rest of the crew is accomplished as well, in particular the actors. Marcello Mastroianni works with Fellini to make Guido a very complex character, even if its not apparent initially. Sandra Milo is also great. Her character annoyed me at first, but as the film continued she was fleshed out to be an equally sympathetic character. The rest of the cast is quite good as well, particularly the tragic performance from Anouk Aimée as Mastroianni's wife and the gorgeous Claudia Cardinale, but those two performances make the film. Plus, its fun to see Barbara Steele in a non-horror role. If you're seriously interested in film as an art form, than "8 1/2" is a necessary film to watch. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The circus of life on film, sort of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I note that Fellini directed twenty-four films, of which I have seen only La Strada (1954), La Dolce Vita (1960), 8 ? (1963), Fellini-Satyricon (1969), Roma (1972), and Amacord (1973).I still rate La Strada as his most powerful and tragic; Dolce Vita explored moral ambiguity of the times; Satyricon was an off-beat fantasy; Roma an interesting documentary of part of Fellini's life and of that city; Amacord looked at the comedy of life from the child's perspective.This one just kept asking questions, and still does...When he directed this enigmatic masterpiece, Fellini had been making films since the late nineteen-forties (when he was in his mid-twenties); by the time 1962 rolled in, he was obviously in state of mental flux, if not fugue, all or some of which has gone into the making of this exquisite puzzle.Was that Fellini's motivation? I can only guess, as much as Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) keeps trying to sort out what his life all means, what and who is really important to him, and the extent to which the heart or the mind should rule the choices we all have to make in life. To do that, poor Guido has to cast his mind back to various episodes in his life ? just as we all do, from time to time ? and come to some reconciliation about what he'd done to himself and others in his quest for...what? Salvation? Happiness? Fulfillment? Answers? As somebody once said: In life there's only one answer ? there are no answers.Everybody goes through some sort of mid-life crisis, so why should Fellini be an exception? And, what better vehicle to make an attempt to sort out parts of your life than put it on film where, if necessary, you can review it, as often as you wish, just to see again whether you got things right, after all...So, in my opinion, the ending for Guido can be interpreted in two ways: either as a wish fulfillment of death, or as a reaffirmation and reconnection with life, depending upon one's own particular point of view. Why? Because, throughout this narrative, there are a few times when the viewer is uncertain whether Guido is only fantasizing or when he's grounded in the reality of the narrative.Hence, was this narrative truly an autobiographical exposition from Fellini, depicting much of his own thoughts, doubts and knowledge? Well, with others, he was the story developer and scriptwriter, so it's hard to say no, I would think. As every writer knows, there is always part of him/her in every story s/he writes.And as the clincher, in my view, there is no better quote than that from one of the guests who mocks Guido during the final party on the beach - because no writer ever wants to hear this assessment of a life's work: "He's lost it! He's got nothing to say!" That says it all...What is there to say about the cast, except near perfection? With brilliant, black and white camera work, a great score, and settings that range from the surreal to the sublime, even if you've never seen an Italian film before, make this one that you must see.Highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The complex nature of the human mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a popular level 8 1/2 is a film about the complexities the artist faces, and the complexities of the artist's mind. However, the film goes above and beyond being about one single type of person; it goes into detail on the complexities of the human mind in general. Through Fellini's voyeuristic, innocent almost adolescent look at life we experience a look into our own thoughts, and into the thoughts of all people.The film is composed of a fairly simplistic plot: A filmmaker struggles to make his next film as its composition date nears, and delves deeper into his own past, dream and reality. On the surface this appears to be a plot lacking deep philosophy or ideas, but in truth it is one of the most profoundly insightful films detailing human nature. Through the use of surrealism the film is able to show how people think, through ambiguity of gender roles, expectations of work and a desire to be comfortable. We get a sense that this filmmaker isn't any different then we are. He isn't quite sure how to deal with stress, or how to deal with his estranged romantic life, so he develops fantasies based on how he thinks things should be. His problems are never entirely solved; he hasn't accomplished anything except the development of a positive mindset by the end of the film, yet things are okay because he accepts his problems rather then letting them run him. Essentially the film relates to everyone's life, because we all face similar problems and the solution is always the same. Our problems are part of us, and moving forward accepting them, rather then wallowing in them is something everyone can learn.Though it isn't for everyone, 8 1/2 offers a lot for those who are willing to see beyond what is initially there. If we allow ourselves to connect it to our own lives, then it has the capacity to be a helpful and realistically implicit film for the modern age and generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest movie ever made. Oh, but there's no shooting, no fighting, no car chases. No 800 years old frogs, no light sabres, although people do fly! Instead, there is an artist and his fickle imagination, struggle with the lack of inspiration and the creative process, which remains a mystery. Fellini said that all his life he was making Lo sceico bianco (his first film). I think he was wrong. All his life he made Otto é mezzo. All his early movies were rehearsals to this tour de force and subsequently he developed themes from 8 1/2. La cittá delle donne, develops Guido's dream, Amarcord - the Saragina scene, Casanova the futility of Guido's love affairs, Giulietta - Guido's wife etc. This is movie making at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am only writing this because there has been so much good comment and no one seems to mention the ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two films in my list of the top ten combine a remarkable parallel between the deep need of the director making the film and that of his principal character in his film's action: WILD STRAWBERRIES and 8 1/2.Ingmar Bergman's Isak struggles at the end of a sterile life for redemption and the freshness of feelings and connections he had long lost. And his acceptance of what would have been just another empty honor at the University at Lund becomes the crowning of a life regained, confirmed, and renewed and deeply moving. Fellini's Guido flounders trying to integrate the fantasies and facts of a life that seems so chaotic that he has lost total control of it. The fascinating thing about 8 1/2 is that Fellini has a great love and understanding of his fellow mortals that is Shakesperean in its scope. And Guido is finally able to put it all together in the great dance of love and acceptance at the end.It never fails to make me weep uncontrollably</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the last personal geniuses of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Commencing with the nightmarish traffic shot of silent, hemmed-in despair, and ever after that open to dream, suggestion and imagination, this is the culmination of a kind of cinema we'll never see again. The era of Cinecitta, of oligarchic producers and fabulous set pieces and swirling arrays of extras, littered with personal recollection, wish fulfilments and fear. And total dubbing. And wholly personal, boyish, poetically inventive direction. I love that his critic character, besides spouting an endless bilge of intellectual clichés (all of their time), states early on that his film is nothing more than a sequence of disconnected scenes; a film about film-making must employ self-criticism at some point, and when he talks about the failure of a scene with the dream-girl at the therapeutic springs, which we've just seen, well, it's significant that it doesn't deflate the narrative at all. And of course the critic hangs later on (how could he not see that coming).The strong mover of the film is the sense of being carried along by large events one is complicit in creating, yet losing all willed responsibility for; the alienating fear of losing the thread, to get off the moving train and admit to not knowing. The endless circus of faces asking for their parts or opinion, always a circular chaos of distractions crossing the line of sight or sweeping up from the corners. The continual demands. The unspoken fear of failure, hungrily grasping at every (feminine) distraction. One of the great films about failure, fact. Fellini has a gift for controlling very large studio spaces, making them buzz and thrive with visual activity and eclectic peoples; contrasted of course with Guido's unflappable calmness at the centre, the quiet heart of adriftness.Along with childish masculinity, the distractions of feminine beauty, the injection of personal drama (the wife, the musical director, and of course the producer) and ceaseless directorial invention. In a film that is ever erupting into dream and fancy, or rather, which is more dream than real (hence honest about the illusions of cinema). The scenes in the steam baths, the profound nocturnality of the film contrasted with the washed out, over-exposed daylight scenes, the sheer improbable cohesiveness of it all? again, one has to resort to lists to distil the breadth of the scope, and avoid wanting to analyse everything (fear of women, Catholicism etc).This is film-making on the genius side of Italian cinema: the Fellini method. Renown, production excess, cartoon humour, gorgeous dolls, a frenetic chaos externalised yet humanised by uncertainty and a search for clarity, or simple, useful and effective film-making; and still to be able to say Yes, this is my (mad) method but there's more to it than that? there are lies, begged indulgences, cover-ups and denials, tawdry lovers, common gossip, domestic despairs, staged resolutions and uneven or badly-paced ambiguities in life, and producers bearing gifts? So much personal free reign will never be given in a studio environment again. rino breebaart</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside the neurotic psyche of an artist, and a nation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is an intensely remarkable work that satisfies on various levels--especially for those willing to experience the film actively and not passively. The ambiguity and even anomie that overlap in the sequences of reality and fantasy must be structured by the viewer to reveal the various elements within this densely woven fabric of symbol and exploration. Firstly, the explicit plot poses the question of whether or not in the reality of an artist's narcissism there exist pure and true relationships, or are all beings in the artist's reality reduced to objects of his/her intertwined creative and personal experience. This furnishes an overt storyline that is entertaining in and of itself, and illuminates the notorious egocentrism of an artist perpetually engaged in creativity and where beings in the environment audition for parts in the artist's personal life as well! Splendid! I am more impressed, however, with the psychoanalytic mechanisms used to drive this plot, specifically in the applications of transference and object relations. We see early on that Guido retains a yearning for the purity, innocence, and maternal qualities of his mother and the women of his early childhood. As he grew older, his own moral development was marked by the shame he internalized through his Catholic religiosity and his own perversion of the female image. This repression of guilt yielded his adult 'Madonna-whore complex' that is evident in his alternating fantasies of women seducing him and treating him as a child (recall that he was swaddled in a white sheet as a child by the nurturing maternal figures after the 'wine bath' (baptism by the Church?) but then also later in his harem fantasy by those who were also the sexual objects of his domination). This is also explicated in the dream where his mother transforms into his wife. As the script-writer criticizes, Guido is plainly pursing incredibly cliché figures (both maternal ones and also sensual) with his proposed female lead character. His aloofness of his own artistic quest mirrors the denial and aloofness of the quest in his personal life. His paternal explorations of guilt and avoidance, and the need for guidance all play out across his relationships with his father (in the dream), the producer, and the various representations of the Church. Ultimately, the viewer observes that Guido's creative enigma is perfectly intertwined with his psychodynamic neurosis, and his eventual catharsis is thus freeing for both dimensions of his life. An additional element Fellini incorporates is the repression, ambiguity, and ambivalence of Italy's national identity at the time of the film. Recovering from the postwar depression, dependence, and shame, and striving toward a new identity and place on the world stage, the nation's identification with the Catholic Church, and both modernism and the new world order led by the USA (as depicted by the panacea of Guido's securing the glamorous American actress "Carla" in the film) suggests that the fragmentation and complexity for Italy at the time may have paralleled that of Guido. As another viewer noted, does the ensemble at the end of the film also promote Italy's progression on the international stage if it too would benefit from introspection? Also, note the scene near the end when Guido and Carla dialog after emerging from the car, and Carla is revealed in full iconic significance: she acknowledges his mystification of her while she stands before an automobile (American industrial might?) and the patterns of the street and perspective behind her appear to manifest an American flag! So much more one can say about such a spectacular piece of art that also stands as a timecapsule of its moment in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Point of departure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 1/2This is not for Gregory-T, who absolutely gets it. For those who say, `Why', I have a very basic explanation. The mystique of 8 1/2 lies not in its story telling perse', but in its timing. It is a about fear, courage, and triumph, but not all at the intention of the filmmaker.Yes, inside the film we find fear and it is dealt with thoroughly. Outside the film, we realize we are observing a courage the director might not have been aware of. After all, he didn't just dare to tell this story of his moral trepidation; he had to release it to exorcise the demons of doubt. He wanted to make an honest film that didn't rely on manipulative devices to stir the audience emotionally. That's a cinematic trick exhibited all too often in our movie culture, from D.W. Griffith to, and especially, Steven Spielberg. There are no crane shots of lost little boys (with an appropriate string accompaniment) we are reminded we must weep for. We are not dealing with a universal code of emotional response here, but with a purely personal reaction to life as it passes before us and scares us into the unexpected necessity of 'a life examined'. The triumph lies in the result of its impact after the final cut and release, because no movie before this had dealt with a 'stream of consciousness' ego run rampant as its focus. This was not a character conceived by a bunch of writers in a back room at Universal trying to gauge the public taste for exciting heroes. Guido/Federico is a real ego in denial trying to sort things out on his own terms, much like the one you look at in the mirror every morning. He sees a beautiful woman and he wants her. He wants them all. When he feels overwhelmed, he wants to run and hide. He can't, but he can envision it.No one had ever told a story in this way before and, wonder of wonders, we got it. The legacy of 8 1/2 is that its acceptance changed the shape of film for all time; a very definite point of departure. It wasn't a gradual morphing of style engendered by a school of filmmaking over a period of time. 8 1/2 stands alone in its uncompromising exploration of our greed, our petty desires, and our fear of being ostracized for being all too human by our fellow sinners.It is about fear and acceptance and the begrudging need we have for the people in our lives. It was an act of courage to make it. It triumphed because of its honesty and its admission that our heroes are, after all, just people trying to claim a little piece of the earth before they disappear from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one film alone will be sufficient to claim him as a maestro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly Fellini's best and maybe the only one we enjoy even we sometimes feel he is too much indulged in his circus show. In making this film Fellini had transcended making films as an artistic work once for all and proved to us even a disastrous directing crisis can be successfully survived and turned magically into a masterpiece.It is not enough to just sit there and watch the film itself, for you would never be able to understand how this magic was being done. There are too many references to the director's real life experience and he made it that way it is no longer possible to divide fiction from real life and thus provide us a sublimed reality which is the dream of every artist.Everybody had a reason to appear in a film or even to exist in this world. The explanation for this and also the labyrinthic relationships between them is thought unable to be represented inside a single film(or even a series of them), used to be, that is, before we see this film.The criterion DVD can give you much information even if you do not have access or won't bother to dig into those commentary and biographical books.In one word, if a film can be so dazzling while you are on it and still remains flawless after you have tried to analyze it cold-bloodly afterwards, then it is enough for you to decide that director's talents are something mysteriously inborn and one film alone will be sufficient to claim him as a maestro.</fullReview>

The main character, Guido, has a very good perspective of things. After all, he is a director in the film.

		<fullReview>This is one of the most original, creative, and interesting films ever made. Easily the most personal film ever made. It's director, Federico Fellini, found himself immensely drowned in "director's block". He didn't know what he wanted to do next after "La Dolce Vita". He was being hounded constantly by producers, writers, and actors about what his next film would be, but Mr. Fellini didn't know what he wanted to direct. So he made a film based on his own situation. 8 1/2 represents all of Fellini's frustrations, anxieties, doubts, hopes and fears. He IS Guido, which is why this film is so wonderfully personal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie to which all those martini commercials refer to. The somewhat older guy, hair combed back, dark sunglasses and some of the most enchanting women I've ever seen. This so-called masterwork draw my attention and it definitely was worth it.Throughout the film you keep wondering whether the director, the main character is either living through the moment or dreaming it. When you want to figure out the motives behind the title, the things the director or the other characters say, you almost need to read through a biography of Fellini. And even then it's pure speculation since it's "just a story"...Beautiful women, magnificent scenes and camera positions, excellent choice of music. And then the plot, full of psychological references to probably the private life of Fellini. Cleverly done although it might seem to be a disaster. Not everyone will enjoy it though, it lacks the pace and action of modern Hollywood movies but it's worth a view if you want to see something else than the 'good guy winning some battle and rescuing the girl at the end of the movie'.Enjoy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply A Brilliant Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fedrico Fellini's epic semi-autobiographical `8 ?' is a beautiful masterpiece that constructs dreams with sentimental moments, it does this flawlessly. The first scene is the most memorable and powerful. It is almost the meaning of the whole film and sets up for a very different experience. Dark humor, musical elements, gothic horrific ideas all in one of the greatest minds film has ever encountered Fedrico Fellini. It goes without saying the film would not be what it is if not for Fellini who the film is based on. It follows Guido a mid-aged film director that is having trouble with his next film, or as I would like to call it director's block. He is being bombarded bye so many about the film that he can't even get five minutes to sit down to see if he even wants to do it anymore. His producer, jive writer, annoying production designer, and of course wife and mistress all are bothering him. So he, as many artists do, goes into his mind to find out what to do with his next `masterpiece' only to find the real meaning of life. Deep stuff, the dream sequences are beautiful and rival most dream movies of today (Vanilla Sky). This film is the best film about film ever made. Intelligently it investigates the hard creative process of a film director or any artist for that matter. Nina Rota's score is perfect with the films visuals. The music seems so perfect for each scene and directs the film perfectly.`Accept me as I am. Only then can we discover each other.'The film is so beautifully constructed, it consists of so many elements of today's films. The shadows of the lighting and the camera pans are revolutionary in every sense of the word. The sentimental love speeches are better then anything today and are some of the most thoughtful and provoking scenes in cinema history. `8 ?' is one of the most different and beautifully made films of the last century. To think that it was made in 1963 amazes me even know after seeing so much special effects as I have grown up. This film is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. Fellini didn't know what to do with his next film, he had sets built and actors ready but he didn't know what to do with them so he made a film about not know what to do with a film. It comes out to be one of the greatest films ever made and makes out to be even better every viewing. Watching the creative process is a very interesting experience as he looks back on childhood memories that are distorted only in the sense that a memory could do. The pictures on the wall are abnormally large and the voices are deep and haunting as a child would remember. The music scenes are fantastic in every aspect of a musical. They jump and sore with technique, pushing the mind to it's limits and teaching us something about love in return. It is not though just a movie about dreams. It is sort of scary to me. It has many horrific and moving moments, using the subtle dialogue between characters and Guido to make the senses jump. I love this film and many others like it. Not just being a movie doing more and more and more. All the way to its beautiful poetic ending that I will leave out of this. It may be hard to get a copy now days. But if you can I strongly recommend it. It is available on Criterion Collection DVD I own it, if you want to take a risk and buy it, it will defiantly pay off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greats and my personal favorite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD of this seminal film has just been released by the venerable Criterion Collection, yet there has been no mention of it's release in the L.A. Times, Entertainment Weekly, N.Y. Times, or any other publication I know of, which, to me is not only a shame, but is, perhaps, indicative of the lack of journalistic integrity left in our world of media monopolies. This film is a MUST for anyone interested in film and/or film-making. And, the two disc DVD is a worthy tribute to the film's genius. Please, at least, rent it, though you might have to go a bit farther afield than Blockbuster to find it. 8 1/2 is the tale of a film maker confronting "writer's block" after having a great previous success. But, it is much more than that, and will touch and reveal to many on many different levels. A great work of art, wildly influential to many film-makers after it's 1963 release, it still stands on it's own as a unique and wonderful revelation of an artist confronting truth, within himself and in others. Fellini was brought up Catholic and this is one of the greatest confessions. No one is spared, especially himself. What some critics have called "self-indulgent", I call honesty, scathing honesty. Something that most critics have scant use for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me warn the casual movie-goer that this film is slow and is not very entertaining in it's usual sense. I fell asleep the first time I saw this as I believe most people will. However, if you can not only keep awake but pay attention through the first 70 minutes, you will be rewarded greatly. This film is not only a good 20 years ahead of it's time in terms of direction, it is one of the boldest and sincere films ever made because of it's message and it's heart. This is an example of film transcending the media to become pure art. The struggles of love and love lost, childhood nostalgia and innocence lost, money, religion, existential doubts, and pretty much all the conflicts that plague our human existence are deeply depicted in this film. It's amazing that anyone could produce such an artistic, rewarding film that is so honest and touching. If you feel confused by the film, you should reflect on how you feel about your purpose in life, how to give it meaning, and then you'll understand Fellini's film a little more. Simply brilliant. Without doubt one of the greatest films every created by one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon my second viewing of Fellini's 8 1/2 I found tons of answers I was searching for in the first viewing. I'm a huge "Nine" fan, so I'm over-familiar with the plot. I understand that the Broadway version was based on 8 1/2, but it's not fair to judge Nine as a 8 1/2 remake. It's like judging a Halloween remake to John Carpenter's classic. Since it was an adaptation on the Broadway show, judge it to that. Enough about Nine, now.Fellini's work here has left me speechless. There is no words to describe this picture. Since it's a cinematic autobiography, obviously, he was going to hit it hard, but no way did I ever expect what I just saw. He uses present reality, past reality, and fantasy. It's hard to tell when he is switching from reality to fantasy. And at times, fantasy intertwines with reality making that confusing as well. But the more you see it, the more you take away from it. Fellini has so much control of the picture, it's uncanny what he did here. It's a shame he doesn't have the Directing Oscar for '64.The story is madness. Pure madness. Like I said before everything it balances, fantasy, reality, his past. It's brilliant, it accurately shows what artists go though. It explores many themes and makes you sit up and think. The acting here is also very good. Marcello Mastroianni gives one of the best performance in the history of the cinema. Aimee is wonderful as the suffering wife. Milo, who I believe was Fellini's mistress, is so fun and heartwarming in the role. Cardinale and Falk are also good for their limited characters. Great ensemble.Like I said, you aren't going to get the madness anywhere else but here. This isn't a film for mainstreamers, they will likely get lost in the twisted story. It's Fellini's masterpiece along with Mastroianni's career performance. The only thing that's keeping this from a perfect 10 is the confusion with the transitions from fantasy and reality; 9.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been so bombarded to my senses in a long time, since my I had my first kiss to be exact (I know, a strange comparison, but bear with me). 8 1/2 is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life. I loved it, I was confused by it and like my first kiss, I wanted more of it. Directed by Federico Fellini, 8 1/2 gives us an insight on a troubled director, Guido, who has a crappy marriage and delves a little bit too much into his dreams and memories. Detaching himself further and further from reality, he prepares for a new movie that he isn't even sure if he wants to get it made. The film takes us on a trip to his mind. From his first encounter with the prostitute Saraghina, to his parents, the Catholic Church, his wife, his various lovers, etcetera. The script is very interesting, but like many people have said, it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate the story and film. The acting is perfect. Marcello Mastroianni is one of my new favorite actors thanks to this film. What a brave and marvelous performance as Guido (On a side note, he made La'Notte with one of my favorite foreign directors, the master, Antonioni. A damn shame I did not know that sooner). The women in this film are amazing. Luisa, Carla, Claudia, Rosella, my god, such beauty and charisma!, incredible. Alouk Aimee as Luisa, Guido's wife, was fascinating. Every actor and actress do an amazing job. Nino Rota: what can you expect from this man?, quality and perfection. His musical score in this film is marvelous, although not as memorable as his other scores, but that doesn't matter. The cinematography by Gianni Di Venanzo is breathtaking. Some shots in here are a thing to behold. In the end, this film left me exhausted. Just when I thought I knew a thing or two about cinema, here comes Fellini and gives me slap on my face to help me understand that cinema and film are endless, and that there are masterpieces just waiting to be discovered by the down on his luck, recently heart broken, college working film geek like myself. I recommend this to any film enthusiast, any film geek and anyone who truly appreciates and loves cinema. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't intend to comment on this film because I didn't think it was at all necessary. Then I made the mistake of looking at some of the negative comments made by some reviewers here. I want to try to address those negative comments.I saw this movie first in its first U.S. theatrical release. I was a junior in high school, and I was completely blown away, as were the friends I went with. I had no trouble interpreting the film, or figuring out what it was about; it was completely accessible to me.To find that the movie is boring or incomprehensible to some people is shocking. Or that they find it self-indulgent or too purposely arty. One reviewer here even called it "dated."It's my opinion that people under the age of 35 shouldn't read Jane Austen. They simply do not have enough life experience to understand what they are reading. The jokes go right by them, as does the sharp and timeless social observation. I think maybe there's a similar threshold for some film goers vis-a-vis 8-1/2. I'm not sure what that threshold would be, though, except for a passionate love of film and film-making. I would also say that if you watch movies solely to be entertained--as a diversion--this is absolutely not the film for you.It feels absurd to comment on one of the most revered and celebrated films of all time. I will say though that I have always thought this is THE most filmic of films. This is the film that uses the medium to its fullest capacity. There is a linear story line, but there is no way to grasp it except to experience it. This is a story that could not have been novelized without an incredible loss of information. It is a Mobius strip: a movie about making a movie about making a movie.If you define art as a combination of intellect and emotion, 8-1/2 is art. It is intellectually stimulating on many, many levels, and it is an exploration of emotions as well as a manipulator of emotion. And it's beautiful. Pick any one frame at random and you'll find a perfect composition.Over the 40 or so years since it was made I've seen 8-1/2 at least 50 times and it never once failed to hold my interest or absorb me completely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 1/2 is one of the most hailed movies of all time, especially in foreign films, I read in a magazine that this was the number one ranked Italian film. So I decided to rent it and see what it was about, I had no idea what the story was about, but if it's ranked so high on the top 250, why not check it out? So I watched it yesterday and this was one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, I almost felt like I was trippin' with this movie. I know that sounds bad, but I just felt like I was on such a trip with 8 1/2, the camera shots, the characters, the costumes, the story, it was just crazy. I felt like I was getting pulled in so many directions and I wasn't sure where I was going. The story is a little hard to follow, but I watched it again, and from what I understand, I'll try to explain.Guido is a writer/director who is constantly looking for new ideas for his new film. He goes into these strange fantasies of new characters, flying, new situations, and different colors or looks. But the actors that he works with are always looking for the bigger idea, they want something better. But after thinking back to his past, he may just come up with the best idea for a film.At least that's what I interpreted from 8 1/2, this was seriously one strange movie. But the thing that stands out to me is this was a film that stood out very much for it's time, it was one of the first films that made people stop and seriously think about what they saw. It was one of the first major artistic films that had incredible camera shots and interesting characters, before the fancy effects of CGI, we had 8 1/2. 8 1/2 is a good movie, it's something you'd really have to be in a mood for though and you may have to watch it a couple times, but it's definitely worth it if you want a classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the camera work for that time is marvelous. it's almost perfect. i don't complain about the script too much, but i didn't think that this one is the most interesting of his movies. for example i liked Roma much more... i can see why this one got an Oscar... but i it is rather personal preference. i do like movies a little darker...it is a little too witty for me...also the movie-making aspect kinda gets boring. the English / Italian aspect seems to be there for the commercial value?i give points usually for cinematography, production, story, etc. especially the story part is very PERSONAL... so the only minus points for this film are from that. i haven't given a ten nor have i given a 1 ever... there's not a perfect film...it is still a must see for EVERYBODY, well at least anybody who values cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World of Federico Fellini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini became one of my favorite film directors in my youth. While Godard was too cerebral, often sour and a bit too complicated for a Sunday afternoon, Fellini was always fun, even when he was dark or dramatic. In his own historical context, Fellini was also my favorite of all post-war directors from Italy. His colleagues were all excellent filmmakers, but in the end Antonioni was too cryptic, Visconti too melodramatic, De Sica too erratic, and films lost Rossellini when he turned his attention to the development of television language. On the other hand and unknowingly to me, Fellini's "8?" illustrated the auteur theory enunciated by André Bazin and the critics of the magazine "Cahiers du cinéma." Not because there were thematic and stylistic self-quotations in the film, or that the story of a film director in crisis is autobiographical, but because in his alter ego's search for a story, a reason, and a leading lady, Fellini introduced introspections and fantasies without restrain, creating a world of his own that could be enjoyed by the audience. The movie is filled with beautiful faces: Marcello Mastroianni, Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimée, Sandra Milo, Edra Gale (later seen as Peter Sellers' wife in "What's New, Pussycat?"), and the Queen of Horror, Barbara Steele. Nino Rota contributed an unforgettable score, whose highlight is the wonderful theme for the final parade, "La passerella d'addio."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're too stupid to get it go home and watch TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever doesn't get this film doesn't get life. The beauty of it and the creativity of Fellini was to tell this somewhat nonlinear story. The whole point of the movie ponders..."what's the point," all the people who don't get it have not lived full lives, they are one-, or two- (at best) dimensional characters of their own existences that keep chugging away just because. And yes, there are more "entertaining" films out there...typical plot, typical escalation of external struggles. But this is about internal struggles, an examination of humanity and it's weaknesses, about self fulfillment and meaning of life. Life is not linear. Relationships are not black and white. Look at it and relate to it and you will recognize yourself in some, few or all elements. And if you don't ...too bad for you, go home and watch mindless television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 1/2, a Fascinating Italian movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fascinating Italian movie, 8 1/2, is probably one of the most awkward movies that I have ever watched. Like I said, the movie is just wonderful and fascinating. It gives the audience that tickling feeling in the stomach every time one watches it, or at least, every time I did. I'm not Italian or speak Italian so I had to depend solely on the subtitles while viewing this film. I personally viewed the movie at least 5 times. I watched it at least 3 times with normal speed and at lest 2 more times with FF( it feels different).The main reason for watching it 5 times was because of the confusion that I had while watching the film. The first time that I watched the movie, I, to be frank, did not understand almost anything. I didn't know who this main character Guido was suppose to be and was confused with all those women who he kept on referring to. I was lost in the movie. So, I went back the second and third time and began to find something new every time. It was at my third view that I actually understood the movie. Now, people may say that I'm just slow, but this movie is actually quiet complicated and takes time to digest it. There are just so many metaphoric symbols and hidden meaning in the movie. The white background and cloth, the dialogues that represent some kind of deep meaning, and every action that characters make, just make the movie so interesting. The characters themselves are quiet complicated with their tangled relationships and internal struggles. The movie is in Guido's view and describes all his struggles and confusions that he has about life and his job. Every time Guido observes something, the film is transferred to his past. If not the past, he drowns in his own imagination where he is loved by everyone and is praised like a King. The notion that I got from these imaginations was that the main character believes that everyone should love him. The scene where Guido is in the house(where he spent his childhood) with all the women that he ever knew in life shows that well. Here, the sister-in-law, who actually hates Guido, comes out as one of Guido's fan in his imagination. The reality, on the contrary, is different and everybody is starting to doubt and question Guido. Thus, these transitions from reality to fantasy describe the confusion and hopelessness that the character has.Music also serves as a good way to express the emotions of the characters. There is the main theme song, bright and childish, which expresses the childishness or the will of the main character to go back to his childhood. Other times, different sounds are used to express the emotions of different characters. One of the sounds that jumped out at me was the sound that was played in the scene where Guido and his companions went to see the under-construction spaceship for the new movie. It was just so different from the rest of the movie.The movie is actually quiet addictive once one gets to understand the movie. I watched the movie two or three more times just because I liked it. I know what's going to happen and what the story is about, but the movie will just draw you in. It's a great movie and I recommend it to everyone who loves movie as an art-form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Fellini and classic cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One cannot describe 8 1/2, because it is a description by itself. A description of the inner depths of the human mind. It is a parade of images and emotions, even more colourful because it's black and white. The story is just the pretext.As with all masterpieces, it's not what this is about, it's how it's done. This world that borders between reality and magic is trademark Fellini. Nobody else could create this atmosphere. You can feel him directing his actors as if he was pulling the strings from above. But of course he knew more than everyone else that only Marcello could be Guido. On top of that comes the great Nino Rota with one of the most recognisable themes in film history.8 1/2 does not fall into certain category, because it's everything combined. One thing you can say for sure, beautiful films like this elevate cinema to an art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite scene is of his childhood, in which he is going to bed. There seems to be such simple beauty to the scene. The musicis perfect and the characters are great. At the same time one canfeel almost as they are reflecting themselves on their childhoodwhile watching this particular scene. Absolutely astounding!In response to the dislike for this film, I believe that if people wentinto the movie with an open mind and no preconceived thoughts ofit being "the greatest movie of the century" it would be far moreentertaining. Expecting any movie to be the best ever is a warm upfor let down. Also, people shouldn't be so analytical of moviesanyway. No one says one has to like or dislike any movie. So bygoing into a movie with the idea its supposed to be great oneimmediately becomes over analytical of it and cant simply enjoy it. Try it next time not being analytical of movies, you'll get more out ofthem and enjoy them more. The ambiguous nature of GOOD filmsallows for this. Its personally what I love about movies........interpreting them for myself and personalizing them. Try it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 1/2 is considered to be Fellini's masterpiece, and is well deserving of that title. Of all the great Fellini films, 8 1/2 captures his complete vision better than any other. This is a beautiful movie about the pain of movie-making. The dream sequences are incredible and far ahead of their time. This film is one of the reasons Fellini could possibly be the best director of all time. This is his most personal and heartfelt attempt. The viewer is really able to walk around in his mind during this movie and understand him better. As with many things in life, there are scenes that are terrifying and beautiful at the same time. 8 1/2 is the definitive Italian masterpiece and will always have its place in the list of the greatest films of all time.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much has been said of this cryptic masterpiece. Many seem irretrievably vexed by its slow pace and the variety of mysterious sub-plots. Well, this is definitely not a film for everyone. But the discerning viewer has at least a fair chance of finding in it a subtle and reflective beauty that is all the more poignant when one considers that it is basically a true story, not in a specific sense, but in an emotional one. It is basically a manifestation of Fellini's inner landscape and the creative paralysis encountered by many great artists. I think even those who dislike this film should still be able to appreciate the uniqueness of this approach as well as the artistry with which is was executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>life is mere metaphor for film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone were to ask me, what the black-and-white sound film was really all about, all I could do is show this film.A couple years before 8 1/2, Fellini made La Dolce vita - one of the most seriously down-right depressing films ever made. Although I respect the art of the making of that film, I cannot recommend it; it is close to three hours of unmitigated spiritual corruption, disappointment, and unresolved Freudian mush.I mention this, because in 8 1?2, Fellini explores pretty much the same territory as La Dolce vita, with one really important exception: here he's willing to allow his protagonist to experience his unresolvable personality difficulties through the fantasies that make him an artists and not just a 'jet-set' clone.The difference, seemingly only a slight matter of perspective, is staggering. This is a very funny film. It is no less critical of its disgustingly superficial environment, nor is it any less remorseful over lost opportunities of youth; nor, for that matter, does it ever find final peace with the conservative demand a young Italian artist would experience from his family after the second world war. But once the whole of this world is blended into a film (the bizarre sci-fi fantasy that, of course, never gets made), we suddenly realize that film isn't simply a device for making metaphors for life - it is THE metaphor for life, except that it's superior to anything else we might actually experience - so really, life is mere metaphor for film.Well, that;s what this film is about - and if you don't like it, too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women in 8 1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am fascinated by Fellini's study of women in 8 1/2. Not women as they are, for surely no woman in the movie has much resemblance to a real woman -- but women as the symbols that a man often perceives them to be. There are three archetypal women in the movie - Luisa, Carla, and of course Claudia. Claudia in introduced to us first at the spa, giving Guido a glass of healing water. This is who she is -- a healer. She appears later, in his bed, saying 'I want to set things in order -- I want to clean.' It's not a domestic vision, but a spiritual one -- she is the one who can forgive, absolve, and heal him. She represents his desire to return to the women of his childhood -- women who loved him by caring for him, making him feel safe, happy, and good. Claudia is the adult version of these women. Carla is next introduced to us. Carla is carnal desire. She is unthinking lust, soulless appetite. She eats too much, drinks too much, and is literally feverish. She has no taste, no discretion, and no intelligence. Guido desires her, but is embarrassed of his desire. He wishes he could be free of her, but he can't. She represents his lust. Carla is the adult version of the Saragina. Lastly is Luisa, Guido's wife. Intense and angry, she is a challenge to Guido, because she is his equal. She calls him out, demands that he be more than he's ever been. It is clear that he loves her, but does not know how to love her. He is doing a bad job of it. It will take everything Guido has -- all his energy, creativity, as well as complete honesty, authenticity, and nakedness -- to love this woman. Loving her will never be easy, but will be rewarding. If he manages it, it will be the greatest achievement of his life. In the middle of a conversation about Luisa, Guido speaks of wanting to do something truly honest, something that buries all the dead things in him. Loving Luisa, and earning her love, would be this achievement. But Guido is filled with self-doubt; he is not sure he can manage it. What strikes me at first about this is how absolutely perfect Fellini's casting and costuming is in this regard. Claudia is the angel in white - the mythical woman who heals and cleans and forgives. With her easy smile, gentle demeanour and knowing look, she absolutely embodies this ideal. It's uncanny. Almost as uncanny is Luisa. She is beautiful, but her beauty -- as it should be -- is more challenging. This is the kind of woman you go to battle for. The kind you die for. Carla, as well, is lust embodied -- I think this is more about costuming and direction than casting, but it's clear. She's um, desirable, but in a sort of disgusting way. Just like the Saragina. The end of the movie is the explosion of these ideals in Guido's mind. Of course he is forced to realize that Claudia isn't his salvation -- she's just another girl with a pretty face. But after that, in the dream sequence that ends the movie, we see Claudia dressed in white one last time -- she is walking left in front of the camera. In the next shot, everyone else is walking right, dressed in black. Suddenly, they are all around him, dressed in white. Guido's ideals have clashed with reality, and now he sees his salvation in all the flawed people around him. We never see Claudia again, but we see a much happier Guido. When the entire cast of the movie comes down the stairs, some are dressed in combinations of black and white -- Guido is able to see now not only their damning elements, but their saving ones as well. It seems significant to me that Luisa in all in white, for the first and only time in the movie. Perhaps Guido has realized that the salvation he is seeking is in giving all he has to this woman, that she is everything he needs, not because of what she is able to give to him, but because of what she is able to challenge him to be, and because of what he can give to her. If that is true, this is the most affirming movie about marriage I have ever seen, and that's just another reason why I love it. I feel the inadequacy of this analysis. It is far from comprehensive; there are so many symbols, so many things to see and ponder in this movie. But that's just another reason to love it. It's relatively straightforward, and yet chock full of stuff. How many movies are like that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though 8 1/2 seems spurious and even dull at times, it is difficult to look past the sense of rebirth and humility that the director portrays. Through the highly confusing and intricate life that the main character leads, we see the humble apology and acceptance of the director as he tries to make a film that explores his own chaotic psyche, as well as the misconstrued identities that surround him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much the showman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this again recently, my basic problem with Fellini remains unchanged - when in the end Guido celebrates the circus of life, summed up by a circus band of musicians and the cast joining hands to dance in a circle; to me it sums up the problem of Fellini as too much a ringmaster or coordinator, orchestrating fact and fiction and past and present and the tools of cinema in a complex and atmospheric whirl, but ultimately not touching me on any level deeper than the transient rush of pleasure associated with the big top spectacle. This movie is more satisfying than most of Fellini's work though, because of its more sombre and psychologically acute underpinnings (particularly well caught in the scenes with Aimee). In fairness, Fellini is not just a showman but is also a strong intuitive designer of scenes in a way that gives them both a visual flourish and an inherent thematic muscle, even if that too often consists of a vague form of alienation and dissatisfaction watching a crazy world with bemusement. The more blatantly auto- or pseudo-autobiographical stuff doesn't do much for me at all; apart from its more measured and subtle and classically built-to-last cloth the movie often seems inherently little superior to Fosse's All That Jazz: the more real it is the better it is, but Fellini is seldom real - that's my problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 1/2 has been known to bring a tear to my eye, if only because I know it takes courage (as well as narcissism) for an artist to throw himself onto the screen for the world to see. I'm not sure how much of this is autobiography and how much is fantasy (with Fellini, one can never be sure), but one thing's for sure: the wonderful Marcello Mastroianni (in the lead) is playing Fellini, as the director saw himself. Mastroianni's performance is masterful, the film is beautifully unnerving, and I find everything about it as close to perfect as any film ever gets.

		<fullReview>The woman activist, in one of the last scenes, must have been talking about the Fellini who shot this movie. (Sigh)I never thought the day would come when I had to write these words but this one is nothing but a narcissistic, pretentious, piece of nothing. Now, I know I'm not making any friends here, specially in the artsy crowd, but I don't write my reviews to make friends but to call them as I see them and what I see here is a waste of celluloid, a flick with no reason to exist. One thing that reveals well the mediocrity of this movie is the waste of great music in trite, meaningless scenes; that's what I'm referring to in my title, to the insignificance of the crowd scene where this Wagner piece is played, compared to the immensity of you know which. That came at about 10 min. into the movie and already I had come to the conclusion that Fellini had absolutely nothing to say at that time, nothing to show, but that he felt anyway compelled to make a film. Then it was the turn for the artsy-fartsy mob to consecrate it as a masterpiece and after that it was for the unwashed to fall into fake admiration and awe face to just another butt-naked emperor. Now, if you want to see a really good Fellini dealing with the same subject?the filmmaker seen during the shooting of one of his works?rather watch his far superior Intervista (1987), one greatly underrated at that.But you don't even got to spend 10 min. to realize that Fellini has fallen here?also!--into the artsy trap. Already during the first shots, a car burning on the road, you realize this will be a cinematographic wasteland; the kind of flick that leaves you the impression of having been made of assorted pieces of used film taken from the trash bin in the cutting room which are then glued together in no particular order. Because for a good 90 min. there's nothing holding it together: plot, characters, psychological undercurrents, accumulating tensions, which is the clearest hint of a filmmaker?or a fiction writer?having nothing to say, show, at the moment in his life, with the inevitable result of his work coming out as nothing more than 2 hrs.--or 200 to 500 pg.?of emptiness and boredom. I wish I could say that what Fellini is doing here is simply exorcising his inner demons; or getting closure for a traumatized childhood during which he had to endure, for ex., all kinds of abuse from priests for watching a fat woman dance in a beach; or that he's metaphorically getting even at women for the disproportionate role they play in his life?I'm just supposing--but the banality of it all precludes that thought. Here there's neither the emotional intensity, the visual confusion, the complexity of situations that a good director uses to illustrate memories, specially traumatic ones. For ex. I remember a hauntingly beautiful dream sequence in Bu?uel's Los Olvidados, one that I felt like living it also, that I haven't forgotten yet, thanks to his masterly use of light and darkness, of the movements of the characters. Obviously Fellini had the talent to shoot such scenes, if what he wanted to show was the filmmaker scratching his own inner dungeons, corridors, trying to use what he's retrieving there into the open to use it as material for his plot, yet it seems as if instead he purposely chose to make of 8 ? the most banal, trivial, movie of his career. There are lots of serious subjects brought up here?adultery, mid life crisis, sexual insecurity and repression, social conformism, machismo, misogyny, etc--yet they are all treated just as jokes?like the ultra misogynistic way Guido treats his "harem"--or like mere afterthoughts, with no one of them being developed further, taken in a more serious and profound way. There are even some sequences showing great promise, most concerning memories?-Guido's parents, the Catholic school, the communal bath, etc?but all lead nowhere, none of them is developed further and linked to his present conundrum as a director.Still, despite it all, there is one saving grace for 8 ? and that can be said in just two words: Anoux Aimée. What a charisma of this woman! Without being a flashy, Bardot kind of beauty, she becomes the focus of each one of her scenes. She just has to stand there, doing nothing, to fill the screen. Well above Milo, Cardinale. I know she was famous in the 60s but I never imagined she was that good. She is the one singlehandedly preventing this film from being a total dog, giving it the last 30 min. the psychological and emotional depth 8 ? was sorely needing, even giving the rather vacuous, inconsequential Manstroianni's Guido a similar depth. If you watch it, keep an eye on her, specially during that terrace scene (90 min.), where she is truly formidable. BTW, Guido must be a true cinematographic genius as his producers have such patience with him, tolerating all his moods and antics, while we don't get to see squat of his talent. I know he plays Fellini, and I know the movie refers to filmmaker's block, but man, even "blocked" masters are still masters. I just could't see the great Fellini anywhere in this man, like it was the case all over Intervista.In all, a Fellini that you can give a miss. Just Anoux's scenes worth watching. One of 4 pts. go to her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's better to destroy than create what's unnecessary."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini's '8?' is one of the most celebrated films of all time, hailed as an undisputed masterpiece by all who watch it. I wanted to love it. I wanted to love it as one loves a son, but this simply was not to be? at least, not yet. There is certainly much to be admired about the film, but I never made that emotional connection with the characters and events, constantly feeling as though I was merely an outsider staring in at a movie. Perhaps, with its self-referential nature and its frequent unannounced lapses into memory and fantasy, this wasn't the ideal Fellini film for my first foray into his work. Nonetheless, rather than putting me off the director, '8?' has rather whet my appetite to see more of his films.The partly-autobiographical plot revolves around an Italian film director, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), who is supposed to be producing an epic science-fiction film but is experiencing a debilitating bout of "director's block." At the same time, Guido is also battling momentous marital problems, trying (and failing) to sustain a working relationship with both his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aimée), and his mistress, Carla (Sandra Milo). With nervous producers constantly pressuring him from all sides, Guido is unable to cope with everything in his life, frequently shifting between reality, fantasies and vivid childhood memories.There are certainly many things to love about '8?.' The autobiographical element of the film was fascinating, and perhaps even an accurate depiction of the psychological barriers faced by a celebrated director whose every picture is expected to be a masterpiece. The film, courtesy of some imaginative cinematography and fast-paced editing, is energetic, dazzling and colourful (if this can be said of a black-and-white film), and there is a healthy combination of reality and dream sequences, and instances when the line between the two is blurred. The acting is excellent all round, with Mastroianni delivering a particularly excellent performance as the trouble-plagued director.But? what is the meaning behind it all? It is likely that Fellini was perfectly aware of his film's "shortcomings" (if you were inclined to call it that), for he introduced the character of Carini (Jean Rougeul), who frequently appears to harshly critique Guido's script, highlighting the issues that a critic might raise about Fellini's own film: "you see, what stands out at a first reading {viewing} is the lack of a central issue or a philosophical stance? That makes the film a chain of gratuitous episodes which may even be amusing in their ambivalent realism. You wonder, what is the director really trying to do? Make us think? Scare us?" In doing so, Fellini cleverly stays one step ahead of his critics, whom I'm sure would be in the vast minority. However, does acknowledging the potential flaws of your own movie somehow exclude it from that same criticism? Of course, this is left purely up to the individual viewer.Though '8?' is beautifully envisioned and executed, I never really felt part of the film I was watching. It really had a cold and sterile tone to it, and even the dream sequences ? during which we are supposed to be inside the main protagonist's head ? felt distant and impersonal. Nonetheless, even just the technical brilliance of '8?' is enough to win my respect, and, like most great films, I'm sure that a repeat viewing will prove infinitely useful. I can't yet say that it is a masterpiece, but perhaps time will change my mind?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film closed and the credits rolled, but still I didn't move. I felt like I had just gone to a confession. Why this is I don't know. 8 1/2 is obviously a film that takes much thought and repeated viewings to even begin to comprehend. Reading the other comments I found viewers have said the film is a test of patience. I on the other hand felt exactly the opposite. I thought it was enthralling. From the famous opening scene on I had left my seat,... I was inside 8 1/2. But perhaps that is more of a personal statement then anything else. I didn't find it boring in the least, but it's easy to see how others can. I really don't think 8 1/2 is a film for an audience. As a matter of fact I don't know who it's for. It's very hard to decide just what fellini has on his mind. I think perhaps, among other things, it is an image of his mind. A twisting confused mind, like a great collection of random thoughts all squeezed into a single narrative. Maybe also he is trying to evaluate reality. What is real after all? He mixes dreams and true life together in one beautifully filmed picturesque of lies. I'm sure anyone reading this has heard all about how the 8 1/2 is an autobiographical film. Well it is, but even at that it's much more. Amazingly 8 1/2 is a film about the making of itself. Think about that for a second. I sincerely doubt that this has ever been done before. To a degree Fellini made the film as he experienced it. I think that 8 1/2 is probably the most true to life movie ever made. No Joke!!! This is because it's not just life. Everyday living is so much more than just a simple narrative. It's a complex web of reality, dreams, fantasy, and so on. Fellini not only captures the characters feelings, he digs down and captures everything, even what they don't know about themselves. In the end we have the image of a certain time period in a certain mans life. But not just on the outside, how others see him. We are given the rare privalege to see inside his mind, see everything he sees, thinks, and experiences. Let me tell you it's quite a trip!!! Well, I could go on but I won't. I feel 8 1/2 is a masterwork, and I'm only 14 years old. I have only seen it once but I look forward to seeing it many times again. Great, bold, brilliant, and all the usual praise. Certainly better than La Dolce Vita. Those who haven't seen it need to. Watching it is a commitment, but it's a very rewarding one. Those who can really put themselves to the test are in for a huge treat.*** E-mail me with your comments. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't talk me about Catharsis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellini is a genuine Shakespeare that translates language and poetry to the big screen. His plays are biographical, personal and felt, just like Shakespeare exposed his bare feelings in multiple plays. In "8 1/2" Fellini roams around the creative block, the solitude and all of the torments that surround artists, that take their passion seriously.But, my problem, is I like neither of them. Fellini, so centered in his script in making it ethereal and passionate, he forgot how to knot the movie into different, fun stages. He focused on making people to try understand his inner thoughts in a way too long catharsis.I believe it's great to talk about one if director and talk it's personal world to the World. But, I am a hasty, pushy critic. I at least want to have fun. I like classics, but they have to have some connection with what Hollywood gives us (too) much: entertainment.If you have lots, lots of patience and like to watch old films to enhance to your movie library, and you're sharp enough to figure out the innuendos, hidden messages and smart lines, go for it. I think I owed a review like these to people that are somewhat whimsied by the Hollywood nature and will not stand Fellini's personal yet sluggish rhythm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put simply, 8 1/2 (Italy, 1963) is about a man simultaneously suffering from a midlife crisis and from "artist's block," the sudden onset of creative paralysis. Yet nothing about this Federico Fellini masterpiece can truly be understood simply. Mixing memory, fantasy, and reality, Fellini offers up an intense, semi-autobiographical psychological study of Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), a film director imprisoned by his own success and riven by the conflicting claims of carnal desire and spiritual guilt, of the need for power and the need for love and approval, of high artistic aspiration and the fear of commercial failure.Fellini's oft-expressed opinion that cinema lagged decades behind arts like painting, theater, and literature, no doubt partly motivates the avant-garde style and sensibility found in 8 1/2, a clear break from the director's roots in the Italian Neo-realist movement. The film's unusual title alludes to Fellini's having completed seven and a half prior films and also suggests that film number eight and a half remains in perpetual progress. As many commentators have observed, 8 1/2 is a film about the creation (or abortion) of 8 1/2 itself. This sort of artistic self-reflexivity is a key characteristic of postmodern art, but is traceable in Italian literature at least as far back as Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, an influential monument of modern drama written in the early part of the 20th century. In 8 1/2's unforgettable surrealistic opening sequence, the film's protagonist is introduced through two nightmares. In the first, Guido is claustrophobically trapped in an automobile stuck in traffic. In the second, he is floating like a balloon above a beach until an anonymous figure pulls him down via a rope fastened to his leg, and he falls into the ocean. As classic Freudian nightmares, Guido's relate to his anxieties about success and failure, love and death. They thus form a prelude to the film's more realistic sequences, in which the sources of Guido's anxiety become clearer - especially his troubled personal relationships with women, his Catholic upbringing with its guilt-mongering sexual repression, and the multitude of difficulties he faces as a film director attempting to create art within a collaborative and commercial context.The realistic plot elements of the film are anchored to Guido's retreat to a health spa where he hopes to find the tranquility and inspiration to complete his stalled film project. Instead, he is besieged by demands and questions from his co-writer, his producer, his wife (Anouk Aimee), his mistress (Sandra Milo), actors and staff, news reporters, the clergy, and casual passersby. Sequences involving these characters segue without warning into and out of daydreams and memories, most importantly Guido's eerie encounter with his parents in a courtyard/cemetery, the prostitute Saraghina's sensual rumba along with the humiliating punishment young Guido receives for observing it, and the infamous "harem sequence," in which Guido is at first docilely served and worshiped by women from his real and fantasy lives and then must tame their fierce revolt with a patriarchal whip. Perhaps the film's most perplexing character is the hauntingly beautiful young woman in white (Claudia Cardinale). Introduced as a Muse-like apparition at the spa and later arriving in the flesh to play an equivalent part in Guido's film, the character has been suggestively interpreted in Jungian psychoanalytical terms as the repressed anima (feminine element) of Guido's subconscious, reunification with which is necessary to establish his psycho-synthesis or balance. Although such an interpretation may seem a bit heavy, it is supported by a childhood flashback where, surrounded by the loving women of his extended family, Guido is taught a magic phrase by his older female cousin: "asa nisi masa." Decoded (remove every "s" and un-double the vowels), the word is "anima." A magician dredges up the word from Guido's subconscious in a key scene midway through the movie, and the restorative power it represents seems an important part of the film's final scene as well.Of course the ending of 8 1/2 presents an especially difficult interpretive challenge since the film seems to end twice - and in contradictory ways. The first ending occurs at a pre-release press conference where Guido ? in a complete state of alienation, frustration, and despair ? crawls under a table and pulls a gun on himself. The camera cuts away, and we hear a gunshot. Has Guido shot himself or only contemplated doing so? Impossible to say for certain. In any case, the next sequence shows him apparently alive and present at the disassembly of his film's primary set: a launching pad for an insistently phallic rocket ship. At that point a second, seemingly happier ending kicks in, one in which Guido comes to terms with himself, his wife accepts him for who he is, and key characters from all phases of his life re-appear to join him at a circus performance where Guido as ringmaster leads them in a celebratory march. It is a finale reminiscent of Shakespeare's The Tempest, and, if only a fantasy, a powerful one. The juxtaposition of these two endings has - to say the least - bewildered critics and general audiences ever since the film's original release. For some, the contradictions indicate the director's confusion and the film's essential incoherence. For others, they lend a rich ambiguity and provocative brilliance to the film. I would certainly cast my vote for the latter view. 8 1/2 is an endlessly fascinating film that rewards multiple viewings even if - or probably because - its mysteries are impossible to definitively resolve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times fascinating blend of memories, fantasies, dreams and reality, of all which end up overlapping each other, the film nevertheless fails to tell what I could call a very good story. The reality sequences feel loosely threaded together: just events showing different struggles on the road to having a film made. The film brings up some notions about personal film-making in order to show one's past and significant memories, and this is mostly likely what the film is about. Yet, there are a number of other unrelated events thrown around the place in a very episodic manner. Since these episodes to not all have the same relevance to the story, they are arguably excessive and are depicted for too long. Even some of the dream/fantasy scenes feel like they could have been cut down in length. The storyline has a good core, but the outer shell just does not fit in a way that I can call good. There is very limited development of the supporting characters too, which makes it difficult to be swept away in the story. The acting never rises above the ordinary either. However, the film succeeds okay even with a story that is perhaps not much good, as Fellini knows how to direct a film very well. The lighting is great, with some excellent use of over-exposure, and superb contrasts between darkness and lightness. It is well shot too, with the camera often following the characters around, and the costumes are glitzy in an almost dreamlike manner, well suited to the film's project. Fellini's use of music feels a bit too infrequent, because when it is used it really enhances the images. This is an excellent film for technical specs, however I would imagine that the storytelling method and the story itself will leave many viewers groping for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult film that is worth seeing due to its influence more than its own merits, even if it does have merit on its own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guido Anselmi is a film director who is preparing for his latest film. However with casting in progress and mere days until shooting begins, he is still unsure of his story or even his theme. He feels trapped and pressured from all sides, like he is totally out of control and at the mercy of himself and others. While he is haunted by memories of his past, his present appears to be coming apart as well. In the middle of all his affairs, his women, his attempts at art and making successful films, Guido is lost and unsure of where he is going.And that is about a good a plot summary as I can manage I am afraid! I saw this film many years ago in an art cinema when I was even more of a movie snob than I am now; nowadays I settle to see this sort of film in my own home without feeling the need to make a special effort to appear elitist! Anyway, in order to review it I watched it again the other night and I am finding myself under as much pressure as Guido himself! Do I just go with the flow and hail this as a piece of art and therefore make myself stand out as an intelligent, contemplative film watcher or do I write a more balanced, true opinion that reflects my real opinion even if it means it will appear that I am just not arty and intelligent enough to 'get it' and will get messages telling me to stick to action blockbusters! Well, I'm afraid that the latter is the only option for me.This is not preparing the way for me to dismiss the film because I found it curiously watchable and interesting as a very personal sort of film. I do not know enough about Fellini to be able to say this was his life on screen but it certainly had the feel of being a very intimate story that was more about Guido's feelings and fears than any specific narrative about making the film. As such it was difficult to really get into and I found it all to be a bit obscure at times, requiring the viewer to do a lot of work to keep up without offering much in the way of help in understanding the characters and their lives. It was still interesting because Guido did have some aspect that became clear if you stuck with it but generally a little help would have been appreciated. Without this help the film appears to be freewheeling without a frame in the manner that very personal films often do ? the director understands the significance of every shot and he forgets that, without his frame of reference, we do not. This is best illustrated in the melting of scenes in the body of the film and the end of the film that is hard to interpret satisfactorily.Time has not helped the film either and it does appear very dated now, with the images already in the mind of the first time viewer from other films, whether they be Woody Allen or Pulp Fiction, this has gradually become a film that is important to see because of the directors influence on cinema rather than on the merits of the film on its own. I sound a bit harsh because this is what I felt but I still did think that my time was well spent watching the movie because it was imaginative and it was a chance to experience Fellini in full flow in a very personal seeming film. On top of that, this is a very influential film and, for all my difficulties penetrating it, I still felt that it was one that I should see to try and recognise its influence and its importance to those directors who are the artists of my generation. The cast seem a bit unaware of the meaning of the whole thing as well and the only one that I looked like he had really connected with Fellini was, fortunately, Mastroianni. He really helped me get into his character and he brought a lot to the film with his performance ? even when he wasn't doing anything he is still a great screen presence. The rest of the cast are not quite as good and really concentrate on being larger than life characters ? only Aimee and a couple of those playing the other main women really struck a note with me.Overall this is still considered a classic and influential film and that is the reason I came back to watch it again. However it is also a dated film that is difficult to get into because it is such a personal film; but then this is also why I found it interesting, as I tried to work out the meaning of the scenes and the character of Guido. Many viewers will wonder what all the fuss is about and, in a way, they are right because the film is mainly worth seeing for its influence rather than on its own merits; but with the well shot images, good direction, personal touches and thought provoking material it is still worth seeing: just don't expect it to live up to the high praise that many famous fans and viewers have been heaping on it for all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accept me as I am. Only then can we discover each other.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Wow. Double Wow. I was unsure what I was about to indulge myself in when I first picked up this film. Foreign, Fellini, and Oscar were all that I knew about this mythological film. I had read about it in books, read reviews of it on top ten lists, but never found myself in the same room as it. I wanted to see this so passionately that when it arrived I immediately popped it into my player and began watching it. What I witnessed was like a drug on the brain. The images, the story, the sheer brilliance and force behind the crafty eye of Fellini brought me deeper into this film than any other I have seen. This is not easy for me to say because I have seen tons of films in my lifetime, but this film really takes the cake. The brilliant black and white photography, the powerful ear-gobbling music, and the acting ? Marcello Mastroianni controls this film. You cannot seem to get your eyes off his scenes. All of these elements create an innovative, provocative film based loosely on the life of Fellini, but also about the competitive and dragging world of film creation.From the opening scene, the tone is set in this film. As we see Guido (Mastroianni) trying to escape a smoking car while nobody tries to help, we are captured. The senses are heightened, and claustrophobia sets in and never leaves throughout the rest of the film. Fellini has trapped us into this character and is beginning our roller-coaster ride known as Guido's life. As we meet the rest of the characters, that looming claustrophobia continues to stay with us. We add to this grab bag of emotions the struggle that Guido has with women, the stress pressures of completing a film that he has no clue how to start. The only idea he has deals with a large structure that seems to keep the producers at bay. Couple with this his struggling childhood memories of women and the angry power of his wife. It is hard not to be involved with Guido throughout the course of this film because of these intense emotions that Fellini has fed to us.Outside of the emotional aspects of this film, it is beautifully directed. Fellini pulls no stops (nor does Criterion) in the creation of this film. The music, the actors, and even the beauty of the random, chaotic scene works to perfection every time. This is not a film you can sit down and enjoy once, it is definitely one that needs to be played over and over again. In the film Sideways, Giamatti's character talks about wine being 'never the same each time you drink it'. Each sip produces a new flavor and even if you open another bottle of the same, it may not be able to replicate the same exact taste. That is how I feel about this film. The first time I watched it, I was oblivious to the surroundings and the sub-stories. I was so engulfed with Guido that I couldn't keep my eyes off him. If I were to watch 8 ? again, focusing on a different aspect, I am sure to see a different film than I originally saw. That is the greatness of Fellini, he directs so that each time you watch you are constantly seeing something new.I saw that with his film Juliet of the Spirits as well. I am not as voiced in Fellini as I should be, but these two films have proved that I need to see more and more of his work.Finally, I would like to say that I enjoyed this film for a direct reason. You don't see this technique used in many Hollywood films today, and I think that is why it caught my eye in Fellini's masterpiece. You could be sitting in a room full of friends and family, and honestly each person in the room (as the final credits ran) would say that they saw a different film than what you thought. It is like going into an art museum for the first time. You can all look at the same visions, but it is how you perceive these visions that makes it a great piece of art. Fellini did this with 8 ?. I don't know if it was on purpose, or if he had a direct vision for some of the scenes, but when it was done there were several different thoughts about this film. I guess what I am trying to say is that it creates conversation.This isn't a film that you sit down, watch, and walk away without a word muttered through your lips. This is a piece of art that will remain in your mind long after the film is over, causing questions to arise days, weeks, months after viewing. I still ask questions about Guido's dream where the women from his past and present all live in the same house as him. It is so deep and beautiful that it erupts with conversation daily. I find that a great tool for grading films is how much conversation occurs after them. Good or bad, if you can talk about it at lengths with friends, than you know you have something special on your hands.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film. While the ending was a bit confusing, I continued to think about it long after the film was over and came to realize that Fellini is a master of film. I cannot wait to watch this film again, and again, and again. It should have won for best film of the year in 1964, or at least for best director, but alas, I can live with the best Foreign Film of the year. This film should be at or near the top of everyone's favorites list and should be served with an amazing red wine, an open mind, and good friends. It is the perfect combination for this priceless film.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guido is capable of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Fellini's film 8? for the first time, deciding upon its finale that it is indeed a cinematic masterpiece. Rarely am I able to feel kinship with a celluloid character the way I do with actor Marcello Mastroianni's portrayal of Guido Anselmi, a psychologically threadbare shell of an artist (obviously Fellini's alter ego or subconscious in ways) teetering on the brink of artistic ruin. Occasional moments of brilliance shine through him haphazardly, but out of apathy, he just can't move forward.Fellini creates an autobiographical series of encounters between Guido and his ego, his false bravado, his failure as a human being (not an artist), and his inner demons. As a result, Guido's past dredges up zealous parents, Catholic hypocrisy, and his attraction to the opposite sex, which begins at an early age with a stout prostitute named Saraghina who lives by the beach (the Catholic priests refer to her as `The Devil,' of course) and blossoms into full-blown public infidelity. His intellectual, estranged wife seeks a separation, knowledgeable of his betrayal and his impish personality, yet, it matters little to him what he truly loses or gains, as there is little rhyme or reason to his social behavior. He drifts on effortlessly like Querry, the lead character in Graham Greene's novel, A Burnt Out Case. Alienated from his own emotions, Guido treads water in a sea of limbo (though it is clear that he loves his wife on some level that she cannot understand) and fails himself with creative paralysis. `Accept me as I am,' he tries to say to his wife, `Only then can we discover each other.' Words of wisdom? I feel sympathy for Felini flawed creation because it's so damn accurate! Guido is an artist trapped by his own prospects, trying to deal with the aftertaste of an unanticipated success that has given him the freedom to experiment. As all his jaunts into sovereignty catch up with him and spiral out of control, he questions the new perception he's skated into, astonished that no one really accepts him for who he is. And so he resorts to deception -- fabricating different identities and feigned self-assurance for the reception of others -- while desperately trying to be true to his chaotic, unwitting spirit. Strangely, he never really pins the blame on religion or parenting, just shows how they helped develop what was already there. In the end, not even a muse and the promise of hope are able to pacify his confused mind. His identity is simply an understated madness of his own design. The people around him who only comprehend `black' and `white' never see the gray that is his world ? it's a classic tale of abstract vs. concrete, pulled from the estranged depths of a Franz Kafka novel. Guido hungers for escape, but doesn't know what to run from, exemplified in a rocket set to blast off to nowhere, in clowns leading all of the people in Guido's life around in circles, in a human kite pulled violently back down to earth, in a man escaping from a traffic jam, in magical cleansing spas, in mud-baths and medicinal mineral-water. But nothing offers him escape from the demands of others ? from the superficiality that he has grown accustomed to -- because no one ever really wants the miserable truth. In short, the lying man becomes fatigued with lies, but he still sounds like he's crying wolf. Toward the end of the film, an actress named Claudia Cardinale tells Guido he is incapable of love? but that didn't ring true for this viewer. I believe Guido, like all of us, is very capable of love and affection, just not in the traditional sense. He loves for the right reasons, not the wrong ones, and relinquishes all responsibility and rules, reducing love to a simple emotion, which it really is. He's just stuck ? Billy Pilgrim style ? between two worlds. Love shouldn't blossom simply because someone has jumped through a series of hoops to warrant adoration ? that's not love; it's worship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare but Must-see Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure the average movie watcher would take a look at some of the reviews on this page and wonder what in the world these reviewers are talking about, so here goes a simple explanation. First of all, understand that with Fellini, nothing is for certain. The prefix psuedo- fits extremely well with the director, because nothing is ever for real. While this definitly hurts some of Fellini's films, it helps 8 1/2 very well. The lines are blurred slowly throughout the film, till there are no lines. Hope I haven't lost anyone yet. The movie, about a fairly well-known director with no clue what he is going to film, manages to display the chaos of the directors life very well. While the director's conflict at first seems simply to be a case of over-hyped writers block, it turns out that it is much deeper. The director goes through more conflict than anyone around him knows, and soon the man starts having psuedo-flashbacks (there's that word again.) Remembering events from his joyfull and sometimes sad childhood helps the director escape from his chaotic everyday life. Fairly soon the line between dreams and real life are blurred, and it becomes impossible to tell what is real and what is not. The life becomes more and more downhill in a spiral motion till the end of the movie. While it is highly hinted that the movie is autobiographical, maintain a critial eye while watching. Some of the footage may be based on the life of Frederico Fellini, but most is probably not. Should you go see it? Yes. Should you like it? Some do, Some don't, I can see from both perspectives. But in this case I'd still give it 4 out of 5.</fullReview>

And two, for Barbara Steele. My second reason did not disappoint, as Steele gets plenty of screen time (though I suspect she was largely dubbed) and this is a nice step up from her work with Mario Bava.The first reason also paid off. This is humor, plain and simple, from one of Italy's greatest directors. Part self-referential and part irreverent, this is a joy to watch. Unfortunately, not enough Americans will ever see it because it has no familiar names (to them) an we all apparently hate subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A director's ruminations on the women in his life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A director is supposed to be working on a big-budget film that is part science fiction, part autobiography, but he becomes obsessed with the process of casting actresses to portray the various women in his life: his wife, his mistresses, his first crush, women he passed on the street, and finally even the actresses who represent these women. This is a lengthy, often-abstract, but usually-coherent reflection of the director's conflicted attitudes and desires. Through fantasy sequences it displays the character's private thoughts and memories with disarming honesty and a fair amount of humor. Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York" (2008) could almost be said to be a remake of "8 1/2," or at least a very similar rumination on very similar ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A collage of memories, fantasies, fears, aspirations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film director (Mastriano as "Giorgio" playing the role of Fellini), who had a series of recently acclaimed films, now has the schedule and financing for his next film. But suddenly--he's completely lost all his inspiration. Many potential actors/actresses, screen writers, producers, etc., keep bugging "Giorgio" about when will production start? who will have parts? The director doesn't know and keeps putting everyone off, attempting to appear suave and in control. Fellini made this film about a director in this position when he found himself in this identical situation. He resolved and transcended his dilemma by making a film about it. (Fellini had previously made 7 full length plus one short film before this; hence this title.)"8 1/2" does NOT have a conventional narrative or plot. Instead the director's apparent reality constantly intermixes with his dreams, memories, &amp; fantasies. The film opens with a person feeling trapped, then segways to a man soaring to the heavens only to fall to his death below. (On 2nd viewing, these are metaphors for "Giorgio's"/Fellini's feelings about his situation.) No two film critics (or viewers) will take away similar messages (it's an absolute Rorschach test in that sense). But it's a film the cognoscenti love and many will need to see it at least 2X-?X? to begin to feel they understand it.I saw this recently, didn't understand it but thought it interesting so then read reviews and saw it again last night. Still don't quite get it BUT, if you accept it as a quilt--or a collage--stitching together reality &amp; fantasies, memories &amp; dreams, mistresses &amp; wives--that comes reasonably close. (Fellini had a Jungian analysis and some say Anima and Animus archetypes are present in this film; I don't see that but I'm not a Jungian.)This movie must be VERY relevant and meaningful to those connected with the film industry since most in that field rate it extremely high. My rating: 6 of 10 stars for a first viewing, 7 of 10 for a 2nd (but maybe moving to 10 of 10 if you're inclined to research it and see it several times.)</fullReview>

I can only say that it affects me on a deep and complex level, leaving me in bittersweet tears at each viewing. It saddens me that not everyone enjoys this film as much as I, and many others, do. That sadness hearkens to the frustration of the artist (and of "8 1/2"'s Guido): To be endowed with the intense drive to share his vision, yet saddled with an obligation to make that vision accessible to an audience that wishes only to be entertained.</fullReview>

The film explores the dreams, inner thoughts and fantasies of a famous director suffering "directors block". At first it's hard and confusing to figure out exactly what is going on but as you delve deeper you realise that it's a portrait of a man's mental state whilst he comes to terms with his mid-life crisis. Definitely a film you need to watch more than once to truly appreciate, in some ways it reminded me a lot of films like Barton Fink, Inland Empire and Synecdoche, New York. The influence of a film like 8? is clear from the get go. Marcello Mastroianni was excellent as the lead and apart from the occasional overacting the supporting cast (which consisted of a host of beautiful women) were good too.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Meditation On Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of Fellini's films, 8 1/2 does not easily fall into any one concrete story structure, genre, or cinematic mold. It is a comedy, a drama, a fantasy, a love story, and everything else; it is a meditation on life, love, relationships, and our pasts. It's also, on the surface, an insider's look into the chaos and pressures of the film industry, and the constant nonsense and babel filmmakers (as artists) often have to endure to achieve their visions.The film has many positives. Of course, the character of Guido is brilliantly portrayed by the charmingly disillusioned Marcello Mastroianni and we can't help but sympathize with him, despite his many flaws. The film is beautifully lit, the cinematography is spot-on, the music is cheeky and dramatic as could be expected in a Fellini picture, and the costumes and locations are extravagant. However, I do have a small complaint about the film in that it's a bit too strange in some sections, almost to the point of being un-engaging. So, as a result, it tends to drag here and there. Overall though, a near-flawless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 1/2 (Federico Fellini, Italy 1963, 138 min.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 1/2 (Federico Fellini, Italy 1963, 138 min.) is a beautiful Italian film. Federico Fellini created a visually stunning film with a story that surprisingly captures the viewer. The story may be a little hard to follow at times especially since element after element is being thrown together. The skipping of time and place also adds to the confusion. Yet with proper viewing the film reveals itself to be rather stunning. The film is about a director named Guido Anselmi, played by Marcello Mastroianni. Guido is trying to compose a film concept inspired by life events and the relationships he has held, mostly female relationships. With producers pressuring him to make the next science fiction film, Guido's mind wanders in an artistic path of self reflection. Throughout the film many comparisons are made to link Guido Anselmi's character with the director of the film Federico Fellini. A few examples would be when Fellini acts as a stand-in during the introductory flying scene, also at one point Guido looks into a mirror not to reflect Mastroianni but Fellini himself. I would highly suggest this film to an audience, just make sure you are in the right mood to pay attention. With an undivided focus it won't be hard to be stunned by the creative design that splendidly overwhelms the film. I also think Colin Firth would make a perfect Guido Anselmi if the film was ever remade correctly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 ? is another one of the films I had to watch in this film class that I just absolutely did not like at all. I thought it was terrible and painfully hard to sit through. I did not follow not one moment of this movie. It was so terribly confusing. I definitely would not ever recommend or watch this movie ever again. It was almost like torture sitting through it. I am at a loss for words. I honestly do not know what all to put here. This movie jumped around. The man in it was some kind of man whore womanizer and was constantly getting with different women. Most of these women were just trying to score roles in his movies but I couldn't understand why they would want to do that. His films seemed to be terrible and he appeared to me to be an awful director. He even had a wife back home who was getting very tired of all his crap yet she tried to make the marriage work but he was just douche bag. I kept getting lost in places where it would flash back. I could never tell if we were in the present or in a dream or in just one of his old memories. He kept going back to being a boy and his mother taking care of him. He seemed to have grown up in a very loving family I don't understand where his bad characteristics were coming from. But maybe that was because I really just was pretty much clueless through out this whole film. I honestly do not know what the point of this film was. How would someone have even thought up something like that. It seems to me to be so crazy. This movie in my opinion was terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something that should be watched twice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched 8 ?, I fell asleep about twenty minutes into the film. I was tired and the room was warm, and while I slept, I had the weirdest dreams. This film, which involves strange dream sequences, permeated into the depths of my unconscious without me even realizing it! The film opens with the main character, Guido Anselmi, suffocating in a car as a crowd of people watch. This scene serves as a basic synopsis for the film, about a famous director who is expected to create a new masterpiece. However, the pressure is too much for him and he is unable to even create a script.Every aspect of this film is perfect. I never for one moment thought that Marcello Mastroianni is acting as Guido. He is Guido. The supporting cast is phenomenal as well. All the women in Guido's life interrupt his work, but he also craves their attention and approval. He also faces conflicts of his strict Catholic upbringing.Director Federico Fellini proves himself as an auteur with this film which is a great example of Camera-Stylo, where the director uses the camera as a pen. There is a sense that the film is autobiographical, in that the story is about a director who is unable to make a new film after a few "failures." There is a strong sense of alienation, with Guido feeling estranged and worthless. My particular favorite scene is a flashback to Guido's childhood where they play a game involving a "magical" phrase "asa nisi masa" which likely relates to the term anima, the idea of female characteristics in men.Overall, the film is a fantastic collaboration of many talented artists under the fine-tuned guidance of the auteur Fellini. A must watch for any film fan, but be sure to let it sink in before you decide if you like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy ride of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for my film history class and was found left feeling weird about by the movie. The intro of the movie with the music was very good as well as the movement. This is hands down an art film and if you aren't into it don't even bother with it. It's full of random moments and characters, each having significant symbolism and meanings. So if that is not your cup of tea just stay away and go watch something else you will enjoy. Other than that the movie is fairly good. The main character is a director pressured by the world to come up with this new movie, but he hasn't the slightest idea for one. That leads him down a winding trail of lying confusing the people around him with his tirades and crazy schemes. The movie has musical numbers in them, which I for one didn't get nor fully enjoy. They were just flashbacks from his life and his own fantasies. I felt they just killed time and proved the man's obsession with women and his craziness. There was one mistake in the film that I could not get over, it's in the end when he is told he has a gun in his right pocket, but he clearly pulls it out of his left pocket. That ruined the movie for me. I mean it's such a huge detail in the movie to screw up, and they did it royally. That just ruined the whole thing for me. I don't know if they meant to do that on purpose, but they had this whole movie based on nothing but a man with no idea for a movie being pressured for greatness, all to lead to his demise and they screw up the part where he pulls out the weapon. I mean come on have some class and respect for your movie! Mixed reviews on this movie, its good, but I'll probably never see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that 8 1/2 was a very unique and interesting film. The fact that it was a movie about making a movie was ironic and funny at the same time. It seems like such a simple idea and yet so complex at the same time. Fellini uses "dreamy" and smoky scenes to illustrate the craziness of the female characters. It's interesting how the film goes in and out of dream sequences which connects the real world to the fantasy world. The film can be a little bit confusing though, because of all of the different female characters, I found myself losing track of who was who. Maybe that was the point though, so that the audience can understand the confusion and chaos going on in Guido's head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini movie about Fellini</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie 8 1/2 is an Italian film made in 1963 and directed by Federico Fellini. the plot revolves around a Italian director named Guido who is at a spa trying to get over a small ailment and while there he is trying to prepare for the next movie he is supposed to make. 8 1/2 is loosely based on the life of Fellini himself and his difficulties in making a film which resulted in the creation of 8 1/2 instead of the film he was going to make at first, to put it in a nutshell 8 1/2 is about the making of 8 1/2 if you get what i mean. The movie does not do much on the level of plot and is more concerned with having strong characterization for the whole cast which it does quite well .The most interesting part of the movie for me are the dream sequences where Guido tries to work what he is going through at the moment. If you like this film i would also recommend 9 and Brazil by Terry Gilliam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film about Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm attempting to write a review of 8 1/2 and really no words come to mind. I could go over the basic plot, but is there one? Guido is a brilliant Italian director that is struggling for inspiration for his next project. He escapes from the city, which he feels suffocates him, he escapes from his wife, whom he loves but cheats on. The escapes his producer, who is just looking out of his own interest, all while he is dealing with flashbacks to his childhood. Guido is Fellini. There is really no doubt. But while I will say I loved it and do believe it is one of the finest films ever made, I find it hard to put my finger on just what it is about the film that is so brilliant. The story flows like a stream of consciousness, interweaving fantasy and reality. Guido attempts suicide at one point, but you don't take him seriously, not only because it is a fantasy sequence but also because Fellini doesn't present him as someone who would commit suicide, more it is Guido being over-dramatic. Which in itself is 8 1/2, a exercise in the over dramatics. Guido's life would be complete and less stressful if he could just handle himself. But he can't, he cheats on his wife, lies to everyone around him, and reminisces about childhood, apparently a time when he could just be himself and happy. But isn't that how everyone feels? I feel that way most times, remember an easier time, and this is that film. 8 1/2 reminds us of where we have been and where we are going. For the record though, the original ending on the train is a hundred times better than the tacked on trailer ending. It would have a much more organic flow to it as the finally feeling of success as you look upon everyone who has been a part of your life. I'm not sure exactly what Fellini wanted to make with 8 1/2, but he succeeded greatly in whatever it is he succeeded in.</fullReview>

And not only the aesthetics alone, but the themes of cinematic existentialism of the past century.Is it a best film for filmmakers? Maybe."Theatricality"? But the same "staged" flavor could be noticed in Eisenstein, Bergman and Tarkovsky... It was in early Fellini, too (La strada and Cabiria). "8.5" should be watch together with "Amarcord" and "Roma" (documentary aspect was a new addition).Forty years ago it must be a revolution, but with time it got a classic flavor. Got better?

		<shortDescription>Incredible tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film twice now, last night the most recent on a medium quality VHS copy. I quite agree with other commentators that each viewing reveals aspects that were not originally apparent. It is a complex film and has many facets and is worthy of multiple views.If you love Marcello Mastroianni then this is just about one of his finest performances. What struck me and maybe it's just my own tastes, is that for most of the film he speaks very quietly and calmly and it has such a hypnotic effect; you feel yourself relaxing and yet he's so seductive. That calm voice is in such contrast to most actors in most movies who speak as if they are on a stage where loud projection is necessary. I am not sure if it was Fellini's idea or it was Mastroianni's to speak in such subdued tones but I just so enjoy the effect.He uses this charming relaxed way with almost everyone in the film, his mistress, his wife, his friends; they all are spoken to with a soft touch. So, what does this say about the man he is portraying? Hard to say that it has a direct connection. This is supposed to be a movie director who has lost his mojo and message and is adrift in a project he cannot connect to or motivate himself into. So, you would expect that the conflict he feels, the illness he is at the spa to recuperate from would make him more high strung? And to that expectation Mastroianni plays against the grain, or at least in my imagination he does, to great success.The opening scene for me is one of the most exciting and brilliant I have seen in all of movie history. Not exciting like guns or explosives going off in all direction: I mean that what Fellini has created is intellectually exciting....he has put us straight into a dream-like state, maybe the actual nightmare of the main character and we are sucked in to the frightful center in just a few seconds with such simplicity. Fellini used our imagination in place of special effects (partly because in 1963 they probably didn't exist?) mostly because our own imagination, our own unconscious is such an effective place to place an idea - our mind does all the work for us. The claustrophobia he feels as he cannot escape from his car; the silent and blank staring faces just increases the fear of a man as he attempts to escape from suffocating smoke. The entire premise of the rest of the film is setup at this point.There are many dream-like sequences in the film; one of the most effective and ghoulish is where Mastroianni escorts his father to descend back into his grave. The sight of seeing his father step further into the earth is shocking and hilarious at the same time; a great visual stunt.This is such a multi-layered and textured film and I'm not doing it the justice that a book length review could. I so much enjoy this movie. What we should remember is that as Fellini released what might be his masterpiece, the Beatles had just released their first album and the war in Vietnam was about to turn awfully nasty. In the early days of the angst of the 60's came this crazy, arty, Italian dream-fest, confusing people, delighting Fellini and Mastroinanni fans. It is at once overly serious, contemplative (Fellini looking with humor at his own self), hilarious, creatively aligned with a dadaist twist of oddness and yet seen these many years later it is still able to stir us and tickle our fancy. It has aged very well. I hope that the DVD version is cleaner than this print; the subtitles were often hard to read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that explores a filmmaker's psychology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've yet to find out if there were other films before "8 1/2" that had a film director in crisis as the central character and used the film-within-a-film as a narrative framework, but if we are to take note of film critic Leonard Maltin's remark that the film has been "much imitated in recent years" (films like Francois Truffaut's "Day for Night" (with regard to the character) and Kinji Fukasaku's "The Fall Guy" (with regard to the structure) come to mind), then there can be no doubt about that.The film deeply and exhaustively explores a filmmaker's psychology---his neuroses, troubles, fantasies and affections---and the kind of interrelationships that go on within the filmmaking process, whether it has entirely got to do with the activity itself or not.For almost two-and-a-half hours, creative imagination and rational thinking (or, if one prefers, fantasy and reality) constantly mingle with one another as the director, Guido Anselmi (enigmatically portrayed by Marcello Mastroianni, Fellini's "spokesperson"), struggles through coming up with an original story, getting the nod of a demanding producer, structuring a symbolic setting and pooling together competent actors (whether for a major or supporting role), while various personal matters---those relating to his childhood, family, the milieu he grew up in, the women he loves and admires---are being dealt with, in a self-analytical and dream-like manner (something which Sigmund Freud would likely hail).</fullReview>

As a movie director he is chase by beautiful actresses-his wife think that he is a failure,an Unfaithful (all artist are).When Guido is with Claudia("the splendid" Cardinale) she also tells him the truth:"you're incapable to love someone".At the end in that chaotic press conference Guido seems desperate for the first time but after that,,he knows he has something,another film? maybe he is searching for coherence,I don't know really.8 1/2 is a journey of fantasies and reality and dream like sequence of a man in crisis or what else? some images stick in my mind...the man floating on air like a kite;the suffocation in a traffic jam;the fat lady"Saraghina";the beautiful Claudia Cardinale;the unique presence of the great "cool"Marcello Mastroianni,maybe because this film has that quality and shows why we love films,actors,directors and cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody does fantasy like Fellini. This is one of his best works, and through a movie in which there is hardly a believable moment the center is clear and realistic: a man who just isn't comfortable in his life anymore seeks escape through his wild imagination. Doesn't it seem a curious contradiction that Guido is stuck with creative block, unable to make a movie, but is filled with those flamboyant fantasies that make this a great movie? Rather, that's the point: the dreams and daydreams make him drift farther from reality as his world tumbles down upon him - he prefers them to any movie he could make, even a movie about them. Watch him directing the women in the screen test, only hoping he could direct his wife like that. When he plays the erotic game with his lover, slapping on the whore-paint, he escapes the reality of his wife in favor of the fantasy of the willing, maternal whore who tells him that everything is all right. He tries to become innocent again, a child who closes his eyes to the world because it's better that way. Guido's sad story is a tragic spiral down into oblivion, and the victory at the end is completely empty - a victory over life. Yet we still smile because it's so beautiful, and maybe because we prefer his beautiful fantasies to our reality.</fullReview>

Fellini's compositions and timing are simply superior. You are emerced in a world of sometimes bizarre yet believeable fantisies. Perhaps the analogy might be "writers block" at the global level. The Director in search of his creative roots to inspire the rebirth of his growth as a creative source is one that I can identify with. The lonely serarch for inspiration, the need to escape the ordinary that claws at us during the process of creating, for me, it's all here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant visual trip...definitive Fellini!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been many years since I first watched 8 1/2... too many years. I become thoroughly engrossed from the opening dream sequence to the final dance on the beach. No one does black and white imagery as effectively as Fellini, and this film is his most definitive. 8 1/2 is also the most autobiographical film that Fellini has done. Marcello Mastroiani plays a self critical and analytical filmmaker who is trying to develop a new film project. The film often goes inside Mastroiani's mind and we see the brilliant visual artist at work. One of more humorous sequences is one in which the various women in his life all operate as a "harem" to serve his needs and then stage a revolution against the tyrant. Towards the end we see the filmmaker have doubts about his film and himself, wondering if he has anything to say. One of the women says to him "Why piece together the tatters of your life--the vague memories, the faces--the people you never knew how to love." Fortunately for us, Fellini did leave us this most personal film, and a number of others afterwards, including Juliet of the Spirits, Satyricon, and Amarcord. We are fortunate that he resolved any self doubts he may have harbored, but we are especially blessed with 8 1/2, which definitely ranks among the best films ever created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 1/2 is a 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie I started to doze after 10 minutes, an immense embarrassment as I consider myself a Fellini fan and count Satyricon among my favorite films. Earlier Fellini is more demanding than the pyrotechnics of his later films, however, so the addition of a few years under my belt prepared me for the experience when I rented the tape again. From the outset, with Marcello Mastroianni tethered like a lost balloon, to having his screenplay premise ripped to shreds by his hawknosed writer, I found 8 ? to be an immensely enjoyable, extremely funny film. Never have the exploits of a self-centered putz been so enjoyable, and I doubt any actor other than Marcello could have mustered the charm necessary to make Guido anything more than a self-centered, self-indulgent boor. While I felt the film ended 2 or 3 times before the lights actually went down, I nonetheless consider myself a better person for having experienced 8 ?. The most interesting aspect of the film to me, now that it is 36 years old, is to realize the entire thing is nothing more than an anthem to male chauvinism. Guido is allowed to wallow in self-doubt, infidelity, duplicity and vacillation, yet at the end of the film he more or less "forgives" his fellow men ? and all his beautiful fellow women (including the ones he has "sent upstairs") ? by allowing them to come back into his life. The entire experience is singularly egocentric and totally male. However, it is performed with such charm, and is, of course, such a product of its time, that there is really nothing to be offended by in this one-eyed view of the world.</fullReview>

The only video versions I've ever seen really butcher this film with pan &amp; scan, but the laserdisc is widescreen and so it is much better. But on the big screen is really how it has to be seen. In my opinion 8 1/2 shares the number one spot with 2001. It is Fellini's best film, and his funniest. Mastroianni taming his harem to Wagner's Ride of the Valkaries is the most profoundly comic scene in the history of cinema. The Dantean descent into the steam baths to find the ridiculously apotheosized cardinal in the center who can say nothing except that outside the catholic church all is evil; a marvellous satire of catholic dogmatism. All the performances are excellent. And the cinematography! This film was very innovative and original with its extensive use of the most fluid of fluid master shots. This is truly passionate filmmaking. I think it is currently being rereleased at select theatres throughout the country, so see it.</fullReview>

Not many, I assure you, and that's what makes a film like this so rare. 8 1/2 remains today as the film that shook up Italian cinema. However, despite it's controversial premise (the idea that the main character's Catholic education left emotional scars) and innovational camera work, it managed to remain unscathed by the critics, Italian and foreign alike. I can offer only one reason for this lack of expected criticism: sheer amazement. This film's dream-like aesthetics and lofty dialogue can do nothing but evoke awe from the viewer. Mastrionni's superb performance only adds 8 1/2's perfection, and provides the body for Fellini's (questionable) alter-ego. This film is truly a work of art, and to this day remains untouched by the critics. No one has the nerve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Federico Fellini was given a very healthy budget to work with here after the success of La Dolce Vita (1960). However he, like Guido, had no idea where the film was going until the cameras began rolling. This combination of freedom and lack of direction has resulted in one of the most insightful films ever made. Its subtlety rescues it from dullness and its innocence rescues it from conceit. What could have been an embarrassing dud, and almost was, turned into a stylish Fellinian masterpiece. It takes patience, however. I fell asleep the first time I saw it and only really began to see what Fellini was doing on the third viewing. Obviously not a casual film, but definitely worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8? lightyears beyond human deed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directors generally see things around and write scripts. But Fellini dreams and with his movie he takes you to a place where you could never be. In the movie, he ultimately transforms a dream like sequence to reality and its such a wonder. Compared to other Fellini's movies like Satyricon this is straight-forward but I still recommend viewing it number of times to appreciate the magic of Fellini. Certain characters are nothing but projection at the protagonist's mind. While few others are one and same. The BGM is fantastic (mostly from Western classical) and did I mention the famous "Harem scene". There is a mid-aged prostitute shown too scary in the movie as Fellini is known to show women in beautiful yet scary way. This semi-autobiographical movie is impossible to rate so beyond 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to write a review. I just want to dedicate a few words to the greatest film of all time. Along with 'Last Year At Marienbad' this would be discussed and dissected even after a thousand years. People then, would also stand in awe. Tears of joy will roll down their cheeks. Art is immortal. And this is the highest point of art. Exactly 50 years ago, 8? was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. 50 years have gone by. A 1000 more will pass by, but the most exciting, ethereal, magical, exhilarating, brilliant, astounding piece of art, ever created on celluloid, will remain immortal. My favourite film of all time. Il Maestro and Marcello and Rota will live on forever. So will 'Asa Nisi Masa' and 'Saraghina'. And we'll hold hands and dance to the ending tune till eternity. Here's raising a toast to the film where the law of diminishing marginal utility doesn't apply :)Cinema is 8?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8 1/2 is of the most original and spellbinding films I know of. One of the beauties of cinema is to merge the artist's memory and fantasy; Fellini certainly utilized this magic to present his story and characters that embody both humanity and mystery. This film is an autobiographical piece (of Fellini himself) about a movie director named Guido, how his life is consumed by his increasing obsession with work. He avoids questions and problems as if they will go away somehow, only to experience more questions and problems. Ultimately, Guido realizes the only way to solve his problems is to face them rather than escaping, accepting himself instead of wishing he was someone else.It isn't really possible to place '8 ?' in any simple category. It is a comedy and a tragedy, a satire and a celebration, a movie about love and about the lack of it, a movie about making art and a movie about living, an autobiography and the most challenging kind of fiction, a masterpiece of style and a movie that's really about something. It's not for everyone, but it should be, and it's quite possibly the single greatest movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What are you working on now? Another film without hope?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually fluid and beautiful without being especially profound (or moving), Federico Fellini's "8?" is a semi-autobiographical visione personale at an Italian film director (Marcello Mastroianni) with an ailing liver who is besieged upon by actors, producers, reporters, starlets, and hangers-on while making his latest movie. It is ironic to criticize a movie which puts the criticism of art in a sardonic light (as if nobody had any valid opinions); still, the picture has such a dreamy, lovely ambiance (with gorgeous lighting and black-and-white cinematography) that the chatty, unsurprising 'plot' just seems like a nuisance. Mastroianni cuts an amazing presence on the screen (and gives a playful performance), yet the externalizations of his fears and desires could very well be anybody's--Fellini seems to regard the character as somehow superior for his heightened appreciation of the fantastic. True, some of his day and night dreams are stunning to absorb, yet there isn't anybody else to care about (the movie-world in Italy appears to be festering with self-absorbed ninnies and narcissists). There are enough married men chasing younger women in other movies, why does Fellini give us this old ploy once again? The film appeals to those who prefer to believe it is saying something 'new', yet if Fellini had simply cut back on all the talk--allowing us to discover this landscape for ourselves--it might have been a more embraceable masterpiece. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

I'm sure there's a lot of things that I haven't understand (that's why a second or even a third viewing is recommended), but it didn't stop me from really enjoying this cinematic feast. And it starts right at the beginning with the brilliant opening sequence: how it's difficult to get out of the prisons we build ourselves. The actors are sublime. Viva Mastroianni! There's also a lot of strong moments. The music adds to the intensity. The same can be said of the great camera work. A touch of poetry is also present. Fellini's obsession with women is evident. Paying attention, there's great lines that force you to reflect on your own life. Truly a masterpiece! Seen at home, in Toronto, on May 1st, 2005.91/100 (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 1/2's autobiographical aspect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ozjeppe-You're right-this is a self-absorbed film. But name me one film that isn't.8 1/2 is highly autobiographical and is relentless in its reflection of Fellini's life. 8 1/2 is essentially a film about a director who cannot finish his film, MADE by Fellini, a filmmaker who also was having trouble making a film. However, if you think this is ONLY about Fellini, you're mistaken. No great film can be "great" without saying something (whatever that may be) about life itself. This is no different. Don't tell me that you've never wished to go back to being a young child, surrounded by love and lack of expectation and responsibility! Don't tell me that you've never wanted to pool every character in your life together and make sense of the whole thing. Don't pretend that your world doesn't mean everything to you. And finally, don't hold all of these things that you've experienced yourself against Fellini simply because he made a film asserting it. And how many men (and women) in the world can honestly say they wouldn't love to have multiple lovers knowing of each other and GETTING ALONG? This is a film about the human condition, about memories and fantasies, and about our need to flee to these when reality is too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I did not fully understand Federico Fellini's 8 ?. I got a little confused with the constant interchange between Guido's dreams, fantasies, memories, and present events. Although it was easy to distinguish the reality from fantasy, I did not fully understand the reason for these fantasies and what they were about. Having just recently seen a similar excellent mind game movie (Mulholland Dr.), I learned how to and get the central message by understanding a movie by heart Without a doubt, 8 ? is one of the best movies made about filmmaking. Many believe that master director Federico Fellini based the movie on himself and his struggles. The movie appears semi-autobiographical because the central character in the movie is also a director named Guido Anselmi, played brilliantly by Marcello Mastroianni. It is about Guido's confusion on what his next movie is about. While trying to reach a decision, Guido also confronts his own personal problems. Guido is already a successful and famous director. And for his next film, a science fiction one, he asked the studio for a massive construction of a prop spaceship. The construction cost the studio millions of Liras, but they did it anyway because they are confident with Guido's abilities. Before filming starts, Guido had a nervous breakdown that made him think about what he is doing. He then postpones the shoot and tries to rewrite the script. When he could not come up with the story he likes, he believes that he ran out of inspiration. So retreats to his dreams and fantasies to come up with one, while his producer, cast, and crew keep pressuring him to start the shoot.Aside from his problems with his film's story, he also confronts his problems with his wife Luisa (Anouk Aimee) and his mistress Carla (Sandra Milo). Guido invites Luisa to the set even though he knows Carla is there. Guido is even careless enough to let the two women be present at the same place. Luisa knows about Guido's affair with Carla, but Guido keeps insisting her that its over. Fellini's directing is excellent. He gracefully guides the audience inside what is clearly a troubled man's mind. Sometimes, Fellini does not show a transition from the realities to the fantasies, but we know that it's only a fantasy because it couldn't have happened in reality. We take a journey through Guido's mind. From his memories of dancing with a prostitute as a child to a fantasy where he has all the woman in his life in the same room. Fellini's camera work is amazing, and he also added some entertaining dance sequences. My only criticism here is that it takes the movie too long to get off the ground. It seems to be stuck in its launching pad at some times. Some scenes and sequences are a little too long and extended. Nonetheless, 8 ? is still amazing and captivating. It exhibits and plays gently with the mind. 8 ? is one of the stalwarts of foreign cinema, and I recommend this movie to movie lovers who want to see something different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense personal statement from the Italian wizard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellini claimed to have never read James Joyce, whose Ulysses is perhaps one of the more apt literary companion pieces to the Italian filmmaker's dreamy, brilliant 8 1/2. As perfect an intersection of life and art as one could imagine, Fellini's motion picture draws heavily on events from the director's own life, but gives them a cinematic spin with remarkable results. Marcello Mastroianni is the perfect stand-in for "Il Mago," and I just adore the passion with which he wields his whip (for all the women in his life, of course) while wearing nothing more than a sheet and his trademark hat. 8 1/2 must also feature cinema's most memorable use of Wagner this side of Apocalypse Now and What's Opera Doc? during the amazingly staged and photographed introduction to the mineral springs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caught this magnificent film at the start of an extended run at BFI Southbank, London and it seemed as fresh as ever. From the claustrophobic opening sequence, trapped inside a car and watched by surrounding travellers, to the exhilarating ending where everyone joins hands, this is confident and bold and always visually stunning. Many images I remembered from my last viewing, many years ago, and they made me smile with recognition, like old friends. Claudia Cardinale is not given an awful lot to do here, she just has to appear as the perfect fantasy beauty and that she does to perfection. I had, actually, forgotten that Barbara Steele was in the film and was startled to see her pop up, with her distinctive and luscious features. Anouk Aimee is great as the director's wife in a very tricky role as she comes to terms with his friends, male and female. Sandra Milo is the fourth fine actress helping this vast venture with her blowsy and bosomy performance. I am surprised and glad to note that these four are all still well and working today 50+ years on. There are so many vignettes one could draw attention to but, suffice, I think to say that despite (or maybe because of) the many imponderables and failures illustrated, this remains a most life enhancing movie. Too long? Well maybe just a shade but who would dare to put their scissors to this work of genius? PS: I notice that amazingly i have written this piece and not mentioned the towering and pivotal role played by the ever excellent, Marcello Mastroianni. Whether seen quick stepping away from an unwanted encounter, liaising with one of his ladies or simply seen in close up peering over his glasses he seems to be the very essence of 'charismatic'.</fullReview>

The film is a continuous day dreamers' delight mixed in with the silly, annoying , or otherwise pretentious pulls of a big time director. The humor works although my enjoyment is deterred by the the simply lousy Italian dubbing. A second viewing much later helped, in that regard. Marcello Mastroianni is a likable and his fantasies and memories are definitely accessible, at least for men. From that perspective, the film seems very Italian. The sexist ways are pitted against the Catholic Church in theory, but are discarded much like real life, but this viewers' experience was borne out of curiosity more than a desire for entertainment and I found some satisfaction from both perspectives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is one of my all-time favorite movies. I honestly believe it to be one of the most creative films I have ever seen. Told through a brilliant collage of memories, fantasies, and experiences, 8 1/2 presents its protagonist, a famous director named Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), with a psychological intimacy so deep that it could never be told in a conventional way. Fellini believed in telling a story as he understood it, even if he, himself, did not understand it. This honesty is what brings the confusion of Guido to life. No one, not even Guido, is completely sure of what is going on. Guido is lost on many levels, searching for something, but he does not know what. While he probes through his mind, seeking answers, there is an unrelenting paparazzi buzzing around the famous director, asking infinite questions about his upcoming picture. Guido would most-likely provide answers to the people around him, if he knew any of the answers they seek. His world and his mind are filled with questions and devoid of answers. Mastroianni does a remarkable job of showing the stress and strain Guido is under. His face is so worn at certain points in the movie. He appears to be exhausted himself. Watching this, it's hard not to see that Guido is on the edge, clinging to the idea that the next moment will provide his long-awaited answers. His problems only gain momentum, however, until a press conference that changes his personal and artistic lives forever. Fellini does a magnificent job at balancing Guido's Freudian fantasies and tension-filled life so that the downward spiral of one man's breakdown is elevated, through surrealism, to an almost dreamlike state. The supporting cast is quite effective with a wide array of eccentricities. Nino Rota's music is playful and whimsical, catering to the insanity that is Guido's high-profile world. Gianni Di Venanzo's cinematography is equally extraordinary. Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is as spectacular as his alter-ego, Guido, would have wished his film could have been. Out of a crippling creative block came a brilliantly conceived work of creative genius! An outstanding film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now 50 years old, I'd say that Fellini's 8 1/2 is a movie that has definitely lived way past its prime.As I patiently sat and watched this excruciatingly over-long picture, I began to seriously ask myself, over &amp; over &amp; over again, what the hell was Fellini's point in all of this nonsense? At 138 minutes of what seemed like one "filler" scene after another, I certainly thought that a good half-hour's worth of story could've easily been edited from the sheer frivolity of it all and no one would've ever noticed the diff.I found that this film tried way-way too hard to be too quirky and surreal for its own good. And because of this, its deliberate oddball perspective (that seemed too often to be directorial bulldozing) quickly lost its overall appeal.Yes. 8 1/2 did contain some very striking b&amp;w camera-work, but the repetitiveness of its imagery soon became one of its greatest downfalls.I also resented this film's blatant product placement of both the Ford and the Coca-Cola logos. Since this was an Italian production, filmed in Italy, it struck me that this was very likely Fellini's attempt to suck up to the Americans. And, in doing so, this could've easily played a part in 8 1/2 winning its Oscar.8 1/2 is one of those films that's bound to delight some, while, at the same time, disappoint others (like yours truly here).*Trivia Note* - This film's title refers to the eight and half films that, up to that point, were credited to Fellini in his career as a director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fellini's most interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellini's ironically creative film about writer's block is quite a mouthful. It's not really challenging in any other way than challenging your patience, but I do have to admit that two-plus hours of non-narrative philosophic ponderings about life, love, art and religion, formative childhood memories, and burlesque fantasies did wear on both me and the people I watched it with. The recurring thing about people constantly bothering Guido did a good job of depicting a director's hardships and made it perfectly understandable why he killed himself in one scene towards the end, but I'm not sure if that can be considered a victory for the film or not. Also, even though there's clearly a lot of self-criticism in 8? as well, the "brilliant-but-misunderstood director" feeling rubs me the wrong way.That being said, there's a lot of brilliance in specific sequences, like the elated ending or the lovely conversation between Guido and Claudia Cardinale. Most impressive is the seamlessness of it, it really plays out like one long stream of consciousness; despite the camera trickery and the vastly different locations, the film could almost have been shot in one take for all I could notice. Other Fellini films get to me more emotionally but this is definitely his most interesting, if also the most self-indulgent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8? is my first film from Frederico Fellini and while I can't say I really liked it, there are many aspects I appreciated here. It's interesting how Fellini makes you feel like you're inside this troubled filmmaker's mind, constantly intercalating flashbacks of his memories with his fantasies and reality. Essentially, the story is about Guido, a famous director who suffers from a creative block and is unable to come up with new ideas for his upcoming film. However, it's so much deeper than that as he retreats to his dreams and memories, hoping to get inspired while also having to cope with personal struggles and the absurd amount of pressure from the cast and crew. I liked how vibrant the characters were at times and the camera work here is simply astounding. The opening dream sequence was very innovative and the way Fellini introduces each character, making Guido interact with so many of them at the same time was excellent. I was also surprised by how funny some of these encounters got (mainly in the first half of the film). While I appreciate the surrealism and strangeness here, I felt that some characters weren't particularly interesting and some sequences were a bit too extended so I wasn't very engaged with the story on certain occasions. Still, 8? is a fascinating and insightful work of art and certainly worth seeing by any film enthusiast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Film "Eight and a half" was released in the United States on June 25, 1963. It was directed by Federico Fellini. This film came to the United States from Italy and is in Italian. Because of the need for subtitles, the film can be somewhat difficult to understand. The main character of this film, Guido Anselmi, was portrayed by Marcello Mastroianni. He portrays a character that seems to know what he is doing. He plays his character very well and seems to not have any problems. The film is about a director that has lost his will to make a film and goes into his dreams to come up with new ideas. After much deliberation, he comes back with a newfound energy to make his film. The movie follows his interaction with his wife, an actress in his movies and many other people. In this movie we see the life of a film maker and the type of life that he lives. The main problem that I have with the film is that the film seems to go nowhere. It doesn't seem to have a point. The big event at the end with the movie premiere seems to be what the movie was leading up to but this doesn't seem like a big enough event to be a climax. I guess that overall the film seemed boring and there was nothing to hold the interest of the viewer. Overall, I felt that the film was not able to hold the interest of the viewer. The acting in the film was great although it was kind of hard to tell because it was in Italian. The main character was played very well by the actor and comes across as the all knowing Hollywood director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Self-indulgent Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1960's proved novel to international cinema. Specifically, Italian cinema became watershed. Those challenging and sober themes of post-war Neo-realism, though pervasive, began to travel down more expressionistic avenues. Besides peeking around doorjambs and tackling real social issues, a new style emerged, mirroring mental events that displayed subjective memories, imaginary scenes, fantasies and dreams. "Chimerical" was the best word to describe the time, with much respects to its hierarchical roots: German Expressionism.Federico Fellini's "8 1/2" is one of the better examples that, in the true sense of the word, "exemplifies" the aforementioned but brief summary. The film, as Fellini describes, is "self-indulgent." It was not made for public fanfare or critic accolades, but was more of an iconoclastic push-in-the-face to media in general. The autobiographical story follows the crowded life of film director, Guido, who, in the midst of making a larger-than-life science fiction film, suffers from an existential crisis.We travel through many surreal corridors, many of which are either incoherent or elusive, but all of which represent the psychology of Guido's memories/dreams as he painstakingly struggles to complete his film. In this aspect, the journey of a filmmaker actually making a film, despite its highly stylized qualities, is very realistic. The non-linearity and seemingly capricious juxtapositions of both Guido's film within Fellini's film mirror each other. In fact, Fellini uses Guido and his story as an extension of his own: two struggling filmmakers who seek to complete their masterpieces.Although extremely challenging to the the viewer's patience, in retrospect the film can be very rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this film is loved and admired by countless filmmakers and fans. I know that the film is very artistic and wonderfully well made. And I understand that all serious lovers of film SHOULD see this film. But, despite this being a "must-see" film, I didn't particularly enjoy it--but I do respect what Fellini was trying to do. For the first time, Fellini was able to capture on film the psyche and inner turmoil of a director and although the film stars Marcello Mastroianni, the film is in many, many ways autobiographical. His inner struggles with traditional morality and god, sexuality and loyalty, all the sycophants trying to get his attention and the critic as well as his own childhood (including, of course his mother AND a representation of early sexual awakening in the form of a hideous but very sexual lady who looked a lot like Divine!) all come together in a series of somewhat disconnected images. All these factors that together work together to make the director's psyche are interesting, but very surreal--like the entire film is a dream or something that is the result of drugs. It is interesting at times, but also very tiring and difficult to watch at times and occasionally a bit dull. That's because it's a very choppy movie and only a child who is very hyperactive could easily stick with the ever-changing plot. As for me, what I liked best was the opening dream sequence--it was very amusing and brilliant. This type of self-analysis and parody was often copied in such films as STARDUST MEMORIES (to me, a blatant attempt by Woody Allen to steal or re-created 8 1/2) or DAY FOR NIGHT--though Truffaut's vision is much, much more conventional and lacks the surrealism and weirdness of Fellini. Many prefer Fellini's mad style, but as for me, while it is not as original or wildly innovative, DAY FOR NIGHT was a more enjoyable film.Overall, while not a fun or completely comprehensible film, it's a must for anyone who considers themselves a serious fan of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: this review is written in response to the notion that "8 1/2" is a 'masterpiece' because it is a representation of an artist (Fellini), unable to conjure an imaginative concept/plot for a film, and therefore recording his own writer's block and submitting it as a full-length motion picture. This precis that I've just written is not a mere interpretation, it is an actual summary of the movie. *Does this sound appealing to you?* "8 1/2" is the equivalent of an amateur painter turning in to his or her patron a half-blank canvas, untouched because the painter's limited creative range of talent prevents them from producing anything more than a testament to their own intellectual impotence, and a blue-print of the form they utilize. Enjoy- if you value style SOLELY over substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is movie is not for everyone, and people who watch all kinds of films and understand more of cinematography and direction than usual should enjoy this film. I have never really liked Fellini's works, mainly because i don't like the way the "plot" flows, and the way the story is told ,but this movie makes it up being one of the most beautiful B&amp;W films I have ever seen. Not only the movie is appealing to the eye but it also deals with important issues of the human soul and has memorable quotes which I'll probably remember for a while.Needless to say it is a must see for all Black And White fans and people already into Fellini's style, but I would also recommend this movie to people who do not like Fellini if anything for the mesmerizing visual of the film.This movie's got a strong 7/10 from me, which means I recommend it indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Applaud the man with no clear ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers throughout) I really related to this film. I think a lot of people can relate to this film. I do not think this was just about making movies - I think that this film is about everything. Guido is a man who, if not grounded by those around him, would shoot off into the heavens with his fantasies. This seems to be what the rocket ship symbolizes. It's not so easy just to let your imagination catch flight - it requires a whole slew of people involved in the production - and that means rules...just what Guido does not want. He wants to know why he needs all these people in his life - why he can't just get by without them. And in the end...he discovers that he wouldn't be who he is without them. That those he wants to reject [or control] are exactly who he needs in his life to give it meaning. Think about the humanity involved in that. This is the secret spot in all of our souls that if we achieved harmony, there would be nothing left to struggle for...(And as the only one who seems to notice this fact - how can he rely on anybody else around him who's not also in possession of this divine knowledge?) Well, that's just one basic point that I got out of this movie. I could be wrong. But I don't think that Fellini would have completely disagreed with what I'm saying... The problem is that if you point out any one basic idea in a movie like this - you lose that meaning trying to sum it up in words (can you say "Asa Nisi Masa?"). That's why you have to see it. I think that for a man with no clear ideas about anything (as one of Guido's friends put it) he did the best anybody could given his limitations.btw...Did anybody else notice that the movie Guido is trying to make is the very film that you are watching? I guess this is probably obvious - but I haven't read a review yet that mentions it. This idea was so far ahead of it's time - way beyond similar themes like in "Adaptation" - which was a good movie, but doesn't even come close to having the many layers that only few geniuses like Fellini are capable of producing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the first foreign films I saw is still in my top 10 of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini is a genius of cinema, which many would attribute to this, La Dolce Vita, and many of his films of the 1950s. At the time I first saw this, I knew I was seeing something special, almost not of this planet, but I was also too young and not familiar with films in general to really appreciate it. After seeing it a few more times over the years, 8 1/2 remains one of those great films that I really experience more than watch, as the scenes and characters and outrageous humor and cool pathos and philosophy is all up for grabs for the senses. It's the kind of film, ironically from its subject matter, that inspires me to create once its over. Fellini tries his best here to get the audience in love with the language of cinema, if nothing else, and people will either go with it, find it amusing, or dismiss it altogether as pretensious, self-indulgent rubbish.It's got Marcello Mastroianni in one of his milestone performances as the perpetual artist/filmmaker in a creative, spiritual, and just overall crisis of wills. What will come of his next science fiction film, if it is eve one? What about his past and how that may or may not affect not just the film or his life? And the women, oh Lord the women (the scene where he's surrounded by them in a dream-state is one of my very favorite scenes ever created with the chaos in fantasy and reality combined). True, it might be a little confusing at first, matter of fact sometimes things might just fly right by, hence not totally getting into it on the first time. But even on the first time that moment in the car, leading to him flying in the air, is about as indelible in the world of cinema as two fingers meet in a giant painted ceiling.Sometimes melodramatic (or operatic, or carnival-like, or just bewildering and beautiful in equal measure), sometimes ludicrous, though always true to itself, it challenges its audience with something many people can relate to, not just creative people or artists or filmmakers even (though for the latter it's definitely the landmark of movies about movies). I want to give this film a hug...actually, I'd rather whip it into submission while brandishing a cape and black hat to Wagner music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Italian intellectual twaddle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say 8 and a half doesn't have a few gleams of truth and beauty in it, almost by accident, it seems to me, but it fails on its basic premise.A film director, any director, in any country, of any time, may agonise over life, the universe and everything, including his own infidelities, before or after making a film but NEVER when he is making a film! He is simply too busy trying to get his film made!What I do find interesting though is, as it appears to me, that the great Russian director Andrei Tarkovskiy must have watched this or other films of Fellini as some of the camera shots seem to resemble and therefore must have suggested his own in his films, which came a little later. Tarkovskiy did work with an Italian collaborator on some of his scripts to give them intellectual heft. Tarkovskiy didn't always avoid portentuousness in his work but he managed it more than Fellini, I think, and his work has better stood the test of time. One may groan about the present state of quality world cinema but Fellini's pretentious piffle is not, I think, something about which to be nostalgic. Maybe a sequel, Nine and three quarters would have been better?</fullReview>

If it has a strength it is the ambiguity which allows any and everyone to interpret it in their own way, put their own spin on it etc and if it has a weakness it is the ambiguity which allows any and everyone to put their own slant on it. It certainly features fine actors, Anouk Aimee, Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale but on the whole it's like placing a piece of abstract art before someone who prefers Art to be representational and defying him to make sense of it, which is, of course, by definition impossible.</fullReview>

As Guido struggles half-heartedly to work on the film, a series of flashbacks and dreams delve into his memories and fantasies; they are frequently interwoven with reality. The film's title refers to the total number of films Fellini had previously directed. These previous works included six feature films, two short segments, and a collaboration with another director, Alberto Lattuada. The latter three projects accounted for a "half" film each. After directing these "7?" prior projects, the film became production number "8?" for Fellini.[2]Fellini's previous six feature films included Lo Sacco Bianka (1952), I tortellini (1953), La strati in (1954), Il bid-one (1955), Le not-ti DUI Cabiria (1957), and La Dulce vita (1960). His two short segments included: the segment Un Agenzia Matrimoniale (A Marriage Agency) in the 1953 omnibus film L'armory in citt? (Love in the City) and the segment "Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio" from the 1962 omnibus film Boccaccio '70. His collaboration with Alberto Lattuada, was Luci del variet? (Variety Lights) in 1950. The working title for 8? was La belle confine (The Beautiful Confusion).8? is about the struggles involved in the creative process, both technical and personal, and the problems artists face when expected to deliver something personal and profound with intense public scrutiny, on a constricted schedule, while simultaneously having to deal with their own personal relationships. It is, in a larger sense, about finding true personal happiness in a difficult, fragmented life. Finally, like many Italian films of the period (and most famously evident in the films of Fellini's contemporary, Michelangelo Antonioni), 8? is about the alienating effects of modernization.[3]8? is highly autobiographical: Fellini made the film because he himself was suffering from a director's block; the character of Guido (played by Mastroianni, whom Fellini often used to mirror himself in his films) is a representation of himself and many of Guido's memories are based on Fellini's own. Because of this, 8? is a recursive film: a film about the creation of itself as well as a meta film.During production, Fellini hand wrote a note to himself and attached it to the camera below the viewfinder so that he would constantly see it when filming. It stated, "Ricordati Chet ? UN film Cormack." ("Remember, this is a comedy.")8? was filmed in the spherical cinematographic process, using 35-millimeter film, and was exhibited with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1As with most Italian films of this period the sound was entirely dubbed in after wards; following a technique dear to Fellini many lines of the duologue were written only during post production, while the actors on the set mouthed random lines. This film marks the first time actress Claudia Cardinale was allowed to dub her own duologue ? previously her voice was thought to be too throaty and, coupled with her Tunisian accent, was considered undesirable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not just a movie, it is a film about Fellini. There are many moments in the movie that appear to be dream sequences if not moments in Fellini's travels that reflect the story of fictional director Guido Agostini. Both are similar in the way a Director thinks and what a Director has to deal with on and off the movie set. Even the title: 8 1/2 is about Fellini and the number of movies he had directed up to this point. Marcello Mastroianni adds his brilliance as an actor to 8 1/2. An excellent example of what an actor must have to be a great actor, Marcello has a presence about him that doesn't require talking. His image on screen blows you away with his dramatic and comical approach. Other film makers have stolen moments from Fellini's films to achieve greatness. The dance number is almost identical to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction dance number. The opening sequence alone in 8 1/2 is beyond wonderful. It is a powerful convincing opening that reflects the true emotion of the main character. He can not breath, he is stuck, unable to escape the life that he is leading. A Christ like figure in some way, he flies away beyond the horizon, where eventually, he is pulled back down to reality...and the movie begins!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that I have seen all of Fellini's significant films now with the exception of Amarcord. There are two interpretations of his career. One opinion holds that his peak was La Strada, and as things went on Fellini became more self-indulgent. Of course, Nights of Cabiria is very similar to La Strada in a lot of ways. Andre Bazin called that film the end of neo-realism. The other opinion expresses that Fellini found himself in La Dolce Vita, and triumphed with it and 8 1/2. My opinion is a mix between the two. I do prefer the neo-realistic films of his, especially La Strada, a film which is closer to me than any of his other films, and Nights of Cabiria, which also touched me deeply. I think that film is his most accessible (though La Strada is in no way difficult to enjoy). But I do think La Dolce Vita was a peak of some sort, also. It is the most difficult of his films that is also worthwhile. It would be difficult to enjoy La Dolce Vita without researching it and its director afterwards. It still has some neo-realistic roots showing. With 8 1/2, Fellini stood at the peak of his career. La Dolce Vita is rife with difficult symbolism, but it is restrained symbolism. One can enjoy the film without "getting" it. In fact, many people did, since it was an enormous hit all around the planet. 8 1/2's symbolism is in no way restrained. It explodes with great fervor at the very beginning of the film, where the main character, a film director named Guido, dreams of being watched by everyone involved in a traffic jam, and then of being flown like a kite until someone yanks at his string, which sends him plummeting to the Earth. It would be simple to dismiss these opening images as pretentious nonsense. I personally think that symbolism is difficult to use in film, but that it can be done if used carefully. La Dolce Vita's symbolism seemed careful, while this seemed haphazard. However, this beginning symbolism does eventually help define the character of Guido. In fact, all of the symbolism of the film works excellently. It is not restrained, but it becomes integral to the film. It actually becomes fascinating. The final parade is miraculously effective, especially if you are familiar with Fellini's symbolic stock (clowns, horses, prostitutes, people suspended in air, processions, magicians, musicians). Fellini made a film so thick with symbolism that a viewer may easily be overwhelmed. If that viewer is familiar with Fellini, he will not be. This was actually the second Fellini film I tried to watch, only after Satyricon (far past his peak), and it just didn't work. I had watched about an hour and 20 minutes before I turned it off frustrated. Last night, I watched it without ever losing interest or involvement. So here is Fellini, standing at the very peak of his career, standing on a pile of symbolism that works, about to step over the peak and fall to his excess. His next film was Giulietta of the Spirits. It is bursting at its seams with symbolism, and it is all obvious, all drivel. I gave 8 1/2 a perfect 10, but Giulietta a 3/10. It is sad when one does not realize when he has gone overboard. Well, here is 8 1/2, and all the films he made before that, still great after 40-50 years. Enjoy them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated but still classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8? is suffused with the fictive childhood memories of Fellini's on screen doppelganger, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), which- if the DVD experts on Fellini, and those I've scanned in gathering background information, are correct- are merely Fellini's own true memories transferred to film. They can result in some interesting themes and scenes for the film, but often, most manifestly in the Saraghina and Cardinal digressions, they make far too much of points that could more easily and poetically been conveyed on screen. Both of these motivs waste a good twenty or more minutes of the film's running time?.As for the famed narrative- or meta-narrative. Let me give a brief rundown of what 8? is about. The film opens with shots of 43 year old married filmmaker Guido Anselmi in a traffic jam. It is obviously a dream sequence- or is it a scene from the film that he is to make, the one this film is about? It is clearly a set piece, and after escaping from his car window, as if from the uterus, he takes to the air, and becomes a kite, pulled back down to earth by whom we later recognize as the filmic representatives of Claudia Cardinale (playing herself), the actress who is to star in Guido's film within this film. As he falls to earth he wakens at a health spa where he is recuperating from a breakdown of some sort, along with his screenwriter, a dense film critic named Daumier (Jean Rougeul). Outside the spa he has a vision of a virginal white clad goddess, also played by Claudia Cardinale- although she is a separate character from the Claudia Cardinale who later appears as an actress in 8?. She manifestly represents an idealized vision of love and femininity to Guido. Daumier then criticizes Guido's ideas for his upcoming film as immature and self-indulgent, as Fellini obviously is striking the first blows for his film's claim to greatness.He then spots Mario Mezzabotta (Mario Pisu), an old friend who is squiring around a dark, sexy young American girl he intends to marry. Her name is Gloria Morin (Barbara Steele, Mario Bava's horror film diva). Guido then heads to the train station to meet his gauche and buffoonish married mistress Carla (Sandra Milo). He already regrets asking her to come, until that night they play a game of hooker and john, and she eagerly plays her naughty role to sexual perfection. Guido falls asleep and dreams of his parents at a cemetery, His father (Annibale Ninchi) is dead, and his mother (Guiditta Rissone) kisses him lasciviously, then pulls back to reveal it is his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aimée). Later, Guido tries to avoid movie types and reporters who are after the story of what his next film will be about. Some entertainment ensues at the hotel, and Guido is reminded of a mysterious childish saying from his past, asa nisi masa. This nonsense phrase is the film's equivalent of Citizen Kane's Rosebud. How this all turns out is well known and detailed by others.Incidentally, there is some confusion over why the film is called what it is called. The truth is that the film's final title 8? refers to the number of films Fellini directed to that point- six features, two short (?) films, and his first film, half a feature, Luci del Varieta, which he co-directed with Alberto Lattuada, thus totaling 7? films. This was therefore his 8?th film. As for the critical reception and continuing misconstruals this film receives, both positive and negative, it is easy to see why. Much of this confusion is recapitulated in the film's original title La Bella Confusione (The Beautiful Confusion). It is not clear whether or not this internal artistic confusion was genuine, in Fellini's case, but it does not matter to his puppet, Guido Anselmi, for intent is meaningless in art. The end result is all, always all. Thus, 8 ? is a weird mélange of Freudian pop nonsense (id, ego, superego), and Salvador Dal? lite imagery, that badly dates the film intellectually. All of it is well handled, in beautiful black and white cinematography by Gianni de Venanzo, with an intriguing and well-placed musical score by Nino Rota, to enhance the artificiality of it all, but all the personal references, which in the film do little to enhance an understanding of Guido, even as they may lend obsessive critics insight into Fellini's life, drag the film down by its own overblown heft?.8? improves with rewatching, but it's still too long, filled with clumsy satire- Saraghina and the Cardinal, pointless digressions, and the like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best test of a true movie fan ever created</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While 8 1/2 might not be the best film ever created (although it certainly ranks up there), it serves as the best test I know of a true movie fan. Let me explain...The public (non-true movie fans) wants movies that are formulaic, that are plot driven, and that are fun to watch. The critically minded (true movie fans) want movies that are artistic, insightful, and well directed. Symbolism is an added bonus, but not essential.Now, the problem is that most great movies are both plot driven and artistic. So, the true movie fan and the casual viewer alike will like enjoy these films. 8 1/2, like no other film I know, stands as a pinnacle of art, insight, and symbolism. Plot is secondary and, indeed, insignificant. Plot alone could not, and does not attempt to, carry the film. For this reason, 8 1/2 will be rejected by casual viewers, but embraced by true movie fans. 8 1/2 is certainly not the only film that exhibits this ability - Bringing Out The Dead or Magnolia from last year, for example - but it is the best, thereby making it the best test.8 1/2 is a drives deep into the human experience. It asks what is life, and answers with an absurdist view that life has no meaning; things happen but order does not exist. Yet, it doesn't stop there. It drives deeper and deeper, forever asking why. Events from our hero's life are recalled, but to what purpose? to what aim? Is there a logical connection or is it an illusion?**Spoilers Ahead**The movie begins with a preview of the movie's themes. A man is trapped in a car. All around him there are others, but no one seems to care about his plight. Eventually, he escapes and achieves apparent freedom floating away, but alas it was an allusion. He is pulled back down to earth.Our hero has traveled to the spas to cleanse himself, to get away from it all, but he can't. The "cleansing" spas and "healing" mineral water offer no escape, as characters and memories keep coming back to haunt him. Indeed, he draws these people to him - his psyche will not let him escape; he must confront reality. He thinks he wants to escape the demands of others, but what he really wants to escape is his loneliness, for he seems incapable of relating to others on anything but a superficial level.Thinks steadily get worse for our hero as he furthers his self-denial. He says he wants no lies, but speaks only lies. He envisions a world where all the women of his life live together in peace, serving his every need, but then there is a revolt. Down with the tyrant they shout. He attempts to whip them into obedience and the revolt ends with no apparent resolution. Our hero is deeply confused. In addition, he wants his movie to contain "everything" but he can supply it with nothing.The inward probe comes to a close, as our hero is discovered for what he is - a has-been with no more ideas. He crawls under the press table to hide and its appears as if he is in a jail cell. Hands are grabbing for him from every direction. Finally, a gun shot is heard and the scene ends.The movie ends with an absurd scene where nothing makes sense. The scene appears to contradict the themes of the movie. This is done purposefully, despite the views of many would-be critics. The movie has come full circle and ended where it began. That is, with the absurdist view of life, that there is no order or meaning, or random events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self confession as cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing a poster for Eight and a Half at an Italian restaurant as a child. It was on a wall mostly dominated by opera posters (appropriate Eight and a Half has an operatic sensibility). I will never forget Mastroianni's cynical care worn face looking out from beneath a fedora with a magnificent spacecraft on a launching pad in the background. Later on I finally got to see it on the big screen at the Harvard Film Archive. Wow! Imagine the originality of Eight and a Half. At the time that it was released, no one had fashioned a film so intensely personal. Even Orson Wells' Citizen Kane did not more directly reflect the director's obsessions, fears, ambitions and raw emotional needs as closely as Fellini's autobiographical masterwork. The level of self-confession and vulnerability is unparalleled as well. Fellini was one of the most well known names in the world. At the height of his career Fellini made a film wherein he depicted himself as a restless failure, and admitted to the world that he had thoughts of suicide. In many ways the film is a continuation of his previous success, La Dolce Vita. People will always debate the comparative merits of the two films, for my money, Eight and a Half is the more innovative, elegant and emotionally honest of the two films. In Vita, Marcello Mastroianni played a version of Fellini as a young man, when he was still working as a hack journalist. Here he is Fellini as a mature, successful disillusioned adult, called Guido for the movie?s purposes, now a film director. The movie follows its main character in a stream of consciousness manner. Daydreams, memories, fantasies, and everyday life blend seamlessly. This makes the film difficult, to an extent. It also allows it to be truly revelatory in a way that would not if we simply observed Guido's actions from the outside. `There is no such thing as objective memory' Fellini once said, and in Eight and a Half, the hero's particular beliefs, fetishes and evasions skew everything we see. Guido's last film was a worldwide smash hit (like La Dolce Vita) and he has had a nervous breakdown due to the pressure to create a successful follow up. The gigantic spaceship that has been built for the film's set represents his enormous artistic ambitions, he hope to create something both truthful and unprecedented. Can the tower stand? He is enslaved to commercial interests, here represented by philistine producers and sycophantic actresses and a contemptuous `intellectual' writer, all of who have there agendas of their own.  Guido is not necessarily a sympathetic character. He is selfish, egomaniacal and unable to control his sexual urges. He tries and fails to juggle a beatnik wife (Anouk Aimee) and a sluttish mistress(Sandra Milo). Still, he is deeply and palpably human. We see his early childhood traumas, at the hands of sadistic priests (relived later on when he asks an unsympathetic cleric for advice and receives as a reply only that he is damned without allegiance to the church) and his boyhood obsession with a strange local prostitute (relived in his sexual game playing as an adult). We sense that he is one of us, that his desire to create some meaning in life is equivalent to our own. An unhappy old man desperate to be useful at the studio Guido owns shadows approaching old age and the possibility of failure. Unable to control his environment, Guido retreats into a world of fantasy, but even his daydreams begin to veer out of his control. Still within his memories and fantasies he manages to finally find some thing sure and meaningful. In a sense La Dolce Vita asks a question concerning the loss of values in the modern world, and Eight and a Half provides an answer. The movie provides unforgettable images, the obese prostitute dancing on the beach (echoed later on in Lynch's Blue Velvet), the circus like parade that celebrates the hero's final triumph over his self doubt, the press conference, where the hapless director is nearly assaulted an army of scandal hungry journalists (right out of La Dolce Vita). Ultimately the film's philosophy, it's proffered answer to life's questions, is a little bit shallow and superficial, but in this it reflects the director. He was an old fashioned modernist, a sentimental genius. He presents himself to us with all his flaws and simply gives us the choice of loving or rejecting him. For one I will always love Fellini, and will always be grateful that he chose to share his imagination with humanity.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I now understand what "dated" means</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film becomes dated not merely because it is a product of its time (by that standard, all movies are dated). A dated movie is one that comes off as a parody of its time.A filmmaker who set out to make a parody of a pretentious early-60s art-house film would end up with something very like 8 1/2.Watching this film, I found myself confirmed in my long-standing belief that artists are among the least interesting people in the world.I do, however, understand why filmmakers and film students love this movie so much: It confirms them in their belief that no matter how rich, famous, and oversexed they get, people will still want to hear them whine about their little problems.The direction, the cinematography, and the performances were adequate, but no more. The music was poor.Occasionally, almost in spite of himself, Fellini will give us something which verges on the interesting, such as the scene where Luisa confronts Guido with the presence of his mistress. But he never sticks with it, preferring to sink back into his dreary little fantasies.This is the only Fellini film I've seen so far (I've seen it twice; my opinion did not improve on second viewing), but LA DOLCE VITA's coming on TV next month. Maybe I'll give that one a try before I write Fellini off as an overrated hack.(Update: I watched LA DOLCE VITA, and frankly, I not only think that he's overrated, but I don't think that Fellini has any particular talent for film-making. Again, there is that touch of interest {in this case, the paparazzi} which Fellini abandons).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i need to learn how NOT to get sucked into watching a film just because it's got a high rating and a lot of critics seem to praise it. This is a prime example. 8 1/2 was an utter bore, and although I admit I couldn't comprehend this piece of poop, I also don't care to. I also can't comprehend why people refer to this as Fellini's "masterpiece"...I saw "Amarcord" and "La Strada", both of which were very entertaining. This artsy fartsy film is simply a chore to sit thru.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, how the artist suffers... but did WE have to? Pretentious junk this is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally an acclaimed 'masterpiece' that I rightfully can cut to pieces: what pretentious JUNK this is! An intriguing meta idea that must've broken some rules back in 1963, I guess, but this is nothing but Fellini's own self-indulgent catholic confession and the sufferings he goes through in his art, and his woman affairs, and... and who cares? Spare me from esoteric "critics &amp; film-students only" -moviemaking!It doesn't justify 140 minutes of a loud, tiresome, smug, confusing mess that should have stayed in his head. Technical slickness &amp; fine cinematography can't redeem the bad entertainment value of a movie, or its failure to move the audience, like this one does. A character actually says in the bath-house scene "If you have anything to say, make sure the audience understands". Well, that's just where he failed big-time with me... and the rhumba beach scene is just the pit of the glitzy manure barrel! The opening sequence is a bravura visual number, I admit, but a big waste on the rest. Anyone agree to go with me against the critics' tide?3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overindulgent Felliniesque Wankfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have enjoyed watching directors such as Bergman, Godard, Antonioni, Bava etc and had little knowledge of Fellini. I have the segment Toby Dammit which is average compared to the Malle and Vadim. I viewed Satyricon which was OK. Someone recommended I view 8 1/2 to see true film genius. A film about the hardships of being a director is over 2 hours of overindulgent felliniesque wankfest. If the film portrayed Fellini's dreams,how boring and tedious to sit through. Running around with a handycam filming overbearing people,vocally out of sync doesn't equal great cinema, I've seen more artistry from 1920's french porn. Fellini's poor imagination and banality is pure cinematic torture,made me nauseous. Ranks no.1 worst film of the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was downright weird and not in a good way. The acting was good, especially by the main character but the plot was way too confusing. Without reading from posts on here beforehand and watching the movie numerous times it'd be near impossible to try to separate the dream sequences from reality. Obviously a lot of effort was put into this movie and it must've had a mega-sized budget for back in the early 60's to have all those people and sets in it. There were a handful of funny quotes that I found mildly amusing but this movie didn't stop to make me think about life like I figured it would and his final realization wasn't anything splendid as one would expect. What was really funny was how the thing most people noticed about the movie were how cool the dude's sunglasses were (and hey they were pretty sweet). This film just screams 'one long acid trip' from beginning to end. Another thing that p*ssed me off were that the subtitles were sometimes impossible to read due to their white font and the sometimes white background that was behind them...so I'm sure I missed at least a few important things there as well. Don't get me wrong it wasn't anywhere near a bad movie, but I feel it's far overrated for my tastes.Movies : I'd end up falling asleep.DVD Purchase : Not worth it.Rental : Worth the rental price, but I noticed that some public libraries have it so check there first as that way it'll be free!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not an 8.5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's said, in 8 1/2, that "The audience should understand the film." Why, oh why did Fellini not adhere to such logic when making this film?I understand that this was an autobiographical, comic fantasy. Perhaps it was not to be "understood". Perhaps that line was written purely for irony's sake.I gave the movie a generous 6/10 -- it only garnered such a high score because it is both foreign and over 30 years old.Regardless, I found the film an abstruse, meandering bore. It was a task of endurance just to watch it -- all 138 minutes of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film is stylish but that's all. Product of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie "wows" many for superficial reasons I'd say. Regarding its autobiographical angle, director Fellini picks handsome Marcelo Mastroianni to portray him in this self-portrayal fantasy and the beautiful Claudia Cardinale as his saviour figure. Both were fine but the material needed darkening.Lots of movie-business buffoonery and wild characters make for some smirking fun but it's all very euro-weird, like a Godard film drunk on champagne. Dated look at playboy-director type in crisis doesn't make me care a whit about him... We're observers of an artist in flux who seems to take nothing seriously but his flawless hair-do."8 1/2" had its' day in the sun, however now it can be seen as just an exercise in fluffy silliness in comparison with the more politically charged movies emergent in the sixties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw. I can easily state that this were one of the worst cinematic experience EVER. It's the first Fellini's movie that I watch and I hope it'll be the last.. This movie is one of the most pretentious ever seen, a director's childhood and fantasy put on screen. Well I never saw a man's mind so boring: 8 1/2 is full of foolishness, unnecessary philosophical statement and argument, dialogues barely understandable full of stupid rhetoric. There is no implication at all, the characters are totally shallow and annoying. Also Marcello Mastroianni seems to be bored while putting Fellini's thoughts on screen, and that's says all.. This is no art, this is arrogance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most overrated films of all time.I viewed it recently hoping to catch up on classic films that I didn't get around to viewing when they were "must- sees" and essential back in the 1960's.Good points:Claudia Cardinale is so beautiful as to make any male take "three-steps-backwards" when she appears as the girl at the Spa; later, she's also a centerpiece, but not so overwhelming.Eddra Gale as "La Saraghina" is also great, as is Sandra Milo as "Carla". Anouk Aimée as "Luisa" does a journeyman job in an unsympathetic role.Marcello Mastroianni as "Guido". Nice hat.Bad points:Almost everything else. The opening sequence pales by comparison to "Touch of Evil", "Thief", "Road Warrior" and too many others to list.In summary: Self-indulgent, neurotic, tedious, predictable, boring ...My thesaurus runs out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was so bad! I was bored to tears! I have no problem with surrealist movies, but i do have a problem with one that is 2 hours and 16 minutes long. this movie is overrated and self indulgent. the only good thing about this movie is the very voluptuous Saragina. Jokes, jokes. but seriously folks,i apologize to all those 8 1/2 lovers. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get this movie, but i shouldn't have to cry out of confusion when i'm watching a movie. maybe fellini thought he could get away with anything after he won an Oscar for "It's a wonderful life", so this is a great example of an ego driven movie. i know you can do better, buddy. Apox on thee, Fellini!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a whole lot to say about this film. Of the seven of us that went and watch the re-release of 8? none of us thought it was worth more then '1'. No matter how high a scale, it would still only get '1'.I was interested in what "everyone" thinks is so amazing about this Fellini film, but I never got it. The terrible singing, lousy story and bad acting was only part of what I didn't like. I was in real pain just not to jump up and tear the screen in the theater apart. One of the absolute worst films I have ever seen, maybe even the worst.Even beats my last couple of films I couldn't stand looking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, shot on a video camcorder of some sort, is a testament to the prowess of stupidity. you'll be lucky to find it in your local store, and i believe it received extremely limited distribution. That it got produced in the first place is a small miracle. though i consider myself a fan of the psychotronic b-movie genre, this film goes wrong in the wrong places. Sure, the acting is bad, the plot confounded, the editing nonexistent. But if i wanted to see a film this bad, I'd go watch all the stupid videos I recorded with my friends in elementary school. Eight and a half is about 2 hours and 18 minutes of just that.</fullReview>
