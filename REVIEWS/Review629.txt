		<fullReview>Wonderful movie, visually rich and a nice blend of comedy, action and romance, well-written. Hopkins is great; so is Banderas as Zorro-in-training, and Zeta-Jones sparkles in her scenes with him. Very little gore or skin, what there is serves the plot instead of BEING the plot. The best movie I've seen in a long time. Note: previews make it look a lot less interesting than it actually is--you just see a lot of things being slashed and blown up, while the comic scenes between Hopkins and Banderas don't really appear (the best part of the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine action hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zorro is one of my favorite heroes. He looks quite cool and not stupid, weird or childish like Batman, Superman, Spider-Man and all of their villains (except The Joker) and he has no superpowers like them, although sometimes it seems that gravity does not really apply to him. His weapon of choice guarantees some spectacular sword fighting scenes as well.With this hero all you need is a nice story and 'The Mask of Zorro' has a nice story. I will be short about it. Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) was Zorro but is too old now. He needs another one and Alejandro Murrieta (Antonia Banderas) is the chosen one. Their enemy is Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). His daughter Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is actually Diego's daughter. His wife was murdered and his daughter was taken by Rafael a long time ago. Rafael also made sure the brother of Alejandro was killed by his helper Capt. Love (Matt Letscher). And now he has an evil plan that will kill a lot of people. Time for the new Zorro.It sounds a little simple and may be it is, but for a movie like this it is a perfect story. Anthony Hopkins who is never bad does not disappoint us here, Banderas has the right charm to play Zorro, Zeta-Jones is absolutely stunning and Wilson and Letscher are very good as the villains. With some nice action sequences and a pretty good soundtrack this is a very entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly wonderful movie. In my opinion it belongs with the Classics.What is a classic anyway? Something with timeless quality. And this movie has it.Just saw this movie again for the 3rd or 4th time since it came out. I remembered almost every scene and still sat to watch it again. To see the great photography, to hear the inspirational music, to admire and have fun with the excellent performances of all actors, leading and supporting.This movie has it all. It revives one of the more influential characters of all time, with the most appropriate way. You get a dramatic, even tragic, plot, and simultaneously a fun script. Emotion and comedy at the same time. Great visuals and scenery and also good action.In my opinion this a highly underrated movie (6.7 for 2013 doesn't give it justice at all) and it belongs among the best. For the friend who gave a low rating a note: Not all the dramas have to be edgy and dark.Overall: Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Old-Fashioned Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had just a couple of things I would have changed but the overwhelming minutes of this 137-minute movie were well done: a nice old- fashioned adventure story.Yes, it's hokey in spots, there is a needless irreverent scene in the confessional and the final action scene goes on too long, but all of that is almost standard fare in today's films. Anyway, the "good" in this film far outweighs the "bad."Some of the "good" is beautiful cinematography featuring bold colors; good action scenes; very little profanity; interesting and somewhat likable lead characters (played by Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Bandaras and Catherine Zeta- Jones), a fun story and very good 5.1surround sound.Zeta-Jones was a brand new "face" with this movie and she's never looked better. Hopkins, as usual, is the best character as the older "Zorro" who teaches the young one (Bandaras). Some of the action scenes are almost cartoon-like in credibility (Bandaras doing flips while riding two horses at once!) but they are fun.The story is a familiar one that seems to always satisfy people: revenge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Campbell sure knows how to make entertaining movies. After making "No Escape" and "GoldenEye" he brings us yet another entertaining movie; "The Mask of Zorro". He actually used to be one of my favorite directors after seeing those movies I just named but unfortunately he hasn't made anything good lately. Let's hope this change after completing "Zorro 2" that is currently being made."The Mask of Zorro" is just some good old fashioned fun with lot's of spectacular moments, good choreographed fight sequences, a love story and a good old fashioned stereotype villain.The story is told in a good way which I think is mainly thanks to Campbell's directing. The pace is high and the combination between the action, the characters and their relations, romance and some of the comical moments is done very well, unlike some other movies from the same genre.There is some nice cinematography that help to create a good atmosphere along with the musical score from James Horner. The end fight is good and it has a spectacular big explosion in it that'll make you go; Wow!Great entertainment for the whole family.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosive,thought out hollywood adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie is the casting.How ingenius,eh? Antonio Banderas as Zorro,eh?And Stuart Wilson as the central villain.This guy is one of the most unrecognised talents around.As a snidy British baddie,he could easily give your average Dennis Hopper a run for his money.Catherine Zeta Jones is also marvellous as the love interest. The action scenes and stunts are fantastic.Real hollywood at it's best.Martin Campbell keeps an efficent and steady pace to proceedings as director. If there's a problem here,it's that it's probably a tad overlong.But luckily,this unwantern time is'nt filled with unnecessary scenes but scenes as visually exciting as the last. It's also marvellous that it's a PG,because such past fare,like Bad Boys,is loud,action packed,exciting and brilliant,it's also rather flatulent and rude.This is just superb action entertainment which can be enjoyed by the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best "Zorro" Ever Produced.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strikingly entertaining and first-rate in most all cinematic categories, "The Mask of Zorro" is a smart action film that works due to a convincing titled character (Antonio Banderas), the almost unreal beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones and the professionalism of Anthony Hopkins. Anthony Hopkins starts out as Zorro, but is caught by the evil Stuart Wilson shortly after a wild rescue of three men in the village. Wilson leaves the country and takes Hopkins' baby daughter with him. Fast-forward 20 years and Hopkins has escaped and he begins to teach Banderas (also seeking revenge after the murder of his brother) the way to be a fighter for truth and justice. The baby has grown up to become Zeta-Jones and thinks that she is really Wilson's daughter. A great film that works well due to an adequate screenplay, good characterization and solid direction. A near-perfect success. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zorro for a new generation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching The Mask Of Zorro, and it was a spectacular achievement. It all seemed cliched at first, and even though it isn't that original, it still pays off quit well. The cast is great. Anthony Hopkins seems to get away with an English accent in every movie he does,but his acting was solid as usual. Antonio Banderas is teriffic as the new Zorro and there's funny moments between Hopkins and Banderas as teacher and student respectively. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very appealing in her role also. The only real complaint I have is that the bad guys never seem like a real threat. The direction by Martin Campbell is very good and the editing was great. A very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MASK OF ZORRO ****1/2 Stunning, visually rich, and highly acclaimed motion picture that retells the story of the Masked Swordsman (Anthony Hopkins) serving the people of California by saving them from the devious plans and conspiracies the Spanish empire and trained forces carry out. Hopkins trains a new Zorro (properly portrayed by Antonio Benderas) to take his place and save California from a tasteless fate. What subsequently takes place is nothing short of first-rate entertainment. The film has delightful humour and well choreographed sword-on-sword sequences. The musical score by James Horner provides additional supportive elements to capture all of the film's diverse moments. Excellent direction by Martin Campbell. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite adventure with horse action, fencing duels and swashbuckling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antonio Banderas is appropriately magnificent along with gorgeous heroine Catherine Zeta-Jones.This superior Zorro with great swordplay is a lavish swashbuckler starred by Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas as the dashing masked avengers . A young Banderas dons a black outfit and becomes the ideal Zorro riding in the hoofprints continuing in the wake of the old Zorro-Hopkins who passes his mantle of protector of hapless ad unfortunates. This is a zesty recounting of saga of legendary masked rider , though not as distinctive as previous classic entry starred by Tyrone Power. Here Zorro faces danger from governor Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) as well as corrupt villain captain Harrison (Matt Letscher). And Anthony Hopkins gives slickness and distinction as elegant veteran Zorro. After numerous setbacks the hero and his lovely heroine, a wonderful Catherine Zeta-Jones, help the good people of California thwart the greedy schemes of a meanie who stands in the way of statehood for the territory. The nimble actor Banderas runs and jumps all over the images of this movie, as he deals with the oppressor with a breathtaking finale and wreak havoc included.In this first Zorro starred by Antonio Banderas took a chance and jumped from comedy-action to costumed comedy-adventures; he steals the show as Murrieta/Zorro relishing his secret identity with cape and sword; executing bounds and leaps, twists and climbs and throughly enjoys himself. A great casting and an unstopped action keep this picture moving at a rapid clip. Banderas made the character of Zorro his own and quickly established himself as a Latin legend. Antonio Banderas is terrific as the Zorro, well accompanied by ideal heroine, a beautiful Zeta-Jones. Nice secondary cast, such as Stuart Wilson, overacting outrageously as the villain, and actors as Tony Amendola and Pedro Armendariz Jr , booth of whom will repeat acting in the following. Furthermore, overwhelming swordplay and horse action and displays too much of everything. Stirring musical score by James Horner and colorful cinematography by Phil Meheux. Other versions about this known character created by Johnston McCulley are the following : The mute classic adaptation ¨Mark of Zorro¨(1920, Fred Niblo, with Douglas Fairbanks), the classic ¨Mark of Zorro¨(1940, Robert Mamoulian with Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone and Linda Darnell), and followed by ¨The legend of Zorro¨( 2005, Martin Campbell again with Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones, Tony Amendola,Pedro Armendariz and Rufus Sewell) and European version ¨Zorro¨(1975, Duccio Tessari with Alain Delon, Octavia Piccolo and Stanley Baker) . Rating : 7,5, good, better than average. The motion picture will appeal to trio protagonist fans: Banderas, Hopkins and Zeta Jones. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the opening frame of Zorro I figured I had been taken to the edge of bad movie making and dropped over. It looked like another corny slash and chatter bomb, but I wound up pretty much liking it. I don't consider it to be a really superb film, but I managed to stay interested all the way through. There was plenty of action, some romance, and quite a few laughs. I think that is what won me over: this picture is a comedy for the most part. A serious comedy. What Zorro is not is what I expected it to be.</fullReview>

Both wish to extract revenge on the men for the killing of a wife and brother,respectively.Catherine Zeta-Jones was in fine form as Hopkins's real daughter, stolen away by the man who loved her mother and watched her being shot to death accidentally by one of the soldiers.The story is wonderful with some history of Santa Ana in California.The dueling sequences are terrific as Banderas quickly learns the techniques from the pro Hopkins.How can you miss with a picture where the villain wants to buy California from Santa Ana and pay for it by using the latter's gold and enslaving people in the process to extract it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hopkins, Banderas, and Zeta-Jones are all just perfect in this film. From the action-packed opening scene to the rip-roaring climax near the end, this is a movie to just sit back and enjoy. It avoids taking itself too seriously, with more comedy than pathos. There is action, love, heartbreak, deception, redemption, and back to love. In several different ways. Sword fights, gun fights, dancing, horse chases, explosions. This movie has it all. I saw it on DVD and it comes across beautifully. SPOILERS. I own the DVD, and seem to re-watch it about every two years. Each time it holds my interest as well as it did the first. As the movie starts Zorro's (Hopkins) wife is killed by the local Spanish don, who also steals his young daughter, while discarding Zorro into prison. Twenty years pass and his daughter (Zeta-Jones) comes to Mexico with her "dad" as Zorro makes a prison break. Being old he finds a new man (Banderas) to train as the new Zorro. Together they eventually foil an attempt at stealing gold and killing all the peasant workers. As Zorro dies, in the arms of his grown daughter, she and the new Zorro make a life together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Zorro Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a childhood favorite of mine. But it still holds up all these years later. THE MASK OF ZORRO is a well-executed and sweeping adventure film in the tradition of the Indiana Jones movies and those old swashbucklers of the 1940's. It is perhaps the best Zorro film ever put to the silver screen, and a great example of how to pull off an old school Hollywood revenge flick in contemporary times. Martin Campbell has made his mark on the Bond franchise with "GoldenEye" and "Casino Royale" and he was able to once again breathe life into another dead franchise with "The Mask of Zorro". The script by Ted Elliot and Terry Russo (the same duo behind the "Pirates" movies) is refreshingly old school in its approach and has a number of memorable lines (particularly the very last line of the film). The musical score by James Horner (as well as the song "I want to spend my lifetime loving you") is sweeping and beautiful. The tap dancing utilized during the dueling scenes is very effective and innovative. I really think this score deserves more attention. Martin Campbell once said that no one can light/film women in movies like cinematographer Phil Meheux, and he was right. He is able to fully capture the beauty of Catherine Zeta Jones in her prime. Antonio Banderas is not a charming moviestar/leading man but a true professional as he does almost all his own stunts as well. Anthony Hopkins is perfect in the role of Zorro's mentor. Catherine Zeta Jones in this movie makes all the hottest actresses/movie stars of today look plastic and slutty. This is a solid update of the character of Zorro that is well executed on all fronts and that still retains the heart of what Zorro is all about. They don't make them like this anymore!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm disappointed I didn't check this one out sooner. What you get is an aggregation of not only many film genres, but many classic films. If you're a film buff, you'll spot them easily. Naturally, Zorro sports black and also takes refuge in his own little Batcave, there's a scene that pays direct homage to "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" and a lot of the action scenes are choreographed in the style of a fight scene in one of the Indiana Jones movies, mixing action with comedy, take your pick. Now here's why I differentiate between homage and rip-off. Like the Western, Batman and Indiana Jones, Zorro's tale began early on in cinema, around 70 years before this film, also in comics and such. Zorro has been the subject of SEVERAL feature films back in the day, just as good old Dr. Jones is based off 30s serial heroes. Therefore when one sees all these things blended together, it makes for nice nostalgia.Another thing that boosts the film up is a very well put together cast. Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins are both as dashing as they are dramatic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sexy but serves as more than eye-candy, well done. The villains are quite awesome, Stuart Wilson being quite debonair yet also playing one of the few great tortured villains. And Matt Letscher is just great. There's lots of great-fitting comedy as well as action that mixes contemporary stunts with classic-styled adventure.Add the score by James Horner and you got yourself a winner. Martin Campbell has certainly created an exciting ode to the classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember of all the summer movies of 1998 (Armageddon, Deep Impact, Lethal Weapon IV etc.), I enjoyed this one the most. Sure a few liberties with plausibility might have been taken but the overall experience was very enjoyable. There was a sense of pioneering, honor, romance, and loyalty about the characters that made the viewing experience all the more immersive. Director Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, Vertical Limit) staged some exciting action sequences and was lucky to have a talented cast to make considerably more out of what could have been stock characters. Oh, and Banderas (in his best Hollywood role) and Zeta-Jones have great chemistry, a fact that is especially notable in their memorable dance together. All in all, very good escapist entertainment, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This gets off to a very impressive start where a trio of peasants are about to be executed on trumped up charges and Zorro appears to save the day . Normally I'd be rather uneasy seeing violence portrayed in such a knock about off hand manner but the action scenes in THE MASK OF ZORRO are something of an exception as the swashbuckling hero notches up an unlikely death toll against the military oppressors . It's all done with a panache as the audience are not asked but told to pick sides of good versus evil It's a very black and white morality tale , ridiculously black and white and oh so very old fashioned but I certainly did enjoy the way the story was told . It has a beautifully paced script that's packed with sword fights and acrobatics and amazingly I don't recall one single scene involving CGI . Are you listening Mr Hollywood producer ? You don't need CGI to make a successful Summer blockbuster , all you need are some film makers who know how to tell an enthralling story Perhaps I should point out that two of the lead actors are from Wales and that one is from Spain , along with the director being from New Zealand while the editor and cinematographer are British . Are these facts intertwined with my enjoyment of THE MASK OF ZORRO ? Certainly Hopkins , Zeta-Jones and Banderas bring their characters to life on screen and if big name American stars had been cast I think we'd have a rather inferior movie . Hopefully Hollywood producers can watch this - And LORD OF THE RINGS - and realise too much American involvement in front and behind the cameras can often be a bad thing . It's nice to see a movie like this where one of the main villains is an American</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun And Delightful Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro is a swashbuckler film based on the Zorro character created by Johnston McCulley. It was directed by Martin Campbell and stars Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Stuart Wilson. In the story, the original Zorro escapes from prison to find his long-lost daughter and avenge the death of his wife against the corrupt governor. He is aided by his successor that also pursues his own vendetta.With scenic 18th century Mexico as a backdrop,Don Diego de la Vega, intent on revenge after rival enemy Don Raphael Montero murdered his wife and took his daughter, Elena. After being imprisoned for 20 years, the fabled hero removes his mask and takes on a tarnished young apprentice, Alejandro Murieta, to infiltrate Montero's plan to take control of California from Santa Anna. A boisterous outlaw with his own desire for revenge, Murieta works with Diego to avenge his brother's death by the sword of Montero's right-hand man, Captain Harrison Love. After Diego's extensive training in sword fighting, discipline and manners, a new Zorro appears wreaking vengeance and stealing the heart of a now-grown Elena.Buckling the swash in a way approaching Errol Flynn, Antonio Banderas is up for the action and handles the slapstick as the inept student with aplomb. The romance between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones has sparks, too.The screenplay follows the predictable paths of action movies, but re-energizes the pattern with adrenaline, exuberance, creativity, and humor.It's self-consciously stylized and unapologetically escape movie but it results into an entertaining,fun and delightful one as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When deciding to go and watch a movie at the cinema,I have always found,that whilst I remember a lot about the film itself,I most of the time rarely remember much about the surroundings that I watched the movie in.In the middle of 1998,I somehow noticed a mistake,which actually played to my advantage,when I opened the case of a recently brought second hand video,and discovered that instead of the film itself being inside,the contents of the case was a "blank" Video.Seeing that I would have to wait for at least a week until the market was on again,I decided to play the "blank" Video,and quickly discovered that it contained a program shown on an obscure Sky TV channel in the early 90's called "Zorro".As the second of the two episodes from the Duncan Regehr Zorro (which after being left in the wilderness for almost 20 years,has at last been brought out in a huge DVD boxset) began,I started to become very interested in finding any other TV shows/movies related to Zorro.After having almost completely worn out the Zorro tape,I ended up getting the best news that I could have possible heard in 1998,when I found out that a brand new Zorro movie was being shown at a local,community cinema. (A cinema,that 9 years later I would have the pleasure of being a projectionist at as a "summer job") With still having memories of being completely awe-struck when watching the film at the cinema,I began to wonder if the movie would still leave me with a sense of wonder,after having last watched the film on an imported (thank you Ebay seller!) video 7 years ago?The plot: 1821:With being told that his rule over California is about to be lost due to Mexico winning the War of Indipendance over control of the city,soon to be thrown out governor Don Rafael Montero decides that his "last act" will be to hold a public execution,in the hope of smoking out,a troublesome "folkhero" called Zorro.Quietly telling two young boys, (one of whom he gives a medallion to) to run away from the execution scene, Zorro makes his entrance and stops the innocent men from being executed.Knowing that Montero is about to leave California,Zorro decides to give Montero a "Z" shape cut on the side of the neck,as a reminder for him should he try to take control of the city again.Getting away from the now chaotic scene,Don Diego de la Vega takes off the Zorro mask,so that he can spend the rest of the night relaxing with his wife and young daughter Elena.Sadly for de la Vega,Montero has secretly ordered Captain Harrison Love to follow "Zorro" and find out his location.Arriving with a group of loyal guards,Montero goes with Love to say a special "hello" to Zorro.Sicken at learning that Zorro is in fact the man who got married to a woman he deeply desired,Montero starts to brutally beat up Vega,until they both end up freezing,when one of Montero's guards accidentally kills Vega's wife.Furious that he will now never get what he most desired,Montero decides to kidnap Elena,and lock Vega up for the rest of his life.1841:Having successfully increased their "wanted dead or alive" price tag to $200,"Three-Fingerd" Jack and brothers Alejando and Joaquin Murrieta's is left in ruins when a recently returned Love catches them committing a petty heist,which leads to him getting set to take all 3 of them down.Being told to hide by his brother (who passes him an old medallion) ,Alejando ends up having to witness his brother deciding to commit suicide mere moments before Love gets his hands on him.Desperate to drown out his sorrow, Alejando uses every single penny he has to buy cheap booze,until the only thing which he owns of remaining value is his brothers medallion.Just before he gives up the medallion for a shot of whisky, Alejando is slammed down on the table by a stranger,who tells him that he remembers giving the Medellin to two young boys many years ago.Attempting to sober him up,the "stranger" tells Alejando that he suspects Montero is about to attempt to regain control of California,and that the only chance that the people of California have of not being ruled by Montero is if the mythical Zorro rides again.View on the film:Watching the making of doc ,I was stunned to discover how much trouble there had been of in getting the film made,with the movie originally having been planned for the early 90's,and director's Robert Rodriguez,Mikael Salomon and even Stanly Kubrick!, (who tried his best to get Julio Medem agree to directing the film) all falling to get the project into production.With the hands that had gone through to getting the movie made,I have to say,that seeing the film again after so many years,I was astonished at the unbelievable pace that the screenplay (written by Randall Johnson,John Eskow,Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) flies by.Keeping away from dragging this wonderful movie into a needless,overly complex mythology,the writers cleverly use the opening to show Zorro in a glorious mythical light that shines for the whole running time.After having shown Zorro in a heroic light,the writers brilliantly rip up everything that de la Vega holds dear,until he is left with the only option of transforming a worn down,wannabe thief into being a hero for the people.Backed by Martin Campbell's tremendously warm directing that looks to have come straight from the pages of a long forgotten Romantic Adventure novel,the ensemble cast give the perfect mix of comedic touches and gravitas,with Antonio Banderas (who also did almost all of the breath taking stunts himself) brilliantly making Murrieta's gradually transformation from theft to hero in waiting feel like a natural progression for the character.Pushing Murrieta to breaking point,Anthony Hopkins smartly makes sure that the burden from the tragedies is felt,whist also showing a shine in the eyes for being the hero of the people that he once was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Film of Excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many films start off with an interesting introduction. However, director Martin Campbell did a great job at bringing a new Zorro to take over the old aging Zorro. The way the characters act, the time that is put into making Zorro is done meticulously and it shows. It's great to see how everything in the plot starts out simple and then becomes more complex. Once the complex situations start to arise, the execution of it is beautiful.After becoming famous for being El Mariachi in Desperado (1995), Antonio Banderas is cast as the new Zorro to take over. Because Banderas is of Hispanic decent, the role of Zorro really fits him. So who's the old Zorro - none other than Anthony Hopkins. What makes Hopkins great as the older Zorro was the fact of how he became the mentor for Banderas. And although for the most part when he's lecturing, he's very serious, yet he shows that he still has a lot of energy for being elderly. Along side those two actors is Catherine Zeta-Jones, the daughter of the original Zorro. When Jones and Banderas are together, they have really great chemistry. My favorite part is when they were dancing together; it's very sexy and culturally attractive.The action sequences in this film are really something to behold. Much of it also entails a bit of comedy too. This is all helped by Banderas' charm as the new Zorro. It is because he is new and inexperienced that he makes things funny. The sword fights are really cool to see. The style that is put into using the sword in this film is truly whimsical. Much of these events take place with Banderas, Hopkins or the villains they're fighting. However, we do get a glimpse of Jones using the sword for a while too. It's nice to see some female domination in a setting like this because in the time that this took place, obviously women were not expected to take on a male's role such as that.Finally, the two other elements that make this movie great are the music and the plot. The music was composed by veteran James Horner. I really liked the way Horner captured the feel of the environment during the setting of the story. Much of the soundtrack has Hispanic instruments and it is obvious when listened to. And that is the icing on the cake. As for the story, I was pleased with how it was carried out. In the beginning of the film, the story was about a man only looking out for others but then landed in trouble. So who rescues him out of his trouble - a friend he made from years past. Not to mention his friend falls in love with the troubled man's daughter and the troubled man resolves his problems. The end result of this film is more than satisfying, and it will make viewers look inside themselves for what values they stand for.It can be interpreted as The Three Musketeers (1993) spin-off with a Hispanic twist, but for the record, this film holds its own and is really entertaining to watch. The performances are more than gratifying, the action is wondrous and the music is very lively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing, entertaining, and very well made swashbuckler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask Of Zorro - this is entertainment at it's finest. The acting is great all around each actor/actress giving an energetic performance. The choreography of the fight scenes was amazing, and all the action scenes were amazing and featured awesome stunts. The only bad thing I can think of is that the plot was a bit weak, but hey, it's Zorro, what it's all about is the action, and this movie sure excels there. The other main thing I loved about this movie was the soundtrack, James Horner does a fantastic job, creating one of the most complex and memorable film scores I've ever heard. The mask of Zorro is a must see for any of you guys out there who haven't yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthony Hopkins at His Best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I don't like some of the older Western movies, or western movies in general, but I have never seen a more well written, beautifully acted movie besides Terminator, the Godfather, Star Wars, ET, and Back to the Future. This is my favorite Anthony Hopkins role besides Hannibal. He was perfect for the role of old Zorro. I highly recommend this movie. It's a great movie. It's exciting, clever, it has characters you care about, its a great movie. But this is a type of movie where either you love it within the first 30 minutes, or you hate it instantly. If you're looking for a good, exciting movie, I highly suggest it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New Mask of Zorro Topped the Old Classic Zorro !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always enjoyed the classic "Mark of Zorro" original in the 40's, however, Anthony Hopkins (Don Diego/Zorro), "Meet Joe Black",'98 gave an outstanding performance through out the entire picture and taught the new Zorro all the tricks of the trade with the dueling and sword swinging, almost looked like Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.in action! Catherine Zeta-Jones, (Elana)"Chicago",'02 performed a very torrid Spanish dance and was extremely HOT during the entire picture. Elana almost lost her underwear with the swift blades of the newly taught young ZORRO introduced in this film. This is a very refreshing new approach to the Zorro image and is a must see film !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend Lives Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on one of the grandaddies of modern superheroes, this 90s take on the crime fighting swashbuckler starts during Don Diego De La Vega's final days as Zorro, when his world is turned upside down, his wife killed, daughter stolen and he himself locked away by the corrupt governor of California. A few decades later, Diego escapes and eventually enlists vengeful bandit Alejandro to take up the mantle of Zorro and bring down the governor once and for all before he can carry out a murderous land scheme.Surprisingly well thought out, this Spielberg-produced 'Zorro' is a a fun ride that also discusses the inspirational power of symbols, masks to be precise, and their transcendent powers. The compelling father-son relationship between Diego and Alejandro is the heart of the film, as each man learns something from the other and lives up to the heroic mantle of Zorro in their own way. One learns to be better than vengeance, the other to be a hero for the people, an icon of good. Despite these hefty themes, the film still regularly has a sense of humour to prevent excess dourness, mainly in seeing the boorish Alejandro become a cultured gentleman, as well as his stubborn horse Tornado.The cast embrace the old fashioned nature of the material. Antonio Banderas knocks it out as a thief-turned-smiling charmer, while Anthony Hopkins &amp; Catherine Zeta Jones wonderfully run with their respective roles of wise mentor and spunky lover, as does Stuart Wilson and Matt Letscher as the governor and sadistic captain. Naturally, also having some great set pieces, like the mine duels, and a passionate, Hispanic-infused score by James Horner, help out further.In terms of criticisms, Campbell's Mexican adventure fills out any adventure lover's bill nicely, and so complaints about the lack of anything drastic, original or confrontational would be to miss the point of the material. The only major complaint is perhaps Letscher is a one note, boo-hiss sadist lackey compared to his more layered, even slightly sympathetic superior, but again, that's just part of this sort of material. Honestly, it's the best kind of film that 'does what it says on the tin'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zorro saves three men from the fleeing Spanish Governor but is followed to his home where his wife is killed and his infant daughter taken and is imprisoned. Twenty years later, he escapes and finds his daughter has been raised as the governor's child. Vowing revenge, he takes a young thief who is also seeking revenge as his apprentice, who will become the new wearer of the Mask of Zorro......As adventure movies go, it's one of the best of the nitrites, and easily the most fun action movie since Temple Of Doom, and the winning formula is thanks to Banderas, because like Ford in Indiana Jones, he is a great hero, but also self deprecating and not afraid to make himself look stupid at times.Campbell proves that he can make really competent action movies. When he's good he's very very good, and when he is bad, he's Green lantern. The man recharged Bond twice, and here he takes an age old hero, makes him fresh and exciting, and also makes Hopkins convincing as a sword fighter.It's a little on the long side, and some of the secondary characters are stereotypical of the setting, but its shortcomings are forgiven for the sheer spectacle of it all.It's a shame that the sequel sank without trace, because this could have been a brilliant franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbiosis of classic heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent adventure film that it takes the character created for a serial early twentieth century by Johnston McCulley, which was already interpreted correctly on the screen by Douglas Fairbanks in the silent version of Fred Niblo 1920, and its sound remake, by Tyrone Power, in the version directed by Rouben Mamoullian in 1940. The character, who also knew a fleeting glory in the films of European series B in the mid-60s, is a cross between the tradition of generous bandit, in the style of the legends of "Robin Hood," and the anonymous liberator and double personality, represented by "the Scarlet Pimpernel" by Baroness d'Orczy. The clever script for this film, takes the character to interpret Fairbanks and Power, played this time with his usual solvency by Anthony Hopkins, in his latest adventure, and making a transcript of the plot of "The Count of Monte Cristo", he's imprisoned for nearly 20 years, but he takes his revenge, after a miraculous liberation. That's possible be taking the personality of the masked sword-man by a new character, Alejandro Murrieta, played by Antonio Banderas, in his most memorable role to date of his Hollywood films, resulting in a whole process of initiation, which is one of the strengths in the plot rests. If the tandem of Hopkins-Banderas is one of those strengths, the second is the tandem of Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones, whose chemistry on screen becomes all the memorable scenes in which they appear together, especially the duel sword in the stables. Martin Campbell up with this attractive material an excellent adventure film of classic resonances to achieve the precise rhythm between fast action scenes and hilarious comedy without the spoof, which has so burdened adventure films of recent years.</fullReview>

The Film Combines Humor, Pathos, Action, and Romance in a Blend of Old Style Entertainment that Never Really Goes Out of Style.Everything Clicks. The Movie does Go On a Bit Long and is Danger of Wearing Out its Welcome but Things Climax Just in the Nick of Time. It is Almost All Done for Real with Just a Smidgen of CGI and it is a Welcome Change and it All Comes Together as a Movie for All Ages. For Once, the Big Budget is Not Wasted. There are Strong and Charismatic Performances and Characters Across the Board, the Cinematography is Stunning, the Music, Costumes and Sets are All Finely Tuned for an Excellent Effort at Some Old Timey Fun.</fullReview>

I was very thrilled when I found out that Antonio Banderas was to play the masked action hero Zorro! Banderas was and is perfect for this role and his performance is phenomenal in the film.I recommend this film to those that love Swashbuckling Action Films and/or Adventurous Westerns. This film would make a great double feature movie night with a movie like "The Lone Ranger", "PotC: The Curse of the Black Pearl", "Robin Hood" or even "Tombstone".8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal favourite blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1998, for the first time since the days of Errol Flynn, Hollywood gave us a swashbuckling epic which did something that no similar film has done since. It managed to deliver all the goods without being heavily dependant on a dumbed down story or heavy use of clichés. While the formula is somewhat schematic, it has a real sense of romantic age, glamour and historical accuracy to it as well as fully rounded, non-artificial characters, and a story that combines humour/action/emotion perfectly, never too little or too much. This is probably the best post- Flynn swashbuckler, and while plenty of similar films have come out since, there is something about The Mask of Zorro which so far it has not been parallelled.After being jailed for twenty years, by former California Governor Don Raphael Montero, Don Diego de la Vega (once Zorro) breaks out. At the same time Montaro has just returned to California from exile. One morning diego meets young Aleandro Mureta. As kids he and his brother were Zorro's biggest fans. Since the recent murder of his brother by Captain Love of the U.S. Army (Montaro's right hand man), he has become a drunk, and wants revenge. Diego gives him that chance when he offers to train him to be a new Zorro. The Mask of Zorro blew me away when I saw it in theatres as a kid. It truly is the perfect film to capture the imagination. To this day I never tire of it. Well photographed, well edited, artistically scored, cleverly written and ambitiously directed, not to mention featuring the best swordplay that cinema can offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun little popcorn movie - nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was actually one of my favourite movies when I was about 11 years old. I decided to take a look at it because it was on TV today and wanted to see if it still holds up. In my opinion it does for the most part.The plot is that Zorro aka Don Diego Televega (Anthony Hopkins) decides that on the day that Mexico was going to be free that he is too old to be playing the whole Zorro gig so he decides to spend a quiet life with his wife Esperanza and his baby daughter Elena. That night however his archenemy, Don Raphael Montero attempts to arrest Diego because he worked out that he was Zorro. So after Diego fights and Esperanza is killed in the crossfire Raphael burns down his house and takes Elena to raise, so that Elena would think Raphael is her true father.20 years later 2 kids that helped Zorro years earlier are now grown bandits and one of them is murdered by a man named Captain Love. Then we find out that Diego spent all those years in a prison cell and escapes by taking the place of a dead body. He then finds the bandit's brother Alejandro (Antonio Banderas) and he agrees to be trained as Zorro and have the torch pass down to him as well as have them fight their own revenge.The acting is pretty good I found Anthony Hopkins was the best performance out of this movie but if there was any weak link in the acting it would have to be Matt Letscher, he just always came across as being wooden all throughout this movie, save maybe one or 2 over-the-top screams in the last few minutes. The rest do a fairly decent job.Now the sword-fights in this movie. They are on par with the ones featured in Disney's Pirates Of The Caribbean, they are that good. All of them can easily engage in what is going on in the scene.So in short, if you want to see a swashbuckling adventure that is simply pure fun then this is for you. I can see some people not liking this movie but it is still just a fun, dumb ride. If you walk in with these expectations in mind then this movie will be a perfect watch. So in short - I can see why as a kid this was one of my favourites, now obviously I have a few other movies to hold that title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mask Of Zorro Is an OK Epic,I personally didn't find it worthy enough to have all that hype generated around it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK,I don't like to be one of those critics that look for the flaws in everything,I actually try my hardest to be fair,but The Mask Of Zorro to me was a big disappointment. You would think with the charming cast,Zorro would be an entertaining romp,but a lot of actors seemed to be slumming it on autopilot so to speak,especially Anthony Hopkins. Some of the sword fights were spectacular some of them were just plain dull,and that was one of this film's main problems it's inconsistency. It's lavish looking,it certainly had the right cast along with some decent humor,but too often I was in the middle of being entertained then slowly getting bored at what was going on,the inconsistent pacing ruined it. Stuart Gordon makes a great fiendish villain to be sure,and there are some great little comic bits|De La Vega telling Alejandro he has BO is one| but it missed out on so much potential. It's a little overlong at 136 minutes too,by the time the big showdown came at the finale it was too little too late for me,the choreography was well done and all, it was just dull. I will say this though,the film does make Zeta Jone's character likable in this film,unlike the 2nd where she becomes a snotty witch for a lot of the film. I'm not saying The Mask Of Zorro is a complete failure or anything,it had quite a few entertaining moments it's just much too inconsistent.The Performances. Antonio Banderas has to play the heart of the film in the 2nd half,he does OK but stumbles a lot,because his charm only gets him so far performance wise. His chemistry with Hopkins was very good as it was with Zeta-Jones,but he often came across as a buffoon more then a believable hero type,thankfully the sequel improved this problem. Anthony Hopkins is good,but you can clearly tell he's slumming it,this was a paycheck film for him and it showed,that's not to say though I didn't enjoy it cause I certainly did. He's so suave and charismatic you can't help but be glued to the screen whenever he shows up,for me he made the film and slumming it or not I'd like to be that good while slumming. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very charming and quite stunning to look at,and unlike most of the sequel she's a very likable heroine. Stuart Wilson plays a wonderful villain usually and here is no different. He oozes class and often stole many of the scenes he was in,I really loved a lot of his and Hopkins banter. Matt Letscher is very good as the henchman,you will hate him.Bottom Line-The Mask Of Zorro is OK,definitely not as good as it could have been,but it also could've been a lot worse. The charming cast helps it out a lot,that being said I was still quite disappointed with the overall production. Worth the watch but don't get too hyped up about it.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't lie about nothing toward this movie masterpiece! Some don't care for the swash buckling heroics and decide to put it down for that but, this is the darkest, and I mean "Darkest" Zorro movie you'll ever see. And has a rich story of redemption that makes one truly remarkable film.. It's shot well done, and casted very well. Anthony Hopkins (Dela Vega) is a superb cast addition in which he brings to life a aging hero who seeks justice for his past mistakes while trying to start a new one, by renewing his relationship with a daughter he hardly got to know! (Elena) played by Catherine Zeta-Jones does a remarkable and beautiful part as a curious and gorgeous women who falls in love with (Elliondo) played by Antonio Banderas as the one and only "Zorro!". Banderas roll is questioned sometimes but, doesn't stray to far off and brings to life a almost forgotten hero in cinema culture.. The Mask of Zorro is a brilliant film with great actors and characters alike. It will immerse you into a time that could almost of been real in the history books and this one is certainly aiming for that! And that's why I rate this my 2nd favorite movie of all time.. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High definition a necessity for this delightful homage to swash bucklers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zorro senior tutors Zorro junior in the way of the blade, their combined goal? To enact revenge on Don Rafael Montero and Capt. Harrison Love respectively.Martin Campbell was an interesting and wise choice for this latest take on the swash buckling heroics of the Latin Robin Hood. Campbell was the man in the director's chair for both of James Bond's reinvigoration's, firstly with Golden Eye in 1995, and then with Casino Royale in 2006. For here it's evident that The Mask Of Zorro has no delusions of grandeur in the pantheon of cinema, it wants (and is) to be an action film with pure fantastical flamboyance pouring from practically every frame. It honours the swashers of old by ensuring all genre boxes are ticked, yep, we got swords a plenty, yep, we got a dashing hero (x 2 actually), yep, we got a spiffing looking villain, and yes we got a heaving bosom led romance into the mix as well. While Campbell and his team of screenwriters gleefully ensure that humour is a very prominent thing, thus keeping the fantasy in the comic book realm from which Zorro's essence comes.The stunt work on show is top draw, none more so during a horse chase sequence where this Zorro tips its hat to former glorious genre pieces (well done Tony Angelotti). Other notable technical aspects deserve a mention, the costumes from Graciela Mazón are desirable and now in this age of High Definition Cinema, good make up work really comes to the fore, so it be that that department did sterling work on this picture (check out Elena's gorgeous face). The cast are basically very strong, Antonio Banderas slips into the Zorro cape with charming ease, and though it's nice to see a Spanish actor playing the famous Spanish character, here in this adaptation the irony is that Zorro is Mexican! Anthony Hopkins is as elegant as ever as the elder, newly retired, Zorro AKA: Don Diego de la Vega, and Catherine Zeta Jones is positively ravishing as Elena, while Stuart Wilson does a nice line in pompous villainy as Don Rafael Montero.Some minor complaints do dwell within the picture. Campbell has a lot to fit into a running time of two hours and twenty odd minutes, and this makes the wait for the rip roaring finale longer than one at first wished for. Though for sure let it be noted that the gold mine action bonanza is totally worth the wait. Weak in the cast is Matt Letscher as Captain Love, oddly looking like some Kiefer Sutherland tribute act, he lacks any real menace for what is a pretty well written role. James Horner's score lacks the necessary boom boom bang bang that some one like Alfred Newman would have provided, and a comedy horse strand pushes the boundaries of acceptable genre homages a little too far.But really why moan and groan at irks that don't alter the trajectory of The Mask Of Zorro's blade? It isn't trying to do anything other than whisk you along for a blade swashing ride, and that is something that it most assuredly succeeds in doing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been several generations since adult audiences have been able to truly enjoy the story exploits of the Spanish legend, originally called 'Joaquín Murrieta' the hero of the old West. The Spanish settlers had another name for him which was El Zorro, The Fox, when Johnston McCulley wrote for the Walt Disney studios and the late Guy Williams played the hero. Of course one could dig further into the Hollywood archives and recall such great names as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Alain Delon, Duncan Regehr and even Gilbert Roland who played the capped avenger. However, in the modern era we have two extremely talented actors which definitely personify the Fox. Anthony Hopkins plays Alejandro De la Vega / Zorro and his protégé is none other than Antonio Banderas who also plays Don Diego Vega / Zorro. Julieta Rosen is Esperanza De la Vega, L.Q. Jones is Three-Fingered Jack, Matt Letscher is the villainous, Capt. Harrison Love and Catherine Zeta-Jones is the love interest of Zorro. The cast is well selected and the movie itself is jam packed with high drama, exciting adventure, great story-line involving millions in gold bullion and the theft of the state of California. The film is fast paced with dazzling sword play and explosive excitement. A great film which will no doubt become a Hollywood Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro tells the tale of how the legendary "new" Zorro came to be. The brother of the newest Zorro is murdered by the captain of California's governor. Alejandro is devastated at this lost. Later, he comes across an older man who happens to be the real Zorro. The older man was captured by the governor, Rafael and his daughter was taken from him. Now Diego de la Vega must train Alejandro to defeat the governor and reclaim his daughter by destroying Rafael's gold mines. The action is very good. There are traditional sword fights in this movie. I liked the scene where Alejandro and Elena de la Vega are fighting. The acting is great. Anthony Hopkins did a great job as Diego de la Vega/Zorro. Catherine Zeta-Jones is great in her first feature film. I liked Banderas as well. I will also say that James Horner is a great composer. He did such a great job with the music. The special effects near the end are decent. I take one point off because the screenplay was kind of weak. Overall, this is a great film. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zorro Rides Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Don't know if there are any spoilers here, but just in case) First saw this film when it was on TV a couple of years ago. Wow. I'd not long ago seen "Shrek 2" and my dad was going on about how so much of Puss In Boots' character had been taken from Zorro that I decided I wanted to have a look. I got my chance a couple of months later, and let me tell you, I was still laughing my head off the next day.I don't care what anyone says, this movie is one of my top ten greatest films ever. The plot, the music, the scenery, the actors and the characters: Everything was amazing. It was a little darker than I first expected, particularly the ironically-named Capitan Love who murdered the trainee Zorro's brother.First of all, the plot. I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy; I just go to see a film to be entertained and gripped by the story, and "The Mask of Zorro" certainly did that. The way that all of the characters were linked to each other whether they knew it or not is clever: Don Diego de la Vega (elder Zorro) is imprisoned and has his child taken away from him by his arch enemy Don Rafael Montero, Governor of California. Rafael takes the child, Elena, and raises her as his own. Twenty years later, his right-hand man, one Captain Love, finds the infamous Murrieta brothers, Joaquin and Alejandro, killing the elder brother, Joaquin. Alejandro swears that he will kill the Captain, and meets Don Diego, who escaped from jail. The pair work together to thwart Montero's plans, and along the way, Alejandro falls in love with Elena, but is unaware that she is his mentor's daughter. Phew, it's kinda complicated, but it works really well. The music. Superb score, apart from that one song, "Spend My Lifetime Loving You", which was fine in a quick snippet, but having the singers belting it out in the credits is a bit much. The one that sticks in my mind the most is in the first scene when Zorro is astride a rearing Tornado after saving the men from being killed, the sun setting in the background and the crowd cheering. Beautiful. The scenery. Set in 1840s California but filmed in the wonderful locations of Mexico. All the rich reds and browns create a powerful and wonderful background for the actors.Now, the cast. I personally think that they all performed brilliantly, and Anthony Hopkins was regal as Don Diego de la Vega, aka Zorro. Catherine Zeta Jones swashbuckles her way onto the silver screen with a brilliant performance, particularly in the duelling scene between Elena and Alejandro. Antonio Banderas is brilliant, he has a great sense of comic timing, and when he tries to get the horse, well. It was about five minutes before I recovered. "Hey, estupido!" he cries, and the horse reluctantly trots over. He smiles to himself and leaps from the rooftop, only for the horse to walk forward and let him crash to the ground. I was in hysterics. He and Hopkins bring a charm to the character that makes you say 'this is how Zorro is supposed to be played'. Stuart Wilson is suitably devious as the evil Don Rafael Montero, and Matthew Letscher plays a good part as the nemesis of the younger Zorro, you can really feel his hatred for Alejandro.Some people do not realise this, but for most of the time, it is really the actors who are doing all the sword-fighting and some of the stunts. The duel between Elena and Alejandro is brilliant; there is such a great chemistry between the two leads. One of my favourite scenes of the whole movie has to be the one where Zorro takes on a group of about twenty soldiers and wins. The look on his face when he realises that the gunpowder fuse is coming towards him is hilarious!I don't care what anyone says, I love this movie and would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to rent it, or if you own it, view it again and have a good time. It is great to just sit back once in a while and enjoy a movie with humour and action that doesn't have to rely on huge explosions, (OK, this film has two, but that's it!) bad language and car chases. I do like a good action film, but it is nice to dive into the past and watch something different that can make you laugh, cry and cheer the heroes on until the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Modern Errol Flynn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the Californian hero Zorro has much in common with the legend of Robin Hood. Both Diego de la Vega and Robert of Locksley are aristocrats, but both choose to side with the common people in their fight against injustice and oppression by foreign overlords, be they the Norman conquerors of England or the Spanish colonial rulers of California. Both men, at least in the cinematic versions of the legend, are expert swordsmen. Traditionally, of course, Robin Hood was more associated with the longbow than the sword, but the producers of adventure movies have always known that sword-fights make for exciting cinema. Hence the famous duel between Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (or, for that matter, all those light-sabres in "Star Wars"). Similarly, Zorro still clings to his trusty blade, even though the stories are set at a time in the nineteenth century when serious differences were settled by the gun and swords were largely confined to ceremonial uses and ritualistic duelling.This particular version of the story begins in 1821 when Mexico (which at this date still included California) is about to gain its independence from Spain. Zorro rescues three men from being executed by the evil Spanish governor, Don Rafael Montero, but is recognised as being Diego de la Vega, a man against whom Montero has long held a grudge. Zorro is arrested at his home and in the struggle his wife Esperanza is killed. Montero kidnaps his daughter Elena and raises her as his own.The action then leaps forward twenty years to 1841, when Zorro manages to escape after a long imprisonment. Montero has now returned to California as the leader of a conspiracy to escape from Mexican rule and to form an independent republic with himself as dictator. He has discovered a rich source of gold which he is secretly mining. Although this gold is the property of the Mexican government, they are unaware of its existence, and Montero intends to use it to buy California's independence from a government desperate for funds to finance its war against the Americans. In order to thwart this plot and to avenge the death of his wife, Zorro finds a young man, Alejandro, who has a grudge against Montero whose henchman Captain Love was responsible for the death of his brother, and trains him in the art of sword-fighting to take his place as the new Zorro.The film is in many ways similar to the recent sequel, "The Legend of Zorro". Both are swashbuckling adventure stories with a likable hero in Antonio Banderas's Alejandro and a ravishingly beautiful heroine in Catherine Zeta Jones's Elena. Elena is not just the hero's love interest (inevitably, she and Alejandro end up falling for each other), but also a heroine in her own right, a fearless and resourceful lady who is as skilled with a sword as he is. Catherine has never looked lovelier than she does here. The earlier film is, however, the better one. It has a second hero in Anthony Hopkins's de la Vega, who brings to the role a dignity and gravitas lacking in the sequel, in which he does not appear. It is not as blithely unconcerned with historical accuracy as the second film, although there are still one or two errors.(The leader of the Mexican nationalist rebel armies in 1821 was not Santa Anna but Iturbide; Mexico was not at war with the USA in 1841 as the Mexican-American War did not break out until 1846).More importantly, there is a significant difference in the political tone of the two films. The sequel is dominated by a rather paranoid post-9/11 patriotism, with Zorro becoming a heroic defender of America against a dastardly foreign conspiracy to blow up the nation's capital. This tone is fortunately absent from the original film. Rather, its ethos is what Roger Ebert describes as a "sense of honour". Zorro is the representative of truth and decency, the righter of wrongs, the champion of the weak against the strong. (The climax comes when Zorro has to prevent Montero and his henchmen from not only destroying the mine but also blowing up all the miners with it, in order to conceal the evidence of their illegal gold-mining). This is not the film to go to if you are looking for deep analysis of moral issues or great psychological depth. As a modern version of those old Errol Flynn swashbuckling adventures, however, it is excellent. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that launched Catherine Zeta Jones's Hollywood career!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it's not a bad one either. The Mask of Zorro is a film about an unlikely superhero called Zorro (played by Sir Anthony Hopkins), he is a lover and a fighter who fights injustices that the poor village people of California suffer and accepts the glorify all under the cover of his mask (the mask of Zorro). One day, an evil Villain attacks Zorro's abode under the cover of darkness, imprisons a wounded Zorro, kills his wife and kidnaps his daughter and seemingly gets away with everything for many years. One day, Zorro finds a way to break out of jail just in time to witness the evil villain's return to their shores. He spots his grown up daughter Elena in the crowd (played by the lovely Catherine Zeta Jones whom was discovered on the CBS telly series Titanic and cast in this role by Steven Spielberg) and this foils his played revenge attack. This forces him to realise that he has to device a better plan. An unlikely drifter whose brother has just been murdered comes Zorro's way (played by Antonio Banderas) whom he unwittingly trains to replace him. After the intense and rigorous training, the new Zorro carries out the plans according to the old Zorro's guidance. While masquerading as a Don, the new Zorro (Banderas) spots Elena and falls in love with her. The rest of the film from that moment becomes as predictable as London weather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inspiring Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask Of Zorro is an inspiring movie due to the fact that the story takes place in Old Mexico. The Music and the Scenery give it that extra Spanish kick. This movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, James Horner did a remarkable job with this one. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones, do an excellent job in playing their roles, but the more inspirational character is Don Diego De La Vega played by Anthony Hopkins, with his wise teachings on life and training. He did a great job with this one, and his appearance is really eye catching, especially how he looks dressed as Zorro. This movie is underrated, but definitely one of Hopkins'best.The story is written very well, from start to finish, and by far, the best Zorro movie. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I love how it explores the old Mexican cultures. It sorta makes you want to go dine in a Classy Mexican Restaurant, or perhaps listen to some old Spanish Tunes. One thing about this movie is that it has a serious tone, and less laughable parts. (Comparing to The Legend Of Zorro, 2005), and this of course, makes it more meaningful to watch, but nevertheless, a good, clean classic. This is a true Hero movie with an excellent story behind it.The Mask Of Zorro, one of the best. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was enthralled by this story of Zorro, a man who had lost everything including his way...only to twenty years later train a man who had saved him as a boy. This story was something that would completely disinterest me on a usual basis, and I admit if I didn't like the first twenty minutes of it I would have stopped. But that was completely not the case. The Mask Of Zorro has everything...a villain, a hero, another hero and a beautiful woman...not to mention a very beautiful man. I would recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that they don't like action or period pieces. Needless to say that I am anticipating the sequel. Zorro, who knew?</fullReview>

Every scene is unforgettable, ((especially when Catherine and Antonio Banderas danced as well as the scene where they fought against one another)), Sir Anthony did a great performance as a father figure. Banderas and Sir Hopkins (without even trying) were hilarious. Catherine was spectacular and was absolutely stunning. She and Banderas' chemistry sizzled the screen. They look so good together, their eyes says it all. It's a must see movie. I recommend it to everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mask of Zorro -- When Zorro stops being interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning, there was considerable hype and excitement over "The Mask of Zorro," which was probably comparable to that surrounding the first Crocodile Dundee series. In retrospect, both films did not really stand the test of time. The problem with "The Mask of Zorro" is that it does not have much to offer. Antonio Banderas makes for a handsome Zorro, but the role seems to be too big for him. He lacks the charisma to make that role work. The villains (Stuart Wilson as Don Rafael Montero and Mark Letscher as Captain Harrison Love) lack that spark, which for example Claude Rains had in "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938) or Jack Palance had as the evil gun slinger Jack Wilson in the movie, "Shane" (1953), or for that matter Megan Fox had in the recently released "Jennifer's Body." These villains were interesting, they new how to get our attention and keep it. The villains in "The Mask of Zorro," by contrast, are simply dull. The creators of this film are also not very good at doing those falling in love sequences. I realize this is a swashbuckler, but really the people who wrote the screenplay for "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938) did a much better job in creating the love sequence between Robin Hood (Flynn) and Maid Marian (De Havilland).Now this film is not a complete flop. There are some laughs in this movie. But these laughs come from the small details, like that scene where the equivalent to Sargeant Garcia says "Kill him" in a very strong Spanish accent. Other than that, there is little in this film to hold onto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More is not always better! This is a fabulously fun, exciting, hilarious movie, but it just goes on forever. There are just too many swordfights, daring rescues, and nonstop action, at the end, it's just overkill. I mean, I like action, swordfights, and high speed action, but this movie (especially at the end) had me saying 'OK, OK, now let's kill the bad guys and get this over with!'. I never thought I would say that a movie had too many swordfights in it, honestly. But just count how many times someone has their sword pointed at someone else's neck, so that they can deliver some Dramatic Dialogue, only to have that person escape to continue the fighting on and on and on... You would lose count. Heck, the hero even swordfights the heroine! I mean, it's excessive!But despite all that, Mask of Zorro is still lots of fun. Some better editing would have been nice, but other than that, it's very good. Just don't be surprised if after you see it, you find yourself thinking 'well it's about time!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank goodness for Anthony Hopkins and a few, well-choreographed sword fights or I would have given it 0 stars.The film isn't quite sure if it's a tongue in cheek farce or a drama. Antonio Banderas comes across as a buffoon. Why is it that most big production films these days have to have the lead actors making quips every 5 minutes? How about a strong story for a change? The film might have had a chance if Robert Rodriguez (Desperado) not dropped out as director early on. He would have brought an edge to the film that Martin Campbell, who is just one of the many Spielberg clones working for Spielberg's production company Amblin Entertainment, was not able to do.Anthony Hopkins brought each scene he was in to a higher level. He is a fine actor that gives a presence to every character he plays - even those that are poorly written.If you want to see an interesting Antonio Banderas film, check out Pedro Almodóvar's "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down". For a good, recent Anthony Hopkins film, check out "Surviving Picasso".Save your $8 and wait for Zorro the "Theme Park Show" - where you can see the sword fights performed by the real stars of this film - the stunt men and women.The film is rated PG-13 for cartoon violence.</fullReview>

And then you get to this piece of junk. A "high concept" exercise in insanity. Could this be what happened .... Suit #1 "Hey, Hopkins did so well in the Hannibal film, he has testosterone to spare even at his age, let's see if we can sell a producer on the idea of him as Zorro?" Suit #2: "Gee, Bud, that is brilliant, really thinking outside the box. But just in case someone should notice that this guy already qualifies for a Senior Citizen discount at the buffet table, let's hedge our bets with someone younger and closer to the original. I hear Banderas is free, mainly because he never lost that accent, and a lot of people have no idea what he is actually saying?" Suit #1: "OK, and for sex appeal, let's get Zeta-Jones, she has been doing mainly TV stuff and is hungry for a screen role." Suit #2: "Brilliant, Bud, they 'aint never going to replace YOU with a computer!" And if that is NOT the way this film was conceived, it is pretty darn close.

		<shortDescription>Batman and Indiana Jones in the Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1998, "The Mask of Zorro" stars Anthony Hopkins as an aging Zorro and Antonio Banderas as an orphaned delinquent with the potential to take over as the hero in early 1840s California. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the babe while Stuart Wilson and Matt Letscher play the villains.As my title blurb suggests, this movie is like Batman and Indiana Jones in the Wild West; there's even a "Bat Cave" (although, I should point out, the character of Zorro pre-dates Batman by 20 years, first appearing in 1919). Like the Indiana Jones movies, this is a fun adventure with thrilling, but eye-rolling scenes. It's nowhere near as good as 1981's "Raiders of the Lost Ark," but it's as good or better than the sequels.While some people praise the opening sequence as one of the best in history, I found it to be the weakest part of the movie. The action and tone are just so unrealistic and cartoony it seriously tempted me to tune out. Thankfully, I kept watching because the story later pulls you in as the wannabe hero tries to prove himself a worthy replacement of the original Zorro. The confessional scene is particularly well done and hooks the viewer. Speaking of which, Zeta-Jones' beauty is just unreal.The film runs 136 minutes and was shot entirely in Mexico.GRADE: B- (6.5/10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great popcorn fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many a movie has been made about Zorro, but nowadays this is probably, if not the most well-known, then at least very close. And for a good reason. It's a great movie that introduces the legendary character to new audiences while also pleasing those that are already familiar with him. It's entertaining, full of great action scenes as well as great characters, has a plot that's just perfect for a summer blockbuster and has a good cast of actors to pull it all off.And while I do think that the plot is just simple enough for a blockbuster adventure swashbuckler film such as this one, I do enjoy its subtle touches. Like the fact that our Zorro this time around is the fictional brother of a real-life Mexican outlaw Joaquín Murrieta or that he is opposed by Harrison Love, who's based on a real-life army man named Harry Love. And the very real conflict between Mexico, California and United States works as the background of it all.The film is also very good at building mythos. The very fact that the original Zorro has grown old and is forced to train a replacement for himself is a great plot hook that allows the film to distance itself from the original stories and build a storyline of its own, while still also giving as all the traditional Zorro moments that we love. Anthony Hopkins plays Diego de la Vega, and while it is a bit distracting whenever he's forced to play the younger Zorro in flashbacks, he is very good as an aged nobleman turned outlaw.Likewise, Antonia Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones shine as the protagonist and his love interest. Both are capable of filling their roles with both the charisma and the humour that these kinds of movies require, and they have good screen chemistry together.The Mask of Zorro is one of my favourite swashbuckling films. It keeps you entertained from start to finish and is filled with enough content to allow you to see it over and over again. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of adventure and fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro is quite good fun. In this case good fun is enough. The film promises excitement and entertainment and it delivers on its promise. It even gives you two Zorros for the price of one. Anthony Hopkins plays Don Diego de la Vega, Zorro number one. Unfortunately for de la Vega when we meet him his time as a swashbuckling hero is about to be cut short in rather tragic fashion. He loses everything that is dear to him and is tossed into a dungeon. Twenty years later he escapes and plots his revenge. Only by this point he's a little too old for the Zorro stuff. He needs a protégé. Enter Alejandro Murrieta, played by Antonio Banderas. Alejandro, seeking revenge of his own, is raw and uncultured, nowhere near as suave as the original Zorro. And being suave is part of what makes Zorro Zorro. de la Vega will have to teach the new Zorro so much more than how to use a sword.Conveniently the man who wronged Alejandro, Captain Love, is now the right-hand man of Don Montero, the man who wronged de la Vega. They will take their vengeance together. Of course it's not quite that simple, there are complications. As you would expect in a movie of this sort one of those complications is a stunningly beautiful woman. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Elena, the daughter Montero stole from de la Vega when she was an infant all those years ago. Elena and Alejandro fall for each other because of course they do. Meanwhile there are still those bad guys who need to be dispatched and a plot to steal California which needs to be foiled. This of course will involve sword fights. Many, many sword fights. Hey, it's a Zorro movie, what were you expecting? The movie greatly benefits from the performances of its three leads. Hopkins is reliably brilliant and clearly enjoying himself in a role which allows him to have some real fun for once. Banderas really grows into the role of Zorro as the movie progresses. He may not be very suave in the beginning but by the end he's quite the charmer. And Zeta-Jones brings a great spark to the proceedings. Elena's not your stereotypical damsel in distress, she gives as good as she gets. Zeta-Jones fits the role perfectly, full of confidence and charisma. Being drop-dead gorgeous doesn't hurt either. Banderas and Zeta-Jones have great chemistry but so too, in a very different way, do Banderas and Hopkins. Everyone plays off one another ever so well. While certainly not as memorable as the three stars the villains play their parts well too. A movie like this needs strong antagonists and here we are not disappointed, these are some truly hissable villains. Captain Love is so over-the-top in his evilness it's a little hard to believe. But the character is based on a real-life figure so give the movie the benefit of the doubt I suppose. Anyhow if you hate the bad guys, and you will, that can only help the movie in the end as you become more emotionally invested. This movie has a lot going for it. Action, drama, romance. A great story, great actors, great visuals, great music. Heroes to cheer, villains to despise. It's certainly not the most serious-minded of films but it's serious enough when it needs to be. Really good swashbuckling fun, that's what this movie is. What more could you want from Zorro?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get this straight - Batman Begins currently sits at 8.4 on IMDb, but this is less than 7. What? No. These kind of inconsistencies are a reflection of how dumb the masses really are.This film is infinitely better written and directed and acted than the Batman films. The script is clever and interesting, the humour is spot on (didn't even exist in Batman Begins), you can suspend disbelief to the action and really enjoy it (unlike most films these days with thousands of half-second edits and a melee of mess), there's a proper villain (actually two), and the story makes bloody sense.The characters are all well developed and the pacing is perfect. You see, here's the thing, dumb masses: We need characters we can understand and care about in order to care about the film. If this film went the Batman way and just had fast scene after fast scene with a rushed narrative, no-one would care and it would just be another dumb action movie.Clearly The Mask of Zorro loses out because it doesn't have the marketing muscle and brand name of "Batman".My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zorro's Great Epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro (1998): Dir: Martin Campbell / Cast: Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Anthony Hopkins, Stuart Wilson, Matt Letscher: Surprisingly successful film about the legacy and secret regarding the mask that shields the identity of Zorro. Anthony Hopkins plays an ageing Zorro who witnesses the murder of his wife and abduction of his son. Twenty years pass and he frees himself from captivity and sets out to train someone to carry on the legacy. Well written setup branches into well placed humour before climaxing with typical action. Directed by Martin Campbell who previously made the exhilarating 007 film Goldeneye. Hopkins is an appropriate ageing Zorro out to avenge the wrong done to his family as well as continue his legacy through another. Antonio Banderas is on target as young Zorro with a lot of great humour to boot. Stuart Wilson plays the villain who causes the tension then sets out upon a new scheme until his past returns to haunt him in the form of a black mask. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows grace and wit as she begins to recall her past that her mind had blocked out. Matt Letscher plays another villain whose murderous nature is targeted for termination. The purpose is to bring the popular comic book to screen but unlike many of its kind, this film plays out its pointless charade with a great deal of grand humour and sword play. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) is the original Zorro who battled the tyrannical Spanish rule of Governor Montero. On the verge of liberation, Zorro is imprisoned, his wife killed, and his daughter abducted. Twenty years later, Montero returns to take advantage and Zorro escapes with Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas). Zorro decides to train Alejandro as the new Zorro.This is a good adventure flick. It has fun sword play especially with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Antonio Banderas. They have good chemistry together. And so does Hopkins and Banderas. It keeps the tone light and irreverent. It's an entertaining romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It brought back memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the Guy Williams TV series and this movie brought back such fond memories. To me, it was practically perfect in it's portrayal of the "he done me wrong" malady--not just once, but twice! The story, the action, the sets, the actors, the horse: all were reminiscent of the restraints of the early TV show, yet magically updated and captured the essence, the beauty, the charm and the swash and buckle. I loved this movie!! They kept the violence from being overly gratuitous, virtually no profanity and the sex well within the bounds of decency--(**POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW**) well, except for Elena losing her dress. I do think, though, that the confessional scene courted being offensive and could have been handled with more respect. But, those two things were the only down side for me and, really, in today's anything goes to offend you world, pretty minor. Everything else was just sit back and enjoy pure fantasy, romance, comedy and rollicking adventure. I laughed, I cheered, I held my breath, I wept and I savored sweet revenge. What a great way to spend a couple of hours! Zorro can scurry across my rooftop and shimmy down into mi casa any ol' time he wants--as long as he brings Tornado with him...grin...</fullReview>

Simply, ladies and gentlemen, The Mask of Zorro belongs to a category where no comic adaptation could enter before. An imperishable, spectacular and chaotically-brilliant movie. The Mask of zorro possesses the essence that should always exist in the handover from comics to the big screen. Sequence after sequence, this is the absolute glory. A great movie that does not give a single frame to breathe. An ode to chaos and anarchy, while shares are confronted inevitably lead to a path dirty, black and hostile.

		<shortDescription>The point is he could be the older Fairbanks, Power, Williams or Regher. It's brilliant. Best adventure movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the best adventure movie ever made. There's something about this movie.It's very well written and the actors have solid performances. This has everything about Zorro's world.For those who know the character can easily agree with me. In my view it was intelligent not to do the traditionally story: having Don Diego coming home from Spain. It's a fresh new plot that shows respect and pays homage to Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Guy Williams and Duncan Regher. These fabulous four were the best playing the character "Don Diego De la Vega". So, why we need another one? Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as an older Don Diego.(40/45 years old in the beginning). The point is he could be the older Fairbanks, Power, Williams or Regher. It's brilliant. Hopkins' character is a very strong personality. Antonio Banderas gave a new personality to the character but he kept faithful to what Zorro is. He gave a fantastic performance.He has presence on the screen.Chaterine Zeta-Jones plays Elena and she is simply fantastic. This was her first big role. And what a role-dueling and dancing like that! Wonderful! The villains were great-Matt Letcher and Stuart Wilson. Old fashioned villains. Captain Love really existed. I also liked Julieta Rosen as Esperanza and the two actors who played the Murrieta brothers as kids. There are a lot of scenes based on the older Zorro versions as the scene in the barracks - Zorro against the soldiers lead by Garcia. This actually reminds me that chase scene in "The mark of Zorro" with Douglas Fairbanks. The confession scene is based on the 1940's movie with Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell,where she-Lolita(Linda Darnell) speaks with Zorro in the chapel thinking he was a priest. Another great scene is the duel in the De la Vega hacienda- Don Diego vs Don Rafael Montero. Like in the 1940's version- Diego(Power)against Captain Pasquale (Basil Rathbone),the 1920's version- Diego vs Captain Ramon or Disney's version in episode 13- Diego (Guy Williams) vs Captain Monastario (Britt Lommond). The secret passage in the hacienda in the fire-hall just like the 1990's version. And as in the other versions we have this love triangle- in this we have two- Don Diego- Esperanza - Don Rafael. Alejandro- Elena - Captain Love. We also see this love triangle in the 1940's version -Don Diego - Inez Quintero - Captain Pasquale. And of course- the "Z" for Zorro. In this we have a knew mark. "M" for Murrieta.The music has class. It's very well included in the scenes. James Horner is really a great composer.It all works well in this movie. The cinematography is wonderful. Congratulations to the wonderful team lead by Martin Campbell. I can watch the movie several times and still never tired of seeing it! that is a proof that this movie is simply fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Z Best "Zorro" Since Tyrone Power's "Zorro!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like The Lone Ranger, he wears a mask to conceal his identity. Like Batman, he hides his crime busting regalia in a secret place. Like The Phantom, he rides a spirited stallion. His wizardry with a bullwhip rivals Indiana Jones. He sports a cape like Superman. Like The Shadow, he is a wealthy gentleman who leads a highly visible public life and shuns violence. Like James Bond, he exudes enough debonair charm to leave the ladies swooning. Named after the elusive fox, he is Zorro! Zorro lives to thwart injustice, corruption, and tyranny. Watching "GoldenEye" director Martin Campbell's classy but drawn-out swashbuckler "The Mask of Zorro" with Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, you'd think Zorro was a cross-section of those heroic crime busters. Actually, you'd be mistaken. The creators of "The Lone Ranger, Batman, Superman, The Shadow, Indiana Jones, and James Bond drew their inspiration from Zorro. For the record, Canadian born novelist Johnston McCulley created the Zorro character in 1919, and the Hispanic hero made his first appearance in the serialized story "The Curse of Capistrano" in "All-Story Weekly," a the pulp magazine. Like a good legendary crime buster movie, "The Mask of Zorro" encapsulates Zorro's motivation. The affluent Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins of "Instinct") resorts to mask, cap, sword, and whip to defend the helpless, put-upon peasantry. Scenarists John Esckow, Ted Elliot, and Terry Rossio have written "Zorro" as if it were an old-fashioned tale. Audiences must pay attention to their multi-dimensional storyline to appreciate the intricate, elaborately woven action. Moreover, director Martin Campbell translates the scripted word into cinematic verse. "Zorro" emerges as such a literate action yarn that you may find yourself enjoying it equally for its mental as well as physical stimulation. The only hitch to "Zorro" is that Campbell and his writers never know when to stop. "Zorro" is a runaway horse, not that it matters much. "Zorro" is one of those movies where each scene contributes to the headlong momentum of the story. What a lot of people may miss after they finish watching "Zorro" is that "Zorro" is a tragedy wrapped up in a romantic adventure.Consider the splendid introductory gambit. In 1821, villainous Spanish Governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson of "Lethal Weapon 3") faces exile. Before departing, he devises one last trap to capture Zorro. Decked out in black as 'the fox,' Don Diego takes the bait. He rescues three innocent peasants from a firing squad, and then eludes an army of Don Rafael's bumbling troops. Swinging gallantly around on his handy bullwhip, Zorro pauses on Rafael's balcony and carves a Z into his throat. Framed in a heroic sunset, Zorro gallops home to tell his baby daughter Elena about his exploits. Later, Rafael shows up without warning at Vega's hacienda. Opening a wound that Vega acquired at the execution, Rafael unmasks Vega as Zorro. A fight ensues, and a cretinous soldier accidentally kills Vega's gorgeous wife Esperanza (Julieta Rosen of "Perfect Target"). Don Rafael had lusted after Esperanza, so he furiously impales the poor soldier on his sword. Not only does Don Rafael imprison Vega, but he also abducts baby Elena! Indeed, "Zorro" features a dastardly villain that you can truly boo-hiss!Twenty years elapse, and Don Rafael returns to California. He proposes a daring scheme to steal California from Spanish General Santa Anna by selling it to him for secret gold stashed in a nearby Spanish mine. Cleverly, Rafael enlists the aid of the greedy landowners. The ghost of Zorro/Vega still haunts Rafael, so he scours Mexico's smelly dungeons to find Vega. Rafael fears that Zorro may thwart his plan. Vega manages to escape during Rafael's inspection when his fellow inmates step forward to claim Zorro's identity. Genuine class distinguishes Zorro from his cinematic competitors. The smoothly handled violence is never gratuitous and rarely profane. Best of all, the swordplay is elegant but stimulating. This is the first good example of saber-slashing since director Richard Lester made "The Three Musketeers" and "The Four Musketeers" in the 1970s. "Zorro" constitutes a lively throwback to the way literate adventure sagas were produced. Indeed, director Martin Campbell revitalized James Bond in "GoldenEye," and "The Mask of Zorro" resembles an elaborately plotted, often indulgent 007 epic where story matters as much as action. In an opening similar to the Bond franchise, Zorro marches on screen. Whipping out his sword, he slashes a huge signature Z with three broad, swift strokes. Flames engulf the screen and the narration begins. Although the body count remains comparably low, "The Mask of Zorro" should keep action-oriented guys of all ages satisfied women will gravitate to "Zorro" for Hispanic hunk Antonio Banderas. Banderas performs his sword fighting chores credibly enough, and he gets a couple of chances to woo Elena. Reining in the sexuality to obtain a PG-13 rating, the filmmakers rely entirely on Catherine Zeta-Jones' modesty and pulchritude as the adult Elena. Essentially, Jones displays only cleavage. She has no nude scenes. She engages Zorro in an entertaining sword fight scene in the stables as well as an erotically charged dance number.Periodically, "Zorro" pokes fun at its hero. While the filmmakers have fun at the expense of Banderas' "Zorro," they succeed in making Zorro both human and sympathetic. "Zorro" loses a modicum of its spontaneity to its cumbersome length and its overwritten script. Indisputably, "The Mask of Zorro" ranks as Z-best Zorro movie since Twentieth Century Fox's "The Mark of Zorro" (1940) with Tyrone Power. "Titanic" composer James Horner provides stirring, toe and heel tapping Spanish music that enhances both the action and the atmosphere. Thankfully, "The Mark of Zorro" is one summer movie without a succession of heavy metal, hip-hop, rap, or country music tunes decimating the end credits. If performance and plot matter in your choice of action adventure films, "The Mark of Zorro" qualifies as ideal entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Epic Adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega, is captured and imprisoned just as Spain concedes California to Santa Anna. 20 years go by and his mortal enemy, Don Rafael Montero, returns to California with a plan to become wealthy at the expense of the peasants. The original Zorro escapes from prison and trains a new Zorro to take his place. Much swashbuckling and derring-do ensues.It's about time I saw the movie! I'm going to say I liked the movie a lot because it's really entertaining and has much humor to boost on with the action. It's just like a Rush Hour film or any other action comedy you've seen.I wasn't annoyed the fact that this movie is over two hours long. I really didn't mind it because, as I said, you would be entertained. There are great action scenes in the film, some just impossible to happen but to make it all worth the fun!Oh, and Anthony Hopkins looks VERY DIFFERENT in the film! I can not see him in the role he was playing, which was good. Antonio Banderas plays a good Zorro and his love, the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones, also does some good acting, although I would like to see her in this film longer.This is what an entertaining, swashbuckling epic action adventure should be! It has great action, great characters, and great humor to lighten up the screen! Watch it and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This swashbuckler, with great acting by Hopkins and Banderas, very high production standards and beautiful music and cinematography is great escapist fun. It roughly follows historical events and one does not have to suspend belief too much. There is one glaring (I think) error. In the scene where "Elena" goes to the local market and her former servant recognizes her and gives her a silk shawl, Elena goes back and seeks her out. She starts speaking to the woman and another younger woman tells her that she only speaks "Qechua", obviously a local Indian language.Quechua is spoken today by approximately ten million people and is the most common of the indigenous lanquages of the New World. Problem is that all of these people live in either Peru, Bolivia or Ecuador. It was the official language of the Inca, and was never spoken in California or Mexico, now or in the early 19th Century. She should have been speaking Nahuatl (the language of the Aztecs), or a local Indian tongue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a child, I used to see the cartoon 'Cool guy Zorro'. Already, the 'zorro' was hero for me. As time goes on, I saw this movie when I was 13years old. It was shocking for me. The zorro, who I thought he is immortal, lost in the first scene. 'The mask of the zorro' treats about the second zorro's born. It is new character, and the second zorro 'Aljandro' is fit with the mask of zorro. Story is fresh and it never looks like a second part of zorro series. The advantages of this movie is that it shows more realistic and more serious one. Until this movie was filmed, movie zorro was a just comical drama; that's why I loved to see the cartoon zorro because at least it showed a tough guy. But, it shows perfectly different part. Action was fantastic and the zorro became more powerful than 1st one. Besides, Aljandro's revenge story and Diego(1st zorro)'s story combinated each other well; and this stories became one as Alejandro and Diego's daughter got married. This movie has no problem to see. this mentions the legend of the zorro will be continued forever....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swashbucklingly Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,The Mask of Zorro is the best Zorro I've ever seen. Instead of the comic-book plot and feel of The Legend of Zorro, everything is made realistic, from the fight scenes to the plot. The Mask of Zorro has awesome fight scenes and great acting from Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Stuart Wilson. Bob Anderson unleashes himself in this film, creating vivid and just plain cool fight scenes and action sequences.On the day the Spainards were pulling out of California, the governor Raphael Montero wanted one last reckoning. He created a trap to bring Zorro out in the open so he could kill him. He was successful in a ways. Zorro was revealed as Don Diego de la Vega and was imprisoned. To make Diego suffer even more, Montero kidnapped Diego's baby daughter, Elena, to raise as his own.20 years later Diego has escaped from prison and Montero has returned to California to fight for its independence from Mexico and America. At the same time, A small-time bandit named Alejandro's brother is killed by the cruel US army captain, Harrison Love. Diego begins to train Alejandro in the ways of Zorro so they both can take their revenge while stopping Montero from slaughtering hundreds of people in order to make California his own kingdom.The Mask of Zorro rocks big time. Antonio Banderas plays the new Zorro perfectly with suave charm and determination. Anthony Hopkins rocks, as usual, as Diego, who is now consumed by revenge and retrieving his daughter from Montero's grasp. Catherine Zeta-Jones does a great Spanish accent as she plays the slightly naive Elena. Stuart Wilson is cold and merciless as Don Raphael Montero and his performance is on par, appropriately, with Anthony Hopkins's performance.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

Granted, "The Mask of Zorro" is pretty corny; it mostly consists of people sword-fighting, jumping on and off tables, and such things (there's always conveniently something for him to use), but it is a good look at the history of the Golden State. Of course, I had never heard of Catherine Zeta-Jones before this, but she was quite impressive here, and has done some impressive stuff since.

		<shortDescription>Magnifico swashbuckling return of Zorro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a fabulous movie! I cannot imagine a more romantic and thrilling return of everyone's favorite Spanish adventurer hero, Zorro. Now we have not one but TWO Zorros here, the older a compelling father seeking justice and the younger a dashing, romantic adventurer. The story begins when the original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega, escapes from 20 years imprisonment, returning to California to exact revenge on his enemy, Don Raphael Montero, who caused his wife's death all those years ago and took his daughter to raise as Montero's own. Furthermore, Montero even now has evil plans to become wealthy at the expense of mining peasants. To further his goals, he takes on a protégé, Alejandro (an orphan who helped him as a boy) in order to train him as his successor, the new Zorro. When Alejandro meets Diego's daughter, Elena, the passions ignite...Never has the mask of Zorro been more daringly worn than by this worthy successor, Alejandro. My most memorable scene is the sword fight between Alejandro and Elena, when he literally cuts off her clothes. Oh, the outrage! the audacity! Also, the story of the older Zorro is a touching one, especially his fury at Montero for having raised Elena as his own daughter. This is naturally the ultimate insult to Diego, forced to watch his daughter's loyalty to his most bitter enemy, all the while she is of course unaware of either Diego's true identity or her 'father' Montero's villainous past deeds and current wicked intent.Though the new Zorro is wonderful in his role, the most memorable stars for me are Anthony Hopkins, who commands sympathy and respect as the aging hero, Diego, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is of course incredibly gorgeous as the fiery and feisty, raven haired Elena.The Z's are boldly and daringly carved out in this movie...villains to be be taken to task, past wrongs to be avenged, innocent victims to be protected, and of course a beautiful woman to woo and win. All as only Zorro can do in his legendary swashbuckling style. Oh, the derring do!</fullReview>

During the strict training, Alejandro was a thief became his excellent apprentice.In the ball of Manteno holding, Alejandro became a charm gentleman who catches Elena's eyes and heart.

		<shortDescription>A rip roaring interpretation of the legendary hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writers and director and crew of The Mask of Zorro hit every mark exactly when creating the most recent entry (and there has been many over the years...none of which I have seen except for a series in the eighties or nineties.) A witty and interesting script, great actors, cutting edge sword fights, and a beautiful lush setting of eighteen hundred California before it's statehood. Zorro has always been a unique savior with a great back story and this film embraces much of it.First off bringing on the incomparable Anthony Hopkins to play the aged and much retired Don Diego de la Vega, the original Zorro, was an absolute stroke of genius. I mean not only does Hopkins automatically up the ante of any film but the role is brilliant and genius. I don't know how much was stunt double but his performance in the beginning of his last ride as Zorro is brilliant and believable and Hopkins plays a tortured sole and former hero perfectly. Enter former wanted thief Alejandro Murrieta played by Antonio Banderas in one of his best roles hands down as the swashbuckling Zorro. He was absolutely built for this role and he is brilliant as Zorro and as his alter ego although he only really takes on his alter ego once. Banderas is the first Spanish American to actually portray Zorro ever in history and he's perfect. He's the exact copy of what you would picture the hero. His back story from thief to Californian protector is interesting and well performed by him every step. Hopkins as his trainer and teacher and mentor is the perfect match and they have incredible chemistry and Banderas matches Hopkins' on screen presence completely. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Elena, Hopkins' estranged daughter taken from him as a baby by his mortal enemy and also Banderas' love interest. She's feisty and a great fighter and some real spirit. Her and Banderas fit each other and have incredible romantic chemistry and their romance is done in very good speed and unfolds nicely as they are pitted against each other as well as together. Stuart Wilson rounds out the cast as the especially underhanded Don Rafael Montero. He's quite good as Hopkins' adversary both in the past and present, and he's great at playing the incredibly evil and also diplomatic sides of his character. Each character has an important part in the film and they get an equally watchable and integral part of the story and everything you hope for each of them unfolds.Martin Campbell, who is no stranger to action films as well as riveting stories does a great job at putting together this incredible action/comedy/adventure film. I think it truly will go down as a classic in the same vein as Indiana Jones, and Superman. I can only hope the 2nd installment is even remotely as good as this one. It would be very difficult to pull of considering so much of the story is done in this one. The setting of eighteen hundred Mexican culture is done exactly the way it needed to be for Zorro and his heroic adventures are worth watching again and again. It has everything you could possibly want and more, a rip roaring action film that adventure lovers will love!! Check it out!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think The Mask of Zorro is just what an action film should be. A good mix of action, drama, and comedy, and in this, there's plenty of all three. In Mask of Zorro, the legendary Mexican hero disappears for 20 years, but when his old enemy rises again, he must train a young and arrogant protégé to take his place.The story and writing for this movie are really good. The movie is well paced, and it has just the right number of action scenes. Nothing is really overdone special effects wise.The performances are really something else. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones are great together, and they play their roles really well. As for Anthony Hopkins, I could watch him read a phone book and enjoy it.The Mask of Zorro is truly one of the late 90's greatest action films.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro is a great action-adventure film, with the director Martin Campbell, taking the popular legend of Zorro and successfully bringing it to life. What really makes this a bullseye is the fact that the script and dialogue is strong, with an appropriate amount of humor. It was also properly cast, with Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Anthony Hopkins breathing life to their fun characters. Also kudos to composer James Horner, fresh off from his spectacular Titanic score, who created one his most unique scores of his career. This is definitely a film worth seeing over and over again - a solid 8 out of 10. Too bad the sequel, The Legend of Zorro is only a pale comparison to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Update of Old-Fashioned Serial Adventures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went as a family to see "The Mask of Zorro." It walks the fine fun line that "Indiana Jones" does of taking the serials both seriously and satirically.The directing is pedestrian but the actors really get into what they're doing so keeps the believability high. Catherine Zeta-Jones's character is as feisty as Mulan, so maybe this is a new, positive trend.The villains didn't have to be so pure evil, on and on with their sadistic crimes, but my husband said you had to really justify the heroes killing them otherwise we wouldn't be sympathetic to such violence.Kudos to all the stunt actors who were kept mighty busy.The music is mediocre. All in all, my family really enjoyed it. (originally written 7/25/1998)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average swashbuckler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie resurrects a character first played in silent films by Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and again on TV in the 1950s by Guy Williams. It is directed by Martin Campbell whom plans to make a trilogy of Zorro films this being the first. Martin Campbell is the director of the James Bond movie GoldenEye which turned out much, much better than most Bond films. This film is also a revival of the swashbuckler genre, without this film we may have never seen "Pirates of the Carribian".Spanish governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) catches on to Don Diego's dual identity and has him imprisoned, absconding with Don Diego's baby daughter. Two decades later, Don Diego encounters Alejandro Murrieta, who's eager for revenge after Don Rafael's partner, Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher), slays Alejandro's brother. Following a bit of "Karate Kid"-style training, Alejandro dons the mask and black cape, and Zorro is reborn to terrorize a new generation of villainous aristocrats. Complicating matters for Don Rafael is the arrival in town of the ravishingly lovely Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the child Don Rafael stole from him 20 years ago and raised as his own The principle problem, though, is easy to spot. Love and Don Rafael are cardboard connivers who never seem to pose a serious obstacle to the combined powers of Alejandro and Don Diego. Since there's no sense of threat or peril, this 140-minute tale sometimes seems to creep along toward a foregone conclusion, with the only suspense in the story growing out of Elena's divided loyalties to her two fathers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive and enjoyable interpretation of a timeless legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Mask Of Zorro' is a fine example of what Summer Blockbusters should be...but generally aren't. Of course, 'The Mask of Zorro' is based on a timeless character that existed long before the likes of 'Mr and Mrs. Smith' or 'Spider-Man'. Zorro has been the subject of over 40 different films, perfect at best, hideous at worst.Rather than simply creating a new franchise, with a story showing how Don Diego de la Vega became the original Zorro, this film focuses on the fact that Zorro, unlike other heroes, is a legend, and can live through generations.Anthony Hopkins plays an aging de la Vega, who is caught out by his enemies and is subjected to twenty years imprisonment before escaping. Upon his escape, he finds that his gaoler, Don Rafael Montero, has returned to California, with evil plans no less. De la Vega finds troubled bandit Alejandro Murrieta (played with comic charm by Antonio Banderas) seeking to avenge his brother's death and Murrieta's training to become the new Zorro begins.Unlike Zorros of the past, this film had a far more lenient budget, giving way for wire effects and stunt men, so that the film could stretch to its fullest. However, at the beginning of the film, when we see Hopkins in his final days as Zorro, it is slightly laughable, as the camera films a slightly pudgy old man before the shot changes and he transforms into an athletic youth (clearly a stuntman), leaping around the scenery and jousting at his foes. Hopkins' acting skill definitely paid off in the role of De la Vega, however he did not have the physical presence of Zorro in his old age. Then again, finding an athletic sixty-year old who can pass for a thirty-year old and still act to his fullest is probably easier said then done.This film is visually and audibly breathtaking, also, with James Horner's impressive Hespanic themes and beautiful landscapes. One particular scene which compliments both musical and production design is an impressive, however slightly erotic, tango scene between Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones' love interest.Overall, this is a highly enjoyable family film that will appeal to all who love adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zorro Lives!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the old black-and-white series that was on the Disney channel at midnight on weekdays, I enjoyed this movie. It was everything I could've hoped for.From the whole ensemble to the reason behind it, this film kind of reminded me of an old-fashioned, low-budget, Mexican Batman. Well, think about it. A justice-seeking vigilante who wears a black mask with a black suit and a black steed goes about taking care of villains trying to do in innocent people. Okay, well, maybe not...And, for those who speak Spanish, did you notice the irony between "Montero" and "Zorro"? If you don't speak Spanish, look up those two words in a Spanish-English dictionary. You'll get it, eventually.Okay, well enough of that. Here's the review...First thoughts: One to buy! Can't wait till the sequel!Pro's: Too many, just watch it! By far, Banderas' best performance. Zeta-Jones does a convincing performance at being Spanish. Action-packed with some humor to it, too.Con's: Not too many. Not the best film I've ever seen, but an excellent one, nonetheless. Some long fight sequences, but otherwise, nothing.Overall: Just see it! You'll love it!Capt. Love: "It's just one man..." Don Rafael Montero: "It isn't just one man, d*** it! It's Zorro!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Zorro legend, slicked up with slam-bang, high-tech, expensive effects, so that it resembles an action-flick or a high-budget martial arts movie. Anthony Hopkins is surprisingly--though nicely--cast as an elderly Zorro passing his skills and knowledge(not to mention his cape and mask!)onto a Latin fugitive who soon becomes a well-trained fighter for the people. The bad guys here are , heartless Spaniard officials, sadistic in a cartoon manner in much the same way Antonio Banderas' new Zorro is dopey and yet dashing. There's plenty of sword fights and anachronistically modern jokes, a saucy side-line romance, well-made but distressingly unsubtle. All the dust and noisy action Hollywood can dream up can't help "Mask of Zorro" escape the feeling that there's no real personality at work. It's an epic--but only in generic terms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ted Elliot &amp; Terry Rossio have proved themselves to be masters of the old-fashioned romantic action-adventure movie. With this and "Pirates of the Caribbean" they have crafted two of the most entertaining and fun adventures since Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was wielding a big sword. This movie is a great throwback to those old Raoul Walsh/Allan Dwan adventure movies from the 1920's-1930's, with much better acting and production values of course. Like another reviewer said, the simpleness and predictable storyline are for once fun, mainly because the action scenes and romance scenes are well interspersed with the action and director Martin Campbell has a light touch through the whole thing as to not make it so serious. Like Pirates, Robin Hood, Indiana Jones, etc. this film is the kind that people watch all the time and turn into a perennial favorite and I am glad it has discovered such a fanbase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when it came out about six or seven years ago. I loved it right from the start. The sword-fighting, the Spanish dancing, the parties, and the excitement; it enthralled me. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I watched the movie.Some of the scenes were a little graphic--the executions and such--but all in all, it was an unforgettable movie for me. It was serious, but also funny at the same time.The action scenes superb as well! Zorro was made out to be an amazing character, with all the aerobatics he could do.Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones had wonderful chemistry on screen. They seemed to not be able to get enough of each other. From dancing to sword-fighting, they were an irresistible couple.Anthony Hopkins did a good job in his portrayal of the older Zorro, but I found it very hard to believe that he was young in the first scenes of the movie. Despite the fact that they dyed his hair and tried to make him seem more alert and peppy, it didn't seem to work so well.Some of the scenes were a little graphic--the executions and such--but all in all, it was an unforgettable movie for me. It was serious, but also funny at the same time.Overall, THE MASK OF ZORRO was a wonderful movie. I recommend it to those who love action and romance.</fullReview>

I think someone said that the new zorro learned how to fight in one day and this was believable. Well lets see did you see Once Upon A Time in Mexico? How many people did Ananito kill in that movie at one setting? So quit nick picking on Zorro. I can't wait for the next one to come out which I understand won't be long now. I think Hopkins did a great job as the old zorro. I was kind of disappointed that they killed him off just when he found his daughter again. Maybe they could have had him live and he could have continued to help the new Zorro and meet is grand daughter. Hopkins did a great job as a teacher. A firm hand with Antonio and at the same time a little understanding on what he was going through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cartooney swash-buckling action, with a strong cast (Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas) and lots of poor repressed Spanish peasants to save. This is an enjoyable film that reminded me of the old Musketeer films staring Richard Chamberlain.This film was also interesting to me on a historical level as it is set in the days when Spain still had control over areas of northern America, such as California. However after I'd seen this film something bugged me about it for days later and then I suddenly realized what it was ? there's an American soldier in this film in a Union uniform who seemed rather anachronistic. Wasn't the Union formed after the American civil war and wasn't that after the state of California had become part of the rest of the northern states and under control of the English ? Hmmm? But I could be wrong !Its still a fun film to watch though (especially for the kids and the big kids like me) !</fullReview>

Sitting thinking about what would have happened to this movie with other leads - it's inconceivable.I thought the story line perhaps a bit too quick (ie with too little transpiring over too short a time) but the plot is magnificent - this is drama.Critics point out that it's virtually devoid of pyrotechnics and special effects and such and that they hope it would succeed in the box office. The results would seem to be in - it 'made it'.This is the kind of film that's a blockbuster without being a blockbuster. It has all those elements other directors like Spielberg strive for but so rarely achieve. It has pathos and breadth and depth. It's just good fun. The good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad. Stacked deck. But this is for fun - mostly - and that's the way it's supposed to be.Great great flick.</fullReview>

Horse chasing and sward fighting are remarkable.Student-teacher relationship, a talented master's attitude and remarkable display of a skilled warrior are presented in a memorable way in this movie. It could easily be a collector's selection. Because, you can watch it again and again without getting bored. Deceptive tactics of political rebels are justified, which, some people may disagree with. Stripping the heroine in duel was interesting, but, whether it was a part of history is unknown. However, that piece is the only sexual content in this movie.

A rousing summer swashbuckler and a more accessible vehicle for Banderas than "Desperado". Hopkins is good as the old Zorro and Zeta-Jones became a star over night thanks to her role as the fiery love interest.Of course, it doesn't help that Catherine, then 28 or 29, showed some of her skin. I am of course, talking about the famous scene where Zorro cuts off her dress and leaves her standing half naked in the stable. Of course, she had been acting a little full of herself and needed to have her 5'8" body exposed to humble her. Yeah right. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MASK OF ZORRO, an expanded semi-'sequel' to Tyrone Power's 1940 classic, is a very enjoyable swashbuckler with a sterling cast. While advertised as being the first 'Zorro' featuring an Hispanic (Antonio Banderas) in the lead, the statement isn't quite true; Guy Williams, who played the masked avenger on TV in the 1950s, was born Armand Catalano, which probably gives him a legitimate claim to the title...however, Banderas WAS the first, in motion pictures!The tale is really of two generations of 'Zorros', facing the same villain, the Once and Future Governor, Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson). The first Zorro is the classic personification of the character, Don Diego de la Vega (Sir Anthony Hopkins, in the role played earlier by Power and Douglas Fairbanks), who, as the story opens, prevents Gov. Montero from carrying out a final execution prior to his recall to Spain. Aided by two street urchins (to whom he awards a medallion), Zorro spectacularly defeats Montero, but calls him by his first name, which alerts the villain to Zorro's secret identity. Later that evening, while Don Diego basks in the company of his wife and infant daughter, Montero and his forces invade the hacienda, accidentally kills the wife, then beats Diego to unconsciousness. As he regains his senses, he is taunted by the Governor that his daughter would now be raised by his mortal enemy, never knowing her 'real' father. Diego is hauled away to prison to die. Years pass, and the two street urchins have grown into wild-haired bandits, Alejandro and Joaquín Murrieta (Banderas and Victor Rivers) who travel with a cackling old cowboy (L.Q. Jones), and fleece local villages. When the military commander (the very blond Matt Letscher) kills Joaquin and chops off his head, Alejandro vows revenge. Meanwhile, Diego has escaped prison (in a scene very similar to one in THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO), and observes Montero's return to California, accompanied by his now-adult daughter, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones, breathtakingly beautiful in her American film debut). Listening to Alejandro's drunken ravings, Diego realizes the pair have similar goals, and offers to train the young bandit in the art of the sword.The training sequence is one of the most entertaining parts of the film, as Diego finds new and rewarding ways to torture the younger man. Finally, Alejandro reaches a pinnacle of development, and decides to don a mask and steal a horse...and he meets Elena for the first time, falling in love with the beauty. Later, hiding in a Confessional booth, he listens to Elena acknowledge that she desires him, as well (in a scene based on a classic moment in THE MARK OF ZORRO), and the story moves towards a spectacular climax at Montero's secret gold mine.The acting is first-rate, with Hopkins having a ball playing an action hero for a change. Banderas and Zeta-Jones create a tremendous amount of heat in their scenes together, making this the sexiest 'Zorro', ever. As villains, Wilson and Letscher lack the suavely malevolent persona of Basil Rathbone, but you'll hiss at them, anyway!THE MASK OF ZORRO is so good that news of a possible sequel should be a cause of celebration for all swashbuckling adventure fans.Zorro ROCKS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg obviously felt that a homage to some of the heroes of the past was not enough when he produced Martin Campbell's scintillating update of the classic tale THE MASK OF ZORRO. Thanks to some smart screenwriting, good old-fashioned performances and a refreshing lack of CGI, they teamed up to produce one of the best versions of the film and one which will inspire and thrill audiences for generations to come. Utilising a common plot technique ,one of an old hero teaming with a new hero who are linked together through a incident of the past to get their revenge on those who have oppressed them, whilst in the process discovering new strengths and skills that will shape the new world, THE MASK OF ZORRO is a handsomely mounted film. Catherine Zeta-Jones was at her best as Elena in this film and Anthony Hopkins continues to age well as the older Zorro. Ultimately, this is Antonio Banderas' film. Having watched the DVD supplement showing him do some of the leaps and swordplay, I am even more impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply the best action film of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As stated in the above lead, Mask of Zorro is the very best adventure film in the past ten years. A glorious throwback to a time when adventure films actually had complicated but logical stories, rich, multi-layered characters who could surprise us, and action scenes aplenty, but only when the story called for them. When action scenes involved real stuntmen doing incredible, but plausible feats of derring-do. When swashbuckling showcased glorious swordplay and footwork, shot in wide, long takes. When real actors created real characters, never assuming that the action genre allows dumbing down the basics.You can read the plot synopsis elsewhere, but know only that this is perhaps the finest superhero film ever made. It's nice and long (130 minutes), so it can have lots of action while still having plenty of time for character development and plot mechanics. It's filled with rich, multilayered heroes and villains and top-notch acting that never condescends (this is the rare film where Antonio Bandaras is allowed to relieve his comic roots and Anthony Hopkins doesn't thumb his nose at the material). The James Horner score is lush, rising, and (for him) surprisingly original. The plot makes an incredible amount of sense, and the obligitory "evil scheme" is actually quite ingenious.More than any action film in recent memory, everything just works. This one deserves comparison with Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Adventures of Robin Hood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm obviously a bit of an old misery, but I thought this film was terrible. I had set out to enjoy it as well, but it was completely ruined for my by the fact that I had just watched the most recent version of Feval's 'Le Bossu', which is wonderful. In the matter of breathtaking swordfights, dashing heroes, creepy villains and treacherous plotters, Le Bossu is one of the best films of the 1990s - and it shows the roughly contemporary Mask of Zorro as the sorry, overblown mess that it is.Which is not to say that I dare dis El Banderas. He's an excellent choice, and has the necessary roguish charisma for the role. I don't particularly mind the plot. I do mind that Catherine Zeta Jones gets another chance to bask in her over-rated glory. Truly, this is a woman with the body of a film-star and the talent of a TV presenter.I also mind that, presumably, at an early stage of the production the director looked around the set and said "Hmmm... what's missing. I know. Bring out the Hopkins', and sent his lacky to unlock the trunk where they keep the Welsh Windbag until the call of some underwritten star-part stirs him from his sleep. Unless somebody has plans to produce Ivor The Engine: The Movie anytime soon I would severely recommend they keep that trunk locked for the time being.You know what else I minded? That crazy prospector guy, who looked like he'd stepped out of a Wild West computer game or some theme park ride - though this is very much in keeping with the tone of the rest of the film, to be fair.This film has lots of loud noise and explosions, is quite over-the-top, and is all the poorer for it. Something of a missed opportunity, really.</fullReview>

Well, The Mask of Zorro tells: A really nice romance story with great actors and brilliant dialogues.First, the actors: Again, Anthony Hopkins is giving a great performance as Don Diego de la Vega, but is doing a lot better in the funny dialogues than as in action. (You just have to love the scene in the cave where the old Hopkins is teaching the young Banderas how to become Zorro the hard way, while he self is smoking cigars) Also Catherine Zeta-Jones is as the daughter of Don Diego de la Vega doing well; she don't only got the looks, but is giving a great performance as well. Antonio Banderas is as Alejandro Murrieta surprising good and is doing quite better with the mask than Anthony Hopkins. Stuart Wilson is doing good as the bad guy and only Matt Letscher is a little bit weird as Captain Harrison Love.Secondly, the connection between the actors is just great. You just feel the chemistry: between Zeta-Jones and Banderas, what makes it a great romance; between Hopkins and Wilson, what makes you really feel the hate; between Banderas and Wilson, what also makes you feel the hate from Banderas side and the contempt from Wilson's side; and between Banderas and Hopkins, what makes you feel the nice friendship, especially at the end.All by all, you got a cigar smoking and great Hopkins as the retired Zorro, a good Banderas as the new Zorro, a beautiful Zeta-Jones (who can also act!) as Elena, respectable bad guys and a really great chemistry. Plus beautiful music, nice locations and a touching ending. And when all the positive things swallow the a bit disappointing action, then I just have to give it a nice 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun, but coulda been more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all, i had such high hopes for this film that anything short of a classic would have been a let-down. antonio banderas' swashbuckling spaniard could do no less than trump harrison ford's whip wielding archiologist. we're talking childhood-influincing, national-icon producing expectations. so of course this movie couldn't live up to that kind of pressure, and neither could banderas.as blockbusters go, this one could have been more blockbustery. sure, lots of fun with swords, horses, playfully corny machismo, and lovely ladies. zeta-jones... wow. to say she made the movie would be an understatement. but the plot could have been bigger, the badguys badder, the danger more dangerous. banderas was smooth, but didn't seem loose enough. hopkins was steady as always, but was probably miscast. the whole film felt like it was missing something. like they forgot the chocolate sprinkles. nevertheless, the mask of zorro is a fun ride &amp; one worth taking. oh and did i mention catherine zeta-jones...?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare that I find a movie that I would want to watch several times. Jurassic Park is one of those few movies. I recently rented "the Mask of Zorro" and it was a great movie. It had action, comedy, romance, great acting, simply the whole package. All the actors were great which is the real strength of the movie, there's a lot of chemistry. The action scenes are very well made, and they are not only "sword battles", there's been a lot of work put in the action scenes. The setting is great, it's a very visual movie. I recommend it to everyone, this movie is a rare combination of pop corn entertaining movie &amp; great acting/quality work. Check it out, I know I'll be seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!What i dont get about this movie is how come Diego dela Vega and his apprentice A.Murrieta are presented as saviors of the people . Both of them pursuit revenge and the only reason why they seem to get involved in the events is their personal vendettas, whereas the villain of the movie Rafael Montero has such a broader vision in contrast with the two zorros pursuing to buy his way for the formation of an independent California. He may not seem so democratic and liberal as regards to his employment policy but can someone say his methods were so harsh compared with many of the formers of modern states. His objective was to form an autonomous independent state where the people who had been despised by Americans, Mexicans and the Spanish Dons could identify themselves as Californians.Don Rafael intended to give the people not only a distinct identity free from all the stipulations and oppressions of the colonialist powers but also the opportunity to obtain a new political status in the form of Californian citizenship. The two zorros try by all means to prevent this scheme from taking place while they do not even think about an alternative plan for the future of the villagers. Thats a bit self-centered attitude taking into account that during the whole movie we are left to witness the poverty and misery these people are experiencing yet we do not feel that De la vega and Murietta do even care about the faith of them. The only thing they are after is to make Don Rafael and his henchman Captain Love pay for their evil acts.So at the end of the movie when our heroes are done with the villains, their achievement seems so insignificant. I myself had sympathized with Don Montero notwithstanding the filmmakers' efforts of justifying his wickedness by portraying his henchman as a super-evil in Northern Cavalier Uniforms. He may be a pure machiavellian but at least he is a man who can step back and look at the big picture. When you think about the period when the events take place, Don Montero was in the brink of changing history but thanks to our zorros he never made it. The world would be a totally different place should an Independent Californian Republic was formed.But instead Zorro and his new wife lived happily ever after with their new born child!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I DID NOT want to see this film. My mother literally DRAGGED me to see it with her (she loved the old TV show). I sat in the theater frowning cursing my luck. I mean, Antonio Banderas is hot, but really...ZORRO?! I'd say about...15 minutes later (including previews mind you), I was sitting like an idiot with this frozen smile on my face, that just said "WOW!" I'm not going to bother wasting time explaining the plot, I'm here for praise only. Not only were the special effects great; how long's it been since a really good sword fight scene in movies? Or stunts on horses? Too long! The chemistry between Antonio Banderas &amp; Catherine Zeta-Jones leapt off of the screen, and you really believed they were madly in love. That dance scene, their first fly-by-night encounter, the sword fight in the barn; HOT HOT HOT. With her first American hit, CZJ instantly became my new favorite actress, and has been ever since. I could go on forever about this film, the good-the bad-the ugly...rather the good-the great-the excellent. But I won't; I'll leave with one final thought; THIS MOVIE MADE THE SUMMER OF '98! After my mother literally DRAGGING me in, she also literally had to DRAG me out! I didn't leave until all the credits were over, as well as the beautiful love song by Marc Anthony &amp; Tina Arena which totally encompassed every aspect of emotion in the entire movie, as well as the relationship between Diego &amp; Elena. That's right folks, even the soundtrack rocked! SO, that's it, if you haven't seen this movie, shame on you, you should be ashamed, you...have to see it! GO! NOW! Drop everything! Stop reading this...and go buy this film!One last thought for already huge fans: there's a sequel on the way!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Mask of Zorro" is one of the best adventures films I've ever seen, period. It's a first class production straight down the line. Banderas, Zeta-Jones, Hopkins, and the underrated Stuart Wilson all perform their roles admirably. Martin Campbell's direction is crisp. James Horner's score enhances the action rather than overwhelming it. And the sword fighting action is as good as you'll ever see in a non-martial arts film. (Bob Anderson was the sword master on this production. Every movie he's worked on that I've seen has featured terrific swordplay action. "The Mask of Zorro" is no exception.)Even though this film was largely ignored at the box office, "The Mask of Zorro" remains a favorite of mine. If I went off to a desert island and could only take a few videos with me, this would definitely be one of them.</fullReview>

I is highly recommendable if you want a couple of hours in fantasyland.I watched them all back then, Hopalong Cassidy - Tarzan - Tom Mix - and off course Zorro and this one completes the circle in the nicest way.

		<fullReview>I havent enjoyed myself so much since the days when Errol Flynn was swashing his buckles all over the screen. As a dyed in the wool movie buff all my life I appreciate all genres of film but have always been a sucker for good rollicking, to hell with history and common sense let's have fun stories, and Zorro was one of them. Oh I saw Tyrone Power duelling with Basil Rathbone, and George Hamilton being a gay Zorro and they were all entertaining, but this Zorro has it in spades. I know it wasn't Anthony Hopkins doing the acrobatic bits (and he had a great stunt double) but in the early scenes I thought I was watching Douglas Fairbanks Snr for all the fun of his performance. He even resembled Fairbanks, making it quite obvious that after all the heavy uptight roles and serious acting he was enjoying every minute. Antonio Banderas made a perfect partner as the novice Zorro and showed a great flair for comedy and action. The pairing was made more enjoyable since the actors obviously had a rapport which showed in their scenes together. It always enhances a film when the actors obviously like each other. I was fortunate enough to have a ticket for the Royal Premiere of the film so I saw both Banderas and Zeta Jones in person (Hopkins alas was filming Titus in Rome and was absent) and can confirm that Catherine really is as beautiful as she looks on screen. A real knockout beauty in every way. Stuart Wilson twirled his moustachios with great gusto and Matt Letscher was a hissable baddie who got what he deserved. Lovely colour,lots of action and a really explosive finale. What more could you want ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's successful invasion of swashbuckler-and-damsels territory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today's audiences truly enjoyed TriStar Pictures/Dreamworks Pictures' THE MASK OF ZORRO: beautiful maiden, cliffhanger sword-fights, exciting horseback chases and a suave ruthless villain. Though some say Banderas cannot hold a candle to the former screen Zorros (Douglas Fairbanks, John Carroll, Tyrone Power, Frank Latimore), he is much much better than French star Alain Delon and makes the role his own with modern charm and proper sensuality (as seen in the wonderful tango with Catherine Zeta-Jones). The script, by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio and Randall Jahnson, is smooth, talky and entertaining, with a nice ending. Beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones is hard to resist, and the subtle and dignified performance of Anthony Hopkins lends some gravitas to a prominently Latin cast. The ham here is Stuart Wilson, splendidly nasty and chilling. I liked the way the movie starts with flashbacks, with Banderas and Zeta-Jones lulling their baby to sleep with the story of the legendary Zorro. The best scenes include Banderas' training under Hopkins, the well-choreographed tango scene, and the climax set in the gold mines. I hope Steven Spielberg decides to make a sequel with both Banderas and Zeta-Jones, for he surely found a gold mine in reviving a movie hero like Zorro. Enough with dinosaur movies for now, focus on Zorro!</fullReview>

The Mask of Zorro was a fine combination of all of them. The two Zorros play well off each other and for once we get a female protagonist, Elena (Zeta-Jones) who doesn't need rescuing. She can take care of herself. The plot is straight-forward. Great popcorn flick and it ranks up there with The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn. Not one of the best films of all time but one of the most fun.4/4 stars, 10 on the IMDB scale and an A on my own scale.Toodles, A.J.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply great!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!Once in a while, you see a movie that you cannot help loving. For me, that movie has got to be "The Mask of Zorro". It has loads of action, and great performances by all five of the main actors. First, the three heroes: Anthony Hopkins delivers a truly excellent and moving performance, as usual. Just about anyone watching the movie can't help sympathizing with his character. Antonio Banderas is also quite good, and Catherine Zeta-Jones gets her acting career off to a great start with her portrayal of Elena. She and Antonio have very good chemistry together, which is particularly shown in the scene when they dance, and during their breathtaking swordfight. Now, for the two villains: The closest thing to a problem I have with this movie is that even though Stuart Wilson plays Don Montero quite well, there are a few scenes where he appears to be kind of soft for the main antagonist. His character in "Lethal Weapon 3" was a ruthless, heartless villain. If Stuart Wilson had made Montero more like that, this movie would be perfect. However, this small problem with one of the two villains is more than made up for with the other villain, Matt Letscher, as Captain Love, the sadistic, clearly insane cavalry officer with whom Antonio's character has a serious axe to grind. Letscher delivers every aspect of his character with as much casual cruelty as possible, and succeeds perfectly. I still get shivers down my spine when I hear the chilling yell that he utters as he jumps at Alejanduro in the film's climax, right before he meets his well-deserved end. Most of this movie is fun for the whole family, but the scene in which Captain Love speaks to Alejanduro in private at the hacienda is a gruesome exception to this. This scene was, I believe, mainly intended to show how completely bonkers the Captain really is, but it would be a good idea to take the younger children out of the room during this scene. Still, the movie has a moral to it: Never take your loved ones for granted, because you never know how much longer they'll be with you. "The Mask of Zorro" is a wonderful movie for just about anyone, and I recommend it to all of you who enjoy action, drama, or just like watching great movies.</fullReview>

I think it's better for Steven not to meddle with someone else's film, but saying that, the opening is very good.The sword-fighting is excellent, capturing a lot of the Errol Flynn magic. Some terrific stunts, obviously, Martin Campbell learnt a lot on Goldeneye!The screenplay needed beefing up, especially during the training of Zorro, this part was very weak. It all seemed a bit too hurried. The Spanish setting in Mexico seemed a bit too American, it seemed very small. I found the climax to be predictable but still, rather enjoyable. The ending was disappointing, will there be a sequel?The performances are excellent, Banderas IS Zorro, perfect for the part. Catherine Zeta-Jones was good, but didn't use the entire acting spectrum. Anthony Hopkins was pretty good, he seemed to enjoy the role.The director did well, but I feel he didn't get into the characters enough, didn't add the flesh to their performances, especially Zeta-Jones.The photography wasn't bad, a bit too soft and lacked some colour.The score by James Horner is one of his better efforts in recent years.Overall, good fun but required a beefy screenplay and more accurate settings and history.

And it was so refreshing and wonderful to see a woman in her position from her time wielding a sword with such grace and efficiency. The sword play between her and A. Banderas and their wonderful dance are definitely my favorite parts of this movie. I liked how they made A. Banderas the "new" Zorro. It was like the film makers were acknowledging that this was a new Zorro for a new era and were not trying in anyway to change or improve the older (most popularly Disney) Zorro. A.

Instead, I saw a Zorro movie that was dazzling and swashbuckling and adventurous, a movie that swept me away. Anthony Hopkins was great, Antonio Banderas was energetic, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was gorgeous. Granted, it was a little slow in spots, but the total experience was magic. Overall, "Mask of Zorro" is nearly the perfect Zorro movie, even surpassing the great "Mark of Zorro."I wonder when the sequel comes out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a Zorro fan. When this movie came out, I went to see it 3 times in the theater by myself, I didn't care if I was alone, because the movie was so great! My favorite movie to date. Antonio Banderas is the ultimate Zorro. Anthony Hopkins is the ultimate teacher, and Catherine-Zeta Jones, the ultimate babe! Great fights, great story, great movie, the best! Where is the sequel?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a rare gem. In this day of modern action movies where city blocks are blown up and gun battles last forever, it's good to see an action movie with some class. In this movie you see the mythical hero Zorro take on the most evil villains. This movie is well acted, well written and well directed.  One of the best elements in the film is how the older Zorro trains a new Zorro. I only see training sessions like this in Kung Fu movies. The sword fighting scenes are nicely put together. The ending sequence is very good. The villains get just what they deserve in spades. Hollywood should make more movies like this.Rayvyn</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good old fashioned movie in the Hollywood swashbuckler style. Anthony Hopkins certainly gives Antonio Banderas a run for his money in the sexy stakes, despite the age difference. Catherine Zeta Jones manages to be a heroine without being annoying or the pathetic woman that always falls over during the chase and has to be picked up...you know the type. This movie has everything, adventure, romance and comedy. I thoroughly recommend it for a family evening in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! Why can't they make more like it any more- makes you wonder, doesn't it. This is the way they used to be; great stunts, great fights, and great fun. If you want a film that's both exciting and enjoyable for the whole family, look no further than this gem. Lovers of the old swashbuckling classics will go for this too. It brings to mind the good old days of Errol Flynn, performing death-defying leaps, sword in hand, as he battles the evil villain. OK, so it's predictable, and it's not the sort of thing that would happen- but who cares, it still manages to be exciting and a real entertainer. And, whatever people say, the fights are some of the best in movie history, second only perhaps to the duel between Stewart Granger and James Mason in the 50's version of the 'Prisoner of Zenda'. The climax is a great spectacle, with brilliant specail effects. I'm even going to go as far to say that it's even better than 'The Mark of Zorro' with Tyronne Power- for one thing, the lush colour helps, and for another it bosts greater action. You can see that this is made for cinema- I, unfortunately, didn't get to see it there, but it just comes out of the TV screen at you. Imagine how great it would be in Virtual Reality- WOW! I can't begin to! See this now- miss it and you miss out on one of the best films you'll see, a great, lighthearted, action-packed adventure from start to finish! RATING: I give this movie 10/10- there could be no other mark. Great stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently purchased this movie and decided to watch it again yesterday and was once again hit with realisation that this movie, even though it is lacking in special effects and gimmicks, is excellent. What this movie lacks in S/FX it makes up for with daredevil stunts, sword fights and subtle humor. It doesnt need CGI or the like to capture your attention. What captures your atention is the romance, the action, and the mystery that is the legend of Zorro. The casting also is brilliant. Sir Anthony Hopkins makes for a good choice as the original Zorro and Antonio Banderas is dashing and brave as his protege. Of course what movie would be complete with a sexy heroine and this part is filled to a T by Catherine Zeta Jones, who proves theres more to a heroine than just screaming and fainting. Overall this is a good family movie and is sure to please any disconcerning viewer, young or old. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Zorro film ever, and the best adventure film of 1998. The only other Zorro that comes close is Tyronne Power in 1940 The Mark of Zorro. Everyone in it is spot on - Banderas is Zorro (as, strangely enough is Hopkins). Catherine Zeta-Jones is a movie star of the first magnitude - right up there with the glamour stars of the 30's, 40's and 50's.This is a great movie - soundtrack, comedy, drama - it has it all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best adventure serial since "Raiders of the Lost Ark"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do I hear the cry of "heresy!" as a reaction to the above title? Believe me when I say that I wholeheartedly mean it. "Raiders" was the first film that I thought of when I left the theater the night I saw it. No hi-tech gimmicks, no overwhelming weaponry, just good old-fashioned period action and a self-aware wit that takes nothing away from the story. That's what both "Raiders" and "Mask of Zorro" deliver in spades.It's not without flaws (no movie is, despite what some may tell you); there are some rather dull stretchs of dead time sprinkled here and there throughout the film. But when the action delivers (sometimes rather unexpectedly), it more than compensates. Watching the inspired lunacy of the barracks fight between Alejandro and the guards is indication enough to tell you not to take things TOO seriously, but there's enough edge-of-your-seat action in the finale to let you know that the film was not made as just one big joke. If anything, it brings to mind the films of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. (cinema's first Zorro) and Errol Flynn (particularly "Captain Blood" and "The Adventures of Robin Hood"), still as entertaining as when they first came out. Why? Because it's about the oldest story in all mythology, the good guys vs. the bad guys. When it's done right, that old tale can exert a powerful pull.As to the film's Big Three (Antonio Banderas, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones), they form the heart and soul of the film. Hopkins (no suprise) is the best, as the original Zorro, still spry enough to give a drunken Alejandro a beating and thirsting for revenge. One may say that this is well below his usual efforts, but Sir Anthony on his worst day is still a lot better than most actors on their best. Antonio Banderas is perhaps the one who seems to have the most fun. He's comically overconfident throughout, leading to some of the film's best laughs. Still, he's dashing enough and tough enough in the right places to keep my respect of him. The divine Catherine Zeta-Jones embodies the concept of "smouldering woman" better than any other actress since Lauren Bacall. Unlike a lot of her cinematic predecessors, she does more than just play victim, pulling off rescues and keeping Senor Zorro himself en garde in the risque' barn fight (which is a nice follow-up to the highly charged dance number earlier). As a result, she's as much an equal partner in this film as Zorro Sr. and Jr.While I'm busy giving out credit, I'd like to also mention an underacknowledged player in this film: director Martin Campbell. The man who resurrected James Bond in "Goldeneye", this successor of Michael Curtiz deserves just as much acclaim as virtually anyone else involved for his fine pacing, deft touch, and excellently orchestrated action and comedy. It's been good to see him work his same magic on the big Z.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mask Of Zorro was not only a huge surprise to me, it was also a huge surprise to everyone. The humour that Antonia Banderas adds to the picture is outstanding. Anthony Hopkins too, is incredible as the older Zorro. Catherine Zeta Jones shines as the love interest of Banderas and Stuart Wilson is great as the enemy of Hopkins. There fight scenes are impressive. The dialogue is sharp and executed well. Zeta Jones adds the same sexiness, she did to Entrapment. Not only do the actors and actresses perform their parts to extreme realism, they also look the parts. There is hardly any faults, so its hard to see how anyone can dislike The Mask Of Zorro as it appeals to the whole family. Rating=4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro may never win any Oscars and I'll never pretend that perhaps it deserved to but it is a wonderfully engaging and entertaining film. Some doubts may be cast about employing 2 welsh actors (Hopkins and Zeta-Jones) to fill the roles of Mexicans but the odd wavering accent, they carry it off with an air of believability. What is such a joy to behold in this film is the chemistry between the 3 leads. Catherine Zeta-Jones would seem to be heading for a huge career. She has the looks and screen presence of a 1950s star. Both her and Anthony Hopkins gel well with Banderas who is in his element here. The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and the fight scenes wonderfully choreographed. Yes it's corny and predictable but it's grade A entertainment none the less. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Age: 13Zorro, aka Diego de la Vega, played by Anthony Hopkins, was a man who fought for the freedom of the people of his country. His enemy, Montero, played by Stuart Wilson, captured him, murdered his wife (accidentally), took his daughter to raise as his own and Zorro was in prison for 20 years. Then he escaped, with a score to settle. Alejandro Murrieta, played by Antonio Banderas, also has a score to settle when his brother is murdered by Captain Love, played by Matthew Letscher. The old Zorro teaches Alejandro how to fight so that he can settle his score for himself and become a new Zorro. Together they must defeat Montero and his plans for California.With a very impressive story, this film manages to have some great action without being excessively gory. It also has a fantastic blend of swordfighting action, comedy, and romance. The acting from Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones in particular are very good, but the other main actors are quite good also. With a great ending to a great film, "The Mask of Zorro" is well worth seeing.Australian Classification: M 15+: Low Level ViolenceRating: 81 out of 100</fullReview>

But it was bad, bad, bad. Really dumb plot, dumb dialog, combined with overdone humor, big movie explosions, slapstick antics. Oh boy. It's kinda like the producers of this movie decided to mix "The Mark of Zorro", "Highlander", and "Lethal Weapon" together. Then when that mix didn't quite work out, they dumbed it down, and turned it into a bad parody of "The Mark of Zorro".I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone over the age of ten.

		<fullReview>THE MASK OF ZORRO ( rating, * * * * out of 5 )Writers John Eskow, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, and director Martin Campbell, effervescently bring this delectable interpretation of the celebrated character created by Johnston McCulley to the screen.This is a romantic adventure of love and nobleness set against Mexico's fight for independence. Zorro, the courageous and chivalrous swordsman defends the weak and oppressed while seducing beautiful women. (good work if you can get it)Antonio Banderas is terrific as the legendary swashbuckler - dashing in all departments and according to my wife, a real horn-bag. Anthony Hopkins brings credibility and refinement to the character of Don Diego de la Vega (what a cool name), and Catherine Zeta-Jones is absolutely exquisite in all her nubile glory.The film makers successfully blend all the ingredients for an action/adventure movie where nothing is taken too seriously but everything is to be delighted in. This is a wonderful romp where love, romance, swordplay and duty combine to create a visual feast.Trying to be critical with this movie really is a pointless exercise because by the time the first sword-fight explodes across the screen, nobody with a sense of humor will care. Sometimes it's good to forget about plot and narrative just so you can revel in the delight of enjoying yourself.'The Mask of Zorro' succeeds in this department spectacularly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, (except for when my wife was making lascivious comments about Antonio Banderas) and for the first time in awhile, I didn't feel the need to make scathing and or slanderous remarks about Hollywood. For that reason alone, this film well and truly deserves its four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro truly came out of the gate last year as one its finest, if not finest, films. In a summer of overplayed special-effect monstrosities such as Armageddon, Deep Impact, and the dreadful Godzilla, The Mask of Zorro was a pleasant and exciting surprise.The movie features incredible performances by Anthony Hopkins, as the elderly, retired Don Diego de la Vega, Antonio Banderas as his Fox-In-Training Allejandro Murrieta, and the exquisite Catherine Zeta-Jones as de la Vega's daughter, Elena. The stuntwork, swordplay, and horsemanship are all top notch, and reminicient of the original silver screen Zorro, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.Explosions and death are kept to a minimum, so this is a film the family can enjoy together. Most importantly, The Mask of Zorro shows the kind of respect and reverence in which McCulley's The Fox deserves. Hopefully, this will not be the last we see of Zorro in this medium, and perhaps, the creative team behind this great movie will step up to the task again.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, perhaps a bit too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most entertaining movie I've seen in a long time. Notice I said "most entertaining," not "best." It is a bit too long (the senators arguing over the table really get boring after a while) and a couple of the battle scenes are a bit drawn-out, but the acting is uniformly good, even great in some scenes, and the dialogue is almost always witty and keeps your attention. Antonio Banderas is made for his role as the successor to Zorro; he is witty, looks the part and handles the action scenes well. Catherine Zeta-Jones is great as well, especially in her scenes with Antonio. She looks the part (who would've guessed she's Welsh?) and her fencing scene with 'Zorro' is thoroughly enjoyable. As is the scene in the confession booth (hilarious; see the 'memorable quotes' section). Anthony Hopkins is not the actor who would immediately come to mind for the part of Zorro (anyone else notice that he keeps getting distinctly non-British roles? Hitler, Picasso, Nixon, Zorro . . . anyway) but, as usual, he is great and subtly steals every scene he's in. My favorite scenes in the entire movie would have to be the sequences in which he trains Antonio (trivia note: in one scene Hopkins *actually* snaps the wicks off several lighted candles. He had fun with the whip, apparently). The soundtrack is wonderful and really adds to the action. The villains are well-acted and thoroughly hate-worthy. All in all, the movie is thrilling and frequently beautiful,visually. Some battle scenes are too long, but others are great. The dancing scenes are also well-done. Very entertaining -- the critics were mostly too hard on this movie.</fullReview>

Hopkins, accent aside, is classy as the world-weary Zorro in search of a replacement and Catherine Zeta Jones looks and sounds suitably Latin as well as being suitably stunningly attractive and pretty good with a sword! The action is slick and timed perfectly but as director Martin Campbell is best known for his work on the Bond Film GOLDENEYE, that is really no surprise.The stunt work is excellent and very much in the classic Fairbanks-Flynn mould, particularly the horse-chase sequence which is straight out of pre-war Hollywood. Sets look good and the final explosive gold mine scenes are a match for TERMINATOR 2s apartment block-demolishing sequence. All in all the sort of film that in future years one can sit through comfortably at the christmas holidays without fore knowledge of the ending spoiling the whole thing. Great Fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a while it's nice to see an action movie with great stunts and sword play instead of the usual 20 minute gun play scenes in the other films get a bit boring after a while (not that all films are like that but most are). Unlike your typical remake this movie changes the story quite a bit and makes it very interesting plot :Don Diego de la Vega the original Zorro and protector of the Mexican peasants finally drives Don Rafael Montero back to Spain but before living he loses his wife and child and identity and then gets locked up. When he finally breaks out he trains a new Zorro, Alejandro Murrieta, and they go save the Mexican peasants again againest Don Rafael Montero and Captain Love. The stunts in this movie are great, and I find that this is one these movies you can watch over and over again, it was that exciting. What I don't understand is why everyone thinks this movie had a lot of over kill. Sure the movie was pretty darn long (136 min.) but it didn't bug me.

		<shortDescription>The best film in forty years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. It is one of the few modern films that cuts back on the special effects and relies more on acting. Anthony Hopkins is at this very best in the film: he is very convincing as Zorro (although I think the make-up was overdone at the beginning of the film) and the film has a refreshingly inventive script. Antonio Bandaras is even better than in Evita, and I thought the dialogue exchanges between Hopkins and he were quite first rate. I have only given two films 10/10 on the voting section. The other was North by Northwest...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Biggest Adventure of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro is a big, hilarious, overblown (in a good way) Action/Adventure that I have watched a dozen times and I never get bored with it, it is only because I have the excellent DVD. And the DVD format is the only way to watch it in because it gives you the total experience, I have also watched it in the video format but felt that it deprived me of the movie as a whole and Zorro is too good for that. Well it is not entirely perfect it does have some bad elements, it is at times cheesy (only in some minor places).The enemies are too one-dimensional and should have been explored more but somehow they seem powerful in a way, however Banderas, Hopkins and Zeta-Jones´ characters are more thought-out and show that they are still human beings with real emotions. Martin Campbell who directed GoldenEye, made The Mask of Zorro in a Bond-esque style and the same dashing scale. It gets better and better every minute and finishes off in a gallant and explosive conclusion that only a former James Bond-director can pull off. I recommend you to buy the DVD if you have a player, if you don´t you should consider buying a DVD player and the Zorro DVD.I give this a JJJJ of JJJJJ because Zorro is the Adventure you shouldn´t miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What GREAT Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since seeing Errol Flynn in The Sea Hawk and the Adventures of Robin Hood have I had such fun with simple, escapist fare! Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as the elder statesmen of 19th century super-heroes and Antonio Banderas as the hero-in-training, with Catherine Zeta-Jones as the not-so-compliant (as well as skilled with a blade!) eye-catcher that she is. It's good guys vs. bad guys, both well-defined, but never does the fare get tiresome or boring.A particular delight is Banderas as the dandified Don, upstaging the senior Don's at their own game, with the present of the rose and on the dance floor with Catherine. Action, humor, romance ... What else could you ask for! SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love movies like this. It's what movies were and what they should be more often. It's funny, the swordfights are exciting, the actors are perfect and the dancing is awesome. Antonio Bandares is great whether he's an outlaw, a Zorro-in-training, a fancy Don or Zorro. Him and Anthony Hopkins are great together, they look like they're having fun. Yes, I admit Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful, but it's an annoying kind of beautiful. Hard to explain. Captin Love, yeek, I couldn't get over how he reminded me of Custard in a movie I saw. The dancing scene is one of the best, but some scenes are a little over-dramatic and sappy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent. Sparkling humour throughout the movie. I can't see why the critics hated it. Anthony Hopkins as the original Zorro - driven by his need for his daughter to know him - is superb. Antonio Banderas always seems to know how to have fun, his character is less driven than in Desperado but still fuelled by revenge. Catherine Zeta Jones is wonderful; sensual and (sometimes) in control.Overall, the best movie I have seen in a long time. Can't wait for it to come out on satellite, then I can watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoying, honest. In the hollywoodian tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the most honest Hollywood sent us since many time. There is a good screenplay who doesn't take us as fools and does not want to make us think that the new Zorro is better than the older, we see that Zorro is a human being, not a superhero like superman or Bruce Willis. The actors are simply great, Anthony Hopkins remembers Guy Williams, the actor of the serial when we were little children, Antonio Banderas is playing Zorro, we see that in his eye, under his mask, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is more than beautiful, she's perfect. That's simply enjoying, in the old hollywoodian tradition, when ther were still more than 3 good directors, when special effects were not a pretext to make movies. Martin Campbell is a good director and we can be amazed that he does not direct movies like that more often. Hollywood is still able to enjoy us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't get much better than this! A totally fresh angle to Zorro, while maintaining its heritage. Casting Anthony Hopkins as Zorro was brilliant, and ditto Antonio Banderas. Then when one thought it couldn't get any better, the movie presented a new superstar onto the screen via Catherine-Zeta-Jones.The chemistry between Hopkins-Banderas, was absolutely on target as was the chemistry between Zeta-Jones and her two leading men.This has to be the biggest Swashbuckling Adventure Movie of all times. The only ingredients not preserved from the earlier Zorro movies were the humorous bits between the swishy Don Diego de la Vega and his father and while Antonio Banderas tried his best to give Don Diego a limp wrist, Antonio never really nailed that down.But the rest of the movie was a 10 all the way. Great humor, action shots, on location authenticity and much more placed The Mask of Zorro as one of the top three great action movies of the nineties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is an awesome movie, stunning special affects, great swordplay. Great story, surprising for a modern video really. Bad Guys COuld have been better, they appeared a bit too weak. I also thought Zeta-Jones could have been in a couple more fighting scenes to show she wasn't a wimp (the one swordfighting scene she was in made her appear to be not a very good sword fighter and afraid to stab Banderas). Banderas shines as Zorro, although it could have used a couple more of his scenes as a noble man. It would have been great to see him have to fight Capt. Love in one of his appearances as a noble man, trying to fight bad, when he could really turn it on but not get wounded. All in all awesome movie, the best I have seen for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commercial, but full of irresistible touches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this not with great enthusiasm, but to have something safe to watch with the kiddies--and wound up enjoying it. It is, on balance, every bit as good as the classic Zorro films, notably the 1920 and 1940 versions of "The Mark of Zorro." While the earlier films have their superior aspects (Douglas Fairbanks' stunt work in 1920 is still the best and the Tyrone Power/Basil Rathbone climactic duel in the 1940 film is still unsurpassed), this one adds the right amount of color, dash, eroticism, and genuinely funny verbal and slapstick humor to keep the more melodramatic aspects of the story palatable. In addition, there's a real feel for the West that gives the film the occasional look of a 1960s Clint Eastwood Western. The presence of L.Q. Jones in an important character part reinforces that feeling. Only in the final showdown did I think the film was piling it on too thick. Oddly, it reminded me of the end of "Star Trek Generations." Between the wit, well choreographed swordplay, and a charming and sexy pseudo-tango scene, this candy bar really satisfies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Swashbuckler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie after seeing the hype and thought it would be worth a watch. I was surprised by several things. One Hopkins can really act. I've enjoyed his performances in the past and he brings so much to a movie that a lot of little imperfections (like historical facts) can be overlooked. I was surprised also by the sword play in this movie. It was magnificent. As a kid I used to watch the old pirate and musketeer type movies and loved the sword fighting. This was equal to any of the old masterpieces. Lastly I was blown away by Catherine Zeta-Jones. I had only briefly seen her in the past and I thought she did a great job. Banderas did a great job as well but he just has too much macho bs in him for me. Overall I rated it a 7 and worth a look see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am almost 16, I saw one re-run of Zorro when I was about five, so, taking that into consideration, I did not know much on the story. The thing that most attracted me were the three amazing leads. Hopkins, Bandaras, and Zeta-Jones rock the screen just as good as that awesome explosion at the end. That summer I had also seen Armageddon, I thought those explosions were interesting (no, I am not an explosion freak), but from the sound of it, the Zorro bang was totally real. I loved this movie not only for the romance, but for the dancing, the music, the wonderful acting, the action, and the plot that totally worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Putting all the praises aside I would like to mention one thing that kept my eyes shining with admiration each time I saw the film: this is what they call chemistry. I never saw two people fit so naturally and unquestionably.Very often the casting of some Hollywood couples ("I love troubles", for example) makes me puzzle over how on Earth they can fall in love to each other. In the "Zorro" case I keep wondering how they managed not to off the set. Banderas and Zeta-Jones harmonize so perfectly well that you can never think of better alternative. And the whole movie would have been already worth shooting had there been only those three unforgettable scenes: the confession, the dance and the swordplay in the stables.</fullReview>

The fact that I am one of the people who will be lumped together with the decryers of "the state of film today" but it is a shambles. Having the Mask Of Zorro even in a competition where the threat of the obvious morons in the foreign press voting it the best picture of the year over something that takes obvious talent and not just a large studio and bucketfulls of money to make, hangs over its head is a large snot infused spit into the face of people who slave to make films with artistic integrity. Come on now, not everything has to be ponderous and artistically amazing, but at least nominate films on the lighter side that are on the good lighter side such as Shakespeare in Love or Bulworth. At least Beatty tried to make something with meaning beyond the box office or senseless tittilation.Thank you, I'll step down of the soapbox now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Points:- All of the actors (that counts actresses): excellent. I can't think of a bad performance among them.- The Action: Some sword fighting moves looked contrived, but many looked authentic and exciting, esp between Alejandro &amp; Diego (Hopkins) and Alejandro &amp; Elena.- The Plot: Well done. Not forced/contrived. Easy to follow.- The Writing: From the intimidating Z of fire, to the Captain's water jug, to Jedi-like training, to the civilized &amp; gentlemanly dialog (no foul language I can recall either), to a man's pain &amp; struggle to recover his family, to a great bad-guy-death scenario, to a legend-in-training and a horse that won't put up with his arrogance and how so many little things are linked together.- Highlights: ** Elena's subtle disappointment, in front of her "father", that Zorro "didn't do anything" to her and how "vigorous" he was. ** Elena's &amp; Alejandro's dancing! Spectacular! ** Alejandro's ins and outs of understanding and arrogance about actually being this legend in the flesh; here you really get a feel for what it's like through the eyes of a truly human "hero", or at least someone like you or I trying to become a hero, unlike Batman who does nothing so adoringly human. ** The "taming" of the horse. Enuff said. ** Elena's gradual and believable story arc of suspicion and ultimate realization about her true past. ** I'm a straight male, so it simply MUST be said: Elena is SOOOO HOT! WOW! There's no escaping it.- I'm sure there's more but it's late at night and I've only seen this once (but I plan on more!).Bad Points:- Hopkins doesn't look or sound the least bit Hispanic (but he's still great and it can be overlooked)- The Ending: Obviously predictable, but that's actually not the bad part. (Hey, you knew the Titanic would sink, even how it would sink from the beginning, and that didn't take away from the movie!) Elena could have cut the fuse, the ppl didn't look like they had enough time to get out, and everyone walking through the dust afterward was WAAAY too sappy &amp; over-dramatized.Still, see this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film! Good humoured, it used every cliche in the book, but did so very much tongue in cheek! In that respect, it reminded me of 'The Princess Bride', a swashbuckler that doesn't take itself too seriously - lots of humour! The three leads were excellent - the rapport and chemistry between all three (in the various combinations) was obvious - it looks like they had fun filming this! I wasn't so keen on the 'dance', but the sword fight between Elena and 'Zorro' was excellent. Kudos for Bandaras, for going from a nope-hope thief to a charming 'Don' most convincingly. It didn't overwhelm you with special effects - the stunts (done by REAL people. not computers!)were spectacular enough in their own right. When they release it on video over here, I'll be there to buy it. A real feel-good movie - you come out of the cinema with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zorro Girl And The Mexicans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zorro was always a lot of fun, in the same category as The Cisco Kid, Batman and Robin Hood. How could it have been otherwise with the name Zorro? Zorro, come on!! Zero?There was of course a serious undercurrent, Zorro after all was fighting on behalf of Mexican peasants against colonising Spanish, but what would that matter to the average viewer, then or now? We're used to ignoring the political ramifications of what we see. And Zorro, like Batman was really a rich man, sleeping blissfully between satin sheets in between his romantic, valorous episodes. Now that's the life, but it does bear thinking about.The Mask Of Zorro does play all of the right financial chords and should make lots of money for its producers. We even get two Z's for the price of one admission ticket and unlike normal mathematics, two zeros multiply very nicely indeed, especially when the two Zorros are two of the most dynamic and romantic actors in the business.Anthony Hopkins is the older Z. He opens the film, or at least his stunt double does, saving some peasants from the dastardly Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) who has set up a public execution in order to trap Zorro (big shades of Robin Hood and that nasty Sheriff of Nottingham there.)Z saves the day but Don Rafael susses him out and grabs the masked one, stealing his baby daughter out of spite. Z one escapes though of course.Enter Z no 2 (Antonio Banderas) , twenty years later when the daughter has become the beautiful Elena Montero (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Z one has trained Z two to be the new Zorro and as you have to expect, especially since Banderas and Zeta-Jones are just the screen types for this type of thing, they fall in love. They do the tango. They cut each others clothes with swords. They become politically aligned. If Z no 2 had had on a rubber suit, Zorro-Jones would have become Zorro Girl or something.All of this works rather well. Banderas is fantastic as Zorro with those self mocking Spanish tosses of the head and those dark lively eyes; mannerisms he by the way honed playing homosexual, or at least homo erotic characters in Pedro Almodovar's films.Catherine Zorro-Jones is beautiful of course, reminiscent of her wonderfully fetching character in Blue Juice. But perhaps it would have been even better, less bland, with a more Spanish looking actress.The stunts are fast and hard, the sword play is impressive and I especially enjoyed the horse stunts even if that section was short.The Mask Of Zorro is good entertainment, but I still wish that the Spanish hadn't done those nasty things to the Mexicans in the first place. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lucas/Spielberg/Ford say that a 4th Indiana Jones movie is on its way, before the stars (and directors) get too old to do it again.Take your time, guys; your thunder's been stolen.This iteration of the Zorro legend has it all--great chemistry, good acting, exciting chaces, and nail-biting swordplay. Yes, the plotting is a bit creaky and yes, the writing is shallow and yes, the resolution will surprise no-one. But I hope this launches a franchise ala the now-defunct "Batman" series or those from the chronicles of Dr. Jones and his intrepid crew.Banderas is terrific, he of the smoldering glances, the daring actobatics, the hot temper, and the passionate romancing. His portrayal of the title character leaves its forebears (Guy Williams and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) literally and figuratively in the dust.And Anthony Hopkins adds just enough ballast to the proceedings to make it all believable. Quiet, reserved, pony-tailed, and internalizing his grief and anger, he's the Obi Wan to Banderas' Luke.Catharine Za-Za-Zing Zeta-Jones is glorious. This damsel is quite able to get herself out of distress, thank you, and nary a hair will be out of place when she's finished, either."M of Z" has made my top ten for '98. Sure, it's a little threadbare, but it's also a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to the whole "Mask of Zorro" team for providing the perfect entertainment package. Action, romance, humour and a great set in which to host the event. Good to see a '90s movie holding true to a fifties TV style authentic western feel. What a great transition from 'OLD small TV screen' to the big screen. Possibly the best remake of an old idea seen in the last five years. It stands head and shoulders above the likes of Phantom and The Saint. Can they do likewise with 'The Lone Ranger"? I don't recall a swear word in the script... am I disappointed to miss it... NOT! Good to rely on Kiwi Directorship. A great night out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Dumb Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite movies of the year (so much so that I had it on my Christmas list so I could watch it as much as I want!). I loved the movie for the following reasons:1. Anthony Hopkins -- I would love him in anything, even a dog of a movie.2. Antonio Banderas -- (need I say more, ladies?)3. Fun, witty dialog that had me laughing out loud.4. Great, unbelievable, over-the-top fight scenes (even if there were too many of them).5. Lots of physical, slapstick comedy -- especially when Alejandro was trying to steal the horse!6. Catherine Zeta-Jones -- a beautiful and talented actress who can play comedy AND drama quite well.7. Great camera shots -- loved the giant fiery "Z" on the hillside as a distraction, for example.8. The chemistry between Antonio and Catherine -- talk about hot! Especially the dance scene and the fight scene.All in all it was a fun escape from reality where I didn't have to think very hard and could just laugh and enjoy myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film with great cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mask of Zorro was the biggest surprise actioner for me this year for 3 reasons.1. Old fashioned swashbucklers have become out of style. 2. Antonio Banderas, while good looking, is not a proven action lead actor. 3. Anthony Hopkins as Zorro?The movie moves at a brisk pace and Banderas and Hopkins are very believable as the mythical (?) heroes. The chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones is also absolutely smoldering.Zeta-Jones is a relative newcomer to the American scene, she is not drop dead gorgeous or sexy but she has a physical presence in this movie that simply glows. There's something about Catherine....Anyway, this is a movie, the whole family can watch, and it is chemistry between all three main actors that make it work surprisingly well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corny, cliched and predictable - but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really is an old fashioned swash-buckler. There is no question that it is corny, cliched or predictable - it is all of these in great measure - but it is also a fun movie and well polished. Anthony Hopkins carries off his role in his characteristically classy fashion, Antonio Banderas is quite capable as Alejandro, but Catherine Zeta Jones (who, annoyingly, is referred to as 'newcomer' in publicity material, in spite of prior film experience) is stunning as Elena [although incredibly easily convinced to turn on the only father she'd known for the 20 years of her life!]. This movie is good - not worth the 7.7 or so it's currently running at but this will come down as the hype does - for a bit of fun and well made, but there is nothing new or surprising here - just old-fashioned story-telling tied to modern movie making. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this movie, I really did, but I couldn't; it reminded me of a cross between an old serial movie and a "family entertainment" film. The sword play was choreographed for laughs, the drama was forced, and romance was overwrought. Still, there were some good moments between Banderas and Hopkins, and the female lead was one of the most beautiful women I've seen on screen. However, at the end "The Mask of Zorro" left me groaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast was well chosen, the acting excellent as could be expected from such a cast. The rich plot was enhanced by good visuals and clever action shots - the stunt men had a field day. The Californian Robin Hood type character, Zorro in reality was not as nice as portrayed but it's the theme that's important. Antony Hopkins I understand did some of the fencing etc.What I enjoyed about this old style adventure film was that it did not rely on too many special effects, pornographic sex scenes and over done bloodshed. Yes, there had to be some of the latter, but it was done in the western style and therefore acceptable. I enjoyed watching the stunningly beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones and the swashbuckling Banderas. The choreography was excellent.Overall an excellent romantic-action-adventure film. Let's have some more like this in 1999.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although, a modicum too long, this has chemistry, great action, two great villains and wit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Castanets, much wailing, swash-buckling and baddies with dreadful complexions - all sounds like a dodgy weekend in Magaluf.No, the King of the Saturday morning specials (Flash Gordon and Rocketman had neither the dash or panache) is back with two, so to speak, upfront. The strikers in question being the original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega, (played byThe GoodThe BadHopkins) and the brash new hero of the under-privileged Mexican masses, Murrieta/Zorro (played with finesse by Banderas).Set in 19th century California, the masked, dusky avenger, a sort of Spanish Robin Hood minus the rather tacky business of exchanging money from rich to poor, is in a spot of bother.The PrettyHis greatest enemy Don Rafael Montero (rather fine English thespian Stuart Wilson), the ruthless and corrupt Spanish Governor, has accidentally murdered his wife and quite deliberately appropriated his daughter, Elena (Darling Buds of May Zeta Jones). To add to his misery he's been banged up in an obviously quite unhygienic jail for twenty years.Understandably the swordsman's a tad miffed. However, he needs to train and enlist the services of a young protégé to avenge the evil Governor. Enter Banderas who has his own bone to pick with Don Rafael Montero's sidekick, the perfectly dastardly Captain Love (wonderful psychopathic turn from Letscher). The blonde-haired, mercenary cavalryman has placed the young Zorro's brother's head in a glass jar. A cinematic moment not for the squeamish.Unlike renderings of great TV series' like The Avengers, The Saint and Mission Impossible to the big screen, The Mask of Zorro is rather successful and you get exactly what you expect. Although, a modicum too long, this has chemistry, great action, two great villains and wit ("the pointy end goes into the other man" says a novice Zorro). The most enjoyable the 'blockbuster' film this year.</fullReview>

Unlike many action/adventure films today, this movie relied on character, story, and, most FUN of all, magnificent stuntwork.

		<shortDescription>Great, entertaining movie! Saw it 4 times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'funniest movie' I've seen since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Right from the start, Zorro appears out of nowhere right on cue, to save the lives of 3 innocent would-be victims of the villain; using his bullwhip, swordsmanship, acrobatic manuevers and all the 'can't be touched' tactics of a living legend- here is Zorro in splendid glory. Even finishing his first appearance with a 'Hi-oh Silver' pose on his horse Tornado reared up, with the sun as a backdrop, his sword raised high in conquest! A Great 'Super-hero' movie with, lots of swash-buckling action, the right touch of romance and comedy, and one very beautiful woman threaded throughout the whole movie. There are no parts that will allow you to sleep even for a minute; with two Zorros, and two very distinctly different villains - where would there be room for a nap?! My ONLY complaint is that Zorro didn't follow in the footsteps of the earlier TV forerunner by leaving his 'calling card' often enough - the infamous Z carved by three swift slashes with the point of his sword. Other than that, I loved the movie all four times I saw it at the theater. And last but not least, the music was great too!!</fullReview>

I was a little surprised that the cinema would be showing such a high profile movie in one of these deals (I was expecting a Pauly Shore movie...). What was most surprising, however, was the overall quality of this film. It was a FUN action movie in every sense of the word. I actually found myself into the moment with this film.

There were some excellent swordfights and the ending was also a great fight scene.2) Anthony Hopkins. This guy is one helluva actor. His role in "Silence of the Lambs" was great and this movie shows that he can play various roles. He took every scene he was in and made all the other actors look like they should've gone back to acting school.3) That chick is fine!!! :PThe only problem I had with this film is Antonio Banderas' accent. Sometimes, I think it's hard to understand what he's saying because of his thick Spanish accent. I had the same problem in Assassins.Overall, this movie is an excellent 4 star movie. The beginning was a bit slow but then the pace moved quickly and it just flowed nice. A great script filled with nice dialogue and action scenes in the right places.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro is a typical Hollywood movie but at its best times. Nobody could get out disappointed by such picture. Of course nobody gets out enthrilled. It's a classic adventure movie with many comic elements and of course the essential love story. Banderas is good in the title role and quite convincing. Zeta Jones is a true beauty and is ideal for the role. But the man who steals the show is certainly Anthony Hopkins. A great actor as he is he "steals' every scene he is in. The direction is also impressing and the cinematography superb. I'm not saying that 'The Mask of Zorro" is an unforgettable picture or that it is one of the best movies of the year. It's a movie that entertains you and makes you feel satisfied. It's the kind of classic movie that Hollywood used to make many years ago and unfortunately doesn't make often anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega, is captured and imprisoned just as Spain concedes California to Santa Anna. 20 years go by and his mortal enemy, Don Rafael Montero, returns to California with a plan to become wealthy at the expense of the peasants. Anthony Hopkins hands over the mask to a new, "vigorous" Zorro, Antonio Banderas, while Catherine Zeta-Jones simply steals the show with her beauty. Of course she puts in a great performance (even does her own sword fight) but it's tremendously difficult to take in anything other than her breathtaking looks! Directed by Martin Cambell (Goldeneye), Zorro combines expertly choreographed swordsmanship, explosions, horseback maneuvers, and fight scenes, with a deft touch of romance. Although I was skeptical of this movie at first I must say that it is very entertaining. It´s almost pure entertainment. Both Hopkins and Banderas play Zorro brilliantly, as they both seem meant for the role. The movie contains stunts and action galore and many sword fights as well as plenty of comedy. Great flick!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dashing boots and swords extravaganza!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest essay in the Zorro literature is very nearly a masterpiece; the only fault I have with it is that it's too short. Since Johnston McCulley's novels of Old California, in which the mysterious Don Diego de la Vega figures as the heroic nobleman who frees the "serfs" from their bonds, the American public has been treated to some spotty efforts vis-a-vis this character. The mythical progenitor of the Lone Ranger [remember, all of you, Don Diego wore the mask before the "younger Reid"], the character has been interpreted in either of two ways--as a straightforward lead role or as a childish caricature [the Disney outrages come to mind]! Here, Anthony Hopkins realizes that it's time to drop the curtain on his adventures as he has responsibilities to wife, daughter, house, and class. The greedy caretakers of Spain's "property," however, see to it that Don Diego's uncomfortable muckraking style is rid forever. The movie's greatest appeal, I think, is the slow and painful transformation of Alejandro Murrieta from a common street thief to a noble and majestic figure with a constituency of far more than one. Antonio Banderas is perfectly cast as the newer incarnation of the avenger of the people's wrongs. He moves from an unkempt, unclean drunkard to self-pitying defeatist to reluctant student, to chest-beating show-off, to reflective and cunning poseur, to gallant and lover, and then, in full flower, to shining exemplar of retributive justice. There is no caricature here, in either Hopkins or Banderas' interpretation of the difficult role. Their scenes together are comedic, worthy, and instructive. Their relationship is very nearly a metaphor for the loving care that any father would lavish on a son [and is the complete opposite of what Spain lavished on its 300-years old colony]. The remainder of the principal cast should come in for praise as well. Stuart Wilson was masterful as the unworthy, thieving Don Rafael Montero, the robber governor. His American henchman, the thuggish Harrison Love, was wonderfully read by Matthew Letscher. Finally, Zorro the Younger's love interest, Catherine Zeta-Jones, brought exquisite feminine beauty and sensitivity to what could have been a thankless role. Her verbal sparring [as well as her swordsmanship] did her proud, and, no doubt, enhanced Zorro's admiration and respect for her, as she did ours. It is a thousand pities that this film was as under-appreciated as it appears to have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a classic matinée show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro is a classic movie, with excellent performance by Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderes and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The director, Martin Campbell, who directed the last James Bond, movie, really understands how to make a good movie with a poor script, since the script doesn't pretend to be more than a matinée show.The good parts of the movie is where Hopkins and Banderas are playing opposite each other, and when the movie portraits the struggle for wealth and power among the establishment contrary the reason why the peasants rebellioned in the former Spanish colony and why Mexico became independent in 1822.The above theme is dominating the movie and as long the movie avoids the confrontation between Alejandro Murrieta's past and his earlier wrong-doings in contrast to the profile of Zorro as the keeper of justice, the movie doesn't cross the border.Another good thing about the movie is fighting scenes, where every move has been choreographed without any errors and expresses the right form between drama and action just like in Scaramouche (1952).On the negative part is the last struggle in the goldmine between Zorro/de la Vega and Don Montero/Captain Love, which takes place in broad daylight. This is disaster and the result would have been much improved, if the scene and the last big explosion had taken place in the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films of the summer. Antonio Banderas shines brightly as Zorro in this much-hyped, but critically-bashed motion picture. Anthony Hopkins was great, as usual. The best character in the film was not the Zorros, but the extremely beautiful and extremely talented Catherine Zeta-Jones. The best scenes in this movie were between her and Antonio; the dance sequence, the "confession" and their sword-fighting scene. A great chapter in the history of Zorro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Mask of Zorro is quite a good flick. It has a good amount of action and adventure, with a helping of romance and humor on the side. Sir Anthony Hopkins was great as the Elder Zorro, the scenes with him and his whip were neat, and I understand he whipped the candles himself. Antonio Banderas as a young bandit, trained to be Zorro by Zorro Snr. did a great job. He makes a perfect Zorro. Overall an ********(8) stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With all the whips in this, when does the leather come out?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All one requires to enjoy The Mask of Zorro is that have at one point in their life been a child, swash buckling with imaginary bad guys with a wooden sword. Or in my case, to my mother's horror the 9-inch carving knife out of the kitchen drawer. It is a by the numbers action/comedy/adventure movie that has all the visual sight gags (complete with classic jumping on to a horse that moves at the last moment) one liners, action, plunging necklines (provided by Catherine Zeta Jones), evil nasty bad guys and romance to keep everyone happy. Antonio Banderas's (Zorro) performance is charming and witty, as a thief turned hero at the hands of an aging Zorro (Anthony Hopkins who turns in a trade mark value performance) who is looking for revenge and his long lost daughter. It is nicely shot with fairly interesting sets and scenery with some very impressive sword duels, the kind that would have done Errol Flynn proud. It doesn't dwell for two long on the `How's' and `Whys' of the plot and for good reason, in places its REAL thin. The writer's just expect us to accept various things, like the training of the new Zorro (Banderas) for example; appears to happen over night. What ever happen to years of practice? This being the case, sign me up for my Black Cape and sword, I could be out fighting power mad Latin American Dictators by the end of the week. These things aside, we do enjoy the movie. It has achieved what a lot of action films of late haven't managed, simplicity. You don't need a hugely elaborate plot involving twins, aliens and big special FX scenes. All you need are some well meaning Mexican peasants in a death trap. For me personally this was a very refreshing movie, it didn't bore me with needless complications whilst not insulting me by treating me like an idiot. All in all I felt it was money well spent and recommend it all Zorro fans new and old alike it is highly enjoyable and proof that comic style heroes can make the translation to the big screen successfully. Perhaps the makers of the last Batman movie should see this and take some notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was good and a bit of a suprise. I was expecting to like it. But what was a nice suprise was how big of a role Hopkins had. I went into this movie thinking it would be much like Highlander and other such movies. Where the big older star teaches the young guy and trains him and then u don't see him anymore the fact that Hopkins had almost as big a role as Antonio was wonderful and made for a great movie. As it was not just Zorro taking on the bad guys it was following the 2 of them deal with revenge in there own way wonderfully done . Will there be sequels???? well since it wasn't a 100 million dollar maker in the US its in doubt and I would almost rather there weren't one since Hopkins wouldn't be in it.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no special effects, no mega superstars, but still one of the best action films of this decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Mask of Zorro" is a delightful feast for the eyes. Romantic, funny and action-packed, this well-made adventure film captivated me and reminded me of the old Indiana Jones days. With a legendary hero you can always count on, this is perfect summer fare. The acting is extremely good for a movie like this, with Anthony Hopkins doing his best in his first action film and succeeding, Catherine Zeta Jones perfectly cast and glowing on the screen with charisma, and Antonio Banderas in his superstar-making role is probably the best Zorro on television or film. The villains are a let-down, but having an a-list like Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons in the main villain role would somehow cause a spotlight-contest, and the villain might steal all the scenes, which is very risky in this type of movie. There are practically no flaws in the technical department, and Martin Campbell (GoldenEye) was well chosen over action-master Robert Rodriguez who might have spoiled the action sequences with his tendencies toward bloody, violent action (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn). The best part of this movie was there was no blood at all during the fights, and only a few people died- most were either punched by Zorro, wounded by his sword or just pushed off a horse.This blockbuster is for all ages and all kinds of people. If you're a fan of charming heroes like Indiana Jones or the old Zorro, you would treasure this flic. Overall, one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen and probably in the top 5 of the best action films of this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the theater opening day to see this remake of one of my favorite stories, Zorro. I was afraid they'd ruin my hero. I had no need to worry. This is a marvelous movie, A skillful blend of action, comedy and romance with a great plot. The fencing scenes are really good. Hopkins and Bandaras just shine as Zorro and the Zorro for the future. Zeta-Jones is so lovely, and I'll never forget her description of Zorro to her father, "he was vigorous, very vigorous." The scenery, sets and costumes were far above average; the soundtrack hauntingly beautiful. I've been telling everyone to see it, and no one has been disappointed for taking my advice.

The characters seemed to act out of their own motivations, not out of motivations designed only to maximize the production cost. It makes for a welcome break in a summer filled with high-budget poorly-scripted fiascos. Solid summer movie-making at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely entertaining amidst a plentiful quantity of films that didn't ignite the imagination this summer. I won't say that this was 'edge of your seat summer entertainment that will keep your eyes glued to the end from start to finish.' It is, however an enjoyable two and a half hours to spend. The characters do seem to have motivation for their actions. The music reminded me of the scores from 'Braveheart' and 'Waterworld' a little too much but it is still forgivable. Plus the movie reminds us that Zorro was not merely a swordsman fighting and killing to protect his fellow men but was a charming man who knew how and when to fight as well as how and when to escape. The most brilliant scenes are not those that are filled with the swordplay but are those in which Zorro must escape from overwhelming odds. Recommended.</fullReview>

The acting is superb; and the casting is excellent. Antonio Banderas was made for this role, and his costars add brilliance to a wonderful story. It does lack on some characterization of the "villians", and most interesting is what seems like an involved background story. I'm sure a sequel will definitely happen in the near future.

		<shortDescription>A Superbly-Inspiring Work of Art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speaking of cinematic masterpieces, the Final Anti-Type, the Seventh and Last Head, on the Image of the Beast (Daniel 7:7), really should preview carefully one of the very best, as well as, now, and, therefore, all-the-more-amazingly, one of the latest; in which some of the finest examples of his dreaded "Oligarchical Principle," Noblemen who, to quote a line from the film, "say one thing and think another," are very vividly displayed. In fact, Zorro is a very personal Trademark to me, as a connoisseur who couldn't be more delighted with the latest enhancement upon an already immortalized classic. Whereas most ultra-modern cinema tends merely to substitute for the lack of any formal resonance, with technological enhancements designed to stimulate the most sensationalistically depraved senses alone, The Mask of Zorro is a genuine work of art; to begin with, in the strictest aesthetic sense per se, as well as in the form of one of the most thoughtfully inspiring and carefully well plotted Morality Plays I've ever encountered, right up there with the inherently insurpassable Robin Hood of Errol Flynn! All the right elements of action, romance, chivalry, and honor serve to bring out the deepest subtleties of the human spirit, with a refinement which can only be appreciated to the unfortunately rare extent it deserves by those who find it nothing short of the most personally and permanently transfiguring experience, rather than as the mere entertainment it no less abundantly is. . . . Even the casting, as well as the script, and the finely blended musical score, could not have been more to perfection! Anthony Hopkins was in the finest form I have ever seen for him, as Don Diego de la Vega, with his magnificently aristocratic charm, and genuine nobility of stature. And, of course, Antonio Banderas holds his own with an artistic mastery every bit as impressive as the swordsmanship it nevertheless so much less plausibly embodies, particularly on such buffoonably short notice, along with just about all the skills of a Valentino, a Bruce Lee, and even a Tarzan combined; although I wish that little trick with the candles, which had Basil Rathbone laughing out the other side of his face as well, in 1940, had likewise somehow found its way into this particular script, in some imaginatively analogous form. . . . Even while exaggerated to the point of the most deliberately fanciful ludicrousness, I only wish I could say in everything but the strictest ethical sense as well, one embodying a fight for the most genuinely independent kind of California; such antics are, in the process, really only intended to lend greater buoyancy to the spirit and imagination of a Vision for which almost nobody is even soberly religious enough to search. The truth is that the herd loves and insists upon nothing more than to be kept fattened, contented, dumbed down, and led by the nose, particularly with the most beautifully self-flattering delusions! Indeed, about two-hundred years of modern democracy have done more than the past few thousand to completely confirm perhaps even its grossest incapacity for anything else, as well as its strongest instinct to murder anybody who dares tell it as much!--Speaking even of most Working Class Heroes who think they have any more use for John Lennon than he did for them! What most of them really need, to replace the unwarrantedly inflated view they currently have of themselves, is enough of the right kind of guidance and discipline, for a totally unprecedented change! . . . Catherine Zeta-Jones could not have been more charmingly tailored to her role, with the same added sword-in-hand through which Stuart Wilson likewise compounds so dynamically upon the original 1940 script. In fact, I never realized just what a superb character actor Mr. Wilson actually is, until given a chance to compare this performance, of Don Rafael Montero, with his part, for instance, as the equally though much less demandingly evil "ex" cop, Jack Travis, in Lethal Weapon III. As Captain James T. Kirk, from the Star Ship Enterprise, would have put it, he's definitely earned his pay for the week, along with other compensations just about as harrowingly reminiscent of the great Kodos; that is, next to an equally fine performance, of Captain Harrison Love, played by Matthew Letscher, whose own chivalrously ignoble sense of "honor" had also come to its most Divinely-Predestined End (Psalms 57:6), as seen through the eyes of its very own worst enemy. . . . And it's certainly no surprise to see the name of Steven Spielberg among the list of credits, for the same reason it would have been quite a surprise to me had just about anybody else been able to pull off this particular little stunt. To quote still another line from the film, which might as well have come directly from, again, the Final Anti-Type, the Seventh and Last Head, on the Image of the Beast, "The children should never have to see the things we do," after-all; and yet, to the contrary, he, as with any real "traitor to his own class," should be among the first to insist that the children not be spared even the most tastefully as well as meaningfully well-proportioned violence in this one! But, to be perfectly honest, I have very little hope here, for essentially the same reason?He'll Never Be Rid of Me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nahuatl in the dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those viewers interested in native American languages, there is Nahuatl (Aztec) in the dialog. When the heroine meets her nanny in the market, the nanny is speaking Nahuatl. This is somewhat odd since Nahuatl is the language of the Aztecs and is spoken mostly in central Mexico. Unless the nanny were an immigrant from central Mexico there would be no logical reason for her speaking Nahuatl. While there was some immigration from central Mexico up to the California mission field, there were very few Nahuatl speakers. If this had occurred the woman would also have spoken Spanish, especially working in a Spanish household. Consequently, having Nahuatl pop up in the dialog certainly came as a shock to those few of us that know the language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Antonio Banderas (I'm afraid he's getting very typecast) may be suave but he lacks the tough hero charisma audiences like. Anthony Hopkins is so fat he looks ludricous in the black Zorro suit. Catherine Zeta Jones on the other hands gives such a smouldering and sexy performance that you want to watch her reprise her role again. Overall, entertaining and humorous enough but the predictability of the whole story leaves a very unfufiling taste in the mouth. You know the black mask Spanish avenger will win the day and claim his woman, and that the older Zorro will exact his revenge on his nemesis. In the end, it all falls together so nicely. Sigh! If only they found someone better to play Zorro!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catherine Zeta-Jones is very beautiful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine Zeta-Jones is very beautiful: her presence is by far the best thing in "The Mask of Zorro". The movie itself could be enough good, but its many defects are disturbing. Banderas is a nice guy. Hopkins is always professional. There is a sufficient amount of fun and humor. The mildly sexy sword-duel between Banderas and Zeta-Jones is a nice and agreeable idea. The action scenes are the usual frantic video-game: I have a strong dislike for this way of filming action, though seemingly much appreciated, especially by young people. The finale, despite its pyrotechnic frenzy, is confused and predictable; moreover its setting is disagreeable. There is a number of unsuited and annoying atrocities: heads cut off and all that.The over-bad deadly enemy of Zorro has changed nationality: no more Spanish, he is now an American officer of Cavalry, with his blue uniform, so that the audience can never forget that he comes from the States. This is quintessential political correctness: it is mandatory for the really cruel, unfair, detestable character of a movie to be a white American. All the better if he is also a handsome blond soldier.There is plenty of naiveness and flaws. The hide-out of elder Zorro - Hopkins is strongly reminiscent of the cave of Batman (we expect to see the Bat-mobile in some corner). Elder Zorro trains the new Zorro - Banderas uttering various speeches in the Oriental-martial-art-philosophy style: something like "Karate Kid". A bit more imagination from the authors of the screenplay would have been desirable. Zorro - Banderas is the brother of Joaquin Murieta (the legendary Mexican outlaw? In the next movie are we expecting that Zorro will be the brother of Jesse James?). The bad soldiers burst into a church, even shooting inside it, and afterwards they deport the priest as an accomplice of Zorro. This is utter nonsense: no Catholic Spanish for no reason would violate the right of asylum in those times, no matter if their commander is the super-cruel American fellow. Elena (Zeta-Jones), the noble daughter of a Spanish gentleman, breaks into a lascivious (and I bet anachronistic) dance, showing legs, underclothes and all that. This is real nonsense, much more than Zorro jumping on horse-back from 20 metre high. A world-record flaw: Elena is recognized by her old nanny, who speaks to her in Spanish, and another girl acts as interpreter! But Elena is Spanish: doesn't she understand her own language? Is there anything I'm missing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell asleep after 30 minutes. No kidding. On the couch, flat dead. It was the script that got me, or maybe the too-much music which wasn't even original. I'm really sick of this trend in movies where the director seems to think I'm too stupid to know what to feel for every shot, and so points out what I should feel with heavy-handed music. I love a good swashbuckler. This is not one. I knew who everybody was, who they would become, and what would happen, in five minutes. No breath of a plot twist was promised. And right before I passed out, I was being hammered into sleep by the acting. (Remember Jon Lovitz on Saturday Night Live? You know -- "AC-ting!" Yeah, well, this is the kind of thing that gave him that idea...) People who were watching with me and did not fall asleep said my expectations were too high, that this was just another offering of delicious cheese in a cheesy genre. Okay, but it really wasn't delicious at all. Bland. Very very bland. I'd prefer a lower budget and more real (as opposed to musically generated) drama and suspense. I guess I was looking for a decent Trader Joe's brie -- or even pepper jack -- and ended up with Safeway pasteurized process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "The Mask of Zorro" has any deficiencies, they certainly aren't in the charm department. This movie's got charisma out the yin-yang, and not just with Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas (perfect casting here) but also in the action; exciting swordfights, wicked double entendre and endearing heroism. I haven't seen this in a good 15 years and it holds up admirably. Swashbuckling movies don't come down the pike often, and it's nice when they're done so well. And even if it didn't succeed on the entertainment front, it still has a formidable secret weapon: the absurdly stunning Catherine Zeta Jones. My, god she's something else.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid swashbuckling entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not deny that I am not particularly into swashbucklers that much, but I will be prepared to say that the Mask of Zorro is splendid entertainment. Antonio Banderas gives a very spirited performance as Alejandro, and the well-choreographed sword fights, beautiful score and witty screenplay allow Banderas to do what he does best. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Don Diego, giving his character a sense of bitterness, sensitivity and vulnerability that make all his performances so endearing. In fact, this, Silence of the Lambs and The Elephant Man just go to show what a great actor Hopkins is; the only film he disappoints in is in Chaplin, where he played the rather unnecessary role of the fictional autobiographer. Catherine Zeta Jones is lovely beyond words as Elena, and Stuart Wilson plays his his-sable villain almost to perfection, but Matt Letscher as Captain Love isn't quite as threatening as he should be. The cinematography is very handsome, capturing perfectly the beautiful sets and costumes. The only other criticism I have of the movie, is its length, it's quite excessive. But I will say the explosive finale and spirited performances more than compensate, making it a very well-done and entertaining film. I wasn't as impressed with the sequel, the swordplay was more like slapstick and the plot was less involving and a little bloated. 8/10 for Mask of Zorro though. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Means : Cinema !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to write about a movie I love. It's a situation where I just want to express all and to be as strong as my feelings are. To right it, and to say it right. Based on the above, Martin Campbell's The Mask of Zorro is a great entertaining movie. It was a treat to watch it in a theater back in 1998 (exactly in 17 November). Well, a lot of the American blockbusters nowadays interested more in the size and the image of the explosions more than anything, and on the top of that anything is the script. Here, among some really super qualities, the script was so fine. Perfectly fine.I told myself at the moment "here's the most Indian Zorro ever !". Because as you've seen there is melodrama all over it this time. It was brilliant not to play the same old story again, but to re-build it with lines like : who my real father is?, the relationship between the mentor and the apprentice, and double revenge stories. Using the melodrama sanely and harmoniously recreated the tale of the masked hero through another perspective and kept it attractive and effective too. I loved also, the dialog with all the references about the hero, the heroism. So the homage to the original (The Mark of Zorro - 1940), and the big party of Action at the end with a ticker (actually non-ticker) bomb like James Bond movies; this climax was something to remember more than any similar work in Bond movies themselves, including for sure the one directed by Martin Campbell himself 3 years earlier.We have a case of so many pleasurable elements : Steven Spielberg's production and revival of Zorro; we needed that badly. (James Horner)'s genius music score, after the historical success of Titanic (one year before) we thought that (Horner) wouldn't be able to outclass that, but actually he did. It's a mark this movie got, which would make it live longer indeed. So the glory of its prodigious theme song. And of course the direction of (Martin Campbell). This man has so much talent and passion to the extent of being the next step ahead after the classics' makers of the 1940s and the 1950s. There's sense of brilliance, wittiness, and great love of cinema. He could, with sharp editing and stately photography, picture the blaze and strike you with it. Remember the intro; it's unforgettably cinematic to the utmost, like a swashbuckling dream, No, it was thoroughly a swashbuckling dream, and as it should be.(Anthony Hopkins) was such a treasure. Thank god for the laser operation that ended the pain in his back to accept the role. (Stuart Wilson) as (Don Rafael Montero) managed to be a real opponent for the screen eater (Hopkins), he played it handsomely and sedately, the best thing is that (Wilson) didn't repeat himself a la' Hollywood. (Banderas) was funny, cool, and hot but what made me feel pity that after 10 years of it he didn't do much or else!, (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was in her début looking good but less experienced and a bit naive especially with a flat role anyway. (Matt Letscher) as (Captain Love) suffered from the same thing, he was the forever and ever stereotype evil guy with stony adolescent face but at least he did it better as an actor.The first half of the movie was great, though scene like undressing (Zeta-Jones) by the sword was too far far fabricated to spice up the movie, and the trailer, a bit. In fact a lot of us back then while playing its trailer in theaters pre-earlier movies like Godzilla (3 months before TMOZ hits our cinemas in Egypt), we were asking eagerly what happened after (Banderas) ripped the girl's dress apart?! We really wanted to know and watch that ! Also, there was a poster that unites (Banderas, Zeta-Jones, and Hopkins) in one cadre at the last scene's décor, which was never in the movie! Smart, deceiving, publicity I suppose ! I've watched this movie at a theater, as a rented video, in our national TV, and on a movies' channel. Though, nothing can compare to seeing it at the movies, where the wide wild screen rules, the intensive sonic pace permeates, and the sigh of (Catherine Zeta-Jones) after her fiery kiss with (Banderas) ignites you. Some movies are meant to be watched in movies. And (The Mask of Zorro) is one of their best. It's a ceremonial of cinema in rarely classic way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm torn. This is my favorite version of Zorro, but I can't in all honesty say that it's the best version of Zorro.It is a bit cheesy, but it's also adventuresome, witty, entertaining, and amusing. The performances were great. I can't say awesome, but they were quite good. It was the dialog that dragged this down into the realm of almost-camp, and considering the talent and money invested in this work, I think that's criminal. Bordering on the 1960's-1970's Adam West camp in the way of dialog, this work takes you by surprise. You expect fun. You expect wit. But you had no reason, with Anthony Hopkins in a pivotal role, to expect cheese.I'm sorry to say that this rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really into Zorro or the story, but my mom has been trying to convince me for a couple years to give The Mask of Zorro a shot, and I do love Antonio Bandares and Catherine Zeta Jones, so I figured to be fair and give The Mask of Zorro a fair shot. And over all, I'd say that The Mask of Zorro is no doubt fast paced and packed with action and romance, Catherine and Antonio had a great connection and passion that sizzled on screen. Although, my question is mainly Anthony Hopkins, ENGLAND's popular actor as a Spaniard? Alrighty then! Zorro is Anthony Hopkins at first, but when he is seized and his wife is killed and his daughter is taken away from his sworn enemy as if she were his daughter, Anthony after 20 years in prison finally escapes and finds a thief, Antonio Bandares and trains him as the new Zorro that the people need. Once he sees Anthony's daughter, Catherine Zeta Jones, it is love at first sight, but she does not know still that Anthony is her real father and the man who raised her is destroying the state of California.I would recommend this movie for a night with friends, it over all was a good movie to watch. I loved the fight between Catherine and Anotonio, it was so awesome and so passionate, these two really did an awesome job. Once you get past and accept Anthony as a Spanard, I think you'll do fine with the movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much of a parody of the character, but surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I've ever really been a fan of Zorro. As a child, I was fascinated by fencing, but never Zorro himself, as a character or a legend. However, my love for fencing kept growing, and that is the main reason that I sat down to watch this movie, as it came on TV; to see some good, well-choreographed swordplay. However, despite my sincerest efforts, I couldn't manage to sit through the entire thing. Maybe it's because the film takes the legend of Zorro and tries to make fun of it; maybe it's because the film was overlong and poorly paced; or maybe I just care too little about the whole Zorro thing to sit through a movie about him... I've never seen any of the other Zorro films(as far as I can remember, at least), so I can't really say if this is as good or better than any other version. The plot is decent enough, but it drags too much and the film is too long. It lasts about 2 hours and 15 minutes; I think I looked at the film for a collective 30-45 minutes. The rest seemed dull and the film quickly lost my interest and attention. The acting is good; the three leads, Hopkins, Bandera and Zeta-Jones all give great performances... or, at least they did, for most of what little of the film I payed attention to. The characters are somewhat one-dimensional, especially Banderas' Zorro. Very goofy and humorous, but that's about as deep he gets. Hopkins really shines, though, as always, and Zeta-Jones really lights up the screen for every second she's on-screen. The sword-fights are well-choreographed and intense, but most of the rest of the action is a bit of a let-down. I don't know if it was the direction, the writing or just the overall kiddie-like PG tone of the whole film, but something just seemed to be dragging the film down. It is saved by entertaining dialog between Hopkins and Banderas, as well as the beauty and talent of Zeta-Jones and the exciting and well-choreographed sword-fights. That's about it, though. Not much else worth watching in this film. I recommend it only to big fans of Zorro(or, maybe they are the ones who should avoid it most of all, seeing as how it's almost a parody on the character) or any of the main actors. Big fans of fencing might also want to check it out, provided that they can do so for free. I once considered renting this movie, and now I'm thanking myself I didn't. If you can watch it for free, consider it. If not, just don't watch it. It's mildly entertaining but hardly memorable. I gave it a 7/10, purely for entertainment value and acting talent. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with 'The Mask of Zorro' is it doesn't know whether to be a comic-strip spoof comedy (the scenes when old Zorro (Hopkins) trains new Zorro (Banderas) are certainly funny) or a serious story of betrayal and injustice (the back story of how Hopkins became Zorro and how he became estranged from his only child). It does manage to be a bit of both but the contrast between one mood and another is annoying. The performances are fine, though, including Catherine Zeta-Jones in her first big film role, catching the attention of the critics and her future husband in this one appearance.A film that is worth watching but could possibly have been better with a little more thought about where it was going and why the story was being remade again after all those previous versions.</fullReview>

Time is not on their side however as a ruthless and tyrannical politician (Wilson) devises his own scheme to take over the Republic of California. Exciting, action-packed, well-crafted film returns to the sense of adventure that most films in this decade have failed to do; the swordplay is fast and furious, the comedy is pleasant and unexpected, and the three leads play their parts to perfection.

		<shortDescription>Still can't outdo oldtime Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typical of so many Hollywood epics that attempt a fresh turn on an old story and end up miscueing badly. A dozen films and TV shows are echoed here, and none to appropriate effect...I swear all at once I was watching Pygmalion, The Princess Bride, Kung Fu, Batman, Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Sons of the Musketeers, but never once did I feel as though it was Zorro on the screen. The traditional spirit of the story was discarded in favor of a revisionist take geared toward the all action market which at times is fun but on a whole is sorely lacking and often too hip for it's own good. The choice of Anthony Hopkins as a dashing and extremely nimble Zorro in the beginning whose appearance is anticipated by the young Zorro-to-be and his brother as though they're anticipating the arrival of a sports hero is very far reaching and somewhat embarrassing. The film pays more homage to Fairbanks' celebrated acrobatics skills than to the tempo which made Tyrone Power's version the Zorro for the ages in 1940. The final sword fight in that film wins out over the quicksilver and quite thrillingly choreographed battles in this version because we don't quite know all through the film if Power actually has the guile and prowess at the conclusion to run Rathbone's villain through. Such is the menace hinted at in Rathbone's mannerisms throughout and Power not being made to show his best til last that gives that sword fight it's well deserved status as best ever on film. Here we're given five minutes to believe Hopkins transforms Banderas' illiterate swordsmanship into the deft and flawless swordfighting skills he flashes as Zorro. One is reminded of the underdeveloped spiritual transformation of Alec Baldwin from evil and destructive villain to crime fighting hero in "The Shadow" when Hopkins introduces Banderas to the "circle", then compresses his training into a few short unconvincing scenes, dumping him in our laps as fully fledged in the kind of disciplines it takes years to master. And Banderas' Murrieto exhibits no aptitude for anything other than a bumbling and heavy footed bandido early on which makes it all the more hard to grasp.The action sequences for the most part do not disappointment, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is quite stunning in all facets of her presence. Banderas is more than the right choice to play Zorro, and the general production values are quite high. It is the combination of cardboard villains, Anthony Hopkins' uneeded inclusion, and lack of a three act story that gives this film the tell-tale signs of a poorly handled concept translated into a huge missed opportunity on screen. And with a character as firmly entrenched as Zorro there is no room for getting it wrong!</fullReview>

In the 70s there was STAR WARS, in the 80s we had THE GOONIES, and, for the 90s, we are brought THE MASK OF ZORRO. This film does something that not many contemporary films do. It entertains.This movie is an action-packed, comedic, romantic, swashbuckling adventure, much in the tradition of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. I was truly surprised that a "movie of the summer" could deliver such cinematic masterfulness. It is a rare action/adventure film that has great direction, writing, and acting.No one could ask for a better Zorro than Antonio Banderas. He brings such a heroic presence to Zorro. I would compare him to Errol Flynn. Anthony Hopkins, not surprisingly, delivers a wonderful performance and Catherine Zeta-Jones is perfect in her role as Elena. No one could have pulled it off better. Who would've thought two Welsh actors would make such wonderful Mexican heroes?I am so pleased that Martin Campbell was the director to bring this film to life. He has a wonderful ability to bring classic heroes into the nineties without making them TOO nineties. First, he brought a wonderful James Bond and then a superb Zorro. I'm just waiting for him to bring us a Spiderman movie (we can hope can't we?).Overall, this a wonderful film for all to enjoy! One of the best movies of the year (second only to PLEASANTVILLE)! A+! Thoroughly entertaining!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I was DEFINETLY not expecting to enjoy this movie at all. Zorro sounded awful, I don't care for Antonio Banderas, It seemed too cowboy-ish and the trailer was not very good.But, the film was completely changed my opinion on all the above, Banderas was great (performance bettered only by "Evita"), Zorro was actually quite cool, it wasn't too cowboy-ish and more romantic and historic at times and although a very simple premise, the story was quite engaging for much of the film.The best moments in this film all have Zeta Jones in it though, she is truly magnificent and her scenes with Banderas are truly brilliant (i.e "the Barn scene", "the dance").Hopkins brings his usual talent to the movie, in fact the whole cast were universally good.OK, so it's not in my Top.10 movies of 1998, but it's only just outside. I'll just give this one a (10), mainly because it was such a surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A RARE MOVIE THAT SUCCEEDS AT EVERY LEVEL.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen this movie and didn't like it you had better check into a hospital straight away as you quite obviously have no red blood in your veins whatsoever."THE MASK OF ZORRO" is beyond all shadow of doubt,the best swashbuckler in 60 years and stands alongside Errol Flynn's "THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD" as the greatest example of its genre ever made.This film exudes what I can only describe as confidence;it is confident in its look,its story,its performances,its direction.It is quite simply faultless. The choice of Anthony Hopkins as Don Diego de la Vega/Zorro is an inspired one and he brings a mature and flamboyant panache to his role.The scene he shares in a stable with Catherine Zeta Jones is wonderfully played and strikes me as the very essence of great screen acting.Jones too is magnificent in her role and leapfrogs over all her contemporaries to become the most beautiful actress working in movies today.As for Antonio Banderas as Zorro;this is the role he was born to play and he invests his playing with an infectious joie de vivre that is the equal of Flynn and Fairbanks in their heyday.The villains too are memorable,Stuart Wilson succeeds admirably as Montero and creates a villain of stature and depth(unlike his bad guy role in the lamentable "LETHAL WEAPON 3") and a newcomer(to me anyway) Matt Letscher is superb as the Custer like psychotic cavalry officer Captain Love.Even if the film did not already have beautiful production values,great music and sets,the icing on the cake really has to be the fantastically choreographed fight sequences which are amongst the best I have ever seen;this is how sword duelling should be not the silly flashing torch-waving pseudo fights that pass for action in all the "STAR WARS" movies.This is the real deal and when you have action like this and the glorious stunt action on horseback when Zorro defeats Montero's riders in the greatest race of this type ever captured on film you just know that you are watching a movie that will one day be recognised as a true classic and will delight generations to come in the way that Flynn's period movies do.I cannot praise Martin Campbell's action masterpiece enough and I look forward with relish to a sequel.More and very soon please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the old story of the fight between good and evil, but it works very well. Antonio Banderas (was made for this part), Anthony Hopkins, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, work really well together. The on screen chemistry is remarkable. There is romance, swordplay, and a good story in this movie. I would say that this is better than the Douglas Fairbanks original. I found that i really cared about the characters.One other point - the trend in a lot of films to take every opportunity to get the leading lady's clothes off (or any of the other women for that matter) and dive straight into a sex scene, is NOT what this film does. Thankfully this one goes for romance, and it is a much better film for it (Directors please take note).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is a bit difficult to follow. It starts out with a historical rundown that is printed in words too tiny to read. I ran it back several times and could not make heads nor tails of it. From then on, I was guessing, and it took the wind out of my sails for this film. A lot of the motives of the characters in the film are vastly understated...very poor character development overall. Maybe the producers just wanted to entertain, and said screw the story-line. But it has to make sense in a logical way, with some chronology, and there it falls short as well. I found myself longing for the old Disney version, or even Sr Fairbanks. I don't think this film topped any of the previous versions...it's just that it has been a while since any real swash-buckling has appeared on the screen. It certainly does not out-do any sword-fighting done by Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. Perhaps that is an unfair comparison, but film-makers should use the old evergreens as a watermark before they endeavor to do films of this sort...they have to top them. This one didn't. It's entertaining..and at least there is no filthy language--or it is kept to a minimum, which is a plus and a rarity now-a-days. I do not recommend it very highly...you must pay attention or you will get lost...but it is watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 out of 10The Mask of Zorro starts strong, with plenty of stunt-filled swordfights and big laughs. For approximately an hour, this is good summer entertainment that doesn't tax the brain. Unfortunately, such high quality thrills and humor fail to last the whole way. The second half is just drop-dead dull, the fight scenes pretty much repeat themselves over and over (unlike say, the Indiana Jones films or even The Mummy, which gave us something new every time), the villains get a little too evil, and that whole revenge theme gets a little too weighty. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones have no chemistry together, just one impressive, sweaty dance scene. At least the finale features some of the most elaborate, overdone death scenes I've ever seen (watch how the two lead villains are dispatched, absolutely hilarious).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Diego is Zorro, fighting for the rights of the people against landowner Don Rafael. When he is imprisoned his wife is killed and Rafael takes Diego's daughter as his own. Twenty years later Diego escapes prison and trains a bandit, Alejandro, to be a better fighter and to be charming so that he can infiltrate Rafael's circle and stop his plans to buy California.This is an old fashioned style film - it's good to see something that has almost no swearing in it, although the violence makes it unsuitable for family viewing. The plot is straight forward but needs several leaps of faith to believe it (Could Elena remember voices and flowers from being a baby?), but it's all done with such charm and wit that it's not hard to go along with the flow. The story eventually gives into Hollywood excesses (fancy death scenes, unlikely escapes from huge explosions etc) but until then it maintains a classy, elegant feel similar to the gentleman's approach of Zorro himself.The director Campbell does a good job filming the action scenes and the more elegant dialogue scenes but it's really good performances and superb casting that really makes the film. Hopkins is totally believable as the gentleman rogue Zorro while Banderas brings wit and charm to his role. Zeta Jones, never one of my favourite actresses, is really quite good here and has a wonderful sexy chemistry with Banderas that brings their dance and their swordfight to life.The only criticisms could be that the story does require us to just go along with all the leaps and coincidences that it has and that at 130 minutes you felt that 10/20 minutes could have been trimmed to make it a lot shorter and slightly faster.However it's a great swashbuckler of a film that they don't make anymore but it's made even better by a great cast.</fullReview>

Oh the humanity. . .then it all came crashing down due to Hollywood's formula. The sickening standard by which the industry lives would reduce the likes of, "Kramer vs. Kramer," into the absurd. In my nightmare, I see Ms. Kramer kicking Hoffman's ass, jack slapping the judge, lecturing the attorneys, and saving the world, while New York monuments burst apart a la "Independence Day." I'm tired of this nonsense.Women, and may I be so bold, girls are not "all knowing" soothsayers packing the moral and physical whallop of the Terminator.That said, this movie should never have been entitled, "Zorro." They should have called it "The Three Zorros: Dad, Daughter, and Trainee."The weirder moments occur when steam boilers explode (like an a-bomb), and dynamite as unlike anything seen in WWII. It occurs to me, "They are having car crashes and blow-ups in 1845 California." Yikes!Keep throwing manure at me Tinseltown, and you will get it back in droves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Antonio Banderas makes a rather fine Zorro, however this film is a bit to long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had some rather entertaining moments in it as it marked a return to the big screen for the mysterious Zorro. The story is a bit different as Zorro is shown at the beginning of the film doing what he does best, unfortunately he is later found out and his wife is killed, his child taken and he is imprisoned. Years later a couple of peasant brothers trying to make their way end up running afoul of a man who kills one of the brothers thus making the other wish for revenge. This man finds the former Zorro and ends up convincing him to train him so that he can get revenge. The film is rather good here and there, but it is sometimes just way to long before there are action scenes. This film runs over two hours and you feel every minute of it. Thankfully, it has a very good action scene at the end of the movie to make up for the long stretches of nothing really happening. The acting is good though as Banderas makes a fine Zorro and Anthony Hopkins plays the role of teacher and former Zorro very well. Catherine Zeta Jones is also good as Zorro's love interest. However, as for the villains they are rather unremarkable and very forgettable. The plot has some issues as well as some of it was just to much, I felt a simpler plot for Zorro's first time out in years was in order. Not a bad film, just needed a shorter run time, better bad guys, and a simpler plot.</fullReview>

They ran away because the Christians dressed up like the Government and attacked them to steal their land. (c) 2005, Debralh GarlickRespectfully,Rabbi Dr. Debra L.H. McCall, Esq. Raven Warhourse Whompom 8307 Rodney Street Philadelphia, PA 19150 www.geocities.com/dlmccall2000/ 215-247-3044Angelina ScarfoNicoli Scarfo met Laurette Angelina McCall in the summer of 1992. She gave him a book of gold plated stamps on their meeting because she knew that he had a heart of gold. She had never do anything like this before. It was love at first hearing of his name and love at first sight. They were married on her birthday June 17, 2004. She wanted to have a large family of sons. Nicoli wanted a smaller family. She felt that they should have a many children as they could afford. He was not a poor man.Angelina named Nicoli, Neco and Jimmy as pet names. She named him Jimmy after Jimmy Hoffa. Angelina knew that he was a good organizer and businessman. She promised that she would keep him in her prayers so he would not die by violence, but by old age and natural causes. She loved him more than he loved her but it didn't matter to her because he didn't know her that well. They were separated from 1992 to 2004. He was recently divorced. She was a widow. Angelina was determined to win all his heart. They passionately kissed all of the time. People thought that they were a new couple. How right they were, for the couple was virgins to each other.Angelina was also a businesswoman and had an online business plus published books. She was a multi Noble Peace Price winner. She recently designed mini hand weapons legally and copyrighted them. Angelina allowed Neco to take credit by selling the hand weapons to others who could afford them. The police departments globally were excluded by her request. In fact she demanded that they never do business with the cops.Angelina's best friends were Annabell and Abbygale L. Purritt. They were born two years apart. The three women discussed politics and organized crime. They decided to invent the Global Syndicate and would draft members with offers they couldn't refuse. Angelina proposed to have Neco use her weapon designs to unite all the families together in legal businesses. The three women would be responsible for all illegal involvements.One night at a dinner celebration for another one of Angelina's designs for a jeep/tank that could not be pierced with any type of bullets, she brought up the Global Syndicate idea. Neco being an honest man was not receptive to the idea until she explained that she wanted to bring all Italian families together for legal business transactions. Since the three women didn't have a rap sheet, they decided to be the cover for any illegal transactions."I have to talk it over with my father before I can give you an answer, Wyfie.," said Neco."Remember back in 1992, when we discovered the drinkable spring water in Valley Green in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I could never forget the message that I left with the Assistant D.A. about our finding in the year 2004. That was a good one, so maybe this is another good finding?," hinted Angelina."That maybe so, but I don't want my Wyfie going to jail and ruin a perfect record.," said Neco."I will plead insanity. They will probably put me under house since it will be my first offense, Luv Luv.," said Angelina.Six weeks later, Angelina was pregnant. The families were uniting together. Neco and his father were named Godfathers of their families. Each family had more than one Godfather. One old for the old ways and one younger for the new ways. Both ways were put together to keep peace amongst the houses. The families eventually took over the business worlds. Neco and Angelina had four children and many grandchildren. They lived to see them all graduate from college.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a remake of the 1940 "Mark of Zorro" but it's close enough to bear comparison. And this looks like a ballooned-up version of the earlier flick. It differs in the expected ways.First of all it looks ten million times as expensive. There are no car chases, of course, because this is like 1840's California, but there are elaborate stunts on horseback that were missing before. There is one huge fire and several huge explosions. Missing in the earlier one. There are multiple sword fights full of gymnastics, whereas the earlier had two. It's shot in glorious color on location in Mexico instead of a studio-reconstructed sleepy Los Angeles. There's semi nudity. The plot is far more complicated, the humor exclusively slapstick, and the direction and editing less focused. (Two long independent and simultaneous climactic sword fights instead of one exquisitely choreographed one.) Way more blood and gore and overall realism in the violence. People get knocked about here with great "THUD"s. Practically no marks of Zorro -- well, only two, and on flesh rather than adobe or leather. What was agile in 1940 has become flamboyantly acrobatic here. Zorro doesn't simply leap from place to place, he somersaults, or (it seems) double or triple somersaults. It's not a bad movie to sit through once but it does suffer from elephantism, even when considered by itself, without comparing it to the 1940 version. Everything seems somehow too big for the cartoonish goings on. The industrial camel labored to bring forth a gnat. The acting is okay. Anthony Hopkins does well, as usual. He has a way of making the most ordinary lines of dialogue sound resonant, an ability he shares with Lawrence Olivier. What an actor Hopkins is. Zeta Jones is beautiful, she can dance, and at one point has her bodice sliced off by the point of a sword. Banderas is good too. I like Banderas. He's not handsome, for one thing, and not bulging with testosterone. But the story is simply too weak to carry the characters. And it's done clumsily, supposed to be hilarious when Banderas crashes through a wall on his horse and falls off. The sword fights seem chunky too, with lots of action and little grace. The combatants are not nearly as light on their feet as they would like to be, and neither is the film.I've read one or two posts in these boards that begin with something like, "I don't usually watch black and white movies." What a shame.</fullReview>

However, Martin Campbell seems obliged to buy into maintaining the flash without danger that TV deals in - a sequence in which Zorro removes Elena's clothes with the point of his sword is more Benny Hill than the sexually magnetic outlaw. Ugh. Catherine Zeta Jones can do no wrong though - in retrospect this is clearly a steeping stone film rather than the A-list prize itself. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a silly film, and what a waste of great talent.You don't realize it at first, but this is just a typical action film. That is, the dialog and plot are completely non-believable, but lots of things blow up and there are plenty of fights where the good guy miraculously conquers countless foes at once.My favorite dumb scene: Zoro defeats a room full of soldiers by lighting a conveniently-placed cannon. The fact that no-one keeps a loaded cannon indoors, and the fact that Zoro would have no way of knowing it was loaded even if it WERE, seems of no consequence to the screenwriter.I also almost threw something at the screen when we see the new apprentice-Zoro as a complete novice with a sword, being trained by the old Zoro, yet in the NEXT scene he is suddenly an expert. It seems that only days went by, yet Zoro is now a master. -And so it goes through the whole film. If this were a low-budget film, all could be forgiven, but with this kind of budget and cast it's inexcuseable.I love anything Banderas is in, except for this film. Even Antonio couldn't save this turkey.It's a somewhat passable flick for a rainy day, if you absolutely have nothing else to do. Sadly, that's about it.</fullReview>

Perhaps this film's greatest crime is that it is based on the premise that a broken-down bum can be trained to be a great swordfighter in about five minutes of film time (stretching over maybe a week of the film's plot). The new version of Zorro is pale in comparison to the Douglas Fairbanks version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have never seen any of the classic films about the black Spanish caped crusader with the flat-brimmed Andalusian-style hat, black cowl mask, bull-whip and rapier (sword), and that always makes the 'Z' mark with three cuts, then this modern take on the adventure stories is a fantastic one, from director Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale). Basically, it is the early 19th century in California where Zorro, secret true identity Diego De Le Vega (first played by Sir Anthony Hopkins) was a champion against the tyranny of Spanish rule, represented by ruthless Governor Raphael Monterro (Stuart Wilson). Unfortunately, after a great triumph, Diego goes home to his wife and child, and Monterro has discovered his identity, and he attacks his wife and the house, abducts his baby girl, and imprisons him. Twenty years later, Monterro returns to California intent on bringing foul play to his total control, while Diego has escaped his long imprisonment and prepares revenge. Part of this involves training orphan who (coincidently) helped him as a boy, Alejandro Murrieta (Golden Globe nominated Antonio Banderas) who has also suffered a loss, his brother killed himself when they couldn't escape a situation, he also wants revenge. As training progresses, Alejandro gets closer to earning the costume and horse to do justice, and he also constantly encounters the daughter Monterro stole from Diego, the beautiful Elena De Le Vega (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who he obviously falls for. Also starring Matt Letscher as Capt. Harrison Love With some good witty dialogue, and great action sequences, this is quite a lot of fun. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor.

		<fullReview>A fun way to spend a lazy evening, but it has been done before, and this version offered nothing new.Like too many of today's high-budget movies, it stuck to the safe path of name actors, lots of action scenes, predictable humour, with no attempt at credible plot developments.But then, sometimes it's nice to turn off the brain and just watch the action...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones could help thim movie hold my attention...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into The Mask of Zorro not thinking very much about it. I had heard about this movie for almost a year, and I wondered why it had taken so long for it to be released, if it was any good. Well I'm here to tell you, it was ok. The movie was shot very nicely, the swashbuckling, sword-fighting scenes were cool, but there was this hour long middle part of the movie, where they tried vainly to set up a story (other than revenge), that it got bogged down. Anthony Hopkins is the first Zorro. He fights for the people against the tyrants that rule California. But when he is found, and his wife is killed and his only child taken from him by one of the tyrants Don Raphael, Zorro is put into prison and not heard from again. Until 20 years later, he escapes, and befriends a young man (Antonio Banderas) who had helped him 20 years earlier. Both Zorro 1 (Hopkins) and Zorro 2 (Banderas) have revenge on their mind. Zorro 1 against the man who killed his wife and took his daughter, and Zorro 2, against the man who killed his brother. So Zorro 1 trains Zorro 2 to be the best fighter he can. Along the way Zorro 2 falls for Don Raphael's daughter, who is in fact Zorro 1's real daughter. Zorro 1 only wants to be able to tell his daughter who she really is. Zorro 2 only wants to kill the man who killed his brother. Then Zorro 2 becomes the only Zorro and everyone lives happily every after. Oh yeah, and there's this thing with Don Raphael wanting to buy California from Santa Ana using Santa Ana's own gold. He uses peasants to do his dirty work, and they're all going to die unless Zorro can save the day. I'm not sure why the revenge motive wasn't enough for the producers of the film. Adding the captives plot line seemed a little forced. That's why the movie seemed so long. The opening of the movie was non-stop action. The end of the movie, with the dueling duels was done well. But other than a few humorous sequences in the middle, for about an hour, I was a little bored. I love Antonio Banderas' acting, especially in The Specialist, and he is the perfect actor for Zorro. Anthony Hopkins always does a good job in whatever role he's in. The villain was good, the girl was good (Catherine Zeta-Jones), although if you notice, the entire movie, she's shot with very soft lighting, which is fine, but when she's standing next to someone else, and she looks soft, and he looks hard, it doesn't look good together. The story was just a little weak. They should have played up the revenge factor a lot more, and leave the captives alone. Overall, it's a decent enough film, something that looks good on a big screen, and sounds even better. But it could have been much more with the people that were involved in it. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sword fights, sword fights, and more sword fights...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been so bored watching an action movie as I was with Mask of Zorro. Sword fight after sword fight is presented with variation after variation. Unfortunately, there was nothing in the movie to make me care about any of the main characters. Unless you're REALLY into sword fights, I can't understand why you would want to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Designed to give you whiplash...but who wants a slam-bang Zorro?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Zorro legend, slicked up with slam-bang, high-tech, expensive effects, so that it resembles an action-flick or a high-budget martial arts movie. Anthony Hopkins is surprisingly--though nicely--cast as an elderly Zorro passing his skills and knowledge (not to mention his cape and mask!) onto a Latin fugitive who soon becomes a well-trained fighter for the people. The bad guys are hissable, heartless Spaniard officials, sadistic in a cartoonish manner much the same way Antonio Banderas' new Zorro is dopey and yet dashing. There's plenty of sword fights and anachronistically modern jokes, a saucy sideline romance, and it is all very well-made but distressingly unsubtle. All the noisy action Hollywood can dream up can't help this "Zorro" escape the feeling there is no real personality at work. It's an epic, all right--but only in generic terms. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very disappointing remake of an excellent series. Banderas' Zorro is rude and unpleasant and from Anthony Hopkins' performance you would assume he is only there because he has bills to pay. Zeta Jones is just moronic, but it's not really her fault becuase the script is so bad that she can't help but make a fool of herself. The sword-fighting is laughably excreble. If you want a real swashbuckler, check out the recent "The Three Musketeers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember back in the day when movies use to be good? Remember when action movies, actually had action in them! And Romance in movies was surprising and wonderful? And you needed to have chemistry between the two leads? I remember that. Mask of Zorro has none of these.There isn't one redeeming quality about this film. It's boring and dull. If you think a good action scene, is a man jumping back and fourth on horses while people chase him, you need to wake up and smell the 90's.The actors don't even try and give it their best! You look in their eyes, and all you see is what they are planning on buying with their HUGE pay checks!I really hated this film to start to finish. Hate is too nice of a word for how I feel on this film. Let me whip out my thesaurus here, so you can understand how I feel about this crap.I DESPISE this film! Rating 1 out of 10. Let's hope SIR Anthony Hopkins and his co-star Antonio Bandereas can pick a decent...how do you say? Oh yes, movie. Let's hope they can pick a better movie to do next time. But with 13th Warrior and Instinct, why do I think they are doing it just for the money?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is blindingly dull, Banderras is a wooden actor at the best of times, here is a role which possibly suits him yet he doesn't get a chance to shine, the directors fault maybe?What is Hopkins doing in this movie? Does he need the money that bad?Anyway, whos idea was it to make movie anyway? Who cares about Zorro movies, swashbuckling movies are dated and dull, the action is boring and unexciting (compare any of these action scenes with say a Jackie Chan movie like Project A and you'll know what an exciting action scene can be), the script is trite and predictable, and the direction sucks, in fact everything about this movie is just so mind numbingly dull don't waste your breath on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this movie as I was entertained by the Tyrone Power version , years ago as I thought this one would be superior. It wasn't. I can't believe that such great actors would appear in such trash. A terrible waste of good film.</fullReview>
