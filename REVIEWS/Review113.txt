		<shortDescription>A closeup of US soldiers fighting in Afghanistan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'One platoon, one year, one valley' goes this documentary's impressive slogan. Such concentrated focus is truly a selling point. This is vivid, intense, unvarnished stuff, and the two filmmakers won the Grand Jury Prize for documentary at Sundance this year for their troubles. Hetherington also won World Press Photo of the Year 2007 for an image of one of the soldiers resting at Restrepo, an outpost named after medic Juan Restrepo, one of their first casualties upon arriving at this dangerous place of daily combat, Afghanistan's Korangal Valley. The two embedded journalists, Sebastian Junger (of 'The Perfect Storm,' with a contract from Vanity Fair for coverage) and distinguished British war photographer Tim Hetherington, are both filming the platoon off and on all through its 15-month deployment. They don't analyze or look at a wider context. They're in effect in the foxholes, where there are no atheists, and this time no military strategists either. What they show, and show well, is the camaraderie of this American Army unit, the Second Platoon, Battle Company, 173rd Airborne Brigade, their bravery, hard work, humor, and love of one another, and, less emphatic but also constant, a deteriorating relationship with the local citizenry. If you are going to make a narrative feature about how contemporary American soldiers in daily combat look and act, this is a good place to go, and the images are superb, and bravely shot, at the cost of physical injury and at the risk of getting shot like the soldiers. The film has no structure other than the actions of the platoon, their two big projects being building OP Restrepo, a 15-man outpost above the outpost that restricted the enemy's movements, and a foray dubbed Operation Rock Avalanche, during which the troops came under the heaviest fire; some of them still have nightmares from Avalanche.The Korangal Valley is a scene in the middle of nowhere with no escape, as the soldiers saw it on arrival -- a place of multiple daily engagements with a hidden enemy. Strategically, this place seems like it was useless. The Korangal Outpost was closed in 2009 after six years, hundreds of US wounded, and 50 US soldiers dead (and heavier losses on the less well-equipped Afghan side). Some US military actually think the Korangal Outpost -- and the outpost of the outpost, O.P. Restrepo where most of the action takes place -- only increased local sympathy for the Taliban.This is one "context" thing we get a glimpse of, because the film shows moments from a few of the weekly "shuras" when the platoon leader, Captain Keaney, met with local "elders," scrawny men of indeterminate age, often with brightly hennaed beards. He swears at them freely (safe, since they don't know English) and replies unceremoniously to their complaints. He's a combat officer, not a negotiator. At one point one of the locals' cows gets caught up in concertina wire (we do not see this) and the troops have to kill it (and eat it, from what we hear, and a very tasty meal it was). Elders come specially to complain about this, and demand a payment for the lost animal of four or five hundred dollars. Permission is refused for this from higher command and the elders leave with only the promise of rice and grain matching the weight of the cow. It looks as if the Afghans lose face in these "shuras," but the Americans don't gain anything.Of course there is the inevitable clash when the Americans push so close they kill some Afghan civilians and wound some children. As with all wars against partisans or insurgents, the locals are all implicated. Captain Keaney is chagrined. But the captain -- he and a handful of the soldiers are shown interviewed later throughout the film, commenting on the experience and the platoon's major projects during the deployment -- is proud of the job they did, nonetheless. They gave the enemy a harder time than their predecessors. OP Restrepo, their initiative, gave them a strategic advantage in the valley. And the men were brave, even when they were scared, and they' were kind and loyal to each other.'Restrepo' illustrates the Chris Hedges line that opens Kathryn Bigelow's similarly intense, visceral, but unanalytical fiction film, 'The Hurt Locker,' "The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug." Soldiers are shown hooting with excitement and saying that being fired upon is "better than crack," and they don't know if they can go back to civilian life after living day to day with such an adrenalin rush as the Konragal Valley and Operation Rock Avalance gave them.The festival enthusiasm is not the end of it because 'Restrepo' will be broadcast globally by National Geographic. But, reviewing the film at Sundance, Variety reviewer John Anderson argues, with some reason, that this documentary "needs a story, much like the war. The roaring lack of public interest in what the U.S. is doing in Afghanistan is largely due to a failure of storytelling: Tell us what it's about, and then we'll care." Will we? What the story of the US in Afghanistan looks like is being stuck in one place, fighting a pointless war, on varying pretexts, in impossible conditions, like Vietnam. Here we don't see the drugs and demoralization of Vietnam, though they may be there. The interviews give only a glimpse or two of the damage this deployment did on the 29 or so men -- as well as of what a very fine bunch of men they are. Michael Levine, the film's editor, who cut Venditti's great little doc 'Billy the Kid,' deserves much credit for bringing some order to a wealth of chaotic material.Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does a soft, liberal-arts civilian like me even approach a document like "Restrepo"? I don't give myself to blind, reflexive worship of the military; before, I have reviewed "Taxi to the Dark Side," an investigation into some chilling crimes committed by individuals in the armed forces, almost surely with the knowledge and approval of their superiors. This, however, is a film, shot by two insane journalists who spent a year with American Army troops in Afghanistan's Korangal valley, and it portrays men who are different from the rest of us in that they have faced and survived the impossible.Outpost Restrepo was named after a beloved comrade killed in action, and it was dug and fortified under constant enemy gunfire. The Taliban just hated giving up the position, and the men describe how they would dig for several minutes, then be forced to pick up their weapons and return fire, and after the gunfight died down, go right back to digging. The outpost is only several hundred meters from a larger base, but in case of an attack, support might as well be stationed in Germany.The all-seeing documentarians capture the men's brutal physical labor under a constant state of siege and barely-adequate resupply, until violence and discomfort become life's permanent background. The soldiers are forced to go on regular patrols through the countryside, tracking the progress of development projects and trying to build trust among the locals, whose allegiances are never clear. If they are only listening with one ear, if they're only out to hedge their bets between the fighting sides, who can blame them? The film culminates in an account of a firefight during an offensive called "Rock Avalanche" ? words that the testifying soldiers cannot say without a shudder. The mission consists of the men being loudly airdropped on a hilltop and moving around valleys and mountains until attacked by the Taliban. They push onwards, trying not to think which step will finally trigger the inevitable ambush. The ambush occurs; the live footage cuts out, and for several minutes, we follow the brutal firefight only through the soldiers' testimony. It is gut-wrenching. The pain and terror of the men who return fire without knowing which of their fellows are still alive and if they themselves will live for another minute are suffocating. Then, the footage is back, and we see a private wailing like a child over the dead body of the unit's favorite commander. If this can happen to the best among us, he says, what chance do the rest of us have? It is an astonishing thing to contemplate, but even at the end of so much hostile fire, the Americans have the better deal. The young men who passed through the trials are scarred and damaged by their experience, but they knew the date when it would end, and the bird was there to take the survivors back to a better life. The local Afghans' pain has no end. Frightened, grimy faces peer out of gashes in dirt walls. Children hide their eyes, dressed in scraps of their grandparents' clothes. The doorways of their mud shacks open into black pits ? even in midday, the sun is unable to dispel the darkness. The village elders are a sight from another millennium ? gnarly, weather-beaten, half-decayed faces that seem to have been chopped out of rotting tree trunks. You could easily give every one of them a couple of centuries, but who knows? They may still be in their thirties. I've had some rough years as a child of the third world, but I can't imagine even a tenth of what these people go through in their lives.So many excellent films have come out of our latest painful conflicts ? "Restrepo," "Generation Kill," "Taxi to the Dark Side," "Gunner Palace"? Almost all of them have been financial failures. Who wants to spend ten dollars to get depressed and emotionally drained? What exactly are we supposed to feel at the end of "Restrepo"? Not hope. Maybe futility, weariness and an incredible desire to think about something else.I wondered if the place I saw in "Restrepo" really exists on the same planet as the Metropolitan Opera. Will its misery ever end?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Objectivity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The horror! The horror! " Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.CNN describes Afghanistan's Korangal Valley as "the most dangerous place in the world." After seeing the powerful documentary Restrepo, I can understand the description, and I can admire an almost new dimension to that type of film: objectivity.An American company of soldiers spent 15 months in that valley with filmmakers Tom Hetherington and Sebastian Junger recording the soldiers' combat and more importantly their personal reactions. For indeed Restrepo is about soldiers fighting an enemy they can't see, a boredom they can't leave behind, and friendships they will keep forever, depending on how long forever can be in such a hostile environment.The singular feature of this Oscar-winning film is its attempt to make no judgment about the appropriateness of the war; it just chronicles the lives of young men stretched by fate to an endurance few of us could even imagine. Not that it's all that bloody or manic; it's just that the terror of an enemy hidden by mountains hangs about like a fog to such an extent that when they do kill one far away in the foothills, they rejoice as if they had wiped out a platoon. When the tired soldiers dance to "Touch Me (I Want Your Body)" by Gunther and Samantha Fox, they celebrate life, not killing.Back to that objectivity: Even a documentary marries fiction when directors choose some images over others. In Restrepo the choices lead me to question how the US could ever win this war, not because that's the directors' statement but because the successes are limited to building a stronghold, Restrepo (named after a fallen comrade), at the top of a mountain among mountains that dare the most powerful army in history to try to win this one when none has ever been won here. Indeed, the army has subsequently withdrawn.While the fictional Hurt Locker minimized its bloodshed in favor of the representational, Restrepo takes no liberties but goes for the real, which in this case is like waiting around a movie set for something to happen. And when it does, it can win an Academy Award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting to note how out of touch the average American is with its own military, as is expressed by the litany of repetitious back-slapping preceding comments like "awesome" and "wonderful" and "outstanding". IMO, these comments reek of incredulity and are not only naive, but are indicative of a thrill-seeking audience seeking a vicarious experience from reality-based versions of "Saving Private Ryan" or "Blackhawk Down", albeit with little or no comprehension of what is actually going on, let alone viewing our military in action with a critical eye.That said, as a former 11B20 and civil affairs soldier, there were a few scenes that made me cringe: 1) In a country where the per capita income is less than $500 per year, and where a man's cow is a man's livelihood and transportation -- an Afghani farmer would regards his cow the same way we regard our own pick-up truck or car here -- this particular unit (2nd Platoon, B Co. 2-503rd AIR, 173rd BCT) couldn't come up with a measly $400 to compensate the farmer for the cow they had eaten, choosing instead to use the flimsy pretext that since the cow got caught in their perimeter wire, it had to be "put down". I guarantee you, this will come back to haunt us on another day, at another time, on another battlefield albeit with the same people, as it will probably be one of the reasons why this particular village and their descendants will continue to nurse a grudge against us for next 1,000 years or more. We should've nipped it in the bud when we had the chance and paid the pittance sum for something we basically stole. Bottom line: Poor leadership and lack of cultural sensitivity and empathy will be our undoing there.2) In the regular meeting with the tribal elders -- the weekly "shuras" -- the villagers brought up the fact that innocent civilians and family members had been killed by ISAF/Coalition forces. The unit's C.O., Captain Kearney, instead of offering his condolences and apologies like a normal human being would -- in addition to doing his job like he should've done by duly compensating that family in accordance with what ISAF forces are authorized to do -- instead chose to dismissively ignore their complaint and flippantly told them to "forget about it" and that they "need to move on," as if he were telling an ex-girlfriend to f&amp;%$ off.Not only did he write them off completely without expressing any sympathy or attempt to show any empathy whatsoever, Captain Kearney put another nail in the coffin of the U.S./Afghani partnership in that embattled country, as it is highly likely that such insensitivity and lack of remorse by an American officer toward an Afghani villager won't be forgotten anytime soon by that family or village for at least another 1,000 years. Again, this was just another example of another incident where we could've and should've nipped it in the bud by using common sense, human decency and blood money to win back the population. Also, this particular unit erred by big time by not having a full-time C.A. (civil affairs) officer attached to this unit to interface between the C.O. and the indigenous population. (Infantry officers, like Capt. Kearney, make poor negotiators.) Bottom line: Poor leadership and a lack of cultural sensitivity and empathy will be our undoing there.Then, to top things off, in the behind-the-scenes footage, Captain Kearney returns to Ft. Benning and where he not only gets a promotion to Major, but is basically rewarded with a highly coveted posting with the elite Rangers. As he awaits orders, we are shown a glimpse of Kearney's family life, as he continues to play with his little boy and catch up with his wife as if nothing has happened. So for certain, Major Kearney, with a family of his own, could imagine how the Afghanis in the Korangal felt about losing a family member -- but in fact, and incomprehensibly so, he didn't or couldn't, as he failed to show even a modicum of remorse, or even a de minimus amount of sympathy or empathy to their plight. Having said that, how are we supposed to win this war if our country is being represented by arseholes and hypocrites like that? In actuality, the futility and hopelessness of the campaign that this documentary captured should've inspired a different if not more befitting title like, "God Help Us."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop and Think About It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a strange way to fight, without ever seeing the people you're shooting at and who are shooting at you.The strongest aspect about this viewpoint documentary is its lack of an opinionated narration. The filmmakers--who deserve commendations of their own for putting themselves in the line of fire for 15 months--let the soldiers and their activities tell the story, the firefights, patrols, attempts to communicate with the Afghans, mundane chores.And they let the viewer judge for meaning.It isn't possible, however, to truly capture a year and three months in 90 minutes. I did find it curious that so much interview footage was cut. If you see it on DVD, don't miss the interviews shown under special features. Perhaps the director-cameramen wanted to keep the ratio heavier on footage than interviews.In one omitted interview, the unit Captain admits that he thought he was responsible for losing even one soldier. He also mentions that one of those killed was the unit Sergeant Major's son. There should have been some way to weave this into the story.Another soldier says he hates the terms "you did what you had to do" because he doesn't think he really had to do it. Says he doesn't think God will greet him with a playful punch to the shoulder and say "you did what you had to do." It's powerful stuff, the included and the omitted footage. For the most part we fight now with volunteers. The mix of soldiers is a bit different than it was when there was a draft, but "Restrepo" shows that American forces still bring a wide range of backgrounds and reactions.And it shows that most are still so young that we are still sending kids to do the jobs old men ask them to do. They are brave, fearful, obscene, committed for the wrong reasons, committed for right reasons, and committed for no reason at all.It's a powerful view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart-wrenching documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where documentary filmmaking becomes serious. Whatever you are expecting out of this film, chances are you will get a whole lot more. Restrepo follows a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan who are defending a valley, Korgengal. It is said to be one of the most dangerous valleys in the entire country and these brave men take fire every single day of their brutal campaign. This is a riveting film and it is one of those that you cannot shake. It gives you a glance into the absolute darkest depths of modern warfare and just how demanding the fighting is both physically and mentally. It is a film that gives you a rare look into the horrors of war. And it is absolutely astounding.Restrepo is shot at a very personal level. The camera never intrudes on the soldiers during their work, and thank God considering some of the harrowing things they go through in this movie. This film hardly even feels like a documentary in the sense of what we think of documentary today. It is filled with interviews, but the bulk of the movie is truly documenting the lives of these soldiers. We get to see all sides of the emotional spectrum that can be afflicted through trauma. We get to look at how different people cope with such horrors as are experienced in this film. And it is all through such respectful eyes. I never once thought, 'Wow, they should really stop filming this.' Every moment of the film feels so important and the fact that all this was so clearly and eloquently caught on camera is astounding.The unequivocally greatest thing about this film is the fact that it has absolutely no political agenda. It really has no alternative motive other than telling the story of these incredibly brave soldiers. The film only seeks to honor the brave men who served our country in the most dangerous area imaginable. This film isn't for the political leaders responsible for the war. It isn't for the military commanders that send these soldiers into battle. This movie is for the soldiers themselves. It is a true soldier's film in every sense. It has a very stern focus on the individual. It makes such an important point out of this aspect that it could have possibly gone even further. There are a lot of men in this platoon and thus we don't get to know any one person particularly well. We get to know the platoon well as a whole and how each man interacts with his fellow soldiers and how they all deal with loss and tragedy. Each individual soldier in this movie is important and the movie strives to show how meaningful that is. It is a remarkably important aspect of the film.You won't see many documentaries like this, and there's probably a good reason for this. The kind of footage captured in Restrepo isn't easy to get and you have to be just as brave as the soldiers themselves if you are to accompany them into battle to document their bravery. But thankfully when the opportunity to get such unforgettable footage arose, it was all put together extremely well. This is not an easy film to watch, but in the end it is so remarkably worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grunt's Eye View of a Depressing War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmakers Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger take their cameras into the trenches for a "day in the life" look at what it's like to fight in the Korengal Valley, Afghanistan, nicknamed the most dangerous place on earth.There, a platoon of battle-weary men fight the Taliban, an elusive spectre of an enemy that they rarely actually see. They seem to have little interest in what they're doing or why they're doing it; they only come alive immediately after a fire-fight (of which they have at least 3 or 4 a day), when the adrenaline of battle gives them a natural high. The rest of the time they spend going about their more mundane duties, feeling at all times like fish in a barrel.Late into the film, one of their men is killed in a battle that pretty much all of them agree was one of their worst moments during the whole period. Other men had been killed, but this seems to be one of the first that the men actually see die before their eyes. It has a devastating effect -- they collapse into sobs and turn instantly from fighting men into small boys, and our hearts go out to them with compassion and the frustrated regret that they have to live like this while the rest of us go about our cushy existence."Restrepo" confirms what a lot of fictional accounts of the War on Terror (or whatever it is we're calling it now) have suggested: the feelings of determination and vengeance that got us into all of these messy military conflicts have long since given way to depressed resignation. No one is really sure what we're doing anymore, these soldiers least of all, and watching "Restrepo" didn't feel much different from watching a documentary about Vietnam.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Restrepo !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨My personal low point? - Rock Avalanche, I saw a lot of professional tough guys go weak in the knees.¨ Restrepo is one of the five pictures nominated for Best Documentary at the Oscars and it also won the Grand Jury Prize in the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. It's beautifully directed and filmed by Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger (writer of The Perfect Storm). The huge success of this film and what separates it from the hundreds of other war pictures is that Junger puts us right in the middle of the action without any political agenda. He simply decides to film these groups of soldiers who have been deployed to one of the most dangerous locations in Afghanistan and lets us experience their day to day lives without making any pro or anti war comments. We are allowed to see a small glimpse of what the American soldiers have to go through and how they live amongst the villagers. In a way Junger allows the soldiers being filmed to tell their own story. We experience what they are going through in this dangerous war zone and how they interact with the local people. The cinematography is actually quite astonishing and I really felt like I was there with the soldiers. Restrepo made me appreciate even more last year's Oscar winning picture: The Hurt Locker, because it showed me how real that film actually was. At one point one of the soldiers even claims that no rush is as high as being shot at in the middle of a war zone. War can be addictive and it actually is for some soldiers.The camera silently follows an American platoon that is being deployed to one of the most dangerous war zones in Afghanistan known as the Korangal Valley for a period of 15 months during 2007. The film begins while the platoon is arriving at the base and some of the soldiers share their thoughts about beginning their service in such a dangerous zone. We follow these soldiers as they live in tents in the middle of a valley where danger is eminent. They have to experience gun fights almost every day, and at the same time they have to adapt to the environment. When they are not fighting, we see the soldiers digging for protection; we see them burning their own feces, and just goofing around while they wait for next gunfight to take place. A day without action is nonexistent in the Korangal Valley. It is during one of these gunfights that one of the soldiers is mortally wounded, his name was Restrepo and the rest of the soldiers decide to build a resistance camp named O.P. Restrepo on his behalf. Restrepo changed the entire mood of the soldiers and they were ready to have their revenge. At the same time that the soldiers have to fight off the Taliban they also try to improve their relations with the locals who have a difficult time accepting the Americans (especially after they kill one of their cows).The movie isn't pro or anti war; it simply places the camera in the middle of the action and lets us experience what is going on. No one's opinion about War is going to change: those who favor Americans involvement in Afghanistan will still do so after watching this documentary and those who don't will still feel the same because the directors don't try to manipulate us into thinking the way they do. There aren't any personal opinions about politics or war; it's all about experiencing what these soldiers have to go through every day whether or not they actually understand what they are fighting for. Some of my favorite parts of the documentary were the scenes where the Captain meets with the local villagers and tries to make allies out of them and the Rock Avalanche operation. The Captain really doesn't have a clue of the way the villagers think and goes the wrong way about trying to convince them to help the Americans. The Rock Avalanche Operation was really intense and was the climatic point of the film. I really loved the interviews with the soldiers with the camera closing-up on their faces (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly style). Restrepo is a really good and memorable documentary that will stay with you for days. It is only 90 minutes long so it is really worth your time.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And I thought "The Hurt Locker" &amp; "...Private Ryan" were intense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After living (because "experiencing" is too weak a word here) this film for the last 2 &amp; 1/2 hours (the DVD extras are equal to the feature) I will not be able to see another combat film for a very very long time.What Sebastian Junger &amp; Tim Hetherington have captured with this doc may be the final word about soldiers in combat &amp; their thoughts afterword.Afghanistan has been called a place "where dynasties go to die". The men shown here mostly don't give a flying f**k about history or politics. All they are concerned about is getting one day closer to the end of their 15 month deployment in the most dangerous on Earth AND the guys on either side of them.This is most clear-eyed view of fighting I've seen since (the excellent) "Gunner Palace". Junger/Hetherington put their own asses on the line getting their footage &amp; wisely kept completely out of their own picture. It drags at times because it shows that fighting is about burning their own human waste, building dirt barriers &amp; killing time before the next kill --a kill they rarely see. The interviews interlaced among the field footage are as riveting as the fighting.BUT make no mistake the fighting is as hellaciously intense as "Black Hawk Down" &amp; "...Ryan". However J/H pull back from the gore. There are PG-13 movies which are more graphic in their violence. The real "graphic" parts of this film are the emotions in the faces &amp; the eyes of the men. Sometimes it is difficult to figure out what comes first: the man inside or the soldier outside.Buy the DVD. The extras are huge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a courageous film that shows a war that is, like the Korangal Valley, a loop of grit and despair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's inarguable that we need to support up the soldiers in Afghanistan. It's the cliché in political speeches, but this film shows that this is more than just a saying when given a human face and context. Restrepo doesn't try and bluntly make the case that the conflict there that the US is engaged in is really worth it, or that we should leave immediately. The filmmakers let the soldiers speak for themselves, and the situation tells much more about what's really going on there. The ground troop that makes Restrepo- named after a much beloved fallen man that died suddenly during a small attack- which is a fort on a hill overlooking the valley, are all mostly kids who are in the army for one reason or another (one of them, who gives the most background, came from a hippie-family), and they are where they are and got to buck up with the situation for the months into the year it goes on till they are relieved. We see some of the action, but if you're looking for the traditional war film please look elsewhere. This doesn't share the intensity of, say, last year's The Hurt Locker, but the film isn't on the same wavelength stylistically. Junger and Hetherington want these faces of the soldiers, and their experiences, to tell more than the visceral shocks that are shown on screen. Point in fact, there isn't a whole lot of action on screen, either because, logically, it would be difficult for the already in-grave-danger cameraman to get it on film (most of all that Rocky Mountain Ridge episode that everyone's haunted by), or that the US Army wouldn't allow it to be shown in the film. It's here, in having the lack of what we expect to see in a war film, that it gathers its strength and resonance.The film Restrepo is engaging and absorbing as a collection of moments and scenes, detailing what everyday life was like there, and sometimes it could be just plain dull, or on the 'downlow' as it were. We see the dealings the army tries to make with the locals, who are either too scared of the Taliban (one gets the sense they're like a mafia with bigger guns) or don't want to help since, frankly, the US ends up killing a few civilians here and there, many of whom have never seen US troops before. Or, on the flipside, those that do want to deal with the soldiers after a cow is caught in the outlying fence on the perimeter and is killed, which is valuable property to the natives. And we also get to see how these guys, mostly kids in their early 20's or younger, having some relaxing time when not being fired at or firing back. To be sure, some sequences are intense, such as the Rocky Mountain Ridge tale which has the soldiers being interviewed still unable to handle with the casualties and how they were surrounded by the Afghan forces. But what one walks away from this film, shot in the Korangal with straightforward, sobering shots of soldiers doing what they do, and with telling interviews shot much later when they were in Italy, is how they weathered the chaos and did accomplish something there with the fort (albeit later abandoned altogether in April 2010). It's extraordinary to see it so up close, and to put the human face on it. The audience, however they feel about the conflict currently (from the looks of things Obama's keeping soldiers there for longer stretches until "it" is "won"), get a fresh perspective and can walk away with their own conclusions. That, and those haunted faces of the soldiers themselves, who in profile have that stare in their eyes, sometimes more-so than others depending on when talking about what, and knowing that look may be there for the rest of their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent movie about war criminals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Restrepo last night. Its a documentary about some army platoon in Afghanistan. First they meet with the local populace, and the locals complain that civilians have been killed, and the commander is like, "Well, its time to move on from that. Get over it. We are starting over with a clean slate now." Then they steal one of the villager's cattle and eat it, and when the villagers complain about it being illegal, the commander accuses them of being Jihadi.Then they arrest some people, and the villagers complain about illegal detention, and the commander says, "I Don't F***ING CARE" Then the villagers finally act up, so the army calls in airstrikes and kill ten civilians including some children. Then one of the Americans get killed, and they cry like babies until they get bolstered up by a tough-talk session in which they promise to make the enemy pay. After that, they indiscriminately shoot everything that moves. At one point, they compare it to a video game or a hunting resort. Finally, they say "F*** this place" and go home. Very inspiring stuff, god bless America.Its basically about a bunch of uneducated moron dude-bros who are pretending that its war, when really they are just sitting on a hilltop harassing villagers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up on idealism. I watched Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Norris and never questioned the nobility and sacrifice that must be endured to maintain our ideals in a black and white world. I believed it and took it to heart. I went down the path of wanting a career in the military.Leftists are quick to trounce Hollywood's war narrative as being self indulgent, and understandably so. Hollywood rarely supports movies which articulately examine the other side, it's not exactly good for business. We all know about our atrocities but we don't need to be reminded about them in our movies, idealising ourselves as being heroic is much better for selling seats at the movies. If we're not Rambo or Braddock, the gallant hero upholding liberty and justice, we're the sacrificial warrior who's returned from war damaged. Examples include Deer Hunter, Rambo, Platoon and the Hurt Locker.The Hurt Locker apparently didn't tackle the politics, it presented the sacrifice our young men make on our behalf. Like the Deer Hunter, it's a "real" story about our tragedy in war. If I'm honest, this is partly why I think this movie resonated the way it did. It does little for leftists to criticise something like the Hurt Locker because it's apolitical ? it's about the troops and we all know unpopular it is if you don't support the troops.For the record the Hurt Locker was obviously unashamedly pro-American and I don't think it is apolitical either.I expect Restrepo will come to be regarded in much the same way, moreover it has the added authenticity of reality. Like the Hurt Locker, it is not about the politics of war, it's about the soldiers. It's about their sacrifice and boy do they make it, in spades. Some die but most give something of themselves that is lost forever and in return they have an experience forced upon them which is so immediate it will never be far from their thoughts.Very, very powerful stuff.This is a raw film in every sense and this extends to the filming. I don't do well with jerky filming with quick zoom in and outs. I know most people don't have as much of a problem but it really makes me want to throw up. I do think the filmmakers over indulged to add authenticity but I'm not going to overly criticise it.This is a film about the American experience, it is not about the wider war and has even less to do with the enemy.*** Spoilers Ahead ***Restepro is interesting because while no one could deny the courage of these young men it also asks many passive questions not just about our approach to Afghanistan but maybe our ideals in general... A Captain entering a new war zone not wanting to know about it, a soldier and his "f**king hippie mother" who wouldn't let him have so much as a water pistol and the other solider who doesn't know how he'll top the high of a fire fight. The photo of the kid back home dressed in army fatigues, presumably the son who wants to emulate his heroic father.Even though the soldiers engage with Afghan locals it is with an overwhelming crippling suspicion on both parts. When the Afghan elders enquire about someone, the Captain tells the locals that he doesn't give a f**k about so and so for grimacing reasons which we as the audience should identify with. When the locals' cow is killed by the soldiers, the offer of rice and beans to repay the debt is met with vacant stares of incredulity. The soldiers tell them in no uncertain terms that if you came looking for money it's not going to happen. There's no mistaking that in the Korangal Valley, it's the Americans who call the shots.And sometimes those shots don't always hit who they're supposed to. Sometimes those shots stray into places where they shouldn't, killing and maiming the innocents. The Colonel is brought in to explain that the burned babies are unfortunate but essentially they are collateral damage. That's the price paid when the Taliban intermingle with the locals. If the Taliban would just come out to fight the Colonel's soldiers then this wouldn't happen. Such is the unfairness of an asymmetric war.For some of the soldiers who fought there, the Korangal Valley became the last place they'd see. For others, behind the awkward smiles and the incomprehension, it will be a lifetime of nightmares and memories which will haunt them forever.Watching these kids is humbling and staggering and I am genuinely in awe of how they can stare death in the face on a daily basis. They deserve more, way more than the $1,000 bonus they might get if they were to stay an extra month. I couldn't do it, more to the point I wouldn't want to do it, not if this is how the war is fought. Al Qaeda have spawned an ideological war which cannot be defeated alone by "getting some".Perhaps the most sobering part is displayed as the credits roll; in April 2010 the Korangal Valley was abandoned altogether, and I can't help feeling if that is how the war in Afghanistan will end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't boring, but this just wasn't a movie I could get inspired or awed by. For the most part, I found the demeanor of the soldiers a lot like inner city toughs playing out their regular lives with an exotic backdrop.I actually think this movie LACKED violence, which it needed more of to get its "shock value" across. Lots of gunfire scenes but only brief, sanitized glimpses of war carnage, which would have really shocked the audience. I don't recall seeing any incoming fire except for an explosion on the road near the beginning. For all the "heavy fire" they took daily, there wasn't a whole lot of footage.Then there were the macro-pore closeup interviews with the usual "it was bad over there, man...really bad" dialog. I'm not making light of their pain but none of it seemed like new territory in a documentary.I wasn't impressed by crude references to a ranch where all you really do is shoot wildlife, a kid calling his mother a (bleep'n) hippie, and similar low-brow stuff. I'm not knocking the bravery of the volunteer army, but it makes these foreign conflicts seem not much different than turf wars in American ghettos. The Taliban are probably the equivalent of U.S. gangsters over there. Dull-eyed people creating trouble out of thin air for the most part, over greed and ego. "It's been going on for ten thousand years" says an old song."Restrepo" reminded me of what's wrong with the whole human race; the lack of foresight and thoughtfulness, with a shoot first, ask questions later mentality. I am weary of those who say "we're just doing our job" without seriously (as nations) questioning the futility of warfare and all the lives that end up being wasted just so similar conflicts can arise again somewhere else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting reporting? yes. award-winning documentary? no.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sad commentary on contemporary journalism that a film like Restrepo can win a prestigious award like the Grand Jury 2010 Sundance Best Documentary Award. Basically, the film-makers embed themselves with a US platoon in Afghanistan, document the experience, and intersperse interviews of some of the soldiers (taken after the period in question) throughout. There's no attempt to place the events in a larger context, no narrative to tie anything with the policy decisions taken in Washington, all we get is a raw "life in Afghanistan" seen through the eyes of soldiers on the ground in a single location. Don't get me wrong, it is quite interesting to actually see some of what is going on the ground in Afghanistan, after the thousands of hours of TV punditry and miles of newspaper column inches that media heads have filled with opinions, debates, tirades and justifications of the so called "war on terror". But this is the kind of reporting that should be omnipresent in our media, something you might see in a segment on 60 minutes, or some other outlet for investigative journalism (of which there are fewer and fewer). Unfortunately, as we know, investigative journalism is expensive, and has dramatically been cut down in our age of media mega mergers. It's a lot cheaper to stick a few people around a table to mouth off on TV (and then cover the debate in the print media), then it is to ship true journalists across the globe (and around the centers of power in the US) who are not afraid to stir things up and take on the powers that be.And so something like Restrepo - which is a bog standard journalistic piece - becomes an award winning documentary film. Examples of the kind of items that might be included in a wider scope documentary film worthy of awards: - Restrepo like footage in multiple locations in Afghanistan - similar footage of the other side (Taliban/AlQaeda or whomever is actually doing the fighting) with interviews on the reasons - interviews with the policy makers in DC explaining what the policies are and why, what they are trying to achieve - compare these goals with what is going on the ground - facts and figures about how much money is being spent on the war (compare to how much is being spent on Afghan aid), start digging into which corporations are making the most profit out of it - look at the cozy ties between retired DoD personnel and defense contractors etc, etc, etc you can just keep pulling at strings forever really... Tie everything into a cohesive narrative, maybe start actually providing answers to the still unanswered question of what we are actually still doing in Afghanistan, and maybe we would have an important documentary film worthy of an award. But a context free year in the life of a US platoon - sorry guys, that just doesn't cut it.</fullReview>

In the end of the film there is a note that 50 American soldiers died in this valley - I wonder how many local people they killed while they were there. I bet a lot more. And, what is the most stupid is that after all this, they retreated from the valley so even their money driven goal was not achieved. I'm afraid that this will turn out to be the scenario for the whole war in Afganistan - politicians and big companies made a lot of money, a lot of innocent of people killed and all for "protecting the land of the free and fake democracy"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RESTREPO is a documentary about US soldiers in the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan, recorded over the period of one year.The Korengal Valley was the most dangerous place in Afghanistan until it was abandoned by US troops. This documentary captures the isolation and the danger equally, though its strength lies in the way it records the soldiers; their rituals, reflections, jokes and professionalism.The films single weakness and greatest strength both stem from outside the Valley. The single weakness of the film is that, we never see these soldiers in a non-war environment. The similar Danish documentary ARMADILLO benefited from the way it showed the soldiers at peace, at war and then returned home. The strength are the post-Afghanistan interviews where the soldiers explain how they felt and how the experiences have changed them. A few of these interviews are simply harrowing.RESTREPO is a good documentary that well deserves the plaudits it has earned.</fullReview>

This is an eye opening documentary film which follows an American platoon for a year in the most dangerous area of Afghanistan - The Korangal Valley. We see the toll the Afghan war takes on a group of young men who have been put in a near impossible position thanks to a bunch of oil greedy politicians. You get to see how close these men get to dying thanks to some fantastic and brave camera work. There are some very upsetting moment as the platoon lose men along the way and Innocent Afghanistan women and children die in the crossfire. How these , or any other men can put themselves through this is beyond me but they have my total respect despite my thought that we should never be in this unwinnable war. 90% of this movie is real footage where the other 10% are interviews with the soldiers. Restrepo is a superb documentary and it's a crying shame that we will never see this directors work again. Tim Hetherington R.I P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just read a complaint ripping this movie apart saying: "The problem I had with this "movie," is that it was not much of a movie at all. It seemed like two guys decided they were going to embed and then make a movie about their experiences, whether there were any experiences to really show. We see a lot of forced shots where the soldiers really have nothing to say" I could not disagree more, as somebody who has spent a significant amount of time being deployed I was happy to see something that came off as real to me. Something that film makers always miss in movies about war is the boredom. War is hell and war is f***in boring! You have to find ways to entertain to yourself when you are there and that is what they did.Aside from saying that soldiers have nothing to say sometimes the facial expressions say it all, soldiers don't always need words to express what they are thinking. The anger that those soldiers had after Restrepo died rang very true for me too especially when they talked about wanting to go out and get payback for what happened. It was cold and real.</fullReview>

Sadly, the film is neither grim, nor funny, nor bloody, or anything more than a mediocre documentary.The film does illustrate how inept the American forces are at negotiation, and the overwhelming emphasis on heavy weapons and air power. Possibly, it could entertain the pride of a nationalistic American, but to the vast majority of the rest of the world, it simply portrays the Americans as expensive buffoons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Over the top"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gritty depiction of the (sur)realities of modern warfare. "the only hope I have is that eventually I will be able to process it differently." These are the words of young men thrust onto the frontier of a conflict for which they have no ideology for or real stake in, except for their own survival of identity and self. Plucked from the suburbs of working class America before been repackaged as fighting machines then sent to one of the most hauntingly beautiful places in the world to play tit-for-tat bombs and bullets ground combat with a people and culture they can not and will not ever relate to at a human level. The embedded reporting is at a hearts and minds level with these troops. Living with them through their daily experiences that gravitate around shoveling rocks around the mountainsides of the valley in order to create an outpost that "is like a big finger sticking up at them (Taliban)" a task that gradually finds rhythm and purpose in between the fire-fights and the monotony of their existence far from home. They are so insulated from the locals (albeit by necessity to a large extent) that from the top level of command down there is not once any effort to reconcile their posting with any external reality. They are doing their "job" for a "1000 dollar a month" pay cheque and dental care. Any passion that they display is confined to the security of their outpost and consists of avenging the death of their comrade Restrepo and "hitting them hard." They do not distinguish the locals from the enemy, and the arrogance that is displayed in the meetings with village elders by the top brass shows how it is impossible for these guys to ever consider the human side of the valley even when during a chaotic patrol/raid they call in air support and end up destroying buildings and innocent lives within in pursuit of the enemy. They never really see the enemy, they hear the enemy (sometimes monkeys), they are told the enemies eyes are on them, watching them from the trees, they cannot see the enemy they obliterate with large caliber gunfire, only witnessing the body falling apart as it is gunned down from distance by one of the specialists form the outpost. There is such a fine line for these guys between reality and "war games" that they get such an adrenaline high from combat, they have no idea how they will reconcile that with returning home eventually. During the day they play around like teenagers, wrestling, slagging each other off, smoking the hours away but "?the fear is always there especially at night...". This group of soldiers have few if any qualms about the political, cultural, economic or human forces and values which are core to this conflict. They never question the fact that they are there, only when they can go home and let the next battalion take over. The mission was one which ended and will always be for them a testament to their fallen comrade and the outpost resurrected and defended in his name, but beyond that there is no achievement for them?except becoming men ? blooded by the US military in a war that has no end, that echoes the clarion calls of the political elite and the industrial military complex that has pushed this war and the concept of terror to the very frontiers of (sur)reality. They return to civilian life battle scarred and proud, but the scars are likely to last a lifetime, pride will raise questions at night, with the nightmares and the sleeping pills.I liked this movie, it is a brilliant war movie, one of the best I have seen. It is hard to believe the USM allowed it to be shot and released. It shows the ideological hollowness of American foreign policy, merely a conduit for the arms industry. It shows the complete lack of cultural sensitivity and assumed primacy of American might and right anywhere it sees fit. The futility of war evident in this movie is akin to WWI over the trenches stuff. What has changed in the past 100 years of war and the incalculable losses incurred by mankind? Have any lessons being learnt? It appears that the lessons learnt are kept for those in power, those who manufacture war and provide a steady stream of toy soldiers and bogey men on the Xbox or through the media for which we can all fight against in our hearts and minds. The technological individuation of western society is clearly evident here, the soldiers using hi- tech weaponry, us the audience using dvds to watch the embedded reporting of a conflict that bears no technologically capable resemblance to the causal factors in loss of life in another war classic, Gallipoli, and I mean that in the sense that we can all see this happening in the wired world, yet it goes on and on, it's going on. We are all telling them "right lads.. over the top, over the top!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting documentary that shows us the human face of a pointless war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Restrepo is an up close and personal documentary about the war in Afghanistan that depicts the day-to-day experiences of combat soldiers of the Second Platoon, Battle Company, 173rd Airborne Brigade as seen through their own eyes. The film has no narration or interpretation by experts, no special effects or background music, only an intimate recording by journalists Hetherington and Junger, who risked their lives to spend fifteen months with the men and to record their activities, some mundane, others hellish.The film is named for the military outpost in the crucial Korengal valley that the American soldiers built to honor one of their fallen friends, a 20-year-old medic, Juan "Doc" Restrepo, who was killed by the Taliban in July, 2007. Hetherington and Junger maintain a non-political stance, focusing only on the men, their courage and camaraderie, the highs and lows, the tedium and endless firefights, and the agony of having to come to terms with loss. Like the atrocity of the war itself, the film seemingly has no beginning and no end, only the end of one phase and the beginning of another, the battle for one rock and then another.As each soldier talks to the camera about their thoughts and feelings, their words convey an unforgettable impact, especially when they describe the terror of a mission called Operation Rock Avalanche, during which they came under the heaviest fire. It is not clear what the men thought about the mission, but what is clear is the bond they forged with each other and the heroism with which they faced the possibility that each new day could be their last. One of the most moving segments of the film is when a young soldier openly expresses his grief when learning of the death of his friend. If you have a heart that's still beating, it will be torn to bits.While the bravery of the men is unquestioned, like soldiers in any war, their focus is on the job in front of them and there is little time for reflection. In an unforgiving terrain, where even the enemy is an abstraction, it is hard to distinguish between "good guys" and "bad guys" and the gunfire is aimed at a mostly unseen foe. At the same time, local farmers, including women and children, are often mistakenly killed by bombs dropped from helicopters, exacerbating strained relations with the local population. Locals are angry and demand money when one of their cows is killed, but only rice, beans, and sugar are offered as compensation along with vague promises about building an infrastructure in the area that will create jobs (what kind of jobs is not discussed).In the midst of this insanity, it is sad is to hear platoon leaders still talking about how war makes boys into men, a theme used throughout history to justify turning recruits who join the military out of love of country, into dehumanized killers. Restrepo is a riveting documentary that shows us the human face of a war that, if it ever had a purpose, has now become completely pointless. To underscore this, we are told that after six years of bleeding and dying, the Korangal Outpost has now been surrendered to the Taliban. A deeply moving film, Restrepo becomes twice as poignant with the knowledge that one of the directors, Tim Hetherington, was killed in Libya only in the last month. We owe him and his co-director an enormous debt of gratitude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Is there any man here that does not know that the seed of war in the modern world is industrial and commercial rivalry?" ? Woodrow WilsonLike most "fly on the wall" war documentaries, "Restrepo" is an exercise in macho sentimentality. The tale of a U.S. Army platoon based in Afghanistan, it unfolds like a typical war movie, alternating between moments of downtime, and moments of tense, adrenaline pumping violence. Simple military values and emotions are then espoused ? sacrifice, heroism, male bonding, the frustrations and drudgery of killing an unseen enemy ? the end result being a narrative arc designed to make you feel sad for what our boys, and their zillions of dollars worth of hardware, must endure in the name of spreading "freedom". It's Kipling's "White Man's Burden" posing as objectivity.The soldiers themselves are the usual assortment of jar-heads; most view war as a rights of passage, a chance to prove their manhood, define themselves, go on an adventure and do "something important". These are trivial reasons to enlist, but the military has always been a cultic institution, preying on the anxieties and insecurities of the young."Armadillo" pretends to be apolitical, but the very act of avoiding all context is itself a firm ideological stance. What the film ignores is the fact that the Taliban have been deliberately dehumanised by the West for a number of decades. They are painted as irrational fanatics, intolerant fundamentalists, bearded extremists, and terrorists. This, of course, paves the way for aggression, war, and genocide, all of which are waged under the guise of collective self-defence. Killing the Taliban is then celebrated as a legal virtue. To leave the Taliban in control of Afghanistan, says the US and NATO, is to leave a haven for terrorism.Yet before 9/11, these same "terrorists" were Washington's close allies. They were funded, supported and hailed as "freedom fighters" who with "our help" would be able to fend off the Soviet Union, whom the American public were told sought to destroy Afghanistan. Under the pretext that the Afghan government was a Soviet puppet, which was false, the then Carter Administration authorised the covert funding of opposition tribal groups. These groups were armed and trained in secret camps set up in Pakistan by the CIA.Thus was born "mujaheddin", a campaign of terror which resulted in the Afghan government in Kabul requesting the help of the Soviet Union, resulting in an ill-fated military intervention which ended ten years later with the retreat of Soviet forces and the descent of Afghanistan into an abyss of religious intolerance, poverty, warlordism and violence. So contrary to "official history", the mujaheddin did not arise in response to a hostile Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union intervened at the request of the Afghan government in response to the instability being wrought by a US funded and armed insurgency. See Nicaragua, Syria, Iraq and Libya.After 9/11, the White House then turned against the very "allies" they supported, a pattern which we find occurring throughout history. Think Washington's funding of Saddam Hussein against Iran, prior to sweeping in and wiping him out decades later. In the case of the Taliban, the justification for their newfound status as "our enemies" became their supposed links to the WTC attacks and their sudden "oppression of women". In reality the Taliban had nothing to do with 9/11, and were the White House concerned about women's rights they wouldn't be close allies with countless other counties, most notably Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, both of which practise an "Islamic Law" akin to the Taliban.The real reason for the West's change of stance toward Afghanistan? During the mid 90s several mega oil corporations began to seduce the Taliban, all seeking approval to build pipelines across the country. Eventually the deal came down to a handful of corporations, the Unocal-CentGas consortium (which later "became" Chevron, and which has ties to the Bush family and Dick Cheney) and Bridas (an Argentine company). While negotiations were underway, Bridas found a partner in gas giant Amoco and Amoco itself went on to merge with British Petroleum. Throw in the fact that Gazprom, a Russian gas company, pulled out of the Unocal-CentGas consortium and that Unocol's proposed pipeline was closed to Afghanistan, whilst that proposed by Bridas would also service the local market, and it looked likely that the Taliban would strike business deals with Bridas. In response, Unocal and its lackeys stepped up their game. Their Vice President of International Relations appeared before the US Congress in February 1998, basically calling for the removal of the Taliban regime. The Taliban themselves were issued an ultimatum: take our offer or we drop the bombs. Meanwhile, cue the Clinton administration's sudden concern about "human right violations" in Afghanistan, the seizing of all US-held Taliban assets, the placement of trade bans, and the calling for the "surrender of Bin Laden". In other words, it was only when absolute control of oil was challenged that the Taliban regime was openly discredited.Although the Taliban continued to offer negotiations on the handover of Osama bin Laden, the atrocities of 9/11 gave Washington oil policies a convenient new all-inclusive justification. Oil motivations, never a popular foreign-policy justification, could now be submerged within a primal response to a deep-seated national combination of fear, loathing and outrage.Incidentally, drug trafficking constitutes the third largest global commodity after oil and the arms trade. Afghanistan produces 92 percent of the world's opium, the profits of which are laundered back to the West or channelled toward corrupt chieftains and locals. The longer the war can be prolonged, the more these 3 industries profit. Unsurprisingly, most of the major White House players during this era were affiliated with oil companies active in Central Asia (Condolezza Rice, Bush, Zalmay Khalilzad, Hamid Karzai, Cheney, Donald Evans, Gale Norton, Spencer Abraham, Thomas White etc).6/10 ?

		<fullReview>Co-Directors Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger's gripping Oscar- nominated documentary "Restrepo" does not rest in exhibiting a US Army platoon in deployment fighting for their lives and their country in a deadly valley in Afghanistan. And that valley happens to be one of the most dangerous places on earth, the Korengal Valley; which is inhabited by a Taliban ready to maliciously strike American soldiers at any cause. These Taliban scumbags even put their wives and sons for cover when confronted by American soldiers in battle so the Americans can cease fire. Hetherington and Junger spent a year with the platoon in the Korengal Valley depicting the soldiers' lives in a treacherous land. The platoon build an outpost in the Korengal called OP Restrepo, named after Juan "Doc" Restrepo; who was a soldier in their platoon who unfortunately was killed in the line of fire early during their deployment. And of course, who the documentary was also named after. Juan "Doc" Restrepo was a Columbian-American who grew up in Pembroke Pines, located in South Florida. The documentary's first scene shows a confident and bit tipsy Restrepo filming his platoon mates and himself with a hand-held camera in an Italian train, just weeks before their deployment. Hetherington and Junger don't shy away in filming low points of a soldier's daily life in rigorous battlegrounds in "Restrepo". Those scenes provoke an even greater appreciation in admiring our soldiers. Moreover, it made me want to slap myself silly why in the world I got ticked off at that driver that cut me off this afternoon. I hope you know the point I am driving at. Hetherington and Junger also interview the soldiers a year after their Korengal tour-of-duty; and through their retelling of the Korengal nightmare, it actually becomes the documentary's primary narration in a documentary that has no voice-over narration. "Restrepo" is very difficult to watch at times because of the profound authenticity of it all, but nevertheless should be watched by all, especially teenagers. Not so much to invoke the "war is hell" message to teens but to provide them a humane appreciation lesson. Sadly enough, Tim Hetherington was recently killed in Libya while filming conflict there. Hetherington was an acclaimed photojournalist besides being a documentarian. As a brave solider, he also risked his life for his country; but he did it in order for individuals to get a clearer picture on the atrocities of modern-day war. And like Juan "Doc" Restrepo and other brave soldiers who risk their lives for their country, Tim will not be forgotten, and neither should his co-directed documentary "Restrepo". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my friends and family ask me what deploying to Afghanistan was like, this is the movie I tell them to watch. I have never seen so accurate a depiction of modern soldiers on operations as I have in this movie.I have completed two tours in Afghanistan with the Canadian army, both times in outside the wire capacities as a member of a Force Protection platoon and as a member of the Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Team. The interactions and actions of the locals, the "magic line" you cross and can be shot at after, the shuras, the incidents, the injured civvies... This movie had me riveted and I cannot recommend it enough.Some say "Generation Kill" is the depiction of the modern soldier at war; it's not. It's a taste of it. This documentary and the events, action, reactions and depictions of the soldiers is real. If you want to know about the war and what it's like in Afghanistan, this is you movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film follows a platoon of US soldiers building an outpost in the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan. Cinema verite-style, we see them shoot at the Taliban, search a home, interrogate individuals, meet with village elders, enjoy leisure time and get killed. There are also some interviews with surviving soldiers later. My impression of the war from this film is that if this is the way we are fighting terrorism, it has got to be the slowest and costliest way to do it.One soldier dies on camera (or rather, he is caught on camera right afterward). The reaction to this is poignant. Even more depressing is a scene in which the soldiers visit a home after a US helicopter has dropped a bomb on it. We see a dead child and several injured people. The soldiers don't seem to be particularly upset, although their captain expresses regret and anxiety in a later interview. In several meetings with villagers, soldiers seem brusque while listening to complaints ranging from a request for money for a villager's cow the soldiers apparently ate and the number of innocent civilians killed by a previous platoon. I began to think that public relations skills must not be part of the training at West Point. And this was when they were being filmed--what is it like when the camera isn't there? The captain talks about how the villagers will get a road and jobs, as if this is more important than someone's child who was killed.I wondered as I watched the film how many of the soldiers portrayed understand how the India-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir, or the U.S.'s support for Israel's war against the Palestinians, or the US's support of the dictatorships of Egypt and Saudi Arabia led to Sept. 11 and created the conditions that led to their being in Afghanistan and their comrades getting killed. If any of them find out this information, my guess is they might be very, very angry. The interviews help us learn more about some of the individual soldiers, but not much. Some have been deeply affected by their experience, but it isn't clear if they learned much from it. Overall, the film is touching and at times riveting, but also frustrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Restrepo - Special Viewing at Ft. Benning, GA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin this review, I would like to let all combat veteran readers know that I will be discussing scenes from a film I recently had the honor of screening. It is about combat in Afghanistan. It's entitled: Restrepo.It is powerful. It is raw. It is real.General Robert E. Lee once said that "to be a good soldier you must love the Army. But to be a good officer, you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love. That is...a very hard thing to do. No other profession requires it. That is one reason why there are so very few good officers. Although, there are many good men." In the 2010 Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize Winning film, "Restrepo" we are given both of these vehicles, both good men and good officers, that deliver an emotionally packed combat story that will stay with me for a long time.3 elements still remain with me after seeing this film: command, loss, and love. Here's what I mean.CommandTaking charge or taking command is all about standing alone and being totally responsible. From the opening scenes of this film, Captain (CPT) Dan Kearney, company commander of Battle Company, 2d Battalion, 503d Parachute Infantry Regiment lets you know that it is "his area of operations" and he is here to "make a difference." He says this, all the while knowing, that he will have to fight with constraining "rules of engagement"and always attempt to minimize collateral damage while fighting an enemy that does not wear a uniform, mixes in with innocent civilians, and attacks from the safety of mosques and other protected sites. Still knowing all this, every day, CPT Kearny accepts the weight of his command and continues to do his job. I wonder how many corporate CEOs, with all their privilege and perks, could hold up to the scrutiny of this type of leadership challenge? The average U.S. CEO is 56 years of age and is compensated in the millions of dollars. CPT Kearney was less than 30 when this film was shot. He laughed with his men, he fought along side them, and even had to direct them to grieve when they lost a buddy. When that was accepted, he reminded them that they still had a job to do. Fate smiled on me during this special screening, because Captain Kearney (now a Major) was present at the theater and took questions after the credits finished rolling. He was even more impressive in real life. Again, here is a professional that gives all the credit to his soldiers, yet accepts responsibility for things that don't always go his way. After the Q&amp;A ended, I had to tell him how much I valued his service. When I got my chance, I shook his hand, thanked him for setting such a great example, and that my favorite part of the film was the beginning, where he accepted responsibility for what he had been charged with. He didn't miss a beat. His reply was humbly, "thank you sir. You'll never know how much that means to us." With such a selfless response from a young man that had endured so much, I realized that it had been a while since I had stood in the presence of a real leader; better yet a Commander.You can read the remainder on my website at Warrior Life Coach dot com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Santayana said it best, and a documentary like this one drives home the point: those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it. Brainwashed by first-person shooter video games and living in a schizophrenic society like this one, the young men in RESTREPO are shown learning the lessons soldiers have learned throughout history (see my first sentence). I watched this one yesterday- not long after seeing a segment of DEMOCRACY NOW! about the Rolling Stone cover story, "The A-Team Killings." Like the COLLATERAL MURDER video, the article in question brings to light atrocities committed by American soldiers. In RESTREPO, we see naive young men, armed to the teeth, waging war against poor people who live in mud and stone homes with corrugated tin roofs held up by wooden support beams. They rarely express doubts about what they're doing (until they see firsthand the Reality of being on the receiving end) and they remind me of the young soldiers I used to ferry to and from nearby military bases. I would invariably ask these soldiers WHY they enlisted and I always got the same three answers: 1) It was a job that PAID. 2) It provided training for when they got out of the military. 3) They got to "drive tanks and kill some sand n-----s." AND: every single one of them said that George W. Bush was- and I quote-: "An a--hole." (An update, for those who care: Israel has already bombed Syria, despite Obama's attempt(s) at Diplomacy.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I completely disagree with the above review. If the Junger and Hetherington want to make a documentary - they are perfectly entitled to make it the way they see fit, and if they chose not to become the immersed in politics of the conflict then so be it. If you want to see that kind of documentary - switch on the History Channel any night of the week. The viewer gets right into the action in 'Restrepo' with the soldiers and it has given many a young person second thoughts about joining the military. That in itself is praise enough for this awesome documentary on man's inhumanity to man. The action shots are superb and real - you do not want any of the soldiers to be hurt because you get to know them as the film progresses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging document of that place at that time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a handful of documentaries around Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years and even if I hadn't, the news networks do a very good job of providing constant footage from the front lines. With this flow of information there is the risk that one gets used to it, that seeing soldiers in a firefight is perhaps not as astonishing as it was and that the stories of one group of soldiers versus another doesn't really stand out as something different or worth seeking out. Restrepo rises above that problem by virtue of how good the access is and how intense the fighting is in the specific part of Afghanistan they are in.The film doesn't seem to have an agenda that it pushes to the point where it drags the footage behind it in the way some narrator-led films can. There is a point (or points) that are almost impossible not to take away from watching it, but the film lets you get there on your own as you watch. The downside of this approach is that it does sit back and just watch ? not adding structure or constant narration to fill in the details and hold our hand, even contributions after the fact are pretty limited. This wasn't a massive problem from my point of view but I can understand why some would feel it was. Generally though this "in it" feel works very well, producing a sense of intimacy which the nature of the guys really fosters. The footage is tremendous whether it be inside meetings with locals or in the middle to a firefight, it is technically impressive but also harrowing and engaging.It isn't the perfect film though, because it does feel sparse in a way that works for it and slightly against it. The viewer is allowed to see everything but without too much discussion or probing we are not really sure how these guys coped and what effect it had on them afterwards, so there is still that divide that understandably no amount of close footage can close. It is well worth seeing though for just how good the access is and how clear and simple their documenting of this place and this time is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Restrepo (2010) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Filmmakers Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger spent time with a platoon of U.S. soldiers as they were placed on a tour in the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan, which is considered one of the deadliest places you could go. Throughout the year the filmmakers were able to capture a wide range of events and emotions including the men losing friends, going into battles without the necessary tools and also having to deal with locals who many have families fighting with the Taliban. RESTREPO has a clear anti-war message that might rub some the wrong way but I think the majority of people, no matter what side of the debate they're on, should enjoy this documentary for a number of reasons but the biggest is the fact that it really gets you into a platoon and so close to the action and I'd say it does this more than any film before it. Yes, Hollywood has pumped out countless war pictures going with platoons on missions but this one here is real and the violence is real. I think some of the most dramatic scenes are of course the ones where the soldiers come under attack because it gives you a clear idea of the terror and confusion going on when someone is fired upon. There's one scene where a soldier is killed during a battle and just seeing what follows with his friends seeing him die is without a doubt very powerful. The most interesting footage comes during meetings between the soldiers and the actual people of this village, many of whom are upset with the death of their children, family or friends. In one of the strangest scenes, one Afghan man is upset because the soldiers killed his cow after it was caught up in one of their safety wires. RESTREPO is a must see simply because of the access the filmmakers had and of course the stories of the men who knowingly walk into dangerous and deadly battles each day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film as itself is very good. It contains scenes of actual fighting, which are not so often seen in documentaries. On the other hand, as a viewer one must start thinking about the conflict the film depicts. When you look at "the Dead cow scene", this is where the flow of my mind goes the other way. At first, I had sympathy for the soldiers in this film. Afterwards, when you see how they laugh at the man whose cow they have killed, and offer him "beans, rice and flour in the weight of the dead cow" as a compensation... Then you start thinking on what are those people looking for in Afghanistan, why are they not at home in the US? A very strong sentiment of rage goes through your body after wards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These are the men that John Wayne pretended to be. The cameraman put himself in harm's way to make this documentary. The Korengal Valley where these men spent 15 months was ground zero for the Afghani theater at the time this was filmed.The men were in half a dozen fire fights every day. The name of the film comes from a soldier who was dearly beloved by his comrades in arms. He died in combat during the filming, and, in his honor, his fellows named a god-forsaken lump of rock after him. The making of the outpost Restrepo cost the United States 50 soldiers, and, in the end, we left that spot behind. The power of this film comes from the portraits of these real soldiers, just kids, who are fighting and dying for the United States on a cold, barren, hostile jut of rock far from home. They serve without complaining, without pity, without much venom toward anyone. They are tough guys who do the job. No politics, no doctrine. It's a job they do professionally, and you have to admire them for it.They pay a high price to serve the rest of the country which has zero appreciation for their sacrifice, but they do so with high spirits and an intense bond between them.This film is one of the five documentaries nominated for the 2010 Oscar. It is a moving, exceptional film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing. You are literally dropped into a war zone. Heck, on the drive up the the base the cameraman gets hit by an IED and the squad gets attacked! Sure, this documentary talks about American soldiers only, but that's what it's about. This documentary is not about war. It is about life as an American soldier. And it's a damned good one too. I wish they were to have more.... Objectives. It seemed that a large part of the movie was just guys sitting around digging holes and then taking fire. There was not a lot of blood. Many parents tend to think war movie == blood and gore. This is not the case. The blood is very minimal. There was no close quarters combat either. Everyone was always pretty far away. Some scenes seemed like they were firing into nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare inside look at the young soldiers task fighting in Afghanistan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched it on Netflix streaming video.This documentary resides with an Army platoon for its 15 month assignment in the Korangal Valley, sometimes referred to as the most dangerous place on Earth. One of the young men we see in opening footage, traveling by train, is 'Doc' Restrepo. In early fighting in Afghanistan he is killed, and when the platoon moves into the valley to occupy a new outpost on a ridge, in his honor they name it 'Outpost Restrepo.' This is a worthwhile documentary, a rare glimpse into the lives of young men, many looking like mere boys, as they carry out their orders. Even the Capatain in command looks to be 25 or 26 years old, probably a recent graduate of West Point or a college ROTC program.The video is realistic, the shooting is real, and when yet another friend gets killed in fighting some find it hard to keep their composure. It puts war into a personal perspective.What struck me most, however, is the relative absurdity of American troops trying to discuss logic with the Afghanistan elders (non-Taliban) in their weekly meetings. The Captain wants to assure them that they will benefit when the road is built, when the Taliban are defeated. But the elders want to discuss why their cow was killed, and why apparently innocent citizens are sometimes killed.Or the exchange with the young man, who with his father is a goat farmer, when asked in he had any information about the Taliban, "If we give you any information they will kill us." I believe the most difficult task for Americans trying to accomplish anything in foreign countries, like Iraq or Afghanistan, is the hurdle of trying to identify with what they think and believe, what their priorities are. Our troops just don't have a very good way of doing that, and this documentary shows that very clearly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Restrepo is intense and insane, there will be moments in the film where you simply can't believe that it's real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Restrepo is a brilliantly strange experience; on the one hand the harrowing documentary is powerful enough to chew your face off while you're watching it, on the other hand the bizarreness of the unfolding situations borderline on an incredibly dark parody.The suggestive editing threads a narrative through the insanity, and offers an underlining current of cynical gallows humour throughout. Meanwhile, amidst the bleak absurdity of war, we bond with these guys, these regular blokes, as they go about their lives, not exactly living but defiantly surviving in the deadliest valley in Afghanistan. This is a film that is well worth experiencing, as it will undoubtedly change your perspective on war and the lives of soldiers, far more effectively than any Hollywood effort. But be prepared to be pulled in a hundred different directions emotionally, as the film will throw you into intense, horrifying battles, comedic downtime, and heart wrenching moments of loss and pain, giving you a glimpse of the kind of disorientation the soldiers themselves experienced. There will be moments in the film where you simply can't believe that it's real, and moments where you can only laugh at the mind-boggling other-worldliness of it all, and yet it is one of the most real experiences it's possible to have in a safe, comfortable cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a critic nor a soldier. If I really like a movie I may rarely comment on what I enjoyed and why. This movie had an intense affect on me. The intense close up battle scenes and the emotional scares we watch being slowly burned into these men really got to me. Knowing what your seeing is real only makes this more intense and personal.This movie provides a more intimate experience than we are used to from other war documentaries. You feel for all the characters. You don't just watch this movie, you feel it. The gritty realism during this film makes this a must see for anyone who wants to know what war really looks like and to an extent feels like. I found myself watching the eyes of the men and how they change dramatically when battles would ensue, emotions flared and people died or people killed. Their enemy is mixed in with civilians and part of their job is negotiations with the village elders. The futility of the negotiations is also a rare glimpse into the war to "win hearts and minds"... I could not help thinking the promises offered to the elders seemed lofty and unrealistic. I thought many things during the film. I wondered if the road was worth the lives and cost to these men. I do not beleieve this movie is political on purpose. Certainly political arguments can be drawn from it. People will take different things from it. To me it only bolstered my detain for war, this one included. Others may leave feeling patriotic or both. But I guarantee you will feel something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Sebastian Junger spent over a year embedded with the Second Platoon, Battle company, 173rd Airborne Brigade, to them their full title, as they are posted to the Korangal Valley in Afghanistan. CNN declared the area the most dangerous place on the planet and the documentary highlights the dangers of the mission.Filmed in Cinéma vérité style, there is little construct to the film as such as it follows the men as they head deeper into the valley and further into danger. Interspersed with the footage are talking heads with some of the troops recalling their time there. The Korangal is a a Taliban stronghold and the Brigade are under constant threat of attack, in fact the very opening scene shows them ambushed on the road. This constant fear of attack shows among the men during the talking heads, it is clear that the mission, one fraught with dangers has taken a heavy toll on the psyche's of these men, some of them incredibly young.Several of the soldiers die, which also takes it's toll, especially later in the film when they delve deeper into the hills and are attacked unexpectedly, with one of their men down, there is a incomprehensible notion that you should grieve, yet you must continue to battle as the gunfire around you continues.The film as been portrayed as a 'real life' The Hurt Locker', which seems a little unfair a comparison, both film portray different situations and to be honest I felt this was actually less engaging. With so many soldiers, it's difficult to know who is who during some footage and so it less compelling trying to work out who is who. There are however scenes of interest. The continual passion within to keep going these men have is incredible, even in the most dire of circumstances. Interactions with locals provide an insight of how difficult and how vastly different the cultures are, and there are scenes of camaraderie and fun among the men to try to make the best of what they have- dancing to pop songs and filming it.Yet it also shows just what an alien world the armed forces are to many, it is a different world and it also suggests that many men there are there only because they no choice, a living with a guarantee wage and no guarantee of coming back alive or intact, physically or mentally. The talking head interviews provide a greater insight into those few that are interviewed; behind the stiff upper lip and possible reserve of what may be said on camera, there is pain behind the eyes of these men that no-one else will comprehend. It's this I found more interesting and it's a shame there wasn't a little more of it which would have made this more powerful.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding documentary!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard many good reports about this documentary recently and so I was surprised when it turned up on TV only a few months after its release. Of course it was immediately put into the planner and subsequently recorded for a viewing. It's well worth a watch if you can catch it, really compelling and pretty scary in places too! I guess I'd better tell you what it's about first (summary haters please wait back at 'The Kop' for the duration of the next paragraph).This film tells the story of the Second Platoon and their fifteen month deployment in one of Afghanistan's most strategically crucial valleys, Korangal. Their main base is called 'The Kop', but they need an outpost which they build and name 'Restrepo' after a soldier, Doc Restrepo, who was killed early in the film. The main focus of the film is on the soldiers and their day-to-day battle against the Taliban. But it also gives us an insight into the lives of the soldiers and what motivates them to do what they do.I really enjoyed this film, it has many highs and lows, but over all it gives an fascinating insight into the American operations in Afghanistan. If I have one criticism, it's that it did tend to get a little repetitive. But I can forgive that, it's an outstanding documentary, at times you feel like you're another member of the platoon fighting alongside them. Hats off to those guys and also to the filmmakers. Highly recommended.My score: 8.2/10</fullReview>

The deployment lasted 15 months and was at one of the most dangerous places on earth - certainly the most dangerous place, at the time, for US forces: the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. Journalist Sebastian Junger and photojournalist Tim Hetherington were embedded with the 2nd Platoon of B Company and captured their daily lives, the action, the military strategy, the interaction with the community and the tragedy.An engaging documentary that captures very well the intensity, suddenness and randomness of combat, and what it can do to those involved. We also see the diplomatic complexities that the US forces have to overcome, as they try to keep the civilian population onside while at the same time treating them with suspicion and occasionally accidentally injuring them and/or disrupting their lives. The trauma of taking casualties, especially fatalities, is well explored, as is the bond between the soldiers which makes the casualties harder to take.A well-made, bravely-filmed documentary with no political agenda (which is a good thing).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great insight look at what U.S soldiers in combat go through, every-day. A very intense documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I fear no evil. Welcome to the suck! Directed by American journalist Sebastian Junger, this documentary tells the story of American troops stationed in the Korengal Valley in northeastern Afghanistan during the Afghan War of the early 21th century. At the time of this film was made, Korengal Valley was one of the most deadly active combat zone in U.S military history. Filmed during the 2007/2008 years of the War in Afghanistan. The film takes a fly-on-the-wall approach, by showing how the men of Battle Company 2nd of the 503rd Infantry Regiment 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team run the area, as they try to negotiations with the local people, construction of an advanced outpost, as well as the challenges and intermittent firefights they face. Interspersed between stock footage of action, are interviews with the soldiers themselves as they look back on what they did right and wrong, and how it affected them. The emotional distress that the soldiers went, through is very haunting. It's really hard to watch them, talk about certain mission, such as Operation Rock Avalanche, due to its tragic consequences. The movie use close up, during the interviews, so well, that you can see the expressions on their faces, not realizing or understanding how they're going to live with this experience for the rest of their lives. Nothing is "candy coated". Just pure, raw energy, bravery, and emotion. While, the combat footage doesn't show, any of the enemy. You can really, tell, how, their unseen presence, affect the soldiers, there. They hardly any down time, in the beginning. I'm awe-inspired by their courage under fire, even if, most of the time, they shooting bullets at ghosts. However, there were some funny parts to lighten up the film toward the middle and the end. The exchange between the elders of the village and the soldiers, about a shot cow was somewhat humorous to witness. Why in the living hell, would the captain think that the locals would take a small bag of rice and beans, over steak, would work!? It's really unbelievable funny, how na?ve, the captain is. However, the scene where the troops are celebrating on being alive, dancing to Samantha Fox's song, "Touch me" was fun to watch. Still, the movie's shaking cam is a bit of a headache to watch. You can barely figure out, what's going on and to whom, half the time. There are just way too many men for this documentary to cover. I really didn't to know, most of them, that well. It doesn't help that the movie footage is full of military jargon and acronyms. There is a lack of subtlety within the language. It doesn't help, that some of the documentary footage, makes, the morals of the soldiers, somewhat look questionable. Lots of over-violent aggressive masculine being shown here, rather than winning the hearts &amp; minds heroics. It's also weird to see, that most of them, have little to no idea, why they're fighting here. The movie doesn't once, address their views of the war. They never address, if their actions, are doing good or not. Other things, that the film fails to talk about, is the legal basis of their occupation like actions. In truth, the army has little to no legal right to order the Afghan citizens around. It's the job of the local police. The movie shows great examples of the loss of communications, between the local tribes and those of the U.S military. You really do, see, the villagers' perspective, in safety when it comes to protecting their families and clan members. From their point of view, the presence of the U.S. military hasn't made their lives more secure. Quite the opposite; their presence endangers them, and no amount of money from the military can change, their opinion on it. It a sign of really bad leadership, when the only way, to solve a problem is to toss money at it. You really do see the lack of cultural sensitivity and empathy within the soldiers. Never once, did the documentary, show the soldiers trying to understand, Afghan culture and why they live, the way, they do. It also hurts to see, the soldiers rarely showing empathy when it comes to accidentally innocent civilians. You would think, they would be more apologetic. Things like that, could be, our undoing there, if we don't address them. In the end, U.S. military did had pulls out of the Korengal Valley, because fail to win the heart &amp; minds of the locals. Still, it's not too late for, building relationship with the whole country. Overall: While, some critics see this film as an American jingoism propaganda. Others see it as an objective movie about the war in Afghanistan. In my opinion, it's both, anti-war and patriotic. It's a gritty depiction of the (sur) realities of modern warfare. A must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Restrepo" is a documentary from Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger and it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Shortly after this film debuted, Hetherington was killed while filming another military documentary in Libya. This isn't at all surprising, as the filmmakers were clearly in very dangerous territory while making these front line battle films.The film consists of following the 2nd platoon, Battle Company in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. This was one of the most dangerous places any of the US military units could be at that time and the film chronicles the unit's action--including firefights, losses of troops in action and everyday activities. The name Restrepo, by the way, is the name of the company's camp--which was named after a member who lost his life in Afghanistan. Overall, it's an interesting film...but. I say BUT because there are other similar films which were made in Afghanistan in recent years. So, there's sort of a 'been there/done that' feel to the movie--though it is well made and I really respect the filmmakers for putting themselves in this place and for making a very tense film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Verissimo Look at Men on the Battlefield</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene of the youngsters in a transport plane, goofing and laughing about 'going off to war,' to later scenes of some wondering what the hell they are doing, we get an honest picture of young men in a battlefield ? sometimes grunt labor, digging in rocky soil, sometimes guy-on-guy semi erotic rough housing, sometimes scary foot patrols at night. Two particularly informing sequences have one soldier talking about the "high" of being shot at:"You can't get a better high. It's like crack, you know. You can sky-dive, or bungee jump, or do kayak, you know. But once you've been shot at, you really can't come down? You can't top that."In the other one of the youngsters loses control of himself, scrambling and sobbing when they find the body of one of their best fighters. It's a credit to the film makers, and the Army, that this was included.Full review at http://www.allinoneboat.org/2015/04/15/restrepo- documenting-soldiers-in-a-war/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film - What a war documentary should look like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished reviewing "The Hornet's Nest," another film by a father and son journalist team, and I explained how I wished it was more like "Restrepo" and "Korengal."This film was everything I hoped it would be and much, much more. The footage is all original and the film is completely immersed in the environment that the soldiers are in ? what their bonds are like with one another ? and how they'd all do anything for the men on their left and right ? so that they could all make it back home.As a journalist, I really appreciated how this film focused entirely on the soldiers and the war, letting the soldiers tell the viewer everything, rather than the filmmakers getting on-camera and explaining it to the viewer. That is where my critique of "The Hornet's Nest" was scathing. That film got in the way of itself, cutting back to the journalists constantly so they could get face time with the audience. I'd rather see it done how Restrepo approached this, asking the soldiers the questions and letting them answer ? letting them supply the narrative, exclusively.Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lone Survivor film was loaded with fabrication in part because of Marcus Luttrell's blatant lies and warped brain because he was obsessed with media and liberal people in general. Quite interesting Tejas outlook. His book didn't even spell the name of his operation correctly and it was downhill from there. He started fabricating the book story and this led to further fabrication of the storyline for the film director. And obviously Hollywood had to mickey-up the deal further. Basically the last 1/3 of the film is not what happened. In contrast Restrepo is the opposite, a refreshing, honest look at military battle in Afghanistan (they didn't cook the books and say they fought 200 Talibans to make themselves look like a super hero). I HIGHLY recommend this film. You won't be disappointed. Sebastian Junger is a true professional. Most of the folks at movie theater stood up and clapped when helicopter extracted them from the valley. It was good to see the boys smiling before entering the copter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt this film documentary was a realistic depiction of the war in Afghanistan at the detail grass roots level. This is not a broad overview ? it is a view of American soldiers (a platoon) in a very remote area of Afghanistan. These soldiers don't care about the country of Afghanistan and they don't care about grand strategy whether it be directed by George Bush, Barack Obama, Stephen Harper or NATO. They just want to get out of there and get back home. They obviously have little empathy or understanding of the people of Afghanistan.There are scenes of the soldiers (who are mostly young) dealing with the village elders. It is obvious that they have little in common with each other and the communication for 'hearts and minds' is futile. Also the wildness and harshness of the location has something to do with this lack of connection for the soldiers.Don't look at this film for any great accomplishments in Afghanistan? there are none. I believe this to be one of the strengths of the film because this is what the soldiers seem to experience themselves. But the documentary does provide you some stunning insights of what it is like to be a soldier in a remote and foreboding country. The Restrepo outpost was abandoned sometime after this documentary was completed. There are some soldiers who were killed while this film was made and it makes for emotional viewing.The hand-held camera used through-out was jerky because the camera person and the soldiers were being shot at.Watch the special outtakes on the DVD for more on the interviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Subtle Incrimination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The filmmakers weren't determined to make an anti-War film, but what they reveal is the most pathetic aspects of today's armed forces: the boyish, obnoxious young men who go off to war like summer camp in an era when battles are won or lost behind the lines. The media reported the occasional combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan like soldiers never die at war, and the boy scout soldiers in Restrepo are ceremoniously devoted to that presumption, memorializing their fallen comrade in a sandbag fort that accomplishes nothing except a handful of deaths: soldiers, civilians, Taliban rebels? does it really matter? The enlisted soldiers seem youthful and sometimes innocent, like we might actually find their deaths to be unfortunate, while the sated, ratlike face of the West Point lieutenant in charge of the outpost shows just how irresponsible today's Army might actually be. "Do I look like I f***ing care?" the lieutenant ejaculates in response to concerns of Afghani villagers. Later, some innocent children die in a misguided air raid. The lieutenant reflects to the camera that it's hard, you know, we're supposed to be fighting them, but we're not fighting them? them, you know, the Afghanis, the oppressed people who may or may not support the regime that may or may not have sponsored terrorist activity. The tragedy of the Bush wars was that the 9/11 attacks weren't undertaken by a nation against whom we should have declared war, but nothing less than two endless wars seemed sufficient for retaliation.</fullReview>

Two filmmakers, Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, are embedded with a platoon in the deadliest valley of Afghanistan. The two filmmakers spend a year with the Second Platoon as they battle al-Qaeda and Taliban strongholds in the dreaded Korengal Valley, where the fighting is crucial and surreal. The soldiers painfully push on with break-back effort, fierce firefights and extraordinary precision in their battle with the Taliban. The besieged squad dubbed their outpost in the honor of their fallen comrade PFC Juan Restrepo. Every shot fired seemed to be of personal nature and each target hit a payback to Restrepo.

		<fullReview>I just got finished watching Restrepo, a documentary centered around a platoon of soldiers stationed in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, deemed as the most dangerous location on Earth. The base that the soldiers stay in is named after a fallen comrade, and the film focuses on the daily lives of the soldiers who reside here, rather than that of the politics of the war. It's sort of like The Hurt Locker of documentaries.It's an ambitious and quick paced project from directors Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, and the focus centered on all the soldiers is a fascinating viewpoint, and serves as a fine character study. Sure, sometimes the film feels a little too brisk, and the "War is Hell" sub-moral can be a bit repetitious, but Junger and Hetherington make up for that with the footage they obtained.The footage is raw, powerful, and devastating to watch, and beautifully edited by Michael Levine, and mixed by sound designer Coll Anderson, leaving room for some real food for thought, as the terror and chaos of each soldier starts to come out in full force. And each soldier who goes there leaves a changed man, if they're one of those who survives. It's a riveting film that moves quickly, and never gets too preachy. It's likely one of the best documentaries I'll see all year.I give Restrepo *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slice of life war documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recent (say in the last ten years) Fiction films about war, BLACK HAWK DOWN for example, have taken the same approach this films takes. The men are men doing a "job" and earn our respect on that level. The fact they do "the job" is what earns our respect. The fact that War isn't your usual job is not questioned, not by the filmmakers or by the men doing the job.Part of the job is not to question the job and you don't do a lot of debating while you're either hiding or shooting to save your own life. That's more of a Hollywood idea of war than reality anyway it would seem.This keeps the film from being political, so doesn't alienate people who are pro or con to the specific war the movie might be about.So this fits into our modern war film approach comfortably on that level. Does it need more than a slice of life approach to be fascinating and tension filled? Not really, if it's done well enough and this film is very well done. The men interviewed talk about being disturbed but they way they talk is real, one guy who can't really sleep at all since actually smiles through his this part of his interview, hiding his horror behind telling something he finds embarrassing. This is so different than the "acted" stories of war we get in movies traditionally and such.Could the film have let us know some history to the valley the men are stuck in or try to let us in tactically a little more from a distance. Probably could have, though bits of this are filled in by the troops as they are the new group in the area and some past mistakes haunt them and they repeat some of those same mistakes. War isn't really a clean job after all or a nice one.The central battle has very little footage, obviously the cameramen were hiding for their lives so that section is a series of very very close up talking heads, the professionally detached talking heads of those involved and their armor does crack as they get into it, the little actual footage of the battle shows the real raw reactions.This is making the best of a bad situation for the filmmakers, but it does rob us the horrid experience of the initial attack.No enemy dead are shown at all in the film, only some collateral damage victims. This, it could be argued, is slanted a bit from the filmmakers point of view, or of course is just a limitation of their "embedded" status with their troops. Perhaps, the film suggests, they rarely see the enemy up close in this particular valley fight. Perhaps, but they aren't shown for whatever reason. Likewise there is scant footage of some of those U.S. troops who die when they are alive. This does also take away some emotional connection. And frankly when everyone wears the same uniform and has the same haircut it does get confusing at a few points as to who is who.Some of the footage is very crudely recorded, shaky/grainy to a distracting degree--to be expected, but don't sit too close in the theater. It's edited and assembled very well, if there is/are movie tricks, and certainly there are, in terms of "faking" reaction shots or re-ordering events to make it more dramatic---it's seamlessly done. It all feels honest.It's a very very good slice of life and puts you there with the men. And though very young they do mostly come off as men. That's all it does and it does it perfectly. There is no "ulimate" film on this war because, of course it's still going on. This film would seem to suggest that it's not going to end with us, "on top" but it doesn't say one way or the other. If you want to see our volunteer army in action in one specific area for one year, there hasn't been anything better previous to this film or in any of the Iraq movies, docu and fiction, done so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'RESTREPO': Four Stars (Out of Five) Tim Hetherington, a British photojournalist, and Sebastian Junger, an American journalist, direct their first film, a documentary following a platoon in Afghanistan. The filmmakers actually risked their lives to follow the soldiers around for a year and captured some pretty remarkable footage. They don't interact with the soldiers at all and instead let them tell their story to the cameras through interviews and of course through their actions with each other and on the battlefield. The footage is surprisingly raw and real.Hetherington and Junger joined the Second Platoon of B Company, 2nd Battalion, in Korengal Valley (then known as "the deadliest place on Earth") for 15 months as they attempted to rid it of insurgents. The film focuses on the death of two soldiers in particular, one being PFC Restrepo who the platoon then named an outpost they constructed after (in one night while fighting off combatants). The film also focuses on a deadly mission known as 'Rock Avalanche' which the platoon suffered some major losses at. Battle footage is inter-cut with camera interviews, the soldiers daily routines and the men just messing around as well as getting emotional.It received the Grand Jury Prize for best documentary at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and is nominated for best documentary feature at the upcoming Academy Awards, as well as being showered with a great deal of other critical acclaim. I liked and respected the way the filmmakers really got into the action and caught some truly amazing footage, and of course respected the men they filmed and was in awe of their courage. I thought the film could have been directed and put together a little nicer though. It drags at several points greatly because of lack of focus and the inexperience of the filmmakers. I've heard there's a great deal of interesting cut footage on the DVDs and I think a better film could probably have been made from it and the video they did use, at the hands of more talented filmmakers. What they do have to present is still amazing, it's almost a given with the video they have but they went out and got it. It's a touching and memorable film none the less.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ</fullReview>

This is the problem with RESTREPO when it was released in 2010 in that it had a slightly seen it all before feel which is heavily compounded if like me you've seen it for the very first time in 2013 .

Afghanistan was the Mecca for journalists from all over the world to make a name for themselves for either decent honest motives or for rather more cynical motives . Either way the country and the combatants would be a daily feature on news and documentary channels and we've seen these type of documentaries before such as the BBC's few genuinely compelling documentaries of recent years OUR WAR . In effect - and I emphasise no disrespect to anyone - RESTREPO doesn't bring much new to the table and you're left with a feeling of having seen it all before</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb documentary chronicling combat soldiers at lone outpost in unwinnable war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Restrepo is the superb documentary created by journalist Sebastian Junger and photographer Tim Hetherington, who followed a platoon of approximately 35 American soldiers for approximately a year in the Korengal Valley in eastern Afghanistan beginning in the spring of 2007. The film's creators did not seek to make any political statements but merely followed this group of soldiers in their day to day activities embedded at a lone outpost they end up dubbing 'Restrepo'.Restrepo refers to one of the platoons' fellow soldiers who is killed early on in their assignment. The Korengal Valley was the most heavily infested area by the Taliban when the Americans got there. The main outpost, KOP (Korengal Outpost) is set up and then the Restrepo platoon must set up their own outpost about a half mile away. That's no easy job as the platoon must get there first and set up the outpost while being bombarded constantly by Taliban artillery.One of the fascinating aspects of 'Restrepo' are the weekly meetings that the platoon have with the village elders. The platoon leader offers them the possibility that the Army can help build up their infrastructure in the future but also hopes they might cooperate in leading them to where the Taliban are hiding. The elders are more interested in preventing the indiscriminate deaths of civilians during American bombing campaigns. One particularly revealing scene occurs when the platoon leader questions a young man they suspect of having Taliban connections and he tells them if he does reveal where the Taliban might be, they will come back and kill him. 'Restrepo' also unflinchingly reveals the aftermath of a bombing campaign on Taliban positions. The platoon leader communicates his frustration (and perhaps anguish) over the innocent civilians who end up victims of American bombs (weapons, however, are found in the victims' home and it appears they are either shielding the Taliban or forced by them to harbor their soldiers).After awhile, one is wondering if the platoon is merely going to remain at OP Restrepo for the duration of the campaign or take the fight directly to the enemy. The platoon leader informs the troops that if they don't go on the offensive, it's likely the enemy will attack them first. Perhaps the most gut wrenching scene in 'Restrepo' is 'Rock Avalanche'--the platoon's mission to move directly into the middle of the insurgents' territory and try and root them out. One of the toughest soldiers is killed during this operation and we see during the battle, how one particular soldier, can't help himself from continually sobbing.Interviews are also conducted with some of the men after they leave Afghanistan, in Italy. Each man has a different story to tell and each of the interviews in their own right, are fascinating. One amusing vignette was one of the soldiers talking about his parents who he described as peace-loving hippies. There's another soldier who continually smiles during the interview while talking about some of the horrible events he witnessed?it struck me that the inappropriate smiling was a defense mechanism, preventing him from addressing deep-seated emotions of rage and sorrow. Still another amazing interview was the description of how another particular soldier survived after being wounded during combat.Whether one agrees with the war or not, I think there's no doubt that the members of OP Restrepo were extremely professional in the way they conducted themselves during the war and who managed at the same time to maintain a great camaraderie with one another.'Restrepo' brings up mixed feelings as to the necessity of our presence in Afghanistan. As Mr. Junger, the film's co-creator points out, since NATO and the US have been in Afghanistan, the number of casualties are much, much less than when the Taliban were in charge of the country. And despite failing to root out the Taliban, the mere presence of the Americans in the Korengal Valley, provided some measure of stability, preventing the Taliban from returning and terrorizing the local population. On the other hand, how the US Army expects the local population to cooperate with them in giving up Taliban positions, is absurd. The locals know damn well that the Army will not remain there forever and if they do speak to the Americans, they know the Taliban can at anytime return and kill them. It would take over a million troops (with massive casualties) to actually defeat the Taliban. Hence, the Americans are really fighting an unwinnable war. Is it any accident that we never see one Taliban soldier during the filming of this entire documentary? The height of irony is when we find out at the end of 'Restrepo', that the US left the Korengal Valley in 2010!Given the vast amount of footage the films' creators ended up with, the editing job on this film should be regarded as nothing short of remarkable. 'Restrepo' is one of the finest documentaries about soldiers in combat ever made and deserves all the accolades heaped upon it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Restrepo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pitch: The real Hurt Locker.The Review: We live in an age when rolling news channels give us constant, and sometimes live, feeds of footage from the front lines of conflict across the world, and where it's possible for movies to have made their way into cinemas while those conflicts are still taking place. We can be lulled into believing that we truly understand what it must be like to be on those front lines, but of course what we get are the heavily edited highlights. Restrepo follows the members of a platoon as they embark on a fifteen month deployment in Afghanistan's Korengal valley.It's also easy to imagine how this is going to play out. We start with talking heads from the platoon members reflecting on their thoughts before they head out, but it's clear that there's a dose of reality already permeating among the members of the platoon. Directors Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington keep close to the platoon at all times, and an attack on the convoy early on immediately sets the stakes for both them and the platoon they're following. The fact that the name of the outpost they establish, Outpost Restrepo, is named for a fallen colleague also serves to underline the immediacy of the threat facing them.What follows has a slightly conventional feel to it at times, with footage of the talking heads of the platoon, mostly taken after the fact, interspersed with the footage of them building and then defending their outpost, attempting to manage the locals and out on patrol. There are also occasions when the members of Second Platoon come over as slightly stereotypical, no doubt thanks to the heavy diet of war films that both they and we have consumed over the years, but that also serves to help familiarise and humanise them, and their plight becomes that much more immediate.Restrepo is not an attempt to judge the rights or wrongs of the Afghan conflict, more to understand what compels men to fight for their country and to put themselves in a situation like this for fifteen months. Although there's no real sense of innovation in the presentation, the quality of the material speaks for itself, and both the frustrations and the terror are writ large across the screen. In particular, the last third of the movie sees the platoon deep in the action and the reality of their situation hits home hard. An undeniably moving and deliberately unglamorous documentary that captures both the best and worst of army life in Afghanistan.Why see it at the cinema: Allowing yourself to be immersed in the footage helps to understand quite what these soldiers have gone through, and hopefully to make you more than a little relieved that you don't actually have to go through it.The Score: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary will not make you an expert on war. Be it the one it is depicting (though it does concentrate on one location) nor in general. What it does though, is letting the people who are in the spotlight talk. It actually only lets them talk. And while it is disguised as one thing, you could interpret it as something completely different too, if you want to that is.And you can only do that, because there is not a commentary that tells you, what you are supposed to feel, while watching the men doing what they do. You hear them and depending on your background you will piece together what is happening. How crazy or sane you think someone is. If the person does the right thing or not, is up to you to decide. Would you act differently? Shouldn't the other people be treated with more respect too? And that is what makes the documentary so unique (to me). It's about loss, but there is even more loss there, than the one that you hear the people talk about. The movie is asking you: What do you think? Do you dare answer?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staged and acted out Nazi Gebels propaganda movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a documentary in a full sense.This is nothing more then a propaganda movie made to look like a documentary.The soldiers and everyone here was specifically told what to do and what to say. Sometimes even exact lines.Anyone who knows how the script works and how the filming of regular movies is done would recognize this immediately and surely they would know this is all fake and NOT real documentary.This is to show the public as if there is purpose in all of this. And to justify the slaughter of the innocent.The fighting in this movie is 100% fake. Not real combat situations.Even the air-strikes are staged.It is simply too dangerous to film a short strip of real combat not to mention doing it every day or often.But even if you film real combat it looks, sounds different and most of all the people during real combat act differently and do different things.At the beginning the explosion is fake.If it was real mortar trap, they would be dead.In short, I can say they are not fighting there. Only killing.When Russians were in Afghan, the Afghanies used to receive weapons from USA.Now Taliban doesn't have much weapons and USA doesn't really have much people to fight.So they just have to make things up as if there is fighting.Obviously, there is little fighting but mostly it's done from a distance or by mobile groups. Anyway, all of this fake drama is not worth the film it was made on.This is a pure propaganda... and it even has some notions of social propaganda.. such as GAY IN THE ARMY propaganda, since you clearly can hear how one GI admits he would like to partake in sexual intercourse with another GI. Now, why would this get on camera unless the GIs were told to act it out?There were no reason to discuss personal matter during the documentary.And such things were constantly appearing throughout the movie.Also, the interaction with the locals was staged too. You can see that the locals are more then frustrated to have been summoned to partake in the movie since it is considered a sin in Islam to make images.It is obvious to anyone who knows anything about Islam. It is obvious.So, what I have to say about this movie is SHAME ON YOU!!! Whoever makes these kinds of movies.This looks like Gebels Nazi propaganda films when they showed "humane" Nazis caring for poor Slavic people and poor Jews. Only now in place of Slavic and Jews are the poor whoever lives in AfghanAnd we all know about that story right??Also, just wanted to point out.. there is a monologue by one US ass-ole colonel who says that locals work for Taliban for 5 dollar.Well... how cute.US GI works for much more then 5 dollar.This movie is such a crap i have no idea weather to recommend it as an example of cynical propaganda or not to recommend since it's so cheesy and fake.PS they didn't actually film the real combat since it was to horrible to show..can you imagine watching army destroying civil population just because they noticed 2-3 people with guns? kids and regular civilians are dead.. heads and arms blown off??I don't think touchy western public could handle looking at real combat.they have to sugar coat it for the gay loving, amazon forest protecting and give a dollar a month to a starving child, public.. and dramatize it.. you know.. you know..YOU KNOW!!!An Oscar nomination... Jesus would see this and climb back on the cross..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent film! One of the best documentaries of what is happening in Afghanistan today. It is produced in the true nature of a documentary as it makes no apologies for the negatives and mistakes particularly when it comes to some of the collateral damage. It shows the soldiers experience as it is and is extremely captivating. Some scenes are definitely not for younger audiences or anyone who is not prepared o see what war is, as close to the eye of a soldier as you can be.and to the two morons who have an agenda when they watched this and brought their politics to this review, you missed a good movie.truecrimsondeath - "none of which is shown, BTW" Are yo kidding? Showing the collateral damage they inflicted onto a village showing the innocent dead? Children permanently disabled in their parent's grieving arms? And then the commander fully assuming responsibility and acknowledging the horrible loss? It even shows him having the ballz to face the village elders in the wake of the mess. Did you even watch the movie? Well I guess they let anyone review these things. That is the true crime.alexbrasiler - I am pretty sure you are free to leave the country any time you like, the door is open. This country was founded by great Americans like these. I am proud of them and their ability to face death on a daily basis for what they believe in let alone be part of this film. In sharp contrast to someone hiding behind a computer and taking anonymous shots at them because they are enjoying playing a video game or laughing in the few moments in their deployment that someone is not trying to kill them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The challenge of documentary film making is presenting the facts without interjecting personal opinions. This film succeeds brilliantly because it follows that rule.'Restrepo' was a young combat medic in the 173rd Airborne Brigade who was killed in Afghanistan. A small outpost constructed on high ground once held by insurgents is named in his honor. The film follows the fifteen month deployment of a company that inhabits O.P. Restrepo, and the nearby combat outpost it protects.The Korangal Valley of Afghanistan is remote, surrounded by imposing mountain ranges, and is very close to the border with Pakistan. For these reasons, it is a Taliban stronghold. O.P. Restrepo was attacked four or five times EVERY DAY with direct fire, and somehow the soldiers there dealt with the stress of living under those conditions. They are all normal, sympathetic guys, and in a few chosen moments of silliness we see how young they really are. The most heart breaking moment in the film is when we see a young Sergeant fall apart after his squad leader is killed. It's hard to watch.The only person who I couldn't sympathize with was the Company Commander. One of the first scenes he is featured in shows him speaking to local elders, who complain that the previous American unit killed a large number of unarmed civilians. He heartlessly replies that he is wiping the slate clean, and has nothing else to say. We see him later on as he screams at the elders and tells them that he doesn't f***ing care what they think, a scene that made my jaw drop. He insulted all of the people whom those elders spoke for, potentially hundreds of military aged males. Anyone who has deployed to the Middle East knows that honor is everything to a Muslim, and to insult someone's honor is to invite an attack. The commander spends the film patting himself on the back, and when he mentions Restrepo at the end you assume he will finally say something sentimental about the eponymous fallen soldier. Nope; he is patting himself on the back again for his idea to construct O.P. Restrepo. He is completely lacking in compassion for his men and the losses they have endured, including the many fallen soldiers from his own command. He represents arrogant Washington bureaucracy all too well.At the end of the film we discover that nearly fifty Americans died in the Korangal valley over the preceding years, protecting the site of a road that the military wanted to build to win the hearts and minds of locals. In 2009 the military abandoned its outposts in the valley and decided to concentrate its assets elsewhere.If you ever meet one of the men who served there, shake his hand and buy him a beer. Some of them had multiple combat deployments even before they went to the Korangal valley. I only experienced a fraction of what these guys went through, so my hat goes off to all of them.P.S. I loved how they wore baseball caps and sweatshirts. It makes me smile to imagine that senior Non-Commissioned Officers who sat in offices down range are freaking out about the relaxed uniform standards on the front lines. Well played Sky Soldiers, well played.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puts you right there with our troops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halfway through this movie I had to take a step back and tell myself that I am not actually there. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. And it's just a documentary, not a Hollywood film. At one point I wondered if it could be possible that it was staged like Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity or the Fourth Kind. I personally don't like those kind of movies and this is not one of them. This film also helped me understand better what we are doing in Afganistan and why. Thank you to all our troops who step up and put themselves in harms way and to the ones who make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms and the American way of life. I salute you all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They take fire every single day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst outpost in Afghanistan. They take fire every single day. Can this be fixed? Sebastian Junger, author of The Perfect Storm, in his directorial debut, won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival for this film, and is in the running for an Oscar tonight. He presented a film about life and death and fear in a way that makes you feel like you are there.What I found most appealing was watching the efforts of the Captain to work with the Afghans to keep them from supporting the Taliban coming in from Pakistan to kill his soldiers.Equally important to understanding the sacrifice of these soldiers is watching them come back after losses. "Say a few prayers and move on."One cannot watch this film without recalling those words from St. Crispen's Day: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got home from the theatre. I thought it was a great movie. I was impressed by the filmmakers in that not once during the entire film do you see the enemy, or any associated violence.This movie (it seems to me anyways) is really about these young men and the lifetime of scars that their battle experiences have obviously seared into their psyche. It is sad, funny, harsh, everyone grief stricken, and tough to watch their faces when they talk about their friends deaths and their constant fear of losing another or being next.In light of the WikiLeaks, it would be interesting to get wikileaks interpretation of what happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best recruitment video for the US army that I've ever seen!!!Lush forest settings. Camaraderie. Good food. And why not take a break from all the shooting to play a shooting game on your PSP!I'm going to sign for the army up today!Seriously, I've never been to war, but I'm sure it's not actually this fun. In some of the interviews the guys are laughing and smiling while they discuss Afghan casualties, trying to use any words other than "murder" and "human" to describe their own part in the slaughter (none of which is shown, BTW).It's like it was only given an R rating to bring in the type of people who the army would like to recruit.Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing. You can feel the frustration, heartache and fear they experience right through the camera.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I don't rate or rank documentaries with regular films but I'm going to make an exception in this case. This is a well structured and powerful film delivering incredible insight and feeling about the ground war in Afghanistan. There's no political agenda at all. What the film does deliver is the actual feeling of being deployed with these incredibly brave and heroic soldiers. You can feel the frustration, heartache and fear they experience right through the camera. We know the harshness of war and have seen the terrain they have to deal with on the news but it's tough to comprehend how difficult a task they face until you've seen it documented in this manner. They are more noble and tolerant then I would be in their situation. Civilian Afghan casualties would be my very last concern if I were in their shoes. Anyway, one line stood out for me and that was delivered by a soldier that was talking about the recent memory of losing a friend in battle. He said, "I don't want to forget because it makes me appreciate what I have." We can all take a cue from that quote. We should never forget what these guys are doing for us and appreciate life and the freedoms they and others like them have earned for us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Perfect Storm (book) was a remarkably fact-filled account which captured a bit of fishing culture, a bit of fishing-industry microeconomics, a few personal stories, and a huge dose of natural science. The presentation of the huge dose of science in an interesting and readable style distinguished the book from the never-ending supply of best-selling drivel. The scientific anomaly of the perfect storm seemed also to survive the making of the movie, but perhaps that view is biased for those who first read the book. Restrepo (movie) has no such feature. The stupidity of wasting treasury dollars and lives to fight over a meaningless spot on the globe is nothing new. The youthful naiveté and the devastating emotional effect on those who experience any real-life OP Restrepo have been popular in fact and fiction for decades. Yes, it's tragic. Yes, we know. The cultural chasm between the old local Afghans (where were the young men - hiding in the woods with guns, perhaps?) and the self- righteous American soldiers might have been interesting had it been developed. But it wasn't - apparently not by the Army, so Junger had no chance. So let's take stock: the United States Army went over to a remote spot in a remote country, spent God-knows how much money on destroying things, alienated the local population, emotionally warped a few young men, killed a few people on both sides, and left. Is that about it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem I had with this "movie," is that it was not much of a movie at all. It seemed like two guys decided they were going to embed and then make a movie about their experiences, whether there were any experiences to really show. We see a lot of forced shots where the soldiers really have nothing to say. It is as if they feel compelled to give the directors something, so they just start performing. I am very interested in this conflict and the men that fight it, but this documentary was inferior to stuff I have already seen on National Geographic and other news stations. In the end, it is rather dull. We are instead party to a number of young men trying to come up with something entertaining for the directors, as if their mission was secondary.</fullReview>
