		<shortDescription>Feel-good Biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say that I'm generally not a fan of biopics, they just aren't the type of movie I seek out. I got tickets to the sneak preview and my wife really wanted to go. Anyway, that preamble out of the way, I really did enjoy the movie.Eddie the Eagle is a story about an underdog in every sense of the word. One theme that is repeated throughout the movie, is the quote from Pierre de Coubertin (father of the modern Olympics), "The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part; the important thing in Life is not triumph, but the struggle; the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well." The story follows Eddie from the time he's a little kid with dreams of going to the Olympics. It follows him through his many assorted set-backs, and all the people around him who saw only failure in his future. It also shows the moments when he got helping hands when he most needed it. This movie is about his struggle.The casting in the movie was quite good. I remember Eddie the Eagle from TV when I was young, and Taron Egerton does an excellent job in the role of Eddie. Hugh Jackman puts in a good performance as the coach Bronson Peary, and manages not to overpower Eddie's character. But while Taron Egerton really assumes the part of Eddie, a lot of Hugh Jackman leaks into his role as coach Peary.The roles of Eddie's parents are also well played, and the actress playing his mother, Jo Hartley, gives a particularly poignant portrayal. The father, played by Keith Allen (currently uncredited on IMDb) is a bit of a caricature, but well acted. Actually, a lot of the supporting cast of characters are caricatures, especially the other ski-jumpers/coaches and the British Olympians/Olympic Committee. But to an extent that serves to emphasize the struggle for Eddie. Also, for those intent on seeing this film for Christopher Walked, he has a very small role.While, I have emphasized the struggle aspect of the story, there is a lot of comedy thrown into the mix as well. The tone is upbeat throughout, even when Eddie has setbacks. While some of the failures are played for laughs (mostly early in the film), it's mostly Eddie's perseverance that makes this film endearing. It also feels like we're laughing with Eddie rather than at him, since it seems Eddie's in on the joke.If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, I say give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie at an advance screening and Eddie the Eagle was awesome. The movie did not disappoint at all.Great insight into the story of Eddie Edwards and the sport of ski jumping.Very dangerous sport but very beautiful to look at. The movie had a lot of heart and humor. Will look forward to this movie making its way on Blu-ray. I would gladly pay to add it to my collection. Great visuals as well. I wish the movie gets the praise it deserves as it really is better than a lot of the trash coming thru movie theaters now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie that left my Wife and I satisfied, inspired and smiling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very funny, enjoyable and inspiring movie for the whole family.A human interest film that are rare these days with so many movies that rely on bravado and special effects.Based on a true story, which proves if you have dreams from a young age that persist you should follow them no matter what the odds are against them and ignore all the doubters that tell you you cannot achieve them.The human spirit and believing in one's self are very powerful forces.Eddie is a character that you cannot dislike. Hugh Jackman's character helps Eddie achieve his dream since Eddie would not be deterred.Eddie unknowingly helps Hugh Jackman's character out of his funk and he is re-born again.We highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See feel good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a nice touch of humor you cannot come away from this movie without feeling a sense of accomplishment regardless of the actual outcome. The movie inspires you to reflect on any challenge we may have faced on our own lives and inspires us to actually rethink how we may have handled it or behaved differently. Taron Edgerton played a very believable character giving the audience a real sense at who Eddie Edwards really was and how he lived his youth through perseverance and fortitude by simply not giving up. The film cleverly portrays this very quickly through a brief introduction into Eddies childhood. The story is written well and the story really gives us a sense of who Eddie is and the drive to fulfill a promise to himself. Hugh Jackman brings a humorous side to the film with just enough serious touch that you do not loose sight of the significant effort that was made by Eddie Edwards. I was glad to be invited to a early preview and hope that all who see this film enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an Oscar Winner - But a Satisfying Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are merely created for entertainment and to tell a story. This is one of those films that you're not going to hear about during award season but it was certainly satisfying and worth the time.Egerton was a perfect choice to play Eddie, from his off beat humor to his on spot facial expressions, and Hugh Jackman is a great compliment as the supporting role. Both characters are total opposites, each flawed in their own way, but really mesh together on screen.The movie is fun and the story, based on the Eddie the Eagles dream of going to the Olympics, was nicely told with clean comedy paced throughout. Not knowing the outcome of the true story, I was on edge rooting for Eddie throughout - just like the crowds in the stands on film. Really glad they made this film, it's such a fun story and Eddie The Eagle is so deserving for a film that honors his hard work dedicated to his Olympic dream.Have fun with this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taron continues to impress as 'Eggsy' (sic) the Eagle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The British love a plucky loser. "Eddie the Eagle" tells the astonishing but true story of everyman plasterer Eddie Edwards who qualified for, and then competed in, the Calgary Olympics in 1988 (probably most famous for those other plucky losers ? the Jamaican bobsleigh team of Disney's "Cool Runnings" fame). I have absolutely no idea how the traditionally more success-driven and competitive American audience will see it, but the packed English showing I attended all clearly loved this film as a feel-good classic.The film starts with Eddie's childhood, struggling out of leg braces to try to pursue his Olympic dream with no success whatsoever. (Excellent performances here by brothers Tom and Jack Costello who set-up the tone for the film). His battle is not just against his lack of skill: whilst his mother (Jo Hartley) is quietly supportive, his father Terry (Keith Allen) is ? not unreasonably it must be said ? hugely frustrated at his son's fanciful ideas, wanting him to follow in the family plastering tradition with the same zeal. (The gulf in ambition is vast ? Eddie: "Didn't you have a dream when you were younger Dad?"; Terry: "Yes, plastering".)Eventually Eddie finds a sport he is half decent in (by British standards!): downhill skiing, but is thwarted in following his Olympic dreams by smarmy and sneering Olympic selector Dustin Target, played by Tim McInnerny (from "Black Adder" and "Notting Hill"? someone who has rather cornered the market on 'smarmy and sneering'). It is then that he exploits ancient rules in the UK Olympic playbook to try to qualify in the discipline of ski-jumping: something no one has done since the 1920's. Linking up in Austria with an alcohol-infused coach and ex- jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), Eddie faces the terrors of the 40m and then 70m jumps to try to learn the sport (16 years too late).This film has been long in gestation, with both Steve Coogan and Rupert Grint originally earmarked for the role. But Matthew Vaughn's involvement in the current project probably contributed to Taron Egerton getting the job following their work together on last year's "Kingsman". And a great choice he is too. Almost unrecognizable from the sharp- suited Eggsy in "Kingsman" and gangster-sidekick Teddy in "Legend", Egerton switches effortlessly between clueless goofball and steely determined sportsman. The film's emotional heart though is with Hugh Jackman's side-story, battling with drink after throwing his own chance away with US-coach Warren Sharp (a nice cameo by Christopher Walken). Although going a little OTT at times (we see for example that he is no Meg Ryan!), Jackman provides a solid acting foundation that the rest of the cast can play off.Rounding out the cast are solid performances from Jo Hartley ("This is England") as Eddie's Mum, Mark Benton ("Waterloo Road") as a BOA official, Rune Temte as a bear of a Norwegian coach and the ever-warming Jim Broadbent as a BBC commentator.An 'attaboy' should also go to the special effects crew headed up by Marty McLaughlin for making believe a man can fly. Whilst ? you understand ? not in any way doubting Jackman's ability to risk his pretty face on a 90m jump, the nighttime sequence of him doing that jump is really nicely executed (with cinematography by George Richmond).A quick browse at Wikipedia will make it clear that there has been a lot of license taken with this as a "true story", and to be fair the prefix "based on a.." was used! And the film is not without irritations: Terry's negativity to his son's actions is about 25% overplayed in Simon Kelton's story, and the coach/protégé sub-plot has been overused in the past. The soundtrack (music) by Matthew Margeson is also rather grating particularly early on in the film: it is presumably going for 'period' in its use of Hammond organ cheesiness, but that music was tiresome in the 80's too! Fortunately Margeson redeems himself with some kick-ass (no pun intended) classic 80's tracks neatly edited into the action.These criticisms aside, I dare you to come out of this film without a silly grin on your face. I certainly did. Directed by Dexter Fletcher ("Sunshine on Leith") it's not likely to win any Oscars, but in setting out to deliver what it said on the can it succeeded in all respects.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review.

		<shortDescription>Important Thing is Not to Win, But to Take Part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone loves a good underdog story, and sports films have always been a good avenue for those stories to thrive. I know a lot of people like to complain sometimes about 'biopics' and how they should be as close to the source material as possible, but I look at it a different way. I go to the movies for an experience. Whether that be to laugh, cry, smile, or whatever, I go for the experience. If a film would be better off taking plenty of liberties, I'm all for it. Eddie the Eagle definitely took that philosophy, and for the most part, it really worked.First of all, I have to give a shout out to Elk Grove Cinema (not that they would actually be reading this) for inviting me to a preview screening of the film a few weeks before its wide release. Of course I jumped at the opportunity considering Hugh Jackman and the up and comer Taron Egerton were starring in a sports film, especially a seemingly uplifting one at that. The film absolutely did not disappoint. Similar to last week's Finest Hours, I went in with mediocre expectations, and came out very pleasantly satisfied with what I got. It's a feel good story that I think everyone can get behind. Eddie dreamed his entire life of competing in the Olympics and was told that he would never make it, naturally that's someone we would root for.The good thing is that Egerton does more than just portray a sympathetic character. He transforms into Eddie the Eagle. I didn't know much about him before the film but it seems like he really pulled off Edwards' emotions and body language to a T. Jackman is also very good as the clichéd drunk washed up trainer that takes Eddie from being a wannabe to an Olympic athlete. I think that's what a lot of people will come out of the film saying, it's so clichéd. To an extent, they're not wrong. Each and every character is the prototype of what you would expect them to be, whether they are supporting Eddie or entirely against him. But I also don't think it was always a detriment to the film. Sometimes the clichés worked.As I said, the film is incredible satisfying. It's one of the best examples of a pure crowd-pleaser. There's not much to dislike about the film. I absolutely loved the music choices including the score and some timely 80's song choices. Sure, I think the stakes could have been raised a bit here or there to give an even bigger emotional moment, but I can't say the film didn't already bring me to teary eyes at some points. And that to me, is an experience at the movies.+Emotionally satisfying+Egerton is terrific+Music+Jackman-Some clichés are unnecessary7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Eddie the Eagle" soars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all have a dream? or have had a dream at some point, at least. You may not have achieved your dream (yet), but I'm sure you remember what it is, even if you're not currently pursuing it. You may have been stopped or been hindered from seeing your dream come true because people told you it wasn't realistic or refused to support you when you needed them to (or both). Or maybe you chose to give up on that dream because you decided yourself that it wasn't practical or because you came to believe that you were too old, too busy, too poor, too? "whatever" to dream anymore. If any of this sounds familiar, then "Eddie the Eagle" (PG-13, 1:45) just might be your kind of movie. (And if ALL of this sounds familiar, you need to drop everything and go see this movie immediately ? before it's too late!) The movie poster says "Inspired by a Dream Come True". That's appropriate (even if it's also a bit of a spoiler). In other words, this film is indeed inspired by a true story, but it's a highly fictionalized account of what really happened. There really is an Eddie Edwards who was nicknamed "The Eagle" and became Britain's only ski jumper in order to realize his childhood dreams of Olympic glory at the 1988 winter games in Calgary. Except for a few more details, that's about where the similarities between the film and reality end. Personally, I think the omitted details of Edwards' story are even more interesting than what appears on screen, but maybe they were left out to simplify the movie or make it even more of a crowd-pleaser. If that was the goal, mission accomplished! The filmmakers did, however, cast an actor who could act and be made to look like the real Edwards, right down to his gestures. It is impressive.Since childhood, Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton) had Olympic dreams, even though he was pudgy, had no discernible athletic talent and even wore a knee brace for years. But he kept his dream alive. Eddie tried his hand at a number of different Olympic events, unable to find the right one for him. But he kept trying. Many different people, including Eddie's own father, criticized and even mocked his dreams. But he just ignored them. Eddie decided on ski jumping even though he didn't know anything about it and was told repeatedly that, even in his early 20s, he was way too old to learn it and get good at it. But he still gave it his best shot. There were even multiple predictions of Eddie's failure, injury or even death if he pushed forward. But he refused to let fear or uncertainty stop him. At one point, Eddie proclaims, "I taking jumping very seriously. I love it. Nearly as much as I love proving people wrong." That he does.Eddie didn't even have a coach. That is, until he suddenly left the home of his frustrated father and supportive mother (Jo Hartley), traveled to a ski jumping facility in Germany and met one of the employees, Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman). Bronson is a former Olympic ski jumper who let his bad attitude derail his jumping career. He squandered his potential, ending up working as a maintenance man and drowning his sorrows in alcohol. As Eddie does small jumps and tries to learn how to jump by trial and error, Bronson repeatedly tells him to quit. Eventually, Bronson agrees to teach Eddie a few things, if for no other reason, to keep Eddie from killing himself as he trains. And if Eddie manages to overcome his alcoholic coach's gruffness ? and his own lack of experience (talent) as a jumper, he still must get past the British Olympic Committee whose leader (Tim McInnerny) is intent on stopping Eddie."Eddie the Eagle" soars! Egerton is powerful, fun and funny in what is best described as a transformative performance, to be appreciated even more by those who saw him as a street-punk-turned-suave-secret-agent in 2015's "Kingman: The Secret Service". 2016 just serves to confirm Egerton as one of the finest young acting talents working today. Here, he makes a wonderful and endearing underdog. This film's story arc recalls another inspiring (basically) true sports story ? 1993's "Rudy". Like many such movies, "Eddie" is guilty of being formulaic (right down to Jackman's charming, but now familiar portrayal of an underdog's main supporter) and I wish this film had stuck a little closer to the actual story, but these issues do little to harm the movie's emotional power and the sheer enjoyment of being in the audience.Regardless of how successful Eddie is (or isn't) in the end, you'll want to stand up and shout, "Do you believe in miracles? YES!!" Hmmm. Sorry. Wrong Winter Olympics movie, but you get the point. "Eddie the Eagle" IS the feel-good movie of the year! If you have (or ever had) a dream, you're likely to enjoy this film? and it may even inspire you to dream about things you never thought possible. Isn't all that what movies are for? Everyone reading this review is witnessing the beginning of me realizing my dreams. This film reminded me of the rewards of determination and the joys of overcoming obstacles and accomplishing goals. I believe it will do the same for you ? and entertain you in the process. "A-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film makers themselves warn you with the movie being publicized as a feel-good, underdog tale that provides family entertainment. And that is EXACTLY what this movie is!!! And even though the movie does not bring in anything new or more than what was expected from it, it is definitely a good watch.The characters are extremely likable and the movie will have you rooting for 'Eddie' in no time.From what I have read, the movie was not shot in Canada and is very loosely based on the actual life of the real Eddie the Eagle, so people from Calgary and people who actually know a lot about the real Eddie might be slightly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I saw this in a free screening prior to it opening for regular audiences, and I even wondered if I loved it so much because it was free, but I think I would have liked it just as much had I paid to see it! I do think that the movie benefits from being shown on a big wide screen with all the outdoor scenes - not sure I would have liked it so much had I seen it on a TV size screen. I felt all the characters were perfectly cast. While it may seem like a nit, the only annoying factor to me was that Eddie's glasses were falling down his nose the whole time - and while I know that was part of the character, it drove me crazy watching him!! However, the movie kept my interest the entire time, and was extremely enjoyable. By the end, I had tears of happiness streaming down my face - definitely one of the best feel-good movies I have seen in a long time!! HIGHLY recommend!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie the Eagle is no downhill crash; it flies with upbeat spirit and lands with a comedic tone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Southern-Californian, snow might as well come from a different world. We receive at the most, a few flurries in the winter, but even then, it needs to be on a full moon on a leap year if it's not Tuesday. That said, we can still provide a wealth of athletes in sports that are played in the winter. Both local ice hockey teams, the Anaheim Ducks and the Los Angeles Kings, have won the Stanley Cup and are seen as some of the best hockey teams in America. Shaun White, famous snowboarder, hails from San Diego and Michelle Kwan, the figure skater, is from the L.A. area.The lesson here is that a champion can come from anywhere. A good movie that provides this example is Cool Runnings from Disney. This portrays the country of Jamaica creating a bobsled team for the 1988 Winter Olympics. Though goofy and clearly not a realistic representation of what happened, the movie was upbeat about one following their dreams to become an Olympic athlete. What's interesting that today's movie was set during the same 1988 Olympics. Eddie the Eagle looks at an aspiring ski jumper as he tries to go fro the gold.Ever since he was a young boy, Eddie Edwards has wanted to go to the Olympics, yet has little athletic skill. He tries his hand at several sports until he sees skiing as his best shot. As an adult, Eddie (played by Taron Egerton) seems to be doing well, he's not selected to join the British downhill skiing team due to his odd technique and just simply not being one of the best. He then sees that the country has not had a ski jumper in a long time, and decides to take advantage of that empty spot to secure a spot.He packs his bags for Germany at the official training facility where his attempts to mingle with the other ski jumpers are met with laughter. While trying out the hills, he comes across alcoholic snow groomer Bronson Peary (played by Hugh Jackman). Eddie finds out that he used to be a part of the American Olympic team under the coaching of Warren Sharp (played by Christopher Walken). He takes pity and agrees to give Eddie the proper coaching. Eddie manages to win a local match that qualifies him to join the Olympic team. While the odds of winning are low, he's happy to be chasing his dream.Eddie the Eagle sounds like your run of the mill sport biography and?basically is?but it's also self aware of that and has fun with itself. I can't think of another movie where ski jumping is portrayed and it looks really cool on a cinematic scale. The sport's high flying action allows for some impressive shots to prove that it was not computer generated. Like Cool Runnings, it's also clearly not using the same story, given how silly a lot of the scenes flow. While it's not laugh out loud hilarious, it makes up by being just as upbeat as the latter. Taron Egerton is proving his worth as an actor, managing to be the perfect athlete and dweeb in one crazy experiment. You know his character is out of their element, but Taron makes him very likable. Hugh Jackman does well as his coach, more or less throwing in a lot of his charm and ability to play off the comedic writing to his advantage. Hugh gains cool points for his shot of ski jumping with a cigarette in his mouth. Going into Eddie the Eagle, you really need to be in the right mood for it to hit you in the right spot.I'll give this eight and a half ski jumpers out of ten. Those that want a gripping story of an athlete should look someplace else. But for those that want something upbeat like Cool Runnings and Rudy, then Eddie the Eagle should please you well enough. Despite the premise, this is no downhill crash; it's a flier that knows where to land.</fullReview>

I was like what the hay. It was a surprise hit in my book. The casting was great, story flowed well, and the ending was a tear jerker. Was not a big budget, well advertised film, but sometimes those can be the most satisfying. I would highly recommend to anyone. One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a long time. This movie really exceeded all of our expectations I can't wait for the DVD. Hugh Jackman was fabulous the main character Eddie was perfectly cast.

		<fullReview>I went in to this movie not knowing what to expect. I hadn't heard anything about the movie from anyone I knew, but I am so glad I ended up watching it. Eddie the Eagle, like most biopics, does not strive for historical accuracy, but rather tries and succeeds in tugging at the heartstrings. In a trending wave of serious, depressing, anti-hero, "realism-pics" Eddie the Eagle shines. This feel good comedy/drama was inspiring. Taron Egerton's portrayal of Eddie Edwards was fascinating and believable, not in the sense of historical accuracy, but rather in his ability to make the audience believe in the impossible and dare to dream. Even when everyone but your mom is rooting against you, you can still achieve your dreams! You can't leave this move not feeling good. It was a great movie, and more should be made like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great drama film - enjoyable and enthralling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was kind of skeptical about the film at first, based on it's name I expected it to be a comedy but it turned out to be much more than that. In some way the movie is inspirational to take on life's challenges to achieve one's goals and dreams. Based on a true story, the movie documents a personal challenges from personal motivations to bureaucratic by officials to ridicule and derision by team-mates that Eddie encountered and ultimately overcame to compete in the Olympic Ski Jump competition as the lone competitor in a field that the British are not known for. My only caveat with the film was that the producers faced certain logistical challenges re-creating the look and feel of the actual 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary Canada so they focused a lot on close-ups and low-angle views which is understandable. Nevertheless I found the film highly enthralling and inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embracing Cliché to Become This Generation's Rudy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many movies have injected liberal amounts of post-modernist snark as of late. If done right the snark translates to layers and layers of humor and meta-humor that rewards repeated viewings. Deadpool (2016) certainly comes to mind as the strongest recent example. If done wrong however, it becomes an unbearable echo chamber of self- congratulatory wink-winks and nudge-nudges (Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (2015) anyone?). Eddie the Eagle is not a snarky movie. It's unabashedly sincere and tenacious in its embrace of the inspiring no matter how corny.Eddie the Eagle is based on the true story of Eddie Edwards (Egerton) an amateur skier who represented Great Britain during the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. Known early on for his tenacity, the movie represents him as a naive young man with a penchant for clumsiness. Failing every attempt to be qualified as a downhill skier, Eddie makes his way to Garmish-Partenkirchen, Germany to learn and master the Olympic sport of ski jumping. While there, he's openly ridiculed by all for his lack of talent, finance and balance. Taking notice of Eddie's near suicidal commitment however, is former Olympic team washout Bronson Peary (Jackman), who takes him under his wing and trains him for success on the slopes.Your ability to outright love Eddie the Eagle is predicated on your ability to absorb cliché. This film is an inspirational sports movie that knowingly borrows elements from other movies right down to the stuffy official who undermines Eddie's attempts to qualify (McInnerny). Yes there are training montages set to catchy 80's tunes, yes there's the obligatory hard to please parent (Allen) and yes there's the inspirational moment, right before the climax, where our hero gets encouragement from an unexpected source. What makes this movie special is it runs at these clichés head-on; as if they're not story elements directly lifted from Rocky (1976), Ski Patrol (1990) and Hot Dog...The Movie (1984). Much like Eddie himself, the movie doesn't care if it wins records; it's just happy to be on-screen warming your heart and making you laugh. One can't help but admire such enthusiasm.Of course if you're too cynical for a feel good sports movie you can at least appreciate the stellar cast rounded out by Taron Egerton. The man is destined for stardom providing the same underdog sensitivity he brought to Kingsman's (2014) Eggsy only with a deft sense of comedic timing. Jackman isn't at his best but boy does he seem to be having a lot of fun playing the permanently drunk Peary. He refers his flask as his "jacket," and has a chemistry with Egerton that borders on brotherly. Jo Hartley and Keith Allen are polar opposites as Eddie's parents and provide much of the humor in their back and forths. You can tell they both mean well yet Hartley is constantly undermining Allen's pragmatic approach to Eddie's struggles. She's the dreamer, he's the realist; both wear their characters well.Eddie carries with him a lunchbox filled with all the medals he's won throughout the years. Most of those medals consist of broken, thick-framed glasses with insanely thick lenses. Those who scoff at the state of sport today and make a stink about how competition is being scuttled by participation trophies are missing the point. Sportsmanship is not about beating the other guy, it's about achieving your personal best. This movie wears that theme firmly on its sleeve and it's truly a joy to see something that doesn't resort to self-reference to get it's point across. While not a masterpiece in the purest sense, Eddie the Eagle firmly places itself as this generation's Rudy (1993).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The many adventures of a soar(ing) loser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For as simplistically structured and utterly predictable as "Eddie the Eagle" is, it's only more amazing that it winds up being such a triumph of a film. A major-minor film, if you will; one that will be casually embraced or dismissed by critics (much like its titular hero) but truly loved and appreciated by audiences, especially audiences who love watching the underdog come out on top. While part of my unspoken duty as a film critic is to demand more from a film, to do so with "Eddie the Eagle," a film that plays it safe and keeps everything entertaining thanks to its committed cast and the respectful treatment of its subject, seems foolish given on how well it stands on its own two-feet.The film revolves around Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton), a young British man who, from a very tender age, aspired to become an Olympian, despite his parents' lack of money and his father's modest expectations for his son to become a plasterer like himself. Eddie's determination always found a way to either get him hurt or in trouble, but he never cared to stop, not even after his tenth pair of glasses or the increasing number of bruises on his body.Eddie's incorruptible determination is predicated upon one end goal; proving people wrong by earning a spot in the skijumping competition in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Eddie's quirky attitude, lack of coordination, and leg braces make him the perfect underdog candidate, and with little guidance, plus a late start in the sport compared to his competitors, he enlists in the help of Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), a once-promising skijumper under the coach of the renowned Warren Sharp (Christopher Walken) turned bitter, pompous alcoholic. Peary agrees to help coach Eddie in landing, so he doesn't make a complete fool out of himself around the more seasoned jumpers.It doesn't take long for Eddie's promise to be communicated to Peary in the boldest way. Through all his quirks and eccentricities, Eddie is a lot of things, but not a quitter, even when Olympic officials laugh in his face, competitors sneer and mock him, and even Peary himself demeans him. Almost everything Eddie says to people results in a jab back in his direction, and instead of fighting back, let alone instigating or being bitter, Eddie persists on towards his goal. "I love jumping," he states at one press conference, "nearly as much as I love proving people wrong." Screenwriters Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton are in such an easy position to turn "Eddie the Eagle" into, what I call, an "anti-character study," similar to the Adam Sandler films of the 1990's, where we take a buffoon character and just pick on him for the entire course of the film. Macaulay and Kelton realize they are operating on a field of landmines for this character in terms of making him the butt of every joke, but through a sensitive lens, they portray a sweet, sincere hero, who gets poked and prodded frequently, but never at the expense of cheap laughs. The respect they give Edwards is quite remarkable and mature, given the direction that would've easily sold more tickets.However, audience members who choose to go to the theater to see this film after the unusually high amounts of drudgery they've been subjected to the past two months will be gifted with a tremendously fun and heartwarming picture with two strong performances at its core. Even though Jackman's role of the belligerent, self-indulgent hulk is one he can sleepwalk, he still does a strong job at conveying the character without an unlikable edge - as if Macaulay and Kelton tried so hard to make the titular character a sympathetic one that they couldn't risk corrupting the tone by making Peary completely unlikable. But, as one can predict, the star here is Egerton, who is nearly unrecognizable compared to his surly but high-octane performance in "Kingsman: The Secret Service, which was directed by "Eddie the Eagle"'s executive producer Matthew Vaughn, in addition to coming with the stamp of Vaughn's production company, "Marv." Vaughn's production company has, yet again, proved itself by giving us a wholesome picture, filled with cleanly edited and shot scenes that carry a decidedly retrograde vibe and an aesthetic warmness that makes for a visually appealing film (and one of the best uses of Van Halen's "Jump" ever committed to film).Here, Egerton gives a sensitive performance of an instantly likable character who has been doubted before he was ever given a chance to prove himself, and through a tender lens, director Dexter Fletcher and company prove that is something that we all want; to be taken seriously and to be, at the very least, respected. By giving us a character who is treated with everything but respect for most of his life, we're reminded that most of us simply want a shot at glory before we can be criticized. "Eddie the Eagle," once more, plays similar tunes, but it's so well-versed and impressive with the familiar that it's also a cogent reminder that one doesn't need to break boundaries to tell a story that's important; all it needs is a different thematic direction and a couple of strong performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best sport films need a true underdog story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some sport films through the years but I've actually never seen one about ski jumping. Eddie the Eagle is the truth based story of the British ski jumper Michael "Eddie" Edwards who participated in the 1988 Olympic winter games in Calgary, Canada. Eddie has since childhood, dreamed of becoming an Olympic participant. When he gets older and is denied to compete in downhill skiing by the British committee, he decides to try ski jumping instead. The problem is that the Olympic games is one year away and Eddie has never before in his life tried ski jumping. The incredibly charming Taron Egerton plays Eddie the Eagle and Hugh Jackman also takes part as the drunken American ex pro jumper Bronson Peary.Classic underdog stories always works well within the sport genre and really are a well played card by now. And yet there is something with the story about Eddie that grabs hold of me. Nobody believes in him, he is odd and rather strange. Despite dealing with all the resistance and sometimes humiliation, he never gives up. The thing that also really keeps me interested is the ski jumping. I have always found that sport pretty funny, but I now seriously have to confess that I would never dare to jump that high with skis on. Hugh Jackman's mentor character is actually very cliché and perhaps a bit exaggerated. They should probably have toned him down to add a little more realism in the story.According to the filmmakers the story is really not that truthful, especially not the parts about Eddie Edward's life outside of ski jumping. His result and what happened to him is however not changed that much, but besides that much of the story is made for film. I really don't think that's a problem. I rank Rocky as my favorite sport film and it is because I think that the ultimate sport film needs an underdog story. It is actually the same thing here in Eddie the Eagle. A struggle for the little man and a display with an encouragement to never give up. Perhaps well needed in our sometimes dark world.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chappy Watched: Eddie The Eagle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've gone from knowing nothing about this film, to hearing bits of what it's about when it was released in cinemas to watching it now and absolutely loving it!The story is beautiful and heartwarming. Eddie is just a resilient, determined guy who even when things aren't going right, always seems to find the lighter side of things.Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman are absolutely brilliant in this movie. The likeness between the two kids playing Eddie and Taron are amazing as is the likeliness and mannerisms of the real Eddie the Eagle.To me, this movie just feels like Hollywood has been left at the door in way of making an awesome, authentic movie. Speaking of authenticity, I love that this movie felt like it was actually in the '80s. The fashion, the setting, the music and score and even the fact that everyone was smoking anywhere and everywhere!The thing I love about true stories or movies based on real people, is when the movie ends with either looking at where the person is now or seeing pictures of their journeys, Eddie the Eagle was no different.This is just an awesome, feel good movie that I will definitely be watching again and that I'll recommend people watch at least once!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael "Eddie" Edwards is an unlikely but courageous British ski-jumper who never stopped believing, even though an entire nation, and his own father, was counting him out. With the help of a rebellious and charismatically drunk coach, Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making a historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.........and the Jamaican Bobsleigh team were not too far behind.....If you've seen Cool Runnings, you may have a feeling of déj? Vu when heading into this film. A family who entertain his dreams at first, but there's always the dad who wants him grounded and to carry in the family trade.Then there is the ragtag coach, whom just happens to be disgraced in the actual sport that Eddie is competing in, it's so 1993 John Candy.If you are from the UK and are over the age of 30, you can probably understand why there hasn't been a film made about his life sooner, the man was a regular face on those cheesy sketch/talent/celebrity quiz shows that graced UK prime time in the late eighties and all through the nineties.The man was, and still is to an extent, a national institution, so to make a film around the same time as Cool Runnings may have been a little bit of over exposure on the man.And the subject matter has been dealt with a lot of respect by Dexter Fletcher, as this could have easily been a parody that Leslie Nielsen would have been proud of.And it's a perfectly fine film, with a wonderful message telling you never to give up and always keep chasing your dreams, no matter what they are and how delusional others may think you are.Egerton is brilliant as the titular skier, putting in a subtle performance rather than accenting on his pseudo 'stupidity' that the media so unfairly tainted him with when he was at the height of his infamy.Jackman steals the show though as his drunken coach, and although he is your typical movie coach, doesn't like him at first,grows to admire him, has his past thrown in his face etc, etc, he's just perfect in his role.It's funny, heart warming, but it plays it just a little too safe for its own good.It's a perfect family movie for a Sunday afternoon, and would obviously make a great double bill with Cool Runnings...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jump.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.I remember part of this Olympic Games. I was 9 years old and someone told me there is a man that is insane that just jumps for the fun of it. It was like a man had been brought into the Games to only entertain. Later on.... well....the Eagle had landed.I get a sense that the story behind this all were magic and wonderful. I also sense that the movie has been given a little to firm touch of the feel good sense, as it first is a struggle in everything, and the last say 40 minutes everything is just going great and easy. This brings down the rate for me. This motion picture is spot on in giving a good time and a little nostalgic journey back in time. If all events happened in real life as in the movie, then that's fine. Maybe they could have in some production way twisted it up to get even more response from the audience.Anyway. I recommend Eddie The Eagle. Good solid movie and all the music and Olympic Games soundtracks just make me wanna fly back to the ages were television and the Olympic Games were more focused and followed. As for an Olympic movie, I have to still say that Miracle with Kurt Russell is my favourite.Oh... I almost forgot.... after the successful jump, Jump settles in an the goosebumps are going wild all over my body.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Great work on everything. The Olympic music and the tunes from the 80's gives pleasant flashbacks. - The actors : Overall standard to give it a push. - The story : True story. Period. (And an important one to always reach for your dreams.) - Entertainment : Feel good throughout... and good. Delightful - Age : 77,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clichéd but satisfying watch nevertheless. Recommended :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh off the leading role as Eggsy in 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' , Taron Egerton takes on the role of Michael ''Eddie'' Edwards , a British Skier who in 1988 became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping and i have to say he absolutely nails it with this one.He makes you root for him right to the end and he is very likable.He puts in a great performance and is supported well by Hugh Jackman who plays his mentor/coach Bronson Peary.His role is pretty clichéd but he still delivers and gets some emotional depth with a good backstory.The chemistry between the two actors are fantastic and they have some great moments together.The other supporting actors include Jo Hartley and Keith Allen who play Eddie's mom and dad respectively.Taron has some good moments with them but yet again Jo's role as a supportive mother and Keith's role as a discouraging dad has been seen before in plenty of other underdog stories. Nevertheless their performances are good enough to forget the clichés.As for the rest of the supporting cast.. well there really aren't any other supporting characters worth mentioning except for a cameo from Christopher Walken.Nevertheless this film provides sufficient amount of entertainment and its really good fun! There are plenty of comedic and humorous moments with Taron Egerton at the center of all of them. The film is also well shot and has some great ski jumping sequences. There are plenty of long shots of the snowy hills and the ramp which the athletes are to jump from and they are absolutely spine tingling! In the end the film may not be perfect and has clichéd moments but it comes under the category of feel good movies and leaves you very much satisfied and maybe even a bit teary eyed (the happy kind) at the end :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember all the hype surrounding Eddie the Eagles achievement in compeating in the Winter Olympics.I don't really care how accurate aspects of the film are,its a brilliant piece of entertainment about overcoming unbelievable odds to achieve an ambition which took real courage and determination.One thing that the film got right was the fact that 'The Eagle' got an individual mention in the closing ceremony,possibly the only individual athlete ever to be honoured in this way. But that is the whole point about his story. Its about having the courage to see something through without all the sponsership and financial support which clouds all sport today.The story speaks for itself, this film is not a documentary but its a wonderful piece of entertainment .</fullReview>

I'm in awe, the same intensity of feelings as in 'Warrior (2011)', just shown in such a classy and subtle way. Left me speechless and with tears in my eyes, beautifully done!Fantastic movie, about a great persona giving the finger to "the man"!(small spoiler alert) Only critique I have, would be utopia not to be able to put a finger on something, is why on earth did they have to overdramatize the landing from the 90 m. jump? It was spectacular enough in itself!Eddie the Eagle, one of my childhood idols!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie The Eagle review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film, i had a sense of inspiration. To think that Eddie (Taron Edgerton) would succeed in being a professional ski- diver in the Olympics with his qualities- No Chance! But Taron proved us all wrong in this Drama/Comedy film as he gives us an impression of never giving up, no matter what the consequences. I thought Taron Edgerton portrayed the role of Eddie perfectly, and thought it was a lot different compare to what sort of gangster character he played in Matthew Vaughn's 'Kingsman' the year before. There was some comedic moments in the film, and some heartbreaking moments, moments to be remembered. All in all, the film had a variety of different emotions, and Hugh Jackman played Taron's trainer perfectly. An alchoholic, a washed up sportsman who still had something to prove. One of the roles for Hugh Jackman to be remembered for. I would recommend this film to watch, i wouldn't say i was in tears in the cinema by how much i was laughing, but it had its funny moments, but mainly this film was for the amount and courage and stamina. This film is definitely one to be remembered in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tale of inspiration and hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made Eddie the Eagle such an inspiration tale of hope, courage, and inspiration is how Michael Edwards always seemed determined to make to the Olympics as a skier despite overcoming his odds and people telling him that his dream wasn't realistic or impossible. He plans to compete in the 1988 Olympics but he certainty showed that no one was going to stop him since he knew that quitting isn't an option. Eddie enlists the help of former skier Bronson Purry who once had the chance at making it big in the sport but it didn't pan out for him. I will say that Taron Egerton does a great job playing the role showing Eddie's determination and courage while Hugh Jackman plays off the Bronson with a gruff exterior who has been burned out by his bitterness but realizes that he is in a positon to help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was fourteen years old, I watched the Calgary Games and fell in love with the Winter Olympics forever. One of the reasons was all the hope and good feelings that those games brought. Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards had everything to do with that. If you remember those Olympics fondly I can't imagine that you won't love this movie. His is such a cheerful inspiring story. The film captures all of that. Taron Egerton, who looks nothing like the real person, transformed himself into the goofy guy we all came to love. Hugh Jackman is also great playing to type in a supportive father figure-ish role. I also like the way the filmmakers used the music and what I would call bullet time. If done right, the film would have been emotional already but those things really heightened it to make it one of the all-time great movies about believing in yourself. Fans of movies like 'Miracle' or 'Billy Elliot' should love it. I've seen it twice already. I can't recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No surprise, just a nice movie that you will enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't say this is a great movie but it is very enjoyable. My wife enjoyed it more than I did but I think that was due to the fact I knew how it turned out, I remember watching Eddie in the Olympics. They guy playing Eddie nailed it, Hugh Jackman was okay, a bit over the top as the washed up and drunken, bitter former ski jumper. Christopher Walken was very subdued in what amounted to a cameo. The story takes you on a journey of, basically, a lovable loser. A kid with an Olympic dream and almost no athletic ability or talent. However far he goes will be due to stubbornness and, probably poor judgement. Not to mention a whole lot of guts! Anyone that has ever seen "The agony of defeat" on ABC's Wide World of Sports knows ski jumpers are crazy. That The Eagle takes up the sport well into his 20's makes him almost certifiably insane. The movie takes the viewer through all the ups and downs, improbabilities and seemingly impossibilities but it does a pretty fair job. Several smiles will cross your lips, perhaps even a few laughs, you will, by the end of the movie, feel some emotion. Normally feel good movies leave me cold, not this one. Don't expect an Oscar nomination for Movie of the year but it is a lot closer to an Oscar than it is to a Razzie. Two Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle (2016): Dir: Dexter Fletcher / Cast: Taron Egerton, Hugh Jackman, Christopher Walken, Jo Hartley, Edvin Endre: Feel good true story inspired film about one's ability to dream big. Taron Egerton dons thick glasses to portray this British underdog who dreams of skiing the big jumps in the Olympics while representing England. He meets much opposition beginning with his father's discouragement despite happy cheers from his mother. His competition is less than good sports and apply cheat tactics to roadblock his progress. Finally the officials behind these events attempt every dirty trick to prevent him from moving forward. This is surprisingly well written and paced so effectively that we can forgive the formula and just celebrate its innocence. The one annoyance given is the clichéd and pathetic rival players or authority figures working against Eddie. Egerton makes an interesting transformation as Eddie playing off his naive nature with humorous innocence. We root for him as he attempts several steep and dangerous ski jumps only to crash to a crumpled heap on the ground. Yet through determination he sets his goals high. Hugh Jackman plays Bronson Peary, a former ski champion whose career faded as his alcohol abuse settled in. He reluctantly coaches Eddie and finds inspiration returning. Christopher Walken makes an appearance as someone who observed the fall of Peary's talent. Rounding it out comically is the opposite reactions of Eddie's parents. Dream big and never give up as one might discover that life's biggest jumps are God's ultimate gifts. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Feel Good Movies I've Seen in a While</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a soft spot for these feel-good type movies and this is easily one of the best I've seen in a long time. All of the characters just ooze charm and I found myself smiling throughout the entire film. I'm not actually familiar with the real Eddie Edwards but this story was so heartwarming that I feel like I'm going to have to find out more about the guy. This flick is directed by Dexter Fletcher and I honestly don't know of anything else he has directed, but I'm definitely looking forward to more from him especially if it's as good as this movie.Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton) is a young man that has dreamed of becoming an Olympic athlete ever since he was a young boy. He's actually an accomplished skier but is refused admission on to the Olympic team since he doesn't have the "look" or upbringing that the English Olympic officials desire. He decides to become a ski jumper since England doesn't have one and they would be forced to let him compete. Unfortunately, he has to learn how to actually ski jump first and he'll need a little help from an ex-ski jumper named Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman). Eddie's determination soon charms everyone he comes into contact with and earns him a spot in Olympic history.I thought all of the actors did a great job with this one but I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Egerton and Jackman. These two play off of each other so well it's almost scary. I didn't even recognize Egerton when I first saw the movie. Eddie is so different from the character he played in Kingsman that it didn't even occur to me that they were the same person. Egerton absolutely nails this role and is easily one of the most affable characters I've seen in any film for a long time. I enjoy seeing Jackman in just about anything he does and this movie is no exception. There were a few scenes where it felt like I was watching Wolverine on screen rather than Bronson but it didn't bother me at all. He doesn't steal the scenes quite the way Egerton does though.The scenes involving the actual ski jumping is done very well and you really get the feeling of awe and danger that the sport instills in its participants. Seeing the hills ascend into the sky can be a bit daunting and I enjoyed how they helped us to experience the sense of speed that the ski jumpers feel when going down the incline at something around seventy miles an hour. It kind of makes me want to go ski jumping but I soon realized that was a ridiculously bad idea.This film is really just a lot of fun and is incredibly heartwarming. Nothing really out of the ordinary is being done here but it's done so well that it's difficult not to legitimately feel for Eddie and his predicament. You have to love a guy that is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed despite all the criticism coming his way. Like I said before, nothing really unique being done on this one but I have to recommend it just because of how great the film is. I honestly can't think of anyone that wouldn't enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw an advance screening of this tonight (1/26). Very good story (based on true events) of Eddie Edwards who, in 1988 was Britain's first ski jumper in the Winter Olympics in Calgary. He previously had been a fairly decent downhill skier who missed out on being on GB's team and then decided to change his sport to ski jumping since GB had no one else. The movie goes on to his trials to get certified to be on the Olympic team. Movie has him training in Europe although he actually trained at Lake Placid, NY.Taron Egerton plays "Eddie" and Hugh Jackman is his coach. Jackman becomes his coach after observing that Eddie perhaps has no talent at all but has plenty of resolve and determination to achieve his goal of being an Olympian. Beautiful scenery throughout with some of the shots looking as if they had been taken directly from the 1988 Olympics.This is a movie far different from the current trend of action, end of the world movies, but being based on a true story will easily hold your interest. It's not described as a comedy, but there are plenty of humorous scenes in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ETE is a triumph of the human spirit. Its a well made feel good sports biopic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle (the film and real person)is a triumph of the human spirit. Its a inspirational film, which will leave you with smile on your face. Based on a true story, ETE is a yet another sports biopic, which is about a underdog, but this film is notches above the ordinary. ETE is the feel good film of the year till now, and Its a film I throughly enjoyed. The film almost doesn't have a false not, the acting, the 80s production values, the script, is all top notch. You know if your rooting for the main protagonist by the end of the film, the film has succeed. But is the film really worth a watch in the cinema halls,well lets analyze.Story wise this film is a true story about Michael "Eddie" Edwards an unlikely but courageous British ski-jumper who never stopped believing in himself even as an entire nation was counting him out. With the help of a rebellious and charismatic coach,Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making an improbable and historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.Acting wise Taron Egerton is a revelation, he has made massive strides in the acting department since his last performances in Kingsman and Legend. He totally lives the role, and gives a knock out performance. Hugh Jackman is a complete bad ass in the film, and is on his A game as always. He starts off as a wild drunk, but by the end of the film he pitches in a mature restraint act. Watch out for the scene when he does the 90m ski jump, its a totally bad ass scene.ETE is not just your regular feel good sports film about a underdog, its pitches itself as being more nuanced than that, even as we know the films end result. The film has a huge relatable factor that works in its favor, the film is about a common man who dreamed, and as a viewer I was easily able to put myself in the main protagonists shoes. ETE also evokes all the right emotions at the most opportune time, and this is because of the solid screenplay and script. We laugh, snicker, and cheer in the film in abundance. ETE is paced perfectly, and there is never even close to a boring sequence in the film. The 80s Europe milieu is captured well in the film, because of great production values(the proper 80s clothing,cars etc).ETE honestly has many great moments in the film, which are full of laughter, and inspiring moments, I mean every ski jumping scene is exhilarating (and amazingly shot), but the pre climax 90m jump in the 1988 Calgary winter Olympics was a heart pounding, literally goose bump arising scene. I literally felt like cheering on for Eddie and clapping while I was seated in the cinema hall. Its one best film sequences I have seen in 2016.ETE is just so inspiring and motivating at times, it makes viewers believe that anything is literally possible if we try(I know that sounds cheesy,but thats ETE for you). We just don't see sports films done right anymore like ETE, for example Saala Khadoos a Hindi movie of the same genre, strived to be like a ETE but fell way short. The only thing that bogs down ETE a bit is that the film is not very novel, as many sports films have treaded a similar path, predictability seeps into the film. But these are minor blemishes.Overall I highly recommend this feel good sports biopic, its simply put a great inspiring and motivating film. Its the 2nd really good Hollywood/English film of 2016 after Hail Caesar (Its overall better than HC). Grade: 82% B+ 4/5*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for an underdog story. Movies like ROCKY always get to me. I find myself cheering along the hero of the film in the hopes that they will achieve their dream, that they will win, that they will become larger than life. EDDIE THE EAGLE is that type of film. Based on a true story it's not about what ski jumper Eddie Edwards achieved but more about the journey he had to get there.As a young boy Eddie Edwards dreamed of being in the Olympics. Saddled with physical issues he fails to succeed at track and field events. This leads him to attempt something else, downhill skiing. He develops into a good skier but snobbish representatives of for Great Britain look down on his social status and don't allow him a spot on the team. Determined to enter the Olympics one way or another he sets his sights on a different goal, that of ski jumper.This should make things easier as Great Britain doesn't have a team in this event. Except for the fact that Eddie has never ski jumped before. Ever. But through his determination he finds his way to a training facility in Germany and starts off on the smaller jumps. Ridiculed by the other Olympic jumpers he gets help from a woman who owns the restaurant near the hill. She allows him to stay there, to work for her and then guides him to someone who could help him achieve his goals. Except that the man wants nothing to do with the idea.Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) was once one of the top jumpers on the American team when he was in his 20s. A disagreement with his mentor/coach Warren Sharp (Christopher Walken) led to his leaving the team as well as his Olympic dreams behind. Resentful, disheartened and unlikeable Peary now runs the jumps and grooms the snow on the slopes. Determined to get his help Eddie continues to pressure him threatening to jump without his guidance which he does. Seeing his determination, his spirit and how the other jumpers try and humiliate him, Peary finally agrees.Eddie gets better and is about to be added to Great Britain's list of attendees until the same snooty team official who ousted him early on has them change the rules for him to qualify. Unwilling to bend or play by their rules Edwards and Peary enter another competition for him to qualify. While on the verge of not making it he eventually finds himself qualified and off to the Olympics.If you know the results of what happened it won't make a difference. If you don't I won't tell you here. For Eddie Edwards his goal was to simply be a part of something larger than himself, a childhood dream of being in the Olympics and representing not only his country but himself as well. His enthusiasm, his determination and his passion are what make his character so lovable and inspiring. His story is one that all should hear and see.The movie is exceptionally well made with breathtaking cinematography that puts you right in the shoes of Eddie as he jumps. The acting is amazing with a nearly unrecognizable Taron Egerton as Eddie. He looks nothing like he did in KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE from 2 years ago. He breathes life into Eddie here rather than make him a cardboard cutout of a man. Jackman takes on the role of sideman here instead of grabbing the spotlight and in so doing displays what a terrific actor he is in the process. At a point in his career where he can take the lead role easily he shows what a true supporting actor can accomplish.The story of Eddie Edwards is an inspiration. I defy anyone to put this movie into their DVD player and not find themselves cheering him on by the films end. Win, lose or draw when the final competition arrives (I told you I wouldn't reveal the ending) doesn't matter. His story of finding a place for himself in the history books about the Olympics is more than enough. The movie entertains, enlightens and leaves you with a smile on your face. Overlooked when it arrived in theaters now is the chance for this film to be discovered. It deserves that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great movie not a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate sports. As long as I can remember I wasn't any good at them and I was some times bullied for it as a kid (but I'm not some fat nerd sitting in a basement at the computer eating chips either so don't get me wrong!) so at some level I think I can relate to Eddie as a character. I also hate bio movies. Mostly they are not accurate, as well as this one.How ever when watching the movie I didn't know it was based on a real story and it managed to do what movies are supposed to do: It made me feel. So I don't care if it's accurate or not. Not very many movies have brought tears in my eyes. This one did, and I'm not very emotional guy. I enjoyed every moment of it. The acting was great, especially Egertons. Only thing i didn't like as a Finn, was Matti Nykänen. He should have been played by a real Finnish guy (now played by a Swedish actor) that could have done the accent and everything as badly as we Finns do.If you want accuracy go to Wikipedia. This is a movie that's going to make you happy.Sorry for my poor English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally got to see this movie and it was really nostlagic and feel good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie The Eagle stars Taron Egerton,Hugh Jackman,Jim Broadbent and Christopher Walken and tells the true story of a young British boy named Eddie(Egerton)who dreams of being an Olympic skier ever since he was a little boy. His father of course(Keith Allen)doesn't want Eddie to become an skier but a plasterer. Now all grown up Eddie goes to the headquarters in England (led by Tim McInerney from the live action 101 Dalmatian movies)who tells Eddie that he just isn't good enough to become a skier. All that changes however for Eddie as he travels to Germany and tries the 40m jump,the 60m jump but failed at the 60m jump,that is until he sees a tough cookie named Bronson Peary(Hugh Jackman)a former Olympic skier who lost out a long time ago and all he does is drinks heavy and smokes. At first Bronson doesn't want to help Eddie out as Eddie,but the two form a bound and he helps Eddie compete with the Olympic games by travelling all over from Austria and even Canada. But will Eddie's dreams of winning the Olympics in 1988 come true?Overall I thought this film was a very good biopic. The music is phenomenal as its got this 80s edge to it,the acting is top notch,I thought Taron Egerton was fantastic as Eddie "the Eagle"Edwards and Hugh Jackman had a lot of laughs as the washed up former skier Bronson Peary who's manager happened to be Christopher Walken(who makes a cameo near the end of the film).If you love underdog movies where you've got people who are proving to others that they are wrong and they are right or you loved Cool Running's along with any of the following actors then you will love this film.SO glad I got this on DVD as I was unable to have seen it in the cinemas this year.Thumbs up4/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'EDDIE THE EAGLE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sports comedy-drama flick, based on the life of Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards; the first Olympic ski jumper, in 6 decades, to represent Great Britain. The movie stars Taron Egerton (in the title role) and Hugh Jackman. It was directed by Dexter Fletcher and co- produced by Matthew Vaughn (both Fletcher and Egerton have costarred in films directed by Vaughn before). The script was written by first time screenwriters Sean Macaulay and Simon Kelton. It bombed at the Box Office, but it did do well with the critics. I enjoyed it.The story begins in Great Britain, in the early 70s, when Eddie Ewards (Tom Costello) was just a boy. He dreams of competing in the Summer Olympics, but later he realizes his skills are better suited for the Winter Games. As an adult, Eddie (Egerton) becomes a decently skilled skier; but he's rejected by the British Olympic officials, due to fear that he might embarrass them. Eddie then becomes determined to become the first Olympic ski jumper, in several decades, to represent Great Britain. He's mocked by other jumpers, but he later gains the reluctant coaching assistance of a drunken former American champion (Jackman). The movie is clichéd, and a little overly sentimental (in places); but it's also extremely inspiring, and uplifting. Fletcher does a great job helming the movie, and both Egerton and Jackman are very likable in their roles. It's definitely nothing we haven't seen before, and it does feel a lot like a 'ROCKY' flick, but it's also a great feel- good movie. I think most viewers will enjoy it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The posters, teasers did not impress me at all. The thought the film going to be a flop. Surprisingly the film was much better than I anticipation. This is a biographical-sport film and very inspiring. The story of a British boy in the early 70s who dreamt to be an Olympian, but the problem is he has not found his sports. By the time in his 20s, he finally finds his interest and gives his best to make his long pending wish to come true. The remaining narration reveals his journey to the world's one of the big events where he aims to soar like an eagle.Hugh Jackman was not any terrific, he was awesome like usual, but in a supporting role. I think Taron Egerton will be the next British sensation. This film worth seeing for his phenomenal act. The real Eddie too appreciated that. The whole film revolved around these two characters and I think making it a comedy worked out so well. Nicely shot film in the beautiful places, especially those risky ski jump stunts were excellent and the direction was undoubtedly the best.This film is not particularly about the sport, it is about one showing his passion towards his undertaking. Eddie can be seen as a role model, no matter what he achieved, his fighting spirit is motivating. I think the youngsters should watch it, especially those who are after their dreams. Not just sport persons, but any field persons. I don't know about the repeat viewing, but watching once is enough for the confidence uplift. One of the must see film of the 2016.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly inspirational!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle is an inspiring biopic about following your dreams despite what the world thinks of you. The movie justifies all those maxims you might have come across growing up like ? "Follow your dreams!", "Never give up!" and all those perseverance clichés. But the most important one that I take out from the movie is ? "Celebrate every little success".EDDIE THE EAGLE OLYMPIAN DREAM Looking at the bright insightful eyes of young Eddie where dreams skulked somewhere deep down, scouring persistently for his life's true objective, your heart might end up brimming up with empathy for the poor lad. Also, looking at his gusto to settle on a dream, his constant search as he zeroes in on what he truly wants to become might leave you disappointed in yourself. Did you once have a passion you were never able give a proper form to? Something that made you so happy, and yet you decided to listen to those who inadvertently stopped you from doing it? Well Eddie never listened to anybody but his heart, and that made all the difference.PLOT OF THE BIOPIC Eddie the Eagle tries to weigh in on the biopic of the real Michael Edwards in a delightful mien. It will let you bag all the good feels as the movie goes on jumping around in them Eddie shoes. The journey starts off in a pleasant manner but there is that hurdle in the form of Terry, Eddie's dad played by Keith Allen who constantly tries to dissuade him from doing what Eddie really loves."Are you telling me you never had a dream dad?" He is instantly reflective of the world, something that is trying to stop one from achieving one's ultimate goal. Our lives are inundated with such characters who are pressing us constantly to steer from our path. It is a good thing that Terry is there in the movie and that he never approved of him that makes Eddie the Eagle further powerful as he says he loves to prove people wrong.Eddie the Eagle struggles profusely as he tries in his own candid way to get himself the spot everybody denies him. But there was no stopping him, the perseverance he shows to achieve is worth commendable.SPOILERS SKI-JUMPING FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS: There are plenty of brilliant acts in the movie. A pleasant side-plot that Hugh Jackman runs is endearing to watch. Christopher Walken and Jim Broadbent cameo were lovely. CONS The movie's melodrama is a bit questionable. It doesn't fling anything gut-wrenching at you. Hugh Jackman's bar fight scene looks like strangely concocted in a clichéd fashion. Taron Egerton often goes in and out of his character multiple times. However does create his version of Eddie beautifully with that constant frown and that wide jaw framing.Another thing that cannot be completely overlooked is that the beauty of the sport hasn't been milked enough. For a guy who has set his eyes on something so huge as ski-jumping there has to be a story to it, or if there isn't, we needed a better screenplay coming from Eddie The Eagle justifying his love for the sport. The film misses both. It goes too light for a dream so big.Also, eventually as the movie comes to fruition it vexes the viewers into questioning whether Eddie the Eagle was crazy or completely sane. The way the movie was depicted right from the start would have you believe that he was alright but then afterwards it was kind of hard to tell.It also, in an attempt to deliberately dodge the question of Eddie's progress, fails to show where Eddie really stood. The fact that it's okay to come last should have been milked more because that was actually the crux on which the movie was based. Celebrating defeating himself, his own personal record was what overjoyed him more, which I think required more screen time.Also, there was a lot of fact changing going on that distorted the real Eddie the Eagle, Michael Edward. As Michael Edward puts it that it clicked with his life only 5% which raises brows at its accuracy.THE FINAL VERDICT Eddie the Eagle might not be a hero one hunts for in a movie, as he always ends up coming last, but there is a lot of heroism one could derive from him, with his free spirit, his perseverance, his attitude, and his constant pursuit for the stars.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

How many of us whish we had followed our main dream to fruition? It's set in the 1980's and it's simply superb in the way it delivers that era.Frankly I couldn't fault it. Perfect acting from all actors, well executed and perfect story telling.I couldn't fault it. For the time length this is superb and I'm certain it's going to be a classic.I'm off to grab the soundtrack already because it brought back many fine memories of an age I wish the entire world could revisit.Ignore terrorism and boring politics and get back to being your best fellow people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting and Thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Eddie The Eagle" is the type of movie that is rarely produced anymore. We've been flooded with copies and copies of the same superhero film. What was thrilling and special before has now turned into a slightly amusing experience. It's lost its freshness. Maybe that's the reason anything different feels so new, though it's part of a long Hollywood tradition that people used to love. The best thing about "Eddie" is how entertaining it is, with great acting all around, and the nature of its message is strong and positive, something we need to hear and see more often now.Egerton made a strong impression in "Kingsman", setting himself up as a debonair, strong, and suave hero. Jackman is great support as the coach who has lost his way and finds an opportunity to redeem himself by training Eddie. Their work together reminds people of the big stars of the past, with good chemistry going through the entire film. We believe in the relationship, with their highs and lows. These two play friends very well.Eddie is a fighter and a dreamer. From his early set backs, he has become determined to become an Olympian. Because of physical ailments, this might be an impossible dream, but he persists. It doesn't help that there is very little encouragement from his father. Still, he keeps going, facing more obstacles along the way.Eddie, has after all, started late, chosen a sport that is challenging, dangerous, and possibly deadly. There's something about the man, and he continues to find ways to make his dreams come true. The last act of the movie has you on your toes because of the way it's acted and directed. We see and feel the intensity of the experience, the possible tragic ending, or the way the film might soar along with Eddie's dreams. In the end, the experience pays off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting underdog story with a heart and humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dexter Fletcher's biopic sports-drama isn't anything out of the ordinary from other sports flicks, nor are there many typical sports clichés in the book unexplored. But when it comes to sports movies energized by an uplifting story, many audiences nowadays near to stare pass the overwhelming tapped tropes that many films of the genre are more than known for. Director Dexter Fletcher blesses the audience with an light-hearted feel-good story based on true events set of the famous ski jumper Eddie Edwards, often known as "Eddie The Eagle" who left a landmark on Winter Olympics history. The film is set in 1988 and stars Taran Egerton as Michael "Eddie" Edwards, a British ski jumper who's dreamed of competing in the Winter Olympics since childhood, and is prepare to stop at nothing to cultivate that dream. His mother Janette (played by Jo Hartley) is very encouraging about his goal but his father Terry (played by Keith Allen) isn't too crazy about this and prefers him to work with him in his plastering business. Worse, he faces skepticism from the public who since British athletes rarely make into the Winter Olympics. Ignoring the lack of evidence from everyone, Eddie turns to former ski jumper Bronson Peary (played by Hugh Jackman) to help train him for the 90 meter jump in the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics, the moment that wins Eddie the hearts everyone of his hometown.As predictable and formulaic as it gets, this film knows how to be fun and uplifting without feeling the needs to pursue something new or be emotionally manipulative. Though not everyone will look pass the overly borrowed elements from other sports flicks like the sports training montages and the underdog's fight-to-the-top story, there is still some heart, humor, and plenty of charisma to be experienced. When we are introduced to the titular character Eddie, he is almost instantly likable from beginning to end. He's a charming young man with an inspiring "never-give-up" attitude and is willing to do whatever to reach his goal while fighting against the adversity of his hometown including his father who views his son's efforts as an utter waster of time. Throughout the film, you can't help but root for him and cheer him on until the end. His charisma is made sincere by a likable performance by Taron Egerton who were last make a high octane appearance in the spy comedy 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' directed by Matthew Vaughn who takes the executive producer position here. Hugh Jackman who plays the titular character's mentor comes out on spot as well. Though he starts off less likable (but not hateful), he grows to be both a good piece of comic relief and pure likability over time, and his performance does not disappoint. Christopher Walken also makes an appearance here as Bronson's former coach but is sadly underused with very little screen time. Eddie The Eagle is an exciting feel-good sports drama with a good message, heart, and a fair amount of wittiness, despite the shortage of originality. This film may not be anything special and far for anything Oscar-worthy, but it makes for a satisfying (and occasionally funny) experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie the Eagle Soars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle is the movie that is based on the life and Olympic dreams of a Michael "Eddie" Edwards. As a young boy, Edwards' dream was to become an Olympian in any sport he can. The trouble is, he wasn't good at any of them. He discovers ski jumping and figures he has a chance since Britain hasn't had a ski jump competitor since 1928. And he's just as bad at jumping as he's been at everything else. He enlists the training of former competitive ski jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) who also strongly encourages Eddie (Taron Egerton) to quit while he's still alive. But the Eagle's determination wins over Peary and the two set out to compete in the Olympics. Eddie qualifies simply by successfully landing a 70 meter height jump in an international competition. The Olympic Committee swiftly changes the rules of qualification in an effort to keep Eddie the embarrassment from participating in the games. So he goes out and meets their demands and they are forced to let him in. He finishes last in the 70 meter jump, but it's enough to set a British record and Eddie is thrilled. His celebration, though losing the event, wins over the crowd. His unorthodox jumping style earns him the nickname Eagle, but he still doesn't have respect. He decides to compete in the 90 meter height, though he never has jumped from that level before.For those of you who don't quite grasp exactly how tall that is. 90 meters is just over 295 feet which is just shy of 100 yards. So, imagine standing a football field upright. That's how high up he is at the beginning of the jump. A typical jumper reaches speeds of 60 miles per hour by the time they jump and jumps over the distance of a football field. Eddie the Eagle is being hailed as one of the most inspirational movies of the year. Delightfully feel-good. In my preview, I said that movies like this make me nervous for two reasons: first, it's based on a true story, but can I enjoy the movie without constantly analyzing how much is true and how much is embellished or changed to make it a Hollywood movie? The second reason movies like this make me nervous is because it's a feel-good movie about an underdog. These can be extremely well done and bring you to tears and make you cheer from your seat. Or they can be forced and manipulated, and I don't appreciate that. The preview looked sweet, charming, sincere, genuine, entertaining and inspiring. But, that's what 30 second previews are supposed to look like. Eddie the Eagle backed it up with a truly delightful movie. It is set in the late 1980's and it looks and sounds like it was filmed in the 80's as well. It has a certain graininess to it and a soundtrack that was taken straight out of some of your favorite 80's movies. The emotionally charged scenes courtesy of any John Hughes film; the action from movies like Rad or ET; inspirational and training scenes from The Karate Kid,Flashdance or Footloose. It didn't take itself too seriously, but was seriously entertaining. What tugged most at my emotional heart strings was not that everyone was against Eddie, not the mocking, not the overcoming of obstacles, not the crowd cheering for him. What got me most was his loving and supportive mother. Maybe it's because my mom is the same way, always supportive and encouraging no matter what I want to do; always the biggest fan. Eddie's father told him he's no athlete; but his mother always believed in him, or at least in his spirit. She even gave him an old lunch box to take with him to hold all his Olympic medals. It served more as a graveyard for his many pairs of broken eyeglasses in his repeated failures, but she always supported him.I gave Eddie the Eagle a hesitant, but hopeful 4 Stars and I'm standing by that but without any hesitancy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was not manipulative or forceful. It was perfectly cheesy, sweet, funny and wonderful matched with the most timely nostalgic soundtrack you could imagine, and has a decent chance of making it to my home collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inspired by true events, Eddie the Eagle is a feel-good story about Michael "Eddie" Edwards (Taron Egerton), an unlikely but courageous British ski-jumper who never stopped believing in himself - even as an entire nation was counting him out. With the help of a rebellious and charismatic coach (played by Hugh Jackman), Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making an improbable and historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. From producers of Kingsman: The Secret Service, Eddie the Eagle stars Taron Egerton as Eddie, the lovable underdog with a never say die attitude. Eddie The Eagle is a heartwarming and beautiful looking movie with 2 great performances by Jackman and Egerton who starts living his mark on the big screen after the amazing Kingsman movie from last year. This is a film that wants you to never give up on your dreams and fight no matter what</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put off watching this film as I didn't think there could be anything interesting about ski jumping, or the life of Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards. How wrong I was.I grew up watching Eddie at the Olympics, but didn't quite remember the impact he actually had on the sport.The film is well paced, there are a few cringe moments, but I think the casting was excellent with great chemistry between all of the cast. The film draws you in from the outset and at one point you know it's going to end, this is when you want to start watching it from the beginning again!Taron Egerton was fantastic as Eddie, capturing all his mannerisms and in my opinion it was one of Hugh Jackman's best performances.It's a wonderful music score which picks up the best of the '80s and '90s. Dexter Fletcher touches on some wonderful John Hughes moments and I have to say there was a tear in my ear several times throughout the film. With a modest budget of $23m the film was well constructed and didn't lack vision throughout. Only taking $46m at the box office I think you will see the film achieve cult status in the coming years.A wonderful feel good film that has you rooting for the underdog from the very beginning and leaving you with a sense of anything is achievable at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical feel good sports film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally wrote a longer and more in depth review on the movie itself rather than the history but it disappeared so now I'm just going to give a brief synopsis of my thoughts. This is a pretty typical film that is supposed to make you feel good and root for the underdog. It has some nice moments of comedy to it and you'll feel attached to his success since you spent the last hour seeing all the hardships he went through to get there. Which is why it only gets a 7. This film takes the inspired by concept about as far as it can be taken. The real Eddie the Eagle said the film is probably 5% true. I get annoyed by films based on real events or real people but don't resemble the truth at all. The caveat to that being when reality is pretty amazing too, it just isn't as Hollywood. **Start major spoilers**The film essentially says this is a child with everything against him chasing his dreams. He had some kind of issue as a child that made him forced to wear a leg brace, think Forest Gump style, but didn't let that malady which is never explained stop him. He attempted to be on an Olympic team but was super clumsy lacked skill and pretty much sucked. He was inspired by an amazing athlete in another sport and decided to do that. That system was against him but thanks to his coach, the only person other than his mother who believed in him, he made it to the games anyway despite not jumping much.Almost none of that reflects reality. He didn't have a medical issue that out him in braces. He was a crazy daredevil of a child that got injured cause he did stupid things. He wasn't some awful failure at his chosen event. He was one spot short of going to the Olympics. When he couldn't cut it he went to Lake Placid to get better at that sport. Still couldn't cut it and decided to switch sports primarily due to money and the guarantee of going to the Olympics since he was the only competitor. His coach isn't real and is based on the dozen of coaches that took time to help him at Lake Placid. The "system" wasn't against him. That 61m rule would be awfully impressive for him to pass since he didn't manage that distance at the Olympics and while a little over a year is nothing compared to 20 years of practice, he was far from a guy who didn't jump much. I know I am nitpicking over a movie but the guy was probably the only unsponsored athlete at the Olympics. Great story! He had to keep his helmet on with twine until one was donated to him because he had no money to chase his dream. Such adversity! He was doing 60+ jumps a day. What dedication! He found out he would go to Calgary when he was staying in an Asylum cause it had cheap rent. Truth is stranger than fiction! My point being they didn't need to make a bunch of things up to show what an inspiring story Eddie the Eagle was for a Great Britain that honestly sucked and needed some heroes underdog heroes at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The British ski jumper in the 1988 Winter Olympics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie on DVD from my public library. It is a very enjoyable movie inspired by real events, the theme is never giving up on your goals, most things are achievable if you work hard enough.A key point to emphasize is the story here is "inspired by" the real Edwards and his exploits. He did go to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary (I remember it well, watching him on TV) as the first ever Alpine ski jumper from Britain and he did finish last in each of his events. But according to the real Eddie about 5% to 10% is factual, the rest made up for the movie.Just a couple of examples, the movie depicts him starting jumping from scratch and going to Germany to learn. In reality he was quite experienced and almost made the British cross country ski team, then went to Lake Placid to learn to jump competitively. The movie has a character, Hugh Jackman as former American jumper Bronson Peary who teaches him jumping. That character is fictional.Taron Egerton is very good as Michael "Eddie" Edwards. As the movie depicts from an early age he was fascinated by the Olympics and wanted to some day compete. In the summer Olympics. When it became clear he didn't have the athletic talent to do so he turned to ski jumping. There was no history of Britain having an athlete in ski jumping so he figured if he could demonstrate competence in a competition then he could go. And he did.It is historically accurate that after the 1988 Winter Olympics, even though "Eddie the Eagle" was a big hit, the rules were changed so that in each event certain performance minimums had to be met to quality for an Olympic invitation. Eddie never could meet the new standards and was never able to compete in subsequent Olympics.The movie is done in a very interesting and entertaining manner, thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie requires that you submit to the legend of Eddie the Eagle. Do not watching it looking for some deep, complex meaning. Instead watch it in the spirit that it is intended, celebrating one person's potential to overcome the steepest of odds. A real feel good film. Had me punching the air. Hugh Jackman was a wonderful, swaggering source of amusement opposite Taron Egerton's earnest and charming Eddie. At times the movie becomes cliché, but it embraces its own over-the-top self and provides a genuinely uplifting experience. In advance of the upcoming Olympic games in Rio, it is important to reconnect with the true spirit of the games, a spirit that it is hard to deny is embodied by Eddie the Eagle.

		<fullReview>Another docudrama with heart, EDDIE THE EAGLE as written by Simon Kelton and Sean Macaulay and directed by Dexter Fletcher manages to offer not only a well acted and performed film, rich is spectacular scenery, but also gives insight to the committed athlete concept that produces winners. The story is based on events in the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics, but it begins with the childhood of Eddie Edwards (at age 10 by Tom Costello and at age 15 by Jack Costello), his loving mother (Jo Hartley), plasterer and realistic father (Keith Allen) as little Eddie strives to be an athlete ? his dream: to be in the Olympics. Unable to make the grade at any part of the Olympics, Eddie (now Taron Egerton) decides to go against the advice of the British Olympic council (Tim McInnerny) and trains for the Winter Olympics instead. Eddie is an unlikely but courageous British ski-jumper who never stopped believing in himself - even as an entire nation was counting him out. With the help of a rebellious, alcoholic snow groomer turned coach for Eddie Bronson Peary (played by Hugh Jackman), Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making an improbable and historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. There are some important actors in minor roles ? Jim Broadbent, Christopher Walken, Ania Sowinski, and Matt Rippy among them ? but the show belongs to Taron Egerton who is fully immersed in this role. This is a true story and a feel good movie and if it fails to be great it is because the story is far more intimate than Grand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>functional underdog sports movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton) has always wanted to be in the Olympics but he's terribly clumsy. His father tries to teach him a trade but he has an idea when he sees a local artificial ski hill. Despite working hard to ski, he's still not good enough to try out for the '88 Olympics British team in Calgary. He sees ski jumping on TV but the British has no training facilities. He decides to go to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The real skiers laugh at him. He convinces former-star-turn-drunken-snow-groomer Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) to help.It's an underdog sports movie. It's not always funny. It's actually a little scary to remember how dangerous it was for Eddie the Eagle. It's half-persistence and half-madness. It's fine that this is filled with classic clichés. That's what clichés are for. It's touching but I need more outright jokes. Eddie could be a funnier character. This is a little movie that hits the heartstrings real hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest, I was very sceptical about watching this as I'm not big on movies that don't have aliens, fast cars, or mindless violence.......... HOWEVER...... I was glued from start to finish. I remember being a kid and watching Eddie Edwards at the Calgary Winter Olympics, and seeing it from a "behind the scenes" point of view kind of made me ashamed to be English. The uptight "look down their nose" attitude was portrayed very well, yet Eddie never gave up and the way the movie was made had me egging the actors on. I won't give any more of the story away as this truly has to be seen to be appreciated. If you aren't crying by the end of the film there is definitely something wrong with you. As I said in the summary, if you only watch one movie this year, make it this one!!! I have never rated a movie a 10..... until this one. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a young boy who has always dreamed about competing in the Olympics. His seemingly far fetched dream gradually becomes reality through persistence, courage and a bit of help from others.I assumed from the poster that "Eddie the Eagle" is a comedy. In reality it's far from a comedy, even though it has its funny moments. The plot is inspirational, and it touches me deeply. Even when everyone PS Eddie down and even sets up obstacles to block him from progressing, he persists and gets to his goal. It's a triumphant fight to prove those snobs wrong, and a further triumph to himself that he achieves his phenomenal success despite such limited support and resources. He's lucky to have the bar staff supporting him, and the former skier coaching him. All stars align to make his success possible, because someone even through hard work and persistence it doesn't work out. It is a remarkable story that lifts spirits soaring high. I love it. Now I have to find out whether he competed in the following Olympics!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taron Egerton is perfectly cast as the unlikely British Olympic ski jumper Michael "Eddie" Edwards. Wisely, while Eddie is portrayed as very eccentric, he's not quite an idiot. His heroic qualities come across well -- chiefly, pursuing his Olympic dream despite quite unbelievable odds against him. The film takes a rather clichéd dig at the British class system, but it's not hard to believe how much harder it would be for a working class tradesman to do well in sport than it would be for someone with plenty of money and social connections. My favourite scene is a massive crowd welcoming Eddie home at London airport -- he must have been such a loved figure. It's sad that qualifying rules have been tightened so someone else like Eddie can now never again compete at the Olympic Games. The film quotes Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the modern Olympics founder, who said it's the struggle and doing your best that counts, not winning. The rival Scandanavian skiiers are all rather overly nasty. Hugh Jackman, as Eddie's coach, is supposed to be a washed up drunken playboy, but unfortunately Hugh looks way too good! He just doesn't convince as a bitter, loser recluse-- the only gesture is the endless cigarettes he smokes. This film isn't a masterpiece, but it's made with affection and it's not a bad little picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ticks all of the boxes that a feel-good movie should</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, the era of Eddie The Eagle occurred when I was just a wee little lass so I didn't know much about the hype behind this beloved Olympic hero. When seeing this film at my local theatre, however, I was pleased to see that the session was virtually full and with people of all ages. Something that really struck a note with me was the fact that a lot of parents brought their kids along to see this PG film ? and it is a film that I truly believe should be seen by the younger generation.As far as motivating underdog feel-good movies go, this one was pretty up there. It included a slightly comedic tinge with sentimental undertones that had you really rooting for Michael 'Eddie' Edwards (played by the young up-and-comer to keep your eyes on, Taron Egerton). After a life-long dream of becoming an Olympic champion, Eddie teams up with disgraced American ski jumper Bronson Peary ? played by a tough but lovable Hugh Jackman ? and the two of them become just what the other needs to flush out their weaknesses and make them stronger.As cliché as this sounds, this film really does inspire and make you feel like you can achieve anything. Despite being shut down so many times and by so many people, including his grumpy old dad, Eddie has a spirit that never gives up and whether he succeeds or fails is beside the point. His na?ve nature and positive disposition will make even the iciest of hearts melt and the toughest of hearts soar with inspiration.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie The Eagle is directed by Dexter Fletcher and stars Taron Egerton, Hugh Jackman, Joe Hartley, Keith Allen and Christopher Walken. Inspired by true events, the film follows Eddie Edwards as he pursues his dream of becoming an Olympic Athlete in the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics with the help of charismatic coach, Bronson Peary. This is a story of true passion and courage, and the incredible power of human spirit. Eddie The Eagle soars high with a beautiful tale about a small-town underdog who had a dream. It hits all the points in terms of its advertised promise; a feel-good, fun, energetic, and comedic story that will have you on the edge of your seat, especially when the ski-jump scenes are so brilliantly constructed and punctuated. Not only that, but having Taron as Eddie was one of the best decisions the casting director made. He settles into the character and personality of Eddie so well that it's absolutely realistic and believable. Hugh Jackman as the (almost) completely fictional Bronson Peary coincided naturally with Taron's performance and they both complemented each other extremely well on-screen. The parents, played by Joe and Keith, were decent enough to be pushed to the background and not taken too seriously without distraction to the two main cast members in the foreground. A lot of the acting around Taron and Hugh felt cheesy and cheap, apart from Christopher Walken, who does appear briefly in the film. But maybe this is what the director and writers were heading towards when working on the screenplay. Baring in mind this is set in the 80s, it's something I can forget about when studying the film and experiencing it again in the future.Speaking of the 80s, the original score had to be spot-on in composition and structure, and I believe that Matthew Margeson did a terrific job bringing the classic sounds back. Old synths and drum pads softly reconcile the picture and music with skill. What's great about it is you can listen to the score without the picture and still find that same enjoyment. There's not a huge amount of music featured in the film so it doesn't ever pull you out of the experience, so much as it draws you in. Again, the ski-jump scenes are paired tastefully with Matthew's score which are huge highlights.When you really look at the care taken during not only the shooting, but the editing of this feature, you can see how much fun the filmmakers had with this project. It's very nice to sit back for a while and experience something other than superhero battles and YA adaptions, which I don't dislike, I actually get some enjoyment out of them. It's just nice to see something different and not so tiresome. My verdict; Eddie The Eagle is a wonderful, feel-good, comedic look at the passionate dreamer who made said dreams a reality. This is a must-watch. Eddie The Eagle, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eagle Has Landed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Eddie the Eagle (spoiler free).Directed By: Dexter Fletcher Distributor: Lionsgate Cast: Taron Edgerton, Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman*, and Tom Costello.Plot: The story of Michael Eddie Edwards, the notoriously tenacious British underdog ski jumper who charmed the world at the 1988 Winter Olympics.Based on the true of Eddie Edwards this feel good British sports biography is an absolute triumph there I said it, British actor Taron Edgerton has gone from playing Gary 'Egsy' Unwin in 2014's spy actioner Kingsman to playing an underdog Winter Olympian Eddie Edwards who charms his way through the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.This is a film that just grabs your heart and doesn't let go until the very end. Even with Eddie's fictitious coach Bronson Peary (Jackman) which is slightly off putting but it is still a feel good film. On the Hugh Jackman gruff meter with 1 being Les Mis' and 10 being Wolverine I'd say this is a 5 or 6 on the gruff meter.Bronson Peary is an ex-Winter Olympian who has given up his dream and turned to drinking but he agrees to help Eddie even while drunk which was hilarious.Here is a point on why this is a feel good film: Acting: Even though Taron Edgerton was born in 1990 he pulls off the performance as Eddie quite well. Hugh Jackman's performance is ingenious with a cognitive immersion into the character even though Bronson Peary didn't actually exist which is a shame.This British drama into the world of sport is really quite a charming film which makes you feel warm and fuzzy even with the snowy terrain.Verdict: A feel good British biographical drama with hilarious that just makes you feel and fuzzy, a definite must see. The Eagle has Landed. 8/10 must watch.*Best performance by an actor in a leading role Les Miserable (2012).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is important is not the destination, but the journey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some stories awaken what is best in the human being, inspiring us to overcome our limits and teaching us to believe in our dreams and never give up. This is the case of the film Eddie the Eagle, based on the true story of the English Michael Edwards, better known as Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards, who since childhood had a dream to participate in the Olympic Games. Without being from a rich family, gangling, having to deal with knee problems for much of his childhood and having to wear glasses because he was nearsighted, his chances of participating in the Olympics was minimal. After trying unsuccessfully various types of sports throughout his childhood and adolescence, Eddie decides to venture into downhill, selecting the 1988 Winter Olympics as his goal. After a disastrous presentation to some sponsors, he is cut from the British Olympic ski team. Heartbroken and about to give up, Eddie bet in ski jump as his last chance to reach his dream.Cinema is full of motivational movies involving sport. We can cite:Mixed martial arts: Warrior (2011); Athletics: Chariots of Fire (1981), Unbroken (2014) and McFarland, USA (2015); Auto racing: the documentary Senna (2010); Basketball: Hoosiers (1986); Baseball: The Natural (1984), Moneyball (2011) and 42 (2013); Bobsled: Cool Runnings (1993); Boxing: Rocky (1976), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Cinderella Man (2005) and The Fighter (2010); Cycling: Breaking Away (1979); Horse race: Seabiscuit (2003); American football: Rudy (1993), Remember the Titans (2000) and The Blind Side (2009); Artistic gymnastics: Peaceful Warrior (2010); Ice hockey: Miracle (2004); Marathon: Atletu - The Athlete (2009); Motorcycling: The World's Fastest Indian (2005); Swimming: Swimming Upstream (2003); Rugby: Invictus (2009); Diving: Breaking the Surface: The Greg Louganis Story (1997); Taekwondo: Best of the Best (1989).Eddie the Eagle's script is all written around the protagonist, played in his childhood and adolescence by brothers Tom and Jack Costello, respectively, and in his adulthood by the charismatic Taron Egerton (known for Kingsman: The Secret Service - 2014). Egerton acting may seem forced, but when confronted with the real Eddie Edwards we realized that he perfectly embodied all twitches that the character demanded. Eddie is the typical anti-hero: with an appearance that nothing resembles the figure of the classic hero, with his nerd, weirdo and gawky way, having worn glasses for life and a device in the legs as a child, which obligatory relate to the movie Forrest Gump (1994), he is the typical underdog. And this is perhaps the biggest hit of the film: deal with our prejudices and with the standards imposed by society.When taking contact with Eddie, any viewer would believe he could do something relevant? But throughout the film, as we are introduced to a young man who despite the physical problems that could be used as an excuse, is determined and sure of himself, naive and dreamy, our perceptions and interpretations of the protagonist are put to the test. That different and strange guy could indeed make a difference.The cast was well chosen. Eddie's mother, Janette, played by Jo Hartley (known for Dead Man's Shoes - 2004) is responsible for supporting and encouraging her child's dreams, while the father, Terry, interpreted by Keith Allen (known for Trainspotting - 1996) is the counterpoint, reminding Eddie of the difficulties and wanting his son to follow his footsteps by working in construction. Bronson Peary, the problematic sportsman, which is already a cliché in this type of film, is played by Hugh Jackman (always remembered for his portrayal of Logan character in the X-Men franchise). The commentator of the BBC, interpreted by Jim Broadbent (known for Iris - 2001), provides good funny moments.The director who is also an actor, Dexter Fletcher (starred in Kick- Ass - 2010), used humor to soften the story. Despite the great photography, the film uses too much clichés and shows some unnecessary scenes. Fletcher could have further explored the action scenes (the ski jumping) and he didn't put Eddie's postscript (what Eddie did next) at the end of the movie. The script made &#x200b;&#x200b;some adjustments in the real story for the sake of a good narrative, and the modifications are portrayed (with spoilers) here and in this review. The soundtrack fits well in the film, conveying the necessary emotion at different times, whether action, drama or suspense. The music called Jump, by Van Halen, was used as an analogy to the practiced sport: ski jump.Eddie the Eagle is a film about overcoming oneself with a cheerful and fun tone, rescuing social values &#x200b;&#x200b;long lost in society. At a time when having is more important than being, in which win, whether in sports, business or any other situation imposed by life, is more important than compete, we need to relearn that what is important is not the destination, but the journey.Originally posted in: https://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather generic underdog tale that never soars to the sky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A determined and likable underdog, Eddie "the Eagle" Edwards captured the hearts and minds of Olympic fans in the late 1980's with his never say die attitude and ability to play up to the crowd with larrikin antics, so it was always inevitable that someone would take this story and do a Cool Runnings like feel good job of it and this person just so happened to be actor turned director Dexter Fletcher.Fletcher has well and truly stuck to the rule book here with his take on Eddie the Eagle, it feels like a close cousin to Cool Runnings (which gets a sneaky look in on a radio broadcast in the film) and his added a cold hearted turned likable coach to the mix with Hugh Jackman's created for the film Bronson Peary but while Eddie the Eagle trudges along, ticking the necessary boxes this is a film that never really soars or invents its own character to come up trumps.Filmed almost as if it's been cut straight from the 80's with his era infused soundtrack and Adidas filled costumes, Fletcher handles the set pieces and danger of the sport well but Taron Edgerton's incarnation of Eddie never fully feels like a good fit for the breakout star of Kingsman: The Secret Service and his performance is a major contributor to a film that feels like a mimicker rather than a film creating its own vibe. It's amusing that in a film based on such outstanding true life moments and around such colourful characters that Hugh Jackman's imaginary Peary comes across as the most interesting and fully formed even if his arc as a coach is anything but original.There'll be a lot of fans of Eddie the Eagle (it's IMDb rating attests to that) and it's a film likely to be adored around this time of Olympics hype and love but you can't help but escape the feeling that Fletcher's film is a rather too generic look at a real life athlete that was anything but and while it's nice for films to walk in the footprints of those successful stories of old, its often necessary that they look to ad their own flavour to proceedings which Eddie the Eagle fails to do.2 ?

		<shortDescription>As High As An Eagle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle is more than just a British legend, he is an institution. Although most people my age will probably know his due to his work on Channel 4's "The Jump", where old celebrities who are desperate for another round of stardom try to defeat death or at least not break a bone in various winter Olympic games. Eventually though they all at some point have to face "The Jump". Anyway I digress, I finally got round to watching this film on bluray the other day and here is my review. The film is based on the life of Eddie Edwards and is journey to the Calgary Olympics. It is a tale, sadly of one of rejection, obstacles and the determination of one man. The movie is classed as a British Movie, and I say that not to be disrespectful, there have been some brilliant British Films. Such as "The Full Monty" for example but then there have been some terrible ones like "Anuvahood" which was just well awful dosen't go far enough. This film however is one of the best British films I have seen in a long time. The film contains lots of humour and at times it tugs on the heart strings. You really do feel for Eddie and the effort that he has had to go through to succeed in getting his dream to come to fruition. The big name in the film is Hugh Jackman. Hugh who plays an ex jumper, does he part well. Though at times you can't help but think either (a) when are the claws coming out and (b) why do you look like Simon Cowell? The film moves along at a steady pace and dosen't feel like it is dragging, which is always a bonus. The graphics at times do leave you with a little bit to be desired but can be excused when you consider what the budget must have been. There are many faces from the UK screen that you would recognise in this film. As far as the tale goes, it is a true story. Which while we are all enjoying the summer Olympics at present, you can't help but hope that no-one after Eddie has had to go through what he did. To hear a parent say they are proud of you can't help but almost bring a tear to your eye. So if you want to have a brilliant comedy, that tells a true story, I would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ordinary, feel-good biopic and that's just fine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen 'Eddie the Eagle' today and let me tell you a bit about the plot. The biopic movie is based on true facts and struggle of the British ski-jumper Eddie 'Eagle' Edwards. Since his childhood years he wants to be an Olympian and he dreams about it. Not just dreams he also works and put his efforts as much as he can. When he was on his way to the Olympics, he came across with lot's of difficulties. Most of people around him mocks him but that doesn't stop him from dreaming about achieving the dream.At the cast of the movie we recognize Taron Egerton which played Eddie Edwards himself successfully. Hugh Jackman is also at the cast with playing his mental coach Bronson Peary. At the minor roles we see huge stars such as Jim Broadbent and Christopher Walken. Let's get to the reviewing part. Now I believe I can review this movie in two different point of views. First one is a critic's point of view.If I were a movie critic I would probably say that the movie has been suffering from being too simple with the addition of poor acting. Yes maybe it has some potential but sometimes that is just not enough.But I'm not a movie critic. I am just a movie lover and believe me It's good, people. You can't expect this movie to be a dark in technical way. It is nice, you don't get bored while you are watching it and the most important thing, IT ENTERTAINS YOU. Just like the duty of the every movie. Also no matter how much simple the plot is, It has managed to impress me and give me a lesson. I think It can impress you as well. All you have to do is giving a chance. I want to end my review with a quotation from Pierre De Coubertin who has been known as the founder of the Olympic Games. ''The important thing in the Olympic Games is not the winning but the taking part. The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle.'' Well that is exactly what movie says to you in my opinion. So go for it people.</fullReview>

Along the lines of gentle British humour, it is surprisingly funny and moving (rather than laugh out loud). The story picks up the themes of Olympic determination and getting back up again when you have been knocked down. There isn't anything to criticize this film.

The bulk of the movie rests on the shoulders of Taron Egerton, who manages to make the fiercely odd Edwards likable.Doesn't reinvent the wheel, but then the wheel works just fine as it is doesn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the right amount of comedy and heart to keep you from laughing at the movie instead of with it. The Rocky of ski movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You will never be Olympic material." Eddie Edwards (Egerton) is a weak kid who's heart is bigger than his ability. His goal in life is to make the English summer Olympic team. After being denied time after time he decides rather than give up to try for the winter team. Once again he is shut out, but finds his chance in ski- jumping. With no ability, skill, or knowledge he puts everything he has into it. With the help of Bronson Peary (Jackman) Eddie tries to overcome every obstacle put in his way. As I have said many times before I am a huge sucker for sports movies, especially true ones. Even though this story wasn't that long ago I was only 10 at the time and don't remember it at all. This movie really had the chance to go over the top cheesy and sappy and really came close a time or two but remained restrained and just the right amount of comedy and heart to keep you from laughing at the movie instead of with it. Egerton does a great job and Jackman plays his role spot on. This is nothing that will become a classic but is well worth your time and I really did like almost everything about this. Overall, the Rocky of ski movies. I recommend this. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was jumping for joy, after watching this film. It made my day. Very charming film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Eagle has just landed. Was it worth watching? Yes, indeed, even with the over used inspirational underdog clichés, this movie has. This biographical sports dramedy film directed by Dexter Fletcher was a lot of fun to watch. However, I can understand, if some people find this movie to be, too over-romanticizing. The good-natured sweetness of the story could be a little too schmaltzy at times. After all, there were points in the film, even I was, thought, were a bit, much. The whole slow open mouth yelling organism sequence, and knit sweater opening toward the end, was some big examples of that. Despite that, this biopic set in the 1980s, about the unlikeliest of Olympians, British ski jumper, Eddie 'the Eagle' Edward (Taron Egerton), whom overcame a physical disability, social awkwardness, and leagues of doubters, to become one of the most famous winter athletes in the mid-'80s was very memorable. The movie from 20th Century Fox remind me, so much of a mixer of 1993's 'Rudy' and 1993's 'Cool Runnings' in its PG heroic failure approached. While, the movie is well-acted, and well-filmed. The movie does have some bothersome flaws, besides the predictable outcome. One big example is how 90% of the film is made up, based on Eddie Edwards's account to his 1988's Calgary training. Some of the jarring modifications to the source material, was the level of experience, he had in ski-jump. In the film, he had no experience, jumping, when in truth, he had some skills in ski-jumping, as he used to do small ski jumps for charity. These are usually over cars, buses, or any structure that he is hired for people to see him jump. He wasn't as amateurism as the movie makes it out to be. Another thing, about his training, is the change in location. In the film, Eddie trains in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, but in reality he learned to master his ski jump at Lake Placid in the USA, hint why he had an American coach. Another big change is the adding of fictional characters to the real-life event. The washed up alcoholic former ski jumper Bronson Peary played by Hugh Jackman who becomes Eddie's coach in the movie, is an almost entirely fictional. While, Jackman's character was inspired by a few of the coaches like John Viscome and Chuck Berghorn who taught Eddie; there was no direct correlation to any single coach. Anyways, for the most part, in real life, Eddie rarely had any coaches, as he mostly had to train himself in the sport. However, Jackman's performance was charming enough to look pass that, even if his role wasn't much of a stretch from his typecast 'bad boy' Wolverine persona. His on-screen chemistry with Taron Egerton was great. I just wish, he dress up and look more like he came from that 1980s era. The whole time, I saw him, on screen, he look like he was a 2010's time travelling badass. Nevertheless, he was really needed for the film, unlike Bronson Peary's mentor/trainer, Warren Sharp (Christopher Walken) Like Bronson Peary, Warren Sharp is a fictional character. In the Eddie the Eagle movie, Sharp is the U.S. Ski Team coach who had kicked Peary off the team for breaking the rules and being a daredevil. While, his character needed to be mention; there was no reason for any actor to play him. In my opinion, Christopher Walken was really wasted as a talent, playing this bland character. Despite that, the other supporting actors like the ones that played Eddie's parents, Terry (Keith Allen) &amp; Janette (Jo Hartley) were a hoot. Even main actor, Taron Egerton is wonderful in the role. Not only, does he transformed himself for the role with the characteristic thick glasses, a weight gain, the Cheltenham accent and, towards the end, Eddie's iconic mustache, but he also downplay his considerable polish appearance to look more slightly goofy-looking to the point, that it's mostly historically accurate. However, the character wasn't that well-rounded. I really didn't get, much about his character, besides wanting to go to the Olympics. Another thing, about Eddie Edwards's life was how harsh, it really was, for him. It was a lot more difficult than it seem on the life. After all, this guy was sleeping cow sheds, mental hospital, and scraping food out of trash bins. Nor does the movie explore, much, what happen to him, after his Olympics appearance with him, trying back to get the Olympics, and failing. Then, his collapse in bankruptcy, follow by his attempts for a comeback career, in singing, in law, and finally having success in being a motivational speaker, and plasterer. Despite Eddie's lack of athletic ability, the media and viewers at home were drawn to him, feeling a sense of kinship because, like many of them, Eddie was just an average guy. This is what makes this movie, kinda great. I think, it represented that whole Olympic spirit. Yes, he had his large amount of doubters, however, most of the athletes at the time, were supported of him. It was more of International Olympic Committee (IMC) that was against him; implementing news rules that says to qualify in any sport, athletes had to be in the top 50 or top 30 per cent of competitors at world championships, known as the "Eddie the Eagle" rule. In the end, the IMC kinda shot themselves in the foot, as it eliminate the right for each nations to send at least one athlete and set their own minimum competition standards for future events. In many ways, the strict bureaucracy of today's Olympics, is one of the reason, why more of the recent games have fewer viewers, as it's not allowing certain poorer countries to completion. Overall: While, this feel-good film will not break records, or will, much awards, at least, it kinda soared like an eagle. It indeed, flew high on my radar. So check it out, on your own. You'll like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never give up no matter what</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want simply to thank for this movie. In the age of dumb comedies and all the vampire/mystics/fantasy crap appears a true cinema. I thought after Tarantino's 'Hateful eight' I won't watch anything so delightful and interesting. Not only acting but music, camera work and... so much heart put in those 106 minutes. I know the taste of fear, of being popular, of being a little star and yet... falling down so easily. And i know what fear is and how hard to start life anew. It's life fight and so many inside fights brings many doubts. So when I see such movies I understand that nothing is not possible. You just need to remember a very tiny detail... never give up no matter what. And this is how you take yourself from the floor and push to new starts and dreams. This movie is so right and inspiring without all useless boobs and blonds and poses. It's a huge thank you to Dexter Fletcher for bringing back cinema to the first plan. And for all touching content. And the manner of storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the Olympics were all about...at one time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Eddie the Eagle in the Olympics. It was entertaining to see the background to his story. His heart and soul was to be an Olympian and he became one...no matter what it took. I went "Ugh" when Hugh Jackman came on as Eddie's coach. However he played the part very well. The actor playing Eddie did an excellent job portraying him. He displayed a number of mannerisms that made Eddie and of which won the world's heart. It's been a long time since I felt the character and had tears come to my eyes but this movie helped me to remember when the Olympics had genuine athletes...not those who seek fame and fortune but those who wish to participate and compete as an Olympian. I will watch this movie again. It will be a reminder of when non-professional athletes were all that were allowed in the Olympics. It's sad that the Winter and Summer games have become a joke as far as true Olympians go but if you watch this movie you'll experience the "feel good" that we all use to look forward to when watching the Olympics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly adequate - Rocky meets Forrest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. This is a perfectly harmless, feel good movie. There is not a whole lot to analyse or criticise. 2. I love the music in this film. Matthew Margeson's perfect pleasant score trundles along, almost as if one might skip to school in time with it. There are moments later on, however, which require a bit more excitement and Margeson doesn't fail to deliver the goods there either.3. Taron Egerton does a great job as Eddie Edwards. He's a buffoon in the vein of Troy Barnes from Community, a cheerful, dorky kid skating through life on his sheer optimism and self-belief. It can be quite distracting at times whilst Egerton tries to emulate Edwards' pronounced underbite, but it does help you not to see him as the cool kid from Kingsman: The Secret Service, and throughout the film I got used to it. 4. A lot of people are taking issue with the fact that Hugh Jackman's character is entirely fictional. I'd like to point out that a film version of the true story would barely have enough content to fill a forty-five minute film. A film is meant to entertain, and the addition of Jackman's character Bronson Peary is a big shot in the arm for entertainment. Jackman is surprisingly convincing as the alcoholic former athlete, and his friendship with Edwards never feels pedestrian or forced. Director Dexter Fletcher lets us get there on our own. The way the script is written, the story never has to stop and wait for Peary, and so the film isn't unnecessarily stretched because of it.5. The cinematography of those ski jumping shots is fantastic, especially one in which Peary flawlessly lands a jump to prove a point. The whole thing, the flick of the cigarette to the rock star landing, is just delightful to watch.6. Two scenes really stand out as effective in the film. The first tells us more than any amount of exposition ever could: Peary tells Edwards to watch the world number two land for tips and leave him alone. The ski jumper soars through the air?and promptly stacks it, before being carried off in a stretcher. Peary then idles back over and dryly comments "and he knew what he was doing". That's it. We now understand more about the danger Edwards is in than we could ever have needed to know.7. The second of those scenes is the scene in which everyone falls in love with him. Egerton's honest excitement and pride in his own miniscule achievement is so genuine that we as audience members want to be pleased for him as well. After seeing a whole film of people knocking Eddie down, it makes us smile whenever people want to hear about him or talk to him.8. Issues with the film are there, but this was never going to be a five star movie so it doesn't matter a whole lot. The head of the British Olympic selection committee is so completely evil and heartless he becomes a caricature of a human being. Eddie's father is less of a caricature but still seems unnecessarily obstructive and single-minded about his son's goals and future. The film's freeze frames are so cheesy that they made me want to cringe.9. Towards the end the screenplay gets a little too obvious and it takes you out of the film. There's only so far your disbelief can handle people dropping comments like "Oh Eddie won't compete in the 90m" or "yep, we've definitely seen the last of Eddie." I'm positive that didn't happen in real life and even in the movie, where the outcome is obvious, it isn't necessary to set up Eddie's decision to do it.10. I would describe Eddie the Eagle as Rocky meets Forrest Gump. It may not match the former in quality, but it avoids the sticky gooey emotional manipulation of the latter whilst retaining its sweet central character. It is harmless, charming and the ideal movie to pop on for a three-generation family movie night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a great feel good movie that puts a smile on anyone's face. Eddie the eagle was great, Taron Egerton's performance as Eddie is just so likable and he nails the whole face scrunching thing.It is an astonishing accomplishment of a dream that started big and ended big. Eddie's never give up spirit is one that has traveled with him his entire life, the dedication and passion Eddie holds towards accomplishing this dream goal is an amazing dream to follow.Just as the real life of Eddie ends with him taking part in the Winter Olympics and accomplishing the jump was heartfelt. It is a very common/every guy sort of thing and makes us the common audience grow passionate of our dreams. If this guy could join the Olympics then we could accomplish our dreams too!The chemistry between Eddie and Bronson Peary was great. The whole thing with a sort of legacy passed on from teacher to student but also, Eddie helping Bronson to push through his troubles effectively shows this aura that Eddie gives off to those around him.I came out of the theater with a grin on my face because 'he did it' it's just so satisfying to see Eddie accomplish his dreams and is a great pay-off after going through Eddie from his childhood onwards and all the way through. The story in some ways is just so relatable to anyone, anyone who has ever dreamed of accomplishing anything. Eddie the Eagle has not gotten the attention that it deserves and it very much deserves it. It is a break from the big Hollywood productions and the superhero genre, just a very small, true and down to earth movie. The film Eddie the Eagle just as the character of Eddie just has such an earnest aura, how could anyone deny him of his dreams? Well done to Eddie for winning the audience's hearts once again since the 1988 winter Olympics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming story for every underdog-sports-biography lover.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by true events, 'Eddie the Eagle' follows the astounding story of the underdog and athletic-awkward Michael "Eddie" Edwards (Taron Egerton). From childhood it has been his biggest ambition to take part in the Olympic Games. With an iron will and the help of ex-pro ski-jumper Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) Eddie strives but also struggles towards his dream.&nbsp;'Eddie the Eagle' is a feel-good drama/comedy in every sense of the word. &nbsp;It's an underdog- sport-biography ? la 'Billy Elliot' or Disney's 'Cool Runnings', but the movie obviously knows that, too. You can actually find one or another easter egg hinting at these two. Well, if you pay attention. With a bit of both, Eddie the Eagle finds the happy medium and delivers a story that is both inspiring and touching. The latter is largely ascribed to Egertons portrayal of the odd, naive-optimistic Brit, that's not just in terms of character but also physical intriguing and powerful. The way he mimics Edwards peculiar jaw or his habits like the occasional adjusting or cleaning of his glasses adds a unique charm to his performance but stays authentic throughout the movie. Jackman also delivers a solid performance, that brings a certain seriousness to the movie which stands in contrast to Edward's humorous cockiness. Whether the adding of the stereotypical ex-pro athlete/alcoholic was necessary is debatable but simply because of the obvious chemistry that's seen on screen Jackman's performance is overall worth seeing. I personally thought the enactment of the ski-jumping was well done and made me see the sport from a new perspective. I will probably keep vanishing into my room when my father decides to spend the whole Sunday on the couch watching ski (which is simply due to the fact that it is sports) but I definitely have respect for everyone who is crazy enough to perform this sport.The theme of the movie is clearly "everything is possible" which is recognizable throughout the entire movie. Partly pretty clichéd but overall neatly packed that you might just overlook one ore two things and simply enjoy. You'll laugh and dash away&nbsp;one or another tear but always with a smile on your face that won't leave you even after the movie is done. Oh, and&nbsp;also: Great Soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The feel-good movie of this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Eddie The Eagle win many prizes? Probably only audience related prizes. ETE doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does everything right that you can do right with this source material.As a European I am VERY familiar with this sport (AND Michael Edwards) and here is my comparison, Eddie The Eagle vs reality: It is true, you start jumping at around 6 and you everything you work for is the take-off and landing. That's the bread and butter of this sport, regardless of the size of the jump. Eddie's approach stirred up media attention as it really really takes a fine set of balls doing this with the experience he had at this point. Ski jumpers really do exactly look like depicted in this film - Tall, slender, boy-like athletes who can silently tame their fear.And now a little bit to the other side. You can't just walk into a ski jumping arena, go to the top and jump, no no no, you have to sign a load of waivers, apply for a license, have your team and material set up and follow training schedules. The Eddie-way in this film is optimistic but as far from reality as you could be. I will dive a little further into this later. His coach is merely a projection of this instances that Eddie had to learn from - there was no actual coach but many many tips from here and there that he built his knowledge on. I guess the producers thought it would be easier to follow to have one entity - they were right. Now the Warren Sharp thing is also extremely far fetched as US-Americans haven't really done anything significant in this sport. The big ski jumping nations are Japan, Germany, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Norway (and maybe Poland, Russia and Czech Republic) and only the idea of having a pioneering American icon is absolutely ridiculous.Back to real. The portrayal of Eddie is superb - he really did look and act like this. Egerton gives the character the life it needs to endure this completely crazy trip and to be honest, you have to be a little crazy to face the challenges in ski jumping considering the experience and resources that Eddie had. He really did jump withe material and brands shown in the movie and he actually did stir up a lot of controversy within the British Olympic team.On to the other side again. A jump (including in run) barely lasts ten seconds, meaning that the emotions and stretched-out comments while shown in slo-mo are just not possible. One blink of an eye and it's over, in both ways. How did his (ex-)coach get across the world from a little remote mountain town AND into the Olympic arena (as an outcast) in less than 24hours? Ski jumping is shown a little bit like a gladiator sport that "separates the men from the boys" which is probably farthest away from reality as it can be. The (European) media focuses on the technical aspect rather than the emotional. Don't forget, there is also "ski flying" - regular part of the ski jumping world cup - where jumpers frequently surpass 225m (app 740ft). The style is also a little mixed up. While back then ski jumpers were still jumping with parallel style Eddie applies the now common V-style which was considered "dirty" at that time.The one thing that really disturbed me was the portrayal of the Olympic games itself. As if everything around this private money machine was for the athletes, the people and the good of mankind. In fact no one from that side wanted Eddie to be there. Not the International Olympic Committee, not the British Olympic Committee, none of the associations, (at first) not the British media, not the other athletes and certainly not the organizers. Right after those games the rules for qualification were changed to prevent people like Eddie to ever compete in the Olympics again. I suppose the makers of this movie had to do this in order to get the rights to show the rings at all. Anyway, to me this is a huge hypocrisy.This film is suitable even for kids of the age of five as it is completely "harmless". The only real challenge to Eddie is Eddie himself, all other obstacles and antagonists are too soft to be a real threat to him - which is good. Some Americans may argue, that his coach's description of the take-off may be unsuitable for kids but hey, it's done in a charming way. "Eddie The Eagle" is about an underdog who does not accept boundaries and overcomes his fears in a very human way. The perfect lesson for a kid and the perfect reminder for an adult what someone is capable of when there is a will.The sceneries are superb, the cinematography is a nice blend of British filmmaking and Hollywood-like hero celebration but it treads on the "safe path" as there is nothing here that we haven't seen already. The music is a fitting hybrid of orchestral score and 80's style synth-tracks that works perfectly. Jackman gives his character the grumpy style that a fallen hero needs and Christopher Walken is the icing on the cake. For a family evening, this movie is a total no-brainer. As a movie itself it's a "safe run" for what it wants to tell. Definitely a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, bad CGI and missed facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so the movie itself is refreshing. It is funny and is very loosely based on story of an unlikely hero. Even though I haven't yet been born at the time of the Calgary Olympics, I know the story. The story of a guy, who was so bad at what he was doing, it made him famous. People were so afraid his jumps may end badly, they would not let him jump in Planica, on a (then) K200 (hill size in meters). I come from a land of ski jumping. It is the sport I grew up watching, I still do. For that reason it was hard to see, how many mistakes they have made regarding the competition. First: the competition held in Calgary had a K90 and K120 hills, appose to K70 and K90 shown in the movie. Second: Matti Nykanen could not have jumped 114,2 meters on a 70m hill, it is impossible, he would have landed on the straight and probably kill himself. In fact, he won gold on both events, jumping 89,5m twice on a K90 hill and 118,5m and 107m on a K120 hill.Third: THE SKIS! During presentation of the team back in the UK guys are using carving skis, invented in 2000s. They could have tried harder and at least use downhill skis, which are longer and straighter. And as for flying skis...we see it all. In one jump! When Eddie sits on a ramp we can see old Atomic skis used in the 80s. When he pushes off, he is still on Atomic's, but newer model, with flat tips. When is in in the air he is on Fisher, the next second on Elan and just before he lands, he is on Fluege.DE.The style. In the 80s ski jumpers held their skis parallel in the air, close to each other. In the movie "V style" is used, where fronts are parted and ends are close together, this style is in use today. Again, the movie itself, casting and story are great, but they should try harder. For a viewer in Finland, Norway, Germany, Austria, Slovenia and Poland the movie has too many mistakes regarding the sport.</fullReview>

I vaguely remember Eddie the Eagle, and he was well known (in Britain in any case) and quite endearing.I also thought the 1970s' atmosphere was captured really well, including the interiors of Eddie's home, and I liked the inclusion of footage from the actual Olympics.Would like to see more such quirky, enjoyable films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good heartwarming underdog film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of sports movies so I thought I would watch Eddie the eagle and I ended up being pleasantly surprised by how good this film was. The premise of the film sees a young man Eddie want to become an Olympic athlete. After trying a few things he becomes hooked on ski jumping and along with his mentor looks to get to the winter Olympic games. Taron egerton has has a great year with this film, kingsman and legend under his belt. He does a really good job in this film as Eddie, even though he looks nothing like the guy he nails the underdog spirit and heart that Eddie has and he just has this likability to him that makes you want to root for him. Hugh Jackman plays eddies coach and he is excellent in this film, you buy the friendship between the two of them and Jackman does a good job of adding depth to his character. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters in this film are paper thin. Whether its the annoying parents or the evil head of the British Olympic committee it just felt too cartooney and ridiculous. The story of this film is pretty by the number cliché, if you have seen any sport movie you can probably predict what is going to happen. However, it does a really good job of building this underdog up and making you really care about this guy that just wants to represent his country and do his best. The script has some really funny moments in it that did work for me but for the most part all the dramatic moments feel cliché and like you have seen it before. The style of the film is great the camera-work really makes you feel like you are up there with Eddie as he is about to jump and its pretty exhilarating. Overall this is a really good film with a great message that should be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really enjoyed this movie more than I expected i.e. I am old enough to remember "Eddie the Eagle" doing the jumps at the time and thinking he was utterly crazy, not to mention brave. So I know from personal experience that at least some of this movie is real.The fact that according to Wikipedia "the ski jumping establishment who found his popularity embarrassing subsequently strengthened the entry requirements to make it impossible for anyone to repeat his feat" is something which must make the Olympic founder Pierre de Coubertin revolve in his grave.Anyway go and see this movie; it's suitable for children from about aged 8 (PG) as well as adults. My 14-year old enjoyed it.Like Eddie this movie is an underdog but much better than some of the blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Edwards, klutzy kid with wonky knees, has wanted to be an Olympian all his life. After failing to be selected for the British downhill skiing squad, he spots a loophole and decides to become a one-man British skijumping squad. Only thing is he's not that good, and the British Olympic Association keeps changing the rules.This film takes Eddie's life story, appropriates the skijumping results, and more or less ignores all the rest. But that's OK, because what results is a very entertaining feelgood movie which manages to retain the central point of Eddie's story, which is that the essence of the Olympian idea is to strive and do your best, irrespective of where you place in the competition (which makes it ironic that the reaction to Eddie's participation was rule changes which mean that no-one like him will ever be able to participate again).Taron Egerton is a sympathetic Eddie in a performance which manages to stay just on the right side of caricature, and Hugh Jackman is pleasing in the wholly fictitious role of Eddie's coach.There's no great depth to this movie, but is very enjoyable, and I defy anyone to watch the final jumping sequences without a huge smile on their face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was such a breath of fresh Canadian air from all the CGI and marvel stuff.A brilliant little British..or should I say English ..movie that holds from start to finish. O.K...some bits were added for effect and the story was modified but on the whole this was an honest portrayal of a man with a plan. Giving us some big name actors like Hugh Jackman and the marvellous Christopher Walken mixed with some top British stars..Keith Allen,Tim McCinery and Jim Broadbent all mixed together in a little gem.The funny was just funny enough and the emotion was never too wet and some of the filming was as good as any blockbuster..The thing I like about British movies are the bit players..who in this add so much.Leave the biggies alone this week and get yourself down to watch this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taron Egerton has won me over with this movie.. I thought he was OK in the Kingsman, didn't like that movie much at all but he was OK in it.. He surprised me in this one.. he plays the part perfectly.. this is a movie I will most likely own on DVD and not just for his acting the cinematography, story, and Hugh Jackman was also great. there isn't much more to say really, I didn't really find anything i didn't like about this movie which is a very rare thing for me.. Its in my top 20 of all time i think. spoiler.... maybe....There is even a mention of the Jamaican bobsled team which made me think of cool runnings which i loved as a kid but wouldn't really watch it now because of how played up to kids it is.. this movie though is one that can be enjoyed by any age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about a feel good movie. Right from the start, Eddie's perseverance and drive is visible. He is a lovable character who steals your heart and makes you cheer for him.This is a great family movie that teaches us all about life lessons. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a hero, as Eddie certainly was/is a hero to many. I remember watching him in the Olympics and my pride for him is the same today as it was back then.Do yourself a favor and take your family to see this movie. I was smiling from ear to ear.........but take some tissues for the happy tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Eddie the Eagle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anybody out there recall the 1988 Winter Olympics? I do. I was 13 going on 14. What I vaguely remember about those games was the fact that the United States had a lousy showing. The land I was born in finished below 9 other countries. In 88', there was also British ski jumper Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards. He never won a medal, looked sort of funny, and became an affable media sensation. I remember watching highlights of his jumps but was never tuned in to his ultimate journey, his plight. With 2016's Eddie the Eagle (my latest review), I now have that affinity. It's only the month of March but "Eagle" stands as one of the best films I've seen this year. It's about good-hearted people having good things happen to them. Ah, you know there's nothing like warm, movie fuzzies when the temperature is 25 degrees outside. Natch.So OK, have you ever had a dream? Have you ever felt the need to pursue a dream? And were you in the mindset of not giving up no matter what odds stood in the way of fulfilling that dream? If these thoughts and notions pertained to you, then Rudy was the film to see back in the early 90's. That was then and now Eddie the Eagle keeps the train rolling. "Eagle" is similar to that legendary, Notre Dame true story. The events feel almost identical in terms of underdog main characters, the ridicule they got from their peers and family members, their journey to notoriety, and the fact that they didn't quite have gifted, athletic ability. Rudy remains in my top five list of best sports movies. Eddie the Eagle isn't quite as invigorating but it's more intricate in plot specifics. With a few feel-good moments and two likable leads (Hugh Jackman and Taron Egerton), it's recommendable enough for at least a spot in my top twenty.Based on true events, featuring a soundtrack full of 80's synthesizer music (sounding like residue from ABC's Wide World of Sports), and giving us a neat cameo in the form of one Christopher Walken, "Eagle's" trailer had me initially feeling a Disney sports vibe. For some reason however, it rises above that distributor's brand of schmaltz and manipulative banter. The story chronicles the real-life (Michael) Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton from Kingsman: The Secret Service). You see from the time Eddie was a youngster, he always wanted to be an Olympian. It didn't matter what event. He put Olympic posters on his wall, practiced throwing the javelin in his backyard, and tried to do the high jump only to break many pairs of his glasses. At one point, his dad finally tells him, "Eddie, you're not an athlete!" As time goes on, Ed ditches the idea of being in the Summer Olympics and instead decides he wants to ski in the Winter Olympics. After being rejected by British Olympic officials for being unrefined, he ends up finding a way to be the only ski jumper on the British Olympic team. He learns how to fly high within a year (most people start practicing when they are 6 according to everyone in the flick). And with the help of a peevish, has-been Olympiad from the 70's (Bronson Peary played by Hugh Jackman), Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards (a nickname given to him by a newscaster) vows to compete in the 15th Olympics via the city of Calgary, Alberta.Now despite using the overplayed Hall &amp; Oats song, "You Make My Dreams" during its training montages, "Eagle" is still a movie that anyone of any age could like. Director Dexter Fletcher surprised me by how well he filmed the ski jump sequences. Whether it was through the eyes of Edwards himself (going down an in-run) or having the camera stuck right up in his face (in the middle of said in-run), the technique is quite impressive. In terms of the acting, well up-and-comer Egerton and top billed Jackman have great chemistry together. They give dynamic performances as bumbled ski monger and alcoholic-soaked, jumping guru. I had my reservations at first but it turned out to be perfect casting. Bottom line: Eddie the Eagle might be a little too playful to qualify as say, an Oscar contender. However, for 106 fervent minutes, it mostly "soars" (ha-ha). Rating: 3 stars.Of note: I got a kick out of the Jackman trouper. He smokes heavily, drinks from a flask because it keeps him warm (the dude doesn't wear a coat even though it's the middle of winter), works as maintenance guy and I guess, plows snow, and with ciggie in mouth, can still jump 90 metres in the dead of night. God bless ya mate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Eddie Edwards become the "Eddie the Eagle"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is hard to strictly categorize, it incorporates elements a sports movie, a bit of drama, with a pinch of adventure.It is a true-ish story inspired by the life of the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping Michael "Eddie" Edwards and his emotional journey to the 1988 Vancouver Olympics.The movie's protagonist is portrayed by Taron Egerton, the aspiring British who's already proved himself repeatedly in Kingsman: The Secret Service and in Legend, his depiction of Eddie was respectable and his assimilation of the original character's traits is quite striking. Nevertheless, He was kind of overshadowed by Hugh Jackman, the multi-talented Australian didn't avail himself to the maximum of his abilities yet delivered a captivating performance. Although the character of Coach Bronson Peary lacked a bit of depth, writing-wise, I couldn't help but admire the relationship between the two main characters and how it shaped their careers.Ski cannot be thought of without the mental image of snowy mountains and the winter scenery. And "Eddie the Eagle" didn't fail to captivate the sensation with good cinematography work. There are a few well-edited scenes that really stand out such as Eddie's repetitive failed attempts at ever higher jumps.When the movie is over and gone, you're mostly left with that warm sensation that these sport/drama movies usually convey. Nothing mind- blowing or memorable, but still promises a good family time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Close to Cool Runnings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say I was an Eddie the Eagle fan during the Olympics. I don't remember the Jamaican Bob Sled team getting much attention in the Press and was only made aware of them in the movie Cool Runnings.I think the movie could have used two lesser known actors than Jackman and Walken in their roles. But the parallels to Cool Runnings were strikingly similar. Underdog, coached by a disgraced former Olympian, (Candy and Jackman) whose coaches never forgave them for their transgressions and just happen to be present at the current Olympic locale. Their Country's Olympic Committees sternly against them etc. I guess the Director figured 23 years between the movies was long enough to take liberties.Jackman's use of the orgasm was covered in the movie Harry met Sally and was unnecessary. I also felt he was trying too hard in scenes because of who he is. Too much Wolverine which by the way I enjoyed him in.However that aside all the other actors were good in this movie and it is a feel good movie as well as a tear jerker. Guilty as charged. If you like these types of movies, as I do, you will like this as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sappy and unrealistic, 95% not the life of Eddie the Eagle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to enjoy this but after reading a bit about the life of the real Eddie (Michael) it was hard to watch knowing how unrealistic it was.In the film Eddie just decides in a second to become a ski jumper when in reality he made the decision for reasons of cost and easier qualification as there were no other British ski jumpers with whom to compete for a place. The film's makers seem to want to make Eddie look like someone who is almost retarded in this movie, I'm guessing to gain sympathy? He was a good downhill skier and he narrowly missed the Great Britain team for that event for the 1984 Games, he was not patted on the head and sent packing because he was a goof ball.The film shows Eddie just going to Germany and training himself and by a drunk has-been when in reality he went to Lake Placid NY and was trained by professionals. He was not forced to re-qualify by the British Olympic Committee nor did he go on the European circuit.Hugh Jackman's character is not a real person.Christopher Walken's Coach character is not a real person.Eddie was not hazed by his co-Olympians and did not miss the opening ceremony (sad that they would take this away from him for a film)While the real Eddie is a fan of the film, he said that "only about 5%" of Eddie the Eagle is a true story.I feel sorry for anyone who goes to movies like this and walks out thinking this was the real life story, but sadly it happens all the time. Filmmakers can't seem to make a bio movie based on reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie would have to improve just to suck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sappy, predictable, inaccurate, pandering, and a pretty dismal job of acting to boot. You know you are in trouble when the sound track is designed to prompt your appropriate reaction to what is going on at the moment. That combined with sophomoric contrived conflict (perseverance triumphs over money and bullying ....yah, right) makes it clear that this movie was written and directed to target 10 year old's. That, or maybe the director believes that the average movie goer has the intellect of a 10 year old. On the other hand, based on the raft of crap movies produced in the past 10 years, maybe I'm the fool and this director and his ilk are the genius'. In any event my advice would be to pass on this one and save a couple hours of your life for something much more meaningful and satisfying. Picking lint out of your belly button would qualify.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loosely based on the biography of Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards, Britain "most famous" ski jumper.Boring even when you watch it in fast-forward skips. Too slow, too formulaic.The concept is similar to that of COOL RUNNINGS (1993) - a story of a person who isn't very successful in his field of sport, but makes an impact by representing his country "against the odds".The only good thing about this movie is the cinematography during some of the jumps. There are some really cool shots, following the jumps while in flight.With Hugh Jackman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland and Mind-numbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is alright for those who like ski jumps and who like to not think while they're watching.Eddie is a boy who dreams of becoming a Olympian or Olympic winner... Right off the bat, the movie starts with Eddie disabled with a bad leg but, the movie doesn't explain why his leg was bad or why he had to go to the doctor for his leg. But, after that scene, somehow because his leg was disabled the actor had to look like he was slow and senseless. His slow-witted head and him failing to land several times on the 40m jump made him not look like a big dreamer but a stupid kid.I like how when Eddie accidentally went down the 70m jump, everyone assumed he did the 70m out of pure confidence. I also like how Eddie doesn't correct the fact and that there is no backlash to not telling anyone that his 70m jump was a clumsy fluke. Most training scenes are stupid because even though training scenes can be uplifting, most training scenes don't tell you specifically why the certain exercises help in any way. The audience is supposed to assume the character is getting stronger. Also, the audience is mind- numbly watching five minutes of a forced relationship between the coach and Eddie. Why did the coach agree to three weeks? No one gave an answer from the movie. The shot where Hugh Jackman and Taron Egerton hopping to the left was laughable because the scene looked like it was copying Tom Hanks hopping on the floor piano in the movie, Big.While Eddie was jumping through competition after competition, the movie has written code that says in parentheses, "(not good enough)." There was no need for the written code. In fact, the written code was annoying because the movie thought that its audience was too stupid to know that 41m or 43m was not a good enough jump. The failed jump on the last competition was unexpected even though a character unexpectedly failing is not surprising to the classic hero story formula. (Search Wikipedia for the Seven Basic Plots.) Later, the movie had no reason but, the movie said that Eddie's 61m jump was accepted.After the goofy PR scenes, there is a empty scene of Eddie sitting on the bleachers staring at the ski jump slope blankly. We're wondering; why is he looking at it for such a long time? Why couldn't Hugh come in at the start of the scene to say Eddie is feeling doubt? When has Eddie ever felt doubt before this scene? Why does this scene need to be written? That's the thing, why does many scenes need to be written? Like how, Eddie needed to tell the movie twice in two separate long scenes to Hugh and separately to his parents on the phone that he couldn't record a jump of 61m.You can tell this movie used most of its production budget on Hugh Jackman and not very good establishing shots. The ski jump slope didn't look big at all for an establishing shot. The shots were bland as most things in this movie. The upbeat feeling in this movie does not work because of how slow this movie is. The run time for this movie is almost two hours! When I saw the title, Eddie the Eagle, I expected Eddie to get the Eagle nickname for his phenomenal sports achievement. But, the nickname was given as a joke which was supposed to be an unexpected twist by the director but the twist came out sad and pitiful.The slow ski jump of Hugh Jackman was cool but felt like a shot made to suck up to a celebrity, to make him look cool. The slow motion shots and music felt like something from Kick-Ass or Scott Pilgrim v. the World. The lighting always on right on the camera looks like Steven Spielberg's lighting but, it's done to the point where there is no emotional impact and makes my eyes hurt. The director looked like he couldn't figure out many ways to make ski jumping look cool so he had to balance out how he'll make the jumps look cool throughout the movie.Overall, this movie is coming out of the success from movies like Creed, Foxcatcher and the Million Dollar Baby. Eddie the Eagle is a dumb Hollywood-induced movie made for filling time in the theaters. It is clear that people who watched this movie were Xmen or Hugh Jackman fans. Giving no insults to Xmen or Hugh Jackman fans, but don't bother spending money on a movie so boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie the EagleThe upside to the Olympics being in Canada is the low exchange rate helps your IOC bribe go a lot further.Unfortunately, the hopeful in this dramedy will need more than a kickback to compete.Dreaming of gold since he was young, Eddie Edwards (Taron Egerton) has shoehorned himself into every possible activity with disastrous results. It's not until he witnesses ski jumping does the fearless Brit find his calling.With help from a failed ski jumper (Hugh Jackman), Eddie gets the training he needs to qualify for the 1988 games in Calgary, but not the respect of his fellow competitors.Despite its' over indulgence in sentimentality and played out sports clichés, this true underdog tale still manages to rally enough heart and good humor to provide a pleasant reflection on this unorthodox athlete. Mind you, to those in the southern hemisphere, this Winter Olympic anecdote is brand new. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle (2016) is a wonderful film based around a true story, it has a good cast; all and all the film held up well. Eddie (played by Taron Egerton) was well performed , his acting really pulled the story well as you sort of felt for how Eddie's life was going. This film has that BBC styled vibe going on while at the same time keeping the story going forward. I really liked this movie and was glad I had gotten the time to stop and see it.I was quite shocked to see Hugh Jackman with his role in this, he did a great job with it, to me I just didn't see him filling this style of family based film but my hat goes off to him. To sum things simple and sweet, this is a good family friendly film with a beautiful story "based on" true events.</fullReview>

I would have given the movie higher rating, but as a Finn there was two things that really caught my eye.Matti is Finnish, he cannot talk English with Swedish accent. The actor also looked like a swede, not like a Finn.Also the ski jumpers didn't use V-style at that time.Apart from those, this was a pretty cool movie. Back in the days when Eddie was jumping I was thinking what the heck is Eddie Edwards doing in the olympics. I thought that he didn't stand a chance against competitors like Matti.After this movie I kind of understand the reasons why he was there :)Eagle had to fly!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read a few of the reviews here and i don't really see the need for some of the criticisms of this film. Ridiculous comments such as "The music was a bit grating" or "its nothing new".To me growing up in the 80s and not athletic at all (due to asthma), Eddie the eagle was a true hero of the time. He was awkward and full of enthusiasm. He did not fit into the old boy network that was the institution of this country.In short he's a British legend. I thought that Dexter Fletcher has caught this so well. The period is spot on and even the soundtrack is very suitable.This move reminded me of what i loved about the 80's and i heartily recommend it to all you who lived through these events. It reminds you of how proud we were of our plucky underdog champion.</fullReview>

Eddie played br?lliantly by Taron Egerton (kingsman a secret service) and Hugh Jackman (do i really need to say) who played his coach a ex Olympic jumper who disgraced himself and now a heavy drinker. The chemistry between the two is mezmarising and the script could of been the worst written but you would not know because of how well the two main actors work together to pull of one of the best underdog stories you will find.

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully filmed story about the enobling values of perseverance and belief in one's self.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rags to riches is the most overdone theme in cinema yet audiences love it as comfort food for the soul. It works particularly well in 'heart-warming' and 'feel-good' sporting bio-pics based on the 'hare and tortoise' tale where the slow plodder eventually wins. Eddie the Eagle (2016) is the plodding tortoise whose obstacles include childhood disability, being gawky and born into a working family at the lower end of the snotty-nosed British class system. But his soul yearns for Olympia, not a medal or glory, just for the thrill of competing.Inspired by the sight of skiers flying like birds, Eddie (Taron Egerton) decides to become Britain's first-ever entrant in the notoriously dangerous sport of Olympic ski jumping. Undeterred by the fact that top jumpers start at five years old and are built like quilled arrows while Eddie trained for a year and looks like a British meat pie, Eddie puts heart and soul into his dream. He meets heavy-drinking but smart former top jumper Bronson (Hugh Jackman) who teaches Eddie how to fly and more importantly how to land. Of course its not only Eddie's lack of talent that must be overcome as the pompous British Olympic Committee has no interest in helping a goofy working-class boy to join its proper-speaking elite ranks. To the Committee's chagrin, the crowds at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics saw the tortoise jump (not very far) and loved him for trying. He became a media sensation and a National hero. Both the true story and this film come closer to showing the beauty of dreams than podiums full of medal-winning super-athletes can ever do.Egerton's performance is both the charm and weak point of the film. Gawky single-mindedness is endearing but when it's the only persona on view feels like a mask that hides someone unknown. Jackman is always drinking or smoking while brooding over his failed ambitions and similarly deprives the role of nuance. But such quibbles are minor in the big picture. The camera-work and special effects are undoubtedly the highpoint of the film (forgive the pun) and the slow-motion freeze-frames in Eddie's final jump are heart-stoppingly beautiful. Never has winning been less important and never has trying been so heroic. The crowd leaving my cinema all had smiles on their faces and some had tears in their eyes. This is a wonderfully filmed true story about the enobling human values of perseverance and belief in one's self.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always interesting to see just how well a movie based on real events capture your attention. This is especially the case when those real events are ones that you are very familiar with. I can certainly remember a lot about Eddie Edwards ski jumping exploits at the Calgary Olympics.Most people in the UK were unaware that Edwards was a very talented skier. His exploits in the olympics were met with a mix of humour, ridicule and respect. This is certainly captured in the movie which also does a good job with explaining why Edwards hits on the idea of ski jumping.I certainly wasn't aware of the storyline surrounding his coach, so this provided added interest. The movie may have been a little flat without the coach who was Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman). The movie can certainly live alongside Cool Runnings with which it obviously contains similar themes. Well worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle Edmonds was a British skier who failed to qualify in his preferred downhill category so turned to ski jumping to represent his nation at the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988. The film telling the story of this man is about perseverance, dedication, sacrifice and glory in the face of defeat. It's also a 90 metre ski jump away from how it really happened. If you're looking for a biopic you best search up something on youtube but if you just want a nice story with some laughs mixed in with a little tension and drama then you will enjoy Eddie the Eagle.The story is told from Eddie's perspective growing up entirely un- athletic yet with a burning ambition to represent his country at the Olympic level. His determination is admirable while the patience and love from his supportive yet bemused parents is charming in a very understated English manner.The film revolves around the portrayal of Eddie by Taron Egerton, an English actor I have not seen before. It's a truly distracting imitation as he mimics Edmonds habits so he appears more caricature than man. He has some funny moments but the laughter is often at Eddie and not with him.Hugh Jackman plays the reluctant coach Bronson Peary who is a welcome distraction from the main protagonist and his idiosyncrasies. Peary is supposed to be an amalgam of real-life coaches but he also has a story arc which must wait until the end to be fulfilled.At the heart it's a simple story of a man thwarted by officialdom from achieving his dream. The nasty British IOC official played by Tim McInnerny with all the sneering subtlety of a moustache-twirling matinée villain tying a damsel in distress to the rail tracks resulting in another caricature who is highly predictable. The resolution for the drama is left to one of the few real life characters a Finnish jumper who explains to Eddie that although their abilities are poles apart their ambitions are parallel.The finale is heart-warming and inspirational which in some small way makes up for the two previous hours which for me came across as manipulative, forced and fabricated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all have a dream to become someone we want to be, and for "Eddie" Edwards his dream was to participate somehow in the Olympic Games. His final decision is to be in the Winter Olympics as a ski jumper! His family are not supportive of Eddie in his decision and dream and believe it is a total waste of time. However, that doesn't stop Eddie from doing everything he can do to chase his dream.The directing was brilliant. The scenery was fantastic. Showing us the danger, and yet the beauty of the high, dangerous, ice, ski jumps! The Musical Score that has gone into this movie really works. Most importantly the acting from Edgerton and Jackman work wonders! I'm sure those who have seen the trailer will know that Eddie is not going to ever win, but the films message was not about that. It was about struggle and passion in order to make to the Olympics and that's what "Eddie The Eagle" does. The whole time we are rooting for him and we can't stop hoping that he will make it! All in all it is a film that is definitely worth watching. The movie is only rated P.G., and while it is not a kids film, it certainly isn't too over the top or violent in any way. The whole world needs to see "Eddie Edwards." Great film.P.S. For fan lovers of Christopher Walken, he plays Jackman's coach by the name of Warren Sharp and he is only in it for a minute. So don't expect him to be in it for long. 4/5 8/10. -Autistic Jay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uplifting and delightful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has watched the spoiler-heavy trailer will know how this story goes. Although truthfully, anyone who already knows the real-life tale of Britain's first ski jumper at the Winter Olympics ? or has seen any underdog sporting-flick ever ? will know how this story goes. What this unstylish but uplifting film lacks in originality and surprises, however, it makes up for with an abundance of charm, irony-free sweetness and low-key humour. Think Cool Runnings, but British, and a lot daggier. Lock, Stock and Band of Brothers actor Dexter Fletcher works behind the camera here, and even though it appears he ostensibly has very little to do in the directing role, he succeeds on two major fronts. First, rather than trying to subvert or circumvent sporting movie clichés, Fletcher leans into them wholeheartedly with an endearing cheekiness. Second, he goes to great lengths to present ski jumping as exhilarating and beautiful, and he nails it. The film's other triumph is Taron Egerton as Michael 'Eddie' Edwards, the bumbling, fumbling protagonist whose indefatigable spirit and undiluted passion for the Olympics provides the basis for a remarkable yarn. Not as successful is Hugh Jackman's fictitious Bronson Peary, an ex-ski-jumping superstar who reluctantly takes Eddie under his wing. Boozy, gruff and regret-filled, Peary is virtually identical to John Candy's Jamaican bobsled-team coach, just, you know, more attractive. Undoubtedly lightweight and highly predictable, Eddie the Eagle nevertheless scores big with its fascinating titular hero, an abashedly delightful outlook on life and a winning sense of humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victory for the underdogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early on, I caught wind of this movie from social media posts from Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman. Being big fans of the both of them, I was instantly turned on to the idea of this film, but one certain quote caught my attention which made this movie a must watch for me, "'Eddie the Eagle' isn't just for sports fans, it's for anybody who's ever been told 'No!'" It is the perfect underdog movie and it was done fantastically. The film made waves at film festivals all over the nation. Critics raved about the film once it was finished and now I fully understand why. Taron Egerton is a superstar in the making. His few roles he has starred in he has performed immaculately. Hugh Jackman is a constant success, grabbing each of his roles by the throat and executing them flawlessly. The story as a whole is a wonderfully put together and memorable piece of work from start to finish (with obvious holes since you can not cover a whole life in an hour and thirty minutes). Overall, this was just a fantastic film. It leaves you feeling good and has you cheering for Eddie the underdog the entire playtime. I majorly recommend this film for anyone interested if you like a goodhearted underdog story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle is a biographical sports film based on the true story of British ski jumper Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards. As far as underdog stories go, this is one of the best. It is a sweet natured and fun film very reminiscent of the similarly themed Cool Runnings.Michael "Eddie" Edwards (Taron Egerton) is a young British man who dreams of competing at the Olympics. Since he was a child, Eddie has practiced and practiced his athletic abilities but has been constantly rejected by sporting officials. Despite this, Eddie never gives up on his dream. One day, Eddie decides to train as a ski jumper and represent Britain at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. Aiding him with his training is Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), a drunken American snow plower who despite his own internal insecurities, believes Eddie has the potential to achieve greatness at the Olympics.While it follows the typical clichéd underdog story that most sporting films tend to do, Eddie the Eagle has a certain charm to it that makes it very difficult to dislike. You just can't help but feel supportive of Eddie throughout all his training to do his best. Taron Egerton's performance in the title role was fantastic and this film really showcases the talent this young actor possesses. Hugh Jackman was great as well, he was very comedic but never so much that he seemed to undermine his character's mentoring responsibilities. As I mentioned previously, this film reminded me of Cool Runnings with its likable lead characters and the same setting (1988 Winter Olympics) so if you enjoyed that film, then I recommend seeing this one as well.I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>17 April 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - Eddie The Eagle. This is a story that is long overdue in coming to the screen. It is the tale of one small boy's dream to be an Olympian.....any kind of Olympian, and a man's tale of how he got there. I remember the ridicule he faced in the 80s as he strived towards his dream, but he went down in history as he competed in the Calgary Winter Olympics and carved himself a niche in the nation's hearts. Eddie was played by Taron Egerton (Kingsman) and the likeness achieved by the actor was uncanny. Even though I knew the outcome I spent the whole film urging him to succeed in every discipline he undertook as he pursued his Olympic Dream. There were huge highs and lows in this film, support from obvious sources and opposition from unexpected ones, and lots of humour. Interestingly Hugh Jackman, who played Eddie's reluctant coach, was not the biggest star in this film as Taron shone through as the brightest light in a hugely entertaining and heartwarming film. As a footnote.......why anyone would want to fling themselves off a 40 metre slope, let alone a 90 metre slope is beyond me, Eddie deserved a medal just for putting on his skis. One for the DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More entertaining than Lady in the Van</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We didn't go to see this with great expectations, but it turned out to be a very sweet and engaging film. Much, much better than The Lady in the Van, the other recent 'quirky' British comedy on offer this year. The movie is based around dual stories of Eddie and his coach, and it has a heart and humour. The rest of the characters are more caricatures, and I'd feel sorry for the real Eddie's dad if the way he's portrayed in the movie wasn't based on fact. One thing though, if you go and see the movie, just check the dialogue when Hugh Jackman's coach character is giving a final pep talk just before Eddie attempts the 90 metre jump at the Olympics, does Eddie address the coach as: "Hugh ...." and then something about the Olympic ideal of having a go. I'm sure he said "Hugh" though it's not listed in the goofs so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Comedy/Drama Movie of The Year"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have ever heard the name "Eddie the Eagle" or don't, you have a mandatory appointment in April to see the dramatic feat of the year so far.Personally, I think that the experience is much more enjoyable without knowing the story of real life. Eddie Edwards was the first representative of Britain to participate in the Winter Olympics in 1988. This honest man tried different Olympic sports until he found the fabulous and adventurous ski jump, the surprising thing is that the guy not highlighted by being the best the the matter. The film is responsible for narrating the whole growth of Eddie in terms of sport while providing a dramatic and comic experience from beginning to end. I can only mention, I cried like a small child.Our boy "Kingsman: The Secret Service", Taron Egerton comes back to seven art, he introduce himself to 100% in his role, this time not as a super agent, this time with large glasses, hair blond and even a strange blonde moustache. Egerton fills his role as nuanced perfectly balanced tones allowing to see the pure soul of his interpretation. Hugh Jackman plays coach Eddie - a successful athlete champion ski jump that is forced by his heart to help this young man to succeed- . True, the film by Dexter Fletcher is a feast of clichés, but well- structured clichés, with chemistry, support and strength to take forward a true dramatic inspirational artwork. The project is a faithful proof that with less materials, better results. It was a surprise in the Sundance Film Festival and won gold, now, it was a surprise in the rest of the world and the chances of winning a gold more large increase exponentially.Dexter Fletcher has created his own cover letter. However, he knew who was dealing with a persevering man (who was not going to win gold medals) managed to capture history with a conventional double- edged weapon. A bullet from his gun was the comedy. The director was prone to cross the thin border of the comedy to become a mockery or joke based on story. He reached the exact point in the soup to create a succulent dish, excellent aggregation of sugar. Aim, fire. The second bullet is shot, the drama. The main reason was to tell all the mishaps economic, mental, physical and psychological that possessed the guy, for obvious reasons,, the biopic would have to be oriented to the guy, good aggregation of salt. What remains after together salt and sugar in a precise point? A real treat for the palate, in this case the visual palate.The visual presentation of the work was very professional and aesthetic. The cinematography of George Richmond is beautiful and elegant, making feel vertigo on the track of 15m, 30m, or 90m in the same way by using the camera and perfectly positioned angles. And to continue to grow, as it is typical of Hollywood, introduce a few seconds the short but symbolic appearance of Christopher Walken - the trainer of Hugh Jackman - to make it look even more professional.Eddie does not want women, he just wants to his mother, Eddie doesn't want fame, just wants to participate, Eddie does not want alcohol, he only wants to milk, Eddie does not want sex, he just wants love. These characteristics are completely emotional and with a finish that I didn't expect, my tears simply fell for my eyes, but a factor that helped my sadness and joy at the same time, it was the self-identification with the character of Taron (Eddie), I think I saw my future on him. So, well done Egerton! task was made very well.It isn't a story more of the bunch where anything is possible. Dexter's film is sentimental and more deep than it seems, a guy that don't mind the standards of money, education or culture, a guy who fixed a dream in his head and managed to leave a huge mark on world history. "Eddie the Eagle" will triumph in most festivals, I promise you. Boldly funny, very well presented, with a 100 in all its aspects, the movie has affected me for rest of my life. Everyone to the cinema already!"The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part; the essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well" Pierre de Coubertin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undemanding, but inspiring real life drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The true life story of the titular Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards (Taron Egerton), who was a young man with walking difficulties, who had a singular dream of becoming an Olympic ski-jumping champion, rather than settling for a life in the plastering trade like his father Terry (Keith Allen.) Despite all the odds being stacked against him, Edwards travels to Europe, where he crosses paths with renegade former ski-jumping champ Bronson Perry (Hugh Jackman), with whom he comes to form an unbreakable pact that sees them heading off together to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada.Sometimes, you need something a little different to mellow your mind. You might feel in the mood to watch something a little out of your normal filmic diet to broaden your horizons and sharpen your mind. This was the case with me and Eddie the Eagle (that, and a lack of much else to watch.) In a time of cynicism, when looking at the brighter side of life is generally scoffed at, this is the type of film that stands out like a sore thumb, and even more inspiring since it's based on a true life event.In the leading role, playing the character everything revolves around, Egerton lights up the screen as Edwards, bringing the character to life and injecting a vitality that is in a field of its own. Riding high on the publicity and self promotion this has generated for him, the real life Edwards has been making a number of appearances lately, and it's clear from these that he's captured his every mannerism and facial expression, not to mention his accent, perfectly.Fundamentally, this is all very workmanlike, playing out in a standard heartfelt, feel-good story kind of way, following the formula to a tee, but that doesn't make it any less satisfactory for what it is, uplifting and inspiring and set to a pulsating 80s soundtrack. This British Cool Runnings is a stand-alone piece in this day and age. ****</fullReview>

I don't know, since I saw the poster and read the synopsis, the movie was like calling for me to see it. Really nice film, great acting, it's remarkable how such a big actor like Hugh jackman didn't outshine the main character. REALLY nice music and beautiful visuals. The story is well written and the pacing is good, I never got bored for a second. My only complain is that I felt it was too short, I don't know, everything happened so fast. But, it left me with a good taste, and that doesn't happen to often. I'll definitely see it many times more, it's very rewatchable as well. Great film seriously.</fullReview>

What a fantastic film about a fantastic sportsman. The amount of b/s he had to put up with to realise his dream and get to the Olympics. The way you get to properly appreciate just how dangerous ski jumping really is. This movie plays it up and sucks you into such a sense of joy and positivity, it's almost scary.Hugh Jackman is great as the faded star but Taron Egerton is the star of the piece. He inhabits the Eagle in a way that is as impressive as the 90m jump. We were walking on sunshine on the way home after this one. Marvelous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We went to this expecting not very much. In fact, if we hadn't already booked the tickets beforehand we might have given it a swerve as we'd had a late night the day before. Well, we're glad we made the effort as this is a gem of a film that puts a smile on your face which lasts way beyond the cinema doors. You will probably have to be British to appreciate the full quality of Eddie the Eagle's stubborness and undoubted bravery in his attempts to get to the Winter Olympics. We all saw him as a lovable "geek" and this film lovingly replicates Eddie's bottle-end glasses and gurning facial expressions. OK, the film telescopes events and there are a number of clichés that would have damned other less well-made films. We all knew what the outcome of Eddie's attempts on the Olympic 90 metre ski jump would be but nevertheless we were held, enchanted, right through to the triumphant end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dedicated, driven and determined, are just three words I would use to describe Eddie the Eagle Edwards after seeing the self titled biopic. This feel good film does everything you would expect start to finish, and would certainly leave you feeling good.First of all, it needs to be made clear that this film uses the predictable cliché feel good film formula. Although successful in doing so depending on your own person, it is extremely obvious as to what will happen and how or at what point the film will end. There will be a journey of some sort, a happy and idiotic training montage and a sad sequence where the protagonist loses faith only to be followed by the happily ever after. This I believe will split audiences. Some will love it, some won't, and I fall somewhere in between. The formula works at leaving you with an optimistic attitude and warm feeling inside, but the film does feel lazy in relying 100% on the formula. The film as a whole could be summed up as how Eddie himself didn't want to be remembered as, simply a novelty.The characters (except Eddie and Bronson) overall where caricatures rather than real people, simply being obstacles in Eddies way, this is again part of this feel good formula which ultimately creates characters that feel more like cartoon characters than real people.Despite this the two leads are great. Hugh Jackman puts away his wolverine claws temporarily to give a fine acting performance as Bronson Peary, Eddie's Coach. The film is called Eddie the Eagle and its lead certainly does soar, Taron Egerton was brilliant as Eddie, pushing his chin out and diving into the ski jumpers shoes becoming him on screen. This film along with Kingsman show how this actor will be one to look out for in years to come.Overall this film feels like a vehicle to showcase Taron Egerton to the world. The film is seen it, done it, worn the T-shirt but don't get me wrong, the motivation of the protagonist is superbly emphasised and the film is using a winning formula leaving you with a warm feeling inside and new sense of optimism. This film is a happy reminder that it's not about winning, but about taking part.</fullReview>

I recall meeting Eddie in a car-park at Silverstone before the British GP in July 1988 with my son - he shook our hands and we spent a good 15 minutes discussing his exploits at the Winter Olympics. He came across as a very humble, determined, likable and brave young man... Just like how he was portrayed in this great movie. We still have the photographs we took of Eddie that day. This was a real feel good movie, heartfelt, funny, dramatic. Even knowing beforehand the events that were about to unfold, I still felt the tension of the story unfolding.

		<fullReview>Eddie Edwards always was an awkward-looking kind of guy, and this is an awkward-looking biopic of his against-the-odds progress from a working-class home in Cheltenham to the Olympic ski-jump slopes of Calgary. His story has been heavily fictionalised, reworking elements from CHARIOTS OF FIRE and BILLY ELLIOTT to chart the obstacles strewn in Eddie's path to glory: childhood health problems, an unsupportive father, funding shortages, a mean-spirited Olympic selector (Tim McInnerny in sneering overdrive). The Julie Walters role of the motherly coach dispensing tough love becomes a bumpy fraternal bond here, with Hugh Jackman as an ex-Olympian turned hardcore boozer. Jackman contributes a solid if not entirely convincing presence, and Taron Egerton breathes real life into Eddie's dogged determination.The jumping scenes unavoidably become repetitive and the redemptive 'bromance' is somewhat clunky, but like its predecessors EDDIE THE EAGLE delivers moments of great charm and a rousing feel-good finale. A small movie with a big heart.</fullReview>

I remember Eddie the Eagle from 88 and was therefore vaguely interested in the film, but had no expectations. Apart from us there was only two more people in the cinema, which normally doesn't bode well, but boy: Was I in for a pleasant surprise. The acting is uniformly excellent, especially the two main characters Eddie and his (fictional) trainer, Hugh Jackman. Apart from that, how can you go wrong with a strong cameo from Christopher Walken and a soundtrack with many rock tracks from my youth? The best thing was that my daughter also loved the film and wants to own it. We all love a story about a plucky loser who just won't give up, and the film gets the tone just right and avoids making the story pathetic - even if the ski-jumping skills of the main character are (rightly) portrayed as pretty pathetic.</fullReview>

The movie is inspirational, delightful and the cinematography in this is just crazy good, I mean just wow.The problems I have for this movie has to be with some of the writing, as it felt kind of sloppy at times, but that's really it.Overall Eddie the Eagle isn't perfect, but I already know this movie has uplifted many moviegoers out there....even me.</fullReview>

I recommend going to see this film as an uplifting choice to make you feel happy when you come out of the cinema. It can be a fun family film, there are minor sex references that would probably go over most kids heads. It also proves to be emotional and heartwarming without being cheesy, a mean feat in my books.

This is a quintessentially British take on "Cool Runnings" - sure it's been done before: we've seen these shots a thousand times over the years; we know we're in for a hail-mary moment somewhere toward the end of the third act (this is a heroic sports movie, after all) but Fletcher pulls it off smoothly and with aplomb.

It's a wonderful story met to inspire you and it achieves it's goals, being a true story that proves all is possible.Director Matthew Vaughan succeeds in taking us back to 1988, with a feeling of the era rather than just a look, but it does not help that he used such tools as music and archive footage to complete this.Taron Egerton was real good in this movie. His transformation was impressive. Just a completely different person than the one he played in the Vaughan's last picture the KingsmenHugh Jackman is great in the film.

		<fullReview>-Eddie the Eagle is a 2016 British-American biographical sports dramedy film directed by Dexter Fletcher.

		<shortDescription>Although clichéd, Eddie the Eagle is an uplifting biopic and an equally whimsical sports dramedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to sports biopics, there is no greater joy than watching athletes overcome unsurmountable odds. It's the very reason why everyone loves the underdog ? that an unassuming nobody can become a legend by achieving the impossible. But what if that nobody never becomes a real legend?Take the case of Michael 'Eddie' Edwards, a name that faded away as soon as it had the slightest chance of making headlines. Edwards did something no one else did in sporting history. At the age of 22 and on a whim, he went from amateur ski-jumping to qualifying for the 1988 Winter Olympics in less than two years, and with barely any formal training. At that time he was the only British ski-jumper to reach the Olympics but getting there wasn't easy. From his parents to the British sports committee to competing against athletes having trained since they were toddlers, the odds were vastly against Edwards. In the end, what really mattered was his determination to succeed, but if it weren't for this film no one would know who Edwards was and what he did to become a hometown hero.That's because the Eddie in this film is portrayed as an oddball rather than a real Olympian. Albeit based on actual events, obvious tweaking in the screenplay modulates the narrative from a serious sports drama to a whimsical sports comedy. It works both ways as safe play from the makers and probably why many of the clichés are forgivable. Even so, the real reason to watch this film is Taron Egerton as the titular hero. From the underdog in 2015's sleeper hit Kingsman: The Secret Service to the underdog in this film, Egerton is an instant charm magnet and one of few reasons that make us want to care for a person sidelined in sports history. The other reason is Hugh Jackman as Eddie's mentor and reluctant coach. Although fictional, the turnaround in Jackman's character from a former ski-jumper turned binge-drinking jerk to Eddie's first real admirer and subsequent bonding elevates the film to crowd pleasing levels. And Jackman, reminiscent of a very similar role in Real Steal, pulls it off with sheer screen presence.By the time Edwards earns the titular moniker Eddie the Eagle, there is little left to be cynical about. Even if this story is only half true and riddled with feel-good clichés and hokey moments, it is still pleasantly watchable thanks to typical British humour, upbeat period music, and the lovable goofiness of its main characters. This is precisely what sets apart Eddie the Eagle from hundreds of other underdog films. That, and the fact that this film isn't about winning, rather, how epic failure can still make a legend out of a determined sportsman. It's the same reason that made Cool Runnings such an uplifting film. The similarities are there and if you watch closely, so is the reference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not since RUDY has a sports movie . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . conquered the hearts of America as EDDIE THE EAGLE is doing for everyone who sees it. And, as Chris Rock said during the Oscars last night, actor Tom Egerton as English Olympic Ski Jumper "Eddie," should be a shoo-in for the Best Actor Statuette a year from now since everyone knows that, as Rock put it, "White people can't do sports." (That's why all the Olympic ski jumping MEDALS are won by Blacks, and why Tiger Woods found it so easy to double Jack Nicklaus' record for Career Grand Slam Triumphs.) As Chris Rock points out, in any sport requiring guts and courage, such as ski jumping, marathon bike races through mountains, ice hockey, and NASCAR, when the rubber meets the road, the victory podium is crowded with People of Color. So let's join Chris Rock in applauding Mr. Egerton's stunning achievement--against all odds--in portraying a Real Life White Person who thought that Whites could do sports, too. (One disclaimer: Eddie Edwards' story takes place in Europe, where the media and Chris Rock do NOT try so hard to brainwash White kids from the youngest age that they cannot succeed at sports!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eddie the Eagle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was initially unsure whether to see this true story movie, I only knew a little about the real British sports star, with his appearances on television in recent years, including him winning Splash!, but critics gave the film high praise, so I went for it, directed by Dexter Fletcher (Wild Bill, Sunshine on Leith). Basically ten-year-old Eddie Edwards (Tom Costello Jr.) dreams of being an Olympic champion, he practises various and fails miserably, his mother Janette (This Is England's Jo Hartley) supports him, but his father Terry (Keith Allen) discourages him. As a teenager Eddie (Jack Costello) gives up trying to participate in the Summer Olympics, knowing he will never get there, he aims to become a skier and compete in the Winter Olympics, he is very successful in the sport. British Olympic officials reject him for being awkward, realising he could make the team as a ski jumper, a sport the United Kingdom has not competed in for six decades, twenty-four-year-old Eddie (Kingsman: The Secret Service's Taron Egerton) travels to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany and finds the training facility, he is belittled by the more seasoned jumpers, including from the Norwegian team, but he befriends and has the support of good-hearted bar owner Petra (Iris Berben). Eddie trains himself, he easily succeeds the 15-metre (49 ft) hill on his first try, he injures himself on his first try of the 40-metre (130 ft) hill, drunken snow groomer Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman) encourages Eddie to give up, in fact Eddie learns from Petra that Peary is a former champion American ski jumper, he left the sport in his 20s after a fall out with mentor, famous ski jumper Warren Sharp (Christopher Walken). Eddie's tenacious spirit and shared feelings of ostracisation from the other jumpers convince Peary to train him, with very little time to qualify for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, they use unorthodox methods to improve Eddie's jump and landing skills, and he successfully completes the 40-metre hill. The rules of the British Olympic division regarding ski jumping mean that Eddie needs to complete a 70-metre (230 ft) jump in order to qualify for the the Winter Olympics, not long after he successfully completes lands a 38-metre (125 ft) jump and wins his place on the British Olympic Team. The officials make an effort to keep Eddie from tarnishing the Winter Olympics, with his amateurish efforts, they decide to change the rules and demand he jump at least 61 metres (200 ft), Eddie is discouraged but continues training at a circuit, increasing his jump length each time, but misses the required 61 metres. At the final event before the cutoff date for qualification, Eddie does a practise jump, he successfully lands 61m exactly, but on his official jump he fails and is disqualified, Eddie is devastated and returns home to his parents, but he receives a letter claiming that his practise jump was valid. Eddie is happy to tell Bronson he is in the Winter Olympics, but Bronson tries to dissuade him, promising he will make a fool of himself and his country if he goes, but Eddie is undeterred, he notes that competing in the Olympics was always enough for him. Arriving in Calgary, Eddie is instantly scorned by the other British athletes, they get him drunk and nearly provoke him into fighting after he missed the opening ceremonies. Eddie completes the 70m jump, despite finishing last with 51 metres (167 ft) he sets a British record, his triumphant celebrations of this achievement win the audience over, the media embrace him and nickname "Eddie the Eagle". Peary over the phone criticises Eddie for not taking the sport seriously, so Edwards appears before the media to apologise for his antics, assuring that he does take his skiing seriously, and not wanting to leave the games as a novelty act, he announces he will enter the 90-metre (300 ft) jump, which he has never attempted before. Peary travels to the games to support him, his parents and friends watch the television on tenterhooks, Eddie barely manages to land a 73-metre (240 ft) jump, he once again scores last in the event, but achieves a British record and is nonetheless cheered by the audience and millions around the world, British Oympic officials grudgingly accept him. Warren Sharp is at the event and reconciles with Peary, and Eddie returns home a national hero to the cheers of fans at the airport, his mother rushes over and embraces him, and his father declares his support and embraces him as well. Also starring Tim McInnerny as Dustin Target, Edvin Endre as Matti "The Flying Finn" Nykänen, Jim Broadbent as BBC Commentator and Mark Benton as Richmond the BOA Official. Jackman is splendid as the fictional alcoholic trainer and former champion, the supporting cast are all good as well, but this film absolutely belongs to Egerton who looks spot-on with the real Eddie's signature pout, wide-eyed personality, sweet naivety and permanently positive attitude, he really gives the film mass appeal. This really is a quintessential true underdog story, it has great visual style and a catchy soundtrack, including the score by Matthew Margeson, and if like me you don't know the full story you really get into the sport, it is a funny, moving, crowd-pleasing and inspirational, something all the family can enjoy, a brilliant feel- good semi-biographical sports comedy drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves more attention and revenue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie the Eagle premiered in China on 18th March, the same date as Renevant, when Zootopia is still earning everything from people all over. Saddly predictably tragically, Eddie the Eagle got less than 5% screens, receiving less than 1% of the daily box office of all releasing films. I mean, I will watch the film no matter what. After all, I am a huge fan of Hugh Jackman, and Taron Egerton has always been an eye candy to me. However, after watching the film, I understood it could not be the most popular one. But please, this is an encouraging and humorous story with beautiful sceneries, novel concepts and hot dudes; it is definitely a must-see.I think the major drawback is the storyline. First of all, it is a little bit short. Come on, only 106 minutes?! Making it to 120 minutes will absolutely raise the level. The length of the film totally limits the number, the kinds, and even the quality of setbacks the lead faces. Therefore, the story become a quite simple one almost expectable. Sarcastically, the movie maker actually spent great many efforts and money in enriching other things. For instance, multiple beautiful original songs no weaker than Try Everything. Let alone the vivid snowy set. If only they had lengthened the story to make it more twisty, colorful and impressive!The cast have done an excellent job delivering such an uplifting story in an amusing way. We see cuteness, optimism, disappointment, pain, struggle, regret, hope, happiness and proud from the characters and feel with them along the way. I have to say my eyes moistened despite all the laughter. This movie can literally teaches a life lesson about holding your dreams no matter what. This is a belief everyone should hold at all ages whether you are left almost nothing or almost everything. Since it is a biopic, it can persuade you to keep that in mind.I really love this film, yet I give it a seven for its amazing story and it being a mediocre story teller. Hey, don't forget Eddie the Eagle is made by the same studio that made Kingsman starring also Taron Egerton last year. It should have brought it to Oscar level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical 2015/16 British film... in every sense of the word...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion on this film won't be popular here, but I just didn't like this film. All of these types of British film have the same very bland, very obviously low budget feel to them. Now some films, like High-Rise for example, use this to their advantage and create their own unique visual style based around their limitations, and it works. However Eddie the Eagle, while showing hints of style, didn't deliver. Shots were just flat, boring, not exciting, just "stick the camera there and press record". There were very few memorable shots in the film, so few I could probably count them on my hands. The film just made no effort to grab me and give me something that I couldn't see if I plonked on BBC 1 on a Sunday evening. For some people that's all they want, but for me I just expect a bit more effort. Now I know going for some kind of overt style may have distracted from the TRUTH of the narrative perhaps, but the TRUTH of the matter is, there is very little TRUTH in this film. It really bothered me. Hugh Jackman and Chris Walken, while fun to watch, played fictional characters. But this film never made any effort to make you feel it was just loosely based on the true story, Eddie the Eagles story is inspirational, you don't need to add American actors to make up for it, just use a better bloody script instead. If the script was amazing and it had a unique style to set it apart from other bland British films it wouldn't need a Chris Walken there do something actually interesting could happen. Just boring, bland, phoned in, cookie cutter rubbish that will be 3 quid in HMV by the end of May.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice underdog sports film, but lacks enough oooomph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this movie made it look like it was going to be a riot. It was cute, though nowhere near as funny as expected. The scenes when he is little are very good, then when he gets older, it just loses some of the appeal. The actors are good,and of course, Hugh Jackman is always great to look at -- but the film seems a little one- dimensional and cliché. Its just we've seen so many of these films where the outsider gets picked on, or isn't liked by his teammates -- then comes through and is loved by all. There are definitely some nice moments, but overall, the movie feels "soft." Could be more dimension, maybe more development of the characters. The best parts are the ski jumps - whether they end up in crashes or safe landings - they are fun to watch. It's just there isn't enough in the movie to make it "soar" the way Eddie the Eagle finally does. It's fun... but it's not great. It's too much like other films we've seen before (with other sports) -- without enough oooomph. The characters are a bit flat, could use more development. Pretty simple in both plot and style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charmless Copy of Cool Runnings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine anyone truly loving or hating Eddie the Eagle. A middle-of-the-road (or slope, if you prefer) true-life sports drama that is so similar to Disney's Cool Runnings that it's hard to believe they aren't actually connected. It's a 1980's set Winter Olympics tale starring an event contender from a country who has rarely competed in their event, led by a disgraced coach who learns to love the sport again. The only difference: Cool Runnings is relatively coherent and immensely charming, whereas Eddie prefers to just let the clichés abound like snowflakes on a ski-lift. We watch Olympic hopeful Michael "Eddie" Edwards as he ascends the ranks of world-wide ski-jumping to just barely qualify as a contender. Just like Eddie himself, the film toes the line of barely passing and completely losing. At first, it's strong eighties setting and attention to detail is uniquely colorful for an inspirational sports film. Unfortunately the corny script, depthless characters, and atrocious skiing effects overwhelm any goodwill the movie earns early on. What a shame that such an extremely easy-to-root for guy is stuck in such a weightless product. Egerton (Kingsman) is definitely a fun newcomer to watch, as he captures Eddie's na?ve determination and awkward charm with aplomb. Director Fletcher, however, clearly doesn't have a strong enough grasp on what made this guy an unpredictable, worldwide phenomenon. Despite its promising protagonist and premise, Eddie the Eagle is sadly a forgettable movie about an unforgettable icon.</fullReview>
