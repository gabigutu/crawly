		<shortDescription>As relevant today as it was then - and still very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part satire, part slapstick comedy, part melodrama; the great pioneer of film, Charles Chaplin, has created his own monument with this film. At the same time, 'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier.After nearly 80 years, this screen marvel still makes me laugh, cry - and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives. Modern times, indeed. To me, this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then, and it's certainly as relevant as it was then. The tramp still rules. My vote: 9 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Farewell Performance of The Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film. Indeed, several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp (with his worn hat, distinctive mustache, dusty suit, cane, and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.Still, the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one. The Jazz Singer, which debuted in 1927, five years before Modern Times began production, is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industry's century-old history. In the film, comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience and...sings. And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin' in the Rain, the public was suddenly in a frenzy for "Talking pictures! Talking pictures!" Sadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.Modern Times is not an entirely silent film, (there are dialogue snippets and sound effects), but if you look closely, every character with dialogue (excluding Chaplin himself) is being mocked. Even when The Tramp opens his mouth (the only time he ever did so in a film), the words are nonsensical, defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance, entertainment, and quality.Despite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, it is hard to ignore the political component. In his movies, Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress, as often embodied through the social elite, the police, and wealthy entrepreneurs. The irony of the film's title, then, is two-fold. It connects with Chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form, but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary, while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) The world was changing fast, and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.As we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern, mechanized world, we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results, but we can also feel pain and pity. He is clearly a man who does not belong. Indeed, The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind, and as far as we know, he has no friends, family, funds, or history).He takes on assembly lines, feeding machines, department stores, policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity), but The Tramp (and his symbolic extension, the individual) never seem to fit.This is, consequently, why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as "The Gamin" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.It is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism, yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. The conclusion of the film, which most likely reflects upon Chaplin's own emotions, is tinged with sadness, but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years ago.Then there is, of course, the comedy, which is the stuff of legendary status. Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times. These include The Tramp's bout with an assembly line (and his resulting twitches), his unfortunate encounter with "nose-powder", the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry, and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customer.In my opinion, however, the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates (the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film) and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an out-of-control feeding machine (the most uproarious moment in the film).These are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is. On a personal level, the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us. In our hearts, many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life (with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappings).As Chaplin so skillfully shows, however, our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream, lost among the sheep-like herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity. Still, the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious comedy with a serious message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Modern Times" is in my top 5 films, and #2 in my list of favorite comedies. Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being, nevermind film maker, that ever lived. I first saw this treasure about 8 years ago, and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny, and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film. "Modern Times" passed my test with flying colors. I laughed hysterically from start to finish. Each and every scene is innovative, well thought out, and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed. Among my favorite scenes are the "automatic worker-feeding machine"; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food, thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store. No special effects or computer animation, just pure, simple, genius.The storyline in "Modern Times" is purposefully naive, a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films. Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros. cartoon, which coming from me is a sincere compliment. The level of physical comedy in "Modern Times" is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and others.Finally, as was the case with most of his later films, "Modern Times" is a serious social commentary. Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released. In fact, it is arguably even more relevant today, and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be. "Modern Times" is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society. The opening scene, which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep, is Chaplin's warning against standardization, mechanization, and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality. Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden, because despite his enormous success and wealth, he never forgot where he came from. In the end, "Modern Times" is a reminder that no matter how bad things are, you can still smile. Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other, and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films. Its up to us to keep his legacy alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie Chaplin's own deeply impoverished past plays an extensive role in the theme of his film Modern Times, which is probably the most potent of his dozens of films that deal with the difficult lives of th</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a testament to Chaplin's filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot. Indeed, the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable, but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong, time-transcending message about poverty stricken populations.It is no secret that Charlie Chaplin was more or less dragged into the sound era against his will. In the early part of the 20th century, he had built a tremendous career as a silent film actor, and had created a character, the Tramp, that was purely a silent film character who could not be transported into the sound era. Charlie had built his career and his popularity with the Tramp, and the coming of sound to the cinema meant the end of that character (as illustrated by Robert Downey Jr.'s Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 film Chaplin, `The Tram CAN'T talk. The minute he talks, he's dead.'). Chaplin delivers to the world a cynical satire about modern technology as well as his own ode to the silent film with Modern Times.Charlie plays the part of a man who works a dehumanizing position in a factory in which he is little more than a component of a machine, and he is controlled like a pawn by the menacing boss, who we see mostly as a looming face on a tremendous television screen. Clearly, the most memorable scenes in the film involve something to do with the factory, such as Charlie's brief trip into the innards of the machine, as well as his warm-hearted efforts to feed lunch to a man who has inadvertently become lodged in a machine, with only his head free. However, there is a very noteworthy but fairly subtle subplot that quietly reveals Chaplin's fondness for the silent film.The first and most obvious thing is that for the most part, this is a silent film. There are intertitles, there is precious little dialogue, and the film's main character doesn't utter a sound until near the end of the film. But there are also a lot of other things that more subtly hint that silent films are better than sound films. For one thing, the only intelligible words spoken in the film are done so through some sort of barrier. There is the factory boss speaking demandingly through the television screen, and the feeding machine company speaking through the radio as they try to sell the feeding machine to the factory boss. This becomes the most obvious by the fact that anyone speaking on screen - such as the factory boss as he tells the men that the feeding machine is not practical - only does so in intertitles. We know that dialogue can be put in the film, but Chaplin chooses only to do this in a detached and mechanized way.There is also a very strong example of Chaplin's endless sympathy for poor people at several points in this film. The most significant example of this is his interactions with the Gamin, played by Paulette Goddard, as well as his nearly constant contempt toward the police. After the scene where he gorges himself at a small diner (note that the window said `Cafeteria: Tables For Ladies'), he casually calls an officer into the diner and tells him to pay the tab, unable to pay it himself. As he is handcuffed to the officer, he gets a cigar from a nearby vendor and hands some large candy bars to a couple of small children nearby, who look to be the type of children who are never sure where their next meal is going to come from.Charlie plays a hard working, lower class man in Modern Times, and no matter how badly he just wants to get some good work and earn a living so that he can buy a house for himself and Paulette, things constantly seem to go wrong for him. It seems that this bad luck is used to suggest that poor people are not poor as a result of their own shortcomings, but because they just can't seem to work their way up to a better life, no matter how hard they try. This social commentary is intertwined with such skillful intricacy with the story about Chaplin's love of silent film that there is really no switching back and forth between the two. Modern Times strikes me as especially memorable because it is a very simple story that is punctuated by a series of comedy skits, yet it also delivers several different messages that are important to society as well as to the filmmaker himself. In this way, the movie almost seems to deliver these strong messages without the audience even being aware that they are being presented with these issues. It is a great way to mix entertainment with important societal topics, and Charlie's decision to finally have the Tramp utter vocalized speech is done so in an endlessly watch-able song and dance scene, adding to the immeasurable number of film skits for which Charlie Chaplin will be remembered and loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a must see for anyone who loves comedies. Charlie Chaplin is at his all-time best as the Tramp, and he has wonderful chemistry with Paulette Goddard's Gamin. Together, they provide an hour and a half of non-stop laughs. My favorite parts are when he is fed by a "modern" machine that goes awry, and then when Charlie goes crazy in the factory. The situations and expressions are hilarious! Please see this movie soon...you definitely will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still modern, funny and profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to review Chaplin's movies objectively because many of us have seen them, or at least have heard about them, since we were young. They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural background.Chaplin is arguably the only complete director: in most of his pictures, he also produces, acts, writes the script, composes the music, does his own stunts and edits. His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes, even when he continued directing silent movies after their time. "Talkies" were the only films produced after 1927, the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception: "City Lights" in 1931 and "Modern Times" in 1936 were sensations worldwide (the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal). This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe. Only in 1940 did Chaplin direct a talkie.*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Is the movie a comedy? Partly: tragi-comedy is Chaplin's trademark. In my opinion, there are three levels of humour.1. Pure amusement, sometimes as in slapstick: the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp roller-skates close to an edge in the department store (fabulous stunt); he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end. Again, I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film. To enjoy it fully, we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense, notably towards old-fashioned cinema.2. No humour, just drama: the gamin's father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job (an efficient illustration of ruthless competition). 3. Amusement with a dramatic twist: these are the most frequent scenes, and probably the best. We grin even as we laugh. The movie opens on sheep moving grouped (of which a black one: an allusion to the tramp?), that fade out to workers coming out of the subway. This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression. Another example is one of Chaplin's most famous scenes ever: the tramp tries the eating machine. It is at the same time hilarious (Chaplin really gives all of himself here) and pathetic: a metaphor on ill-conceived progress, oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requests.Other scenes include: the entire first part in the factory, including when the tramp is stuck in the machine (inside shot, that became iconic), which also happens to a colleague later on (outside shot); the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea, with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hut.The movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour, as well as its rhythm. It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music. And it ends like a roller-coaster: funny musical (the tramp sings), emotional (he is hired), dramatic (the police arrest the gamin), thriller (they run away as climatic music plays), melancholic (they are on the road, free but uncertain). The last image is rightfully double-edged: the tramp and the gamin walk away, but mountains ahead block their road. She looks like an elegant lady, he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes. We don't know where they are going, nor do they.Hence Chaplin's ambition was far more than to just divert. Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern:- Crisis, redundancies, strikes, inequalities, social unrest- Working conditions in factories, even though exaggerated by humour and symbols: productivity, control, burn-out- Technology that dehumanises: chain-working, the eating machine, video surveillance (a science-fiction element at the time). Remarkably, the only sounds of the film are coming from devices, not humans: screen, phonograph, radio- Success with talent, work and some luck- The law. The topic is prominent (the police are omnipresent) and ambiguous. Can one steal food to survive? Chaplin seems to excuse this behaviour. The tramp is on both sides of the law: he steals food but helps the police arrest villains in jail. And the police's role is complex; notably, they shoot an unarmed man, followed by the ironic card: "The law takes charge of the orphans"- Violence and drugs in prisonThe universal dimension of the movie shows by the fact the main characters have no name: the tramp, the gamin. Chaplin will be blamed for its social topics during the McCarthy era, among other grievances, and he will be forced to exile. Considering it now, this seems ridiculous since the message of the film is not communist: the tramp and the gamin want everything but change society; they search for a job, a home and respect. Note also Lincoln's portrait in the tramp's cell: he is a patriot.The movie does not take sides. Workers can be friendly or violent. Policemen can be friendly (e.g. in jail) or violent (one purposelessly pushes the tramp outside the factory). Prison inmates can be honest (the tramp) or villains. Women can be attractive (the gamin) or not (all others, actually). This double-sidedness also divides individuals. Big Bill was bullying the tramp in the factory, but later sympathises with him. The gamin steals and then becomes settled. The tramp will do anything to protect the ones he loves (the gamin, children), but can abuse almost anybody else to achieve it: a recurrent feature in Chaplin's pictures.The underlying message seems to be: people are not good or bad, it mainly depends on their conditions. Yet another modern theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Favorite Chaplin film. Packed with social commentary that is still relevant today. Chaplin does a superb job of representing the average worker of the time and the mental impact that the daily motions of what we consider normal in society. Such as the opening of the movie in which a scene of a morning rush of people going to work fades into a herd of sheep. Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present in this film while still keeping serious undertones. The best example of this is the eating machine. This particular scene was a perfect representation of the problems in our society (a machine meant to further regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process) while also causing a laugh out loud reaction. My favorite part of this film is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances. What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was the first time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stance against "talkies". Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are complete gibberish but the audience understands regardless. All in all I believe Modern Times is Chaplin's greatest film, this was the first Chaplin film I had ever seen and since then have watched all of them and found a great respect for Chaplin and silent movies overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some iconic scenes in socially conscious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is just a cog in the modern machinery. He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts. The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine. By late afternoon, he gets lost in the machinery. He can't stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital. He gets out but he doesn't have a job anymore. A red flag falls off the back of a truck. He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it. The police grabs him thinking that he's the leader. In prison, he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released. A Gamin (Paulette Goddard) is stealing food for the children. Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage. She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp. He tries to take the blame but she's caught anyways. He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing. They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out together.This has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on. The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream. The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next. He's the cog that never really fits in the machinery. This is a sound movie with sound being used for specific and interesting ways. The Tramp is actually singing but it's a lot of non-sense. This definitely has a social commentary but it's still funny message movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilarious, touching, anarchic, revolutionary, realist, surreal, of its time, timeless - Modern Times is a multifaceted work of genius. When it's over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into 85 minutes, it is incredible - the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the "nose powder"; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance (my favourite); the gibberish song - and many more. Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques, making the best of both worlds, not falling between stools as some directors might have done.Of course, there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances, of bureaucracy, and of the then current depression, on the ordinary "little man". And it is the little man, the individual caught up in society's complex machinery, whom Chaplin championed. He may have sympathised with left-wing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people, but Chaplin's essential beliefs are enshrined in the final "words" and shot, with him telling Paulette Godard, that she should keep smiling, they will get along, as they walk, a couple of individuals, into an uncertain future. Beyond politics, the individual has to rely on his or her own resources and spirit to survive. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long after most people thought the silent movie had been buried forever, Chaplin brought his "Little Fellow" out of mothballs for one more magnificent motion picture. The Tramp is trapped in a factory, performing mind-numbing repetitive tasks, and finally he goes hilariously berserk. I started laughing the instant I saw the lady in the dress with the buttons. Like "City Lights," this film is a collection of charming vignettes, this time revolving around The Tramp's desire to settle down with gamin Paulette Goddard. From the Tramp's encounter with an assembly-line "feeding machine" to his unsuccessful stints as night watchman and waiter, this movie is packed full of delights. Chaplin never speaks, but he does sing a little. This work of genius can make you smile though your heart is breaking.</fullReview>

He plays one of the hordes who slave away for low wages while the upper classes while away in their idleness.Charlie is at his best here and the film contains many memorable scenes, including his being caught in the giant machinery of a factory, his inadvertent leading of a protest march which lands him in jail, his blindfolded excursion on roller skates, his delightful song in the cafe and the memorable final scene as he saunters arm-in-arm down the road and into the sunset with his wonderful costar, Paulette Goddard, as the picture fades out. The have nothing but hope - and each other.The film is brilliantly performed by Chaplin and the supporting cast, masterfully directed and superbly shot and edited. Even though the film is largely silent, save for sound effects and a few snippets of dialogue, there are few title cards. This is because the film is so expertly acted and directed they are not necessary. The story can be easily followed with only the bare minimum of titles.Everyone has their own favorite Chaplin film (mine is "City Lights"), but this ranks with the best of his work.

There, he is subjected to such indignities as being force-fed by a malfunctioning "feeding machine" and an accelerating assembly line where he screws nuts at an ever-increasing rate onto pieces of machinery. He finally suffers a nervous breakdown and runs amok, throwing the factory into chaos. He is sent to a hospital. Following his recovery, the now unemployed factory worker is mistakenly arrested as an instigator in a Communist demonstration. In jail, he accidentally ingests smuggled cocaine, mistaking it for salt. In his subsequent delirium, he avoids being put back in his cell.

		<shortDescription>Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1930s, technology was increasing faster than people could've imagined 30 years ago, and factories were simply becoming normal at this point. The world was moving faster than ever before, and I'm sure the workers at the factories couldn't help but feel like they were being used as just another cog in the machine. "Productivity" became more important than the workers well being and big company bosses - as well as the machines themselves - seemed to be controlling the workers. The machines seemed to be taking jobs from the actual human beings and this feeling is perfectly conveyed in Charlie Chaplin's great "Modern Times".I don't need to go into an in depth analysis to point out the parts of the film that convey these points but the most impressive aspect of this film is how genuinely funny it manages to be while making this point. From the lunch machine and the Tramp's mental breakdown to the entire jail scene, this is by far the funniest Chaplin movie I've seen yet, and one of the funniest silent films I've seen.Speaking of the lunch machine, the film's main point is perhaps portrayed with more clarity and hilarity in this scene than any other scene in the film, and that point is this: Humans aren't machines, and machines aren't perfect, and neither of those should be treated as such.As well as that bit of commentary it has a sweet story involving a young homeless girl and the Tramp and an optimistic ending in which they literally walk off into the sunset. It may sound trite, but in this story there's no telling if they'll be OK, the important thing is that they believe they will and they shouldn't stop trying, and that seems to be the most important thing to Charlie Chaplin, who seems to convey this message in one way or another in every film he makes.</fullReview>

You can watch it anytime, anywhere, and with anybody without any age range.From incredible lead performance, where it's script was unspoken. With a mind-blowing writing about politic, hard-work, and sacrifice, no other comedies could stand any chance to compete to Modern Times. They will be discretely forgotten rather than Modern Times which always haunt the audience's mind for a longgg time.. With a remarkable cinematic ending, no one dare to disgust. Worshiping Chaplin as a beyond is very very easy.. Because all of His creation is just... All Masterpieces..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Modern Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We like to think that comedy has evolved since the time of silent film. We like to think that with the advent of sound and the injection of modern technology in all aspects of film production has made just about everything better. Indeed, it's hard to argue that so much of today's fun and farce just can't exist without a sound mixer and a few boom mics laying around. Ask yourself, if you put The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) or The Hangover (2009) on mute, would you really get anything out of it?By 1936, sound had long taken the film industry by storm. In fact, if you listen closely to the moment Al Jolson uttered "You ain't heard nothing' yet," in The Jazz Singer (1927), you may have heard the careers of many shattering in earnest. Never has there been a piece of technology so seamlessly adapted to an industry before or since. To name the number of noteworthy films made after 1929 that were silent would be to name perhaps a dozen.Yet with this adoption came growing pains. The cumbersome size of the Photokinema sound-on-disc machines and their components meant cameras had to stay bolted down. Actors had to not wonder too far from the mic or worse still, find a way to wear several pounds of bulky microphones under their garments. What once were dreams, stitched together by editing cuts became pale imitations of stage plays. The grammar of film essentially took two steps back.Seeing this, silent era superstar Charlie Chaplin decided to stem the tide. In 1931, he directed, produced and starred in City Lights, a romantic masterpiece of stagecraft and pantomime that to this day is one of the best examples of the beauty we lost. Seeing the writing on the wall by 1936, Chaplin decided to give the Tramp one last hurrah before retiring the character. One last bow before the tendrils of technology transforms his career into a shadow of its former self.Modern Times is at once one last bow, one last look at innocence lost and one glorious masterpiece of cinema. In it, Charlie's lovable Tramp struggles to adapt to a modern technological age while causing light-hearted mayhem everywhere he goes. Throughout the film he tries to conform to working as a security guard, a longshoreman, a factory worker, a mechanic etc. yet his peculiarity prevents him from being at a work site for too long. During his struggles he befriends an woman named Ellen (Goddard) who aids him in his quest for fulfilling work. They of course, fall in love in the chaste innocent way that couples did in the films of the time.Modern Times is infamous, for among other things, a soundtrack that includes the earworm "Smile" composed by Chaplin himself. The most famous cover was crooned by Nat King Cole whose astringent voice had the poorly covered scars of a life harshly lived. "Smile" to Modern Times is perfect; both as a bittersweet anthem and as addition to the American songbook. It perfectly captures the Tramp's uneasy monachopsis while hanging onto a buoyant hope of finding purpose. It's at times sad, at times triumphant but always life-affirming.Modern Times is also known for large, unique and detail filled comic set-pieces that despite being around for eighty years still coaxes laughter. One after another, these moments capture the absurdities of industrial life no other film does. Whether it be Chaplin toiling over a conveyor belt of widgets or literally being engulfed by a mechanical do-dad, He always has the perfect expression to reaffirm his humanity in the most inhuman of situations. It's pitch-perfect pantomime done by a true master of the craft.Of course, being the film advertised as "the one where The Tramp speaks," Modern Times does succumb to the encroachment of sound. And unlike in City Lights, Chaplin decides to inject it as part of a large theme as opposed to a target of mockery. The film is book- ended by two moments of sound, the first of which is his factory boss yelling at him through a large projected screen. "Get back to work!" he yells while the Tramp struggles to find a moment of respite. The inclusion of sound as an oppressor, even a personified one is an effective means of identification. Those who have heard the phrase "If you have time to lean, you have time to clean," will no doubt sympathize with Chaplin's character in that particular moment in time.The second time sound is used, is to affirm Chaplin's Tramp as a unique individual amid a crowd of onlookers. Late in the film, Ellen finds a job for the Tramp at a restaurant as a singing waiter. Right before his debut, he struggles to remember the words of the song he's to sing. He decides to put the lyrics on his detachable cuffs. Invariably, he looses the cuffs and, thinking quickly, begins to sing in gibberish. It's a prank pulled on audiences clamoring for the Tramp to finally speak on screen, yet it's one that's so incongruously Chaplin that one can't help but admire it.With Chaplin having a hand in every aspect of the film's production, one can write an entire book fawning over the exploits of a genius so ahead of his time, we still feel his influence. Modern Times showcases that genius, filling the celluloid with beauty, pathos, humor and humanity. Years after most of today's contemporary comedies fade into obscurity, those centuries from now will still fondly remember Charlie and his lovable Tramp. I guarantee it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This very well written story never lets down from the very first image we see, flocking sheep compared with rushing urban human crowds, to the very ending. Excellent criticism of the Taylorism/capitalistic through humor relevant for any age, nationality or time; story-telling that would touch anyone alike in a universal fashion, every now and then sparkled with Chaplin's unique and deeply influential sense of humor and on-screen comedy. Hilarious in moments, and unique. A man of many talents clearly, and excellent at those. Overall this depicts quite a zany approach to life, one that is pure in essence and profoundly antagonistic with the current ways of the time, and ways of today still: a life dominated by one-track thinking, rigid and stubborn social etiquette, and the enslavement this new world has brought in so many aspects to the human species. Finally, it highlights the importance of never giving up; EVER; and the preciousness of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed 'till the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Modern Times" is an exceptional movie, also being the last silent-ish movie produced by Charles Chaplin. As we all were accustomed with his depictions of every day lives of ordinary people, this movie brings to life the hardship of a working man during the Great Depression of 1929.This depiction of the working man during a economical state is "flavoured", enhanced by the skills of the producer. It depicts the life of a very ordinary working man, with a job in a factory when the economical state is damaged by the event that occurred in 1929.It is a very beautiful depiction of how a persons life can change when the life they know is completely ruined by a major event and how they choose to cope with the fact that their lives may never return to its original state.Another great and amazing thing about all of Charles Chaplin's movies are the other characters in all of the movies. You can sense that all of the characters of this movie were, in some way, affected by the Great Depression and that emotion is transmitted on the silver screen.The last thing I want to say was how long was my smile at the very end of the motion picture. The flow of emotional feelings was immense and there is some truth in the last lines of the main two characters: Never Give Up on something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Allegory for Sound (Technology Advances) in Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times is a hilarious, and equally brilliant Formalist Film about the rise of technology in the world, and the American dream. Directed, written by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. The film boldly made statements that at the time would have been, very controversial, and remain relevant today. However, the film is at its most impressive when one considers the care, and shear brilliance that went into the making of this film.It seems straightforward to call Modern Times a Formalist Film, the ideas take clear precedence, while the narrative is very character driven. To further that, it would seem the main purpose of this film is to make a statement, technology and the business like approach of filmmaking are ruining the art form, however it's ingeniously hidden behind hilarious humor. The fact that the statement is so well hidden makes it all the more powerful when you realize what it is. For instance people who staunchly disagree with that opinion could laugh at, and enjoy this film without even knowing the film is making this statement.The motifs are ones that don't age poorly as some may. Chaplin chose such vague areas, that we can watch today and relate many arguments to modern day film issues. For instance the technology argument is still present today in the form of "Digital Filming v. Film Reels", or "Computer Generated Images v. Practical Effects.", etc., both modern arguments hold similar issues with the "Talkie v. Silent" argument of the 1930's. Chaplin consistently shows motifs such as the outcast being exiled for a more uniform approach (the black sheep imagery helps parallel this), the overly complicated, often dysfunctional way Chaplin sees technology , or his pessimism towards society, through a showing of eternal optimism. It's similar to when a filmmaker makes you empathize with a character you've grown to hate. All of these motifs are subtly hidden under hilarious gags, so they don't feel preachy, or heavy handed. This approach requires care, and talent, some of the best directors today can't even send a message as subtly as Chaplin did. Part of the reason Chaplin did so well hiding his views was his ability to, for the most part argue his point objectively. By that time colors were being used to influence audience opinions, red made audiences feel uncomfortable, while blue emphasized happiness, Chaplin avoided any colors. Not only did Chaplin avoid coloring his film, he showed the contrasting views, something most filmmakers wouldn't do. It's the brilliant subtlety, and balance that makes Modern Times such a great piece of art. Chaplin carefully crafted a film with a message, but made his film enjoyable for all, which is a true accomplishment. It's truly amazing to see a film that can send a message through the opposite viewpoint, and I can't stress how truly brilliant it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely, one of the best movies of all time. If you are young and meet with Chaplin for the first time, it is the first movie that you need to see. I am sure you'll find this movie very unique and great. With the aid of this movie, you may change your perspectives through people and maybe even your life style. It's a difficult job to foreshadow 21th century in 1936 but Chaplin did it with a perfect way that's why I adore him and his movies.Furthermore, it represents many features of capitalism -today's economical and social model- with a satirical way of point. You may watch very "direct" political movies but don't like them because they focus on a specific kind of audience. However, Chaplin directed/wrote his movies for all sort of audiences in a very repressive time. He risked many things to make us watch these masterpieces.</fullReview>

Modern Times is different in Chaplin's work for the mixture of serious criticism , using the parable, and the pure show. but that fact does it an useful manifesto . because it is the right manner to remind the small details who defines the life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous "Modern times" - we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much, much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga. Another example of things I just assumed I know. It charmed me instantly, of course, because Chaplin was a true genius and magician - his creation, "Little Tramp" is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly, for all his sweetness, clumsiness and old heart. This story apparently happens in Metropolis-like factory where work, machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we (audience) roar with laughter - I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny. Basically, everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed, until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again. What a genius!Once Little Tramp looses his job - there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness, poverty and depression around - he quickly ends up in a prison, from which he doesn't even want to leave. However, he gets Cocaine in his salt, (Charlie Chaplin on a Coke!), saves policemen from escaped criminals, meets minister's wife (very funny scene) and gets release from the prison, with job recommendation letter. And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much, much more coming up later - it really goes on forever but its wonderful, heart-warming and joyous to watch. I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece. Film is so immensely rich with characters, stories, little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Modern Times" (1936) is my first movie which i saw that features Charles Chaplin. Saw it first time in 2015, but nevertheless it's a great movie. Comedy here is truly funny, and it's not just a comedy. It tells a story, with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day ? technology is changing, evolving, and if you are not keeping pace with it, you will have some hard times like our hero of this movie.Acting here is very solid, actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was ? no one overreacted. Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced ? at running time 1 h 27 min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finish.Overall, "Modern Times" is a black and white silent movie (there are some sounds actually) which safely can be viewed for the first time even in 2015 ? 79 years after it's original release. It has some truly genuine comedic situations, it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid. Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because it's very old, but great movies are great movies ? they can be viewed no matter what.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hands of the cinema clock were set back five years last night when a funny little man with a microscopic mustache, a battered derby hat, turned up shoes and a flexible bamboo cane returned to the Broadway screen to resume his place in the affections of the film-going public. The little man?it scarcely needs be said?is Charlie Chaplin, whose "Modern Times," opening at the Rivoli, restores him to a following that has waited patiently, burning incense in his temple of comedy, during the long years since his last picture was produced.That was five years ago almost to the day. "City Lights" was its name and in it Mr. Chaplin refused to talk. He still refuses. But in "Modern Times" he has raised the ban against dialogue for other members of the cast, raised it, but not completely. A few sentences here and there, excused because they come by television, phonograph, the radio. And once?just once?Mr. Chaplin permits himself to be heard.Those are the answers to the practical questions. They do not tell of Mr. Chaplin's picture, or of Chaplin himself, or of the comic feast that he has been preparing for almost two years in the guarded cloister in Hollywood known as the Chaplin studio.But there is no cause for alarm and no reason to delay the verdict further: "Modern Times" has still the same old Charlie, the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audience's or hold it still, taut beneath the spell of human tragedy. A flick of his cane, a quirk of a brow, an impish lift of his toe and the mood is off; a droop of his mouth, a sag of his shoulder, a quick blink of his eye and you are his again, a companion in suffering. Or do you have to be reminded that Chaplin is a master of pantomime? Time has not changed his genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love these black and white, old classics! Why does it seem like they did more with their films when they had less technology available to them? They don't have that ~Hollywood Magic~ that does their effects for them, it was all camera tricks and carefully strategized, one-chance-to-get-the-shot filmmaking and it is beyond impressive.I enjoyed watching this! Full of cool and clever special effects and plenty of moments to make you laugh. Chaplin did such a good job of creating such a silly little character. The story was creative and fascinating, with imaginative concepts and energetic cinematography. It was a fun watch for sure. Delightfully absurd, yet it did give voice to the woes of unemployment and the voracious appetite of capitalism at the price of some disposable human equipment. Silliness with a sting. I recommend it! 8/10 Bye love you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The mechanized and standardized world made of levers, bolts, department stores and lifts is too difficult, or probably too ordinary, for the "honest and trustworthy" Charlie Chaplin, who always ends up trapped in his times. But did this world really change a lot when nowadays we walk to the subway (or we drive in crowded streets) like cattle in order to reach our working place? In fact, what Charlie Chaplin and the beautiful Paulette Goddard (a close up of her face after The Little Tramp is arrested for the theft of a loaf of bread is magnificent) really wants from modern times is a small, decent house where to have dinner together, an apple to grab by stretching your arm outside the window and fresh milk from a cow. Charlie Chaplin doesn't need to speak on the screen (while talking pictures were already widely produced since late 20's) to deliver his brilliant view on 1936's world; and even when he does talk during the floor show towards the end of the movie, we don't need to understand what it is said to appreciate once more his talent and genius. There are two moments that stand out during the movie: the feeding machine that feeds The Little Tramp on the assembly line in the first part of Modern Times (note also some similarities later when the mechanic assistant feeds his boss). And the splendid final scene when before fading out, The Little Tramp invites The Gamin to smile while walking on an empty street at dawn; a scene that alone is worth a full movie, a smile that becomes the essence of the use of trying. This last moment is full of hope and full of humanity; things that we still struggle for in our modern times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Progress is the apparent enemy in this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's last silent film showcases the side effects of modern progress and industry. Possibly a tone on his views of sound films. Heck this was made in 1936. Silent films were long gone, and talkies were the thing of the future. Being Chaplin's last silent film he decided it was right to say goodbye to the little tramp. Anyways let's look at the plot. The tramp (Chaplin) is a factory worker. Chaplin illustrates his views on industry here by showing us huge gears and his daunting assembly line job. Chaplin inadvertently scares people when having a mental breakdown so he is sent to a hospital. After release he is inadvertently held as a communist and arrested again. After that Chaplin meets an orphan (Paulette Goddard) the oldest of her siblings who tries to provide for them. Chaplin and Goddard decide to make a life together and find a home and a job. The trouble is Chaplin always seems to get himself arrested after every job. After the final job that he has fires him too, the tramp and the girl walk off assured that they will make it somehow. This is just another one of those perfect films. The characters find trouble but you feel good for them in the end. Also Chaplin is just as funny as ever. I highly recommend this film. It will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hard Times" turns into "Modern Times"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of Chaplin's "Modern Times" reminds us of the novel "Hard Times" by Charles Dickens. In fact, both masterpieces are examining the same subject, that is the mechanization of human beings that came with the Industrial Revolution. However,this mechanization is criticized in different ways. Charles Chaplin makes fun of the modern times which is around the Industrial Age, with a satirical tone. He puts smiles on the viewers' faces throughout the movie. So not going into further detail about the technicalities of the movie, it can be said that it makes you smile and think at the same time. Therefore, if you are a Charlie Chaplin fan and want to smile and maybe even laugh, then go for this movie. Because it is one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farewell to the Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a time when the art of filmmaking was rapidly churning toward the future, Chaplin was still fighting a one-man battle in favor of silent films. Famously he didn't think much of talking pictures and predicted that they would die out in five years. So, he gleefully pressed on, working his magic in, what was perceived, as a dead art form. Chaplin's contemporaries thought he was behind the times and he continued to fight a battle by keeping his films silent even though he didn't make many in the sound era. As punishment, his last two silent films, City Lights and Modern Times, did not receive one single nomination.Neither of the two silent films that he made after The Jazz Singer were totally silent, they incorporated sound effects and a line or two of dialogue, but both used sound as a means of being critical of the process. First was City Lights which opened with a political speech in which the audience only heard squawks coming from the speaker's mouths. The other was Modern Times, a red-blooded assault on madness of the machine age.Modern Times wasn't his best film but it was certainly better than anything else released in 1936. It was one of his most important films mainly because it was his transition from silent to sound. Here he satirizes the process but there is a tone that suggests that he's ready to move on. It is the most technologically innovative of his works yet it remains silent. The only noises come from machines and the only voices are heard over a radio, a monitor and a phonograph. The message is that Chaplin will move into the sound age, but that doesn't mean he will give it any respect. The reason that the film is important is because it displays his best gifts for satire. His other films had satire but it bubbled under the surface ? this film is more of a full-frontal assault. He exposes the madness of over-dependence on machines, the economic crisis, communist paranoia and man's never-ending pursuit food, glorious food.Most importantly, perhaps most famously, this is the film in which Chaplin bids farewell to The Tramp. There was some discussion of the possibility of giving the Tramp a speaking voice but Chaplin wouldn't hear of it. When the studio insisted on it, he created a moment in which the Tramp sings a song, an odd tune called "Titania," sung in gibberish.Five years after City Lights, Chaplin uses The Tramp to show how the society has changed, how it has grown past his gentle nature and threatens to crush his fragile spirit. In the blistering maelstrom of The Great Depression (this was 1936) we find that The Tramp has had to join the work force, working ten hour days at a steel factory turning the bolts on a grotesque machine that frequently breaks down and constantly speeds up. As he turns the bolts on the conveyor belt, he has to catch up if he misses one. The machine finally swallows him, and The Tramp finds himself bending inside the machine's cogs, but he's so loopy that he doesn't even notice.Although the film finds The Tramp working it also underpins the same theme that Chaplin has always worked with, survival. After going insane, The Tramp is sent to a mental institution and after having been cured, the rest of the film chronicles his desperate search for work. At the docks he meets a gamine (Paulette Goddard), a plucky girl stealing bananas for her brothers and sisters. Food becomes a dominating goal for these two and one of the central themes of the picture: The gamin steals bananas and later bread; The Tramp is nearly killed by an automatic feeding machine that short circuits; The couple have cake in a department store where he works as the night watchman; He eats a very large meal that he can't pay for in order to get thrown in jail where he will have decent food and a roof over his head; Later when he gets his job back at the factory he stops to have lunch even though his supervisor is stuck inside the machine; And he fantasizes about his dream house and coming home to the wife . . . at dinnertime.The world of Modern Times is not that far removed from Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Both films present a world besieged by the chaos of its own technology and both present the kinds of oppression that Orwell would brought to "1984". The inside world is a crush of machines and noise, the outside world is awash in riots, strikes and marches. The Tramp, as always finds himself caught in the middle of one damn thing after another. The message is that things are tough all over, but as The Tramp confides in the gamin to keep chin up and spirits high because if you keep trying eventually, it will all work out.Most of the Tramp's efforts come to nothing, just when he has something it blows away in the wind and he finds that he has to start all over again. This has been the theme of the Tramp all along and, given his determination, we know that he will never give up.It's fitting that Chaplin's Tramp bows out in Modern Times, one more film and I think he would have become dated. The world has moved past him, it's grown too large and too fast for his gentle spirit to maintain. In the end we find him still searching for his dream, the difference is that in the end when he walks into the sunrise of a new day he doesn't go alone. With that, we know he'll be okay.**** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the end of an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin had resisted the influence of 'talkies' for over half a decade, but not even an artist of his enormous talents (and ego) could stall the march of progress indefinitely, and so the Little Tramp's swan song shows the strain of a compromise between the freedom of silence and the straitjacket of sound. The distinction may be subtle, but 'Modern Times' is not so much a silent film as it is a sound film without sound, and Chaplin's tramp is all too clearly an anachronism among the humming dynamos and labor unrest of the 1930s (he might have called the film 'Changing Times'). Enough echoes of the old days remain to qualify it as a classic (including the mad dance through the factory and another great roller skating routine), but after his earlier 'City Lights' his sense of humor would never again measure up to his social conscience, and the hope with which the Little Tramp faces the future at the end of the film is not nearly so clear as Chaplin's regret at leaving silent film behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Sir Charlie Chaplin made his first sound picture in 1940 with The Great Dictator, this was the last of his classic silent films where he played the Tramp we all love. Basically a factory worker, let's just call him the Tramp, is struggling to keep up with machinery of the modern society, specifically tightening bolts on plates. He is at one point selected to try out a new experimental employee feeding machine to speed up production and breaks, but of course the boss is unconvinced. It is when the Tramp gets stuck in the large cogs of the machine that he has a nervous breakdown, where he has a laugh mucking up, and this takes him to prison. Meanwhile an orphan girl known only as Gamine (Paulette Goddard) faces going into a home with her sisters, but she manages to escape and is scrounging to get by. When the Tramp has been released he is immediately put back in when he is mistaken for the leader for a communist parade waving the red flag. In prison he is out of place, but at the same time he prefers to modern society, and when he mistakes cocaine for salt and he unintentionally foils a breakout he is rewarded with release. This release leads the Tramp to meeting Gamine stealing a loaf bread and trying to take the blame to go back to prison, and again getting himself loads of food without paying. He does get arrested for this and sees Gamine in the paddy wagon, but it crashes and they tumble out to make something of themselves, specifically the Trap getting a job in a department store as night watchman. After initially starting out well, the Tramp is caught in a pile of womens' clothes and arrested again, and when he is released ten days later Gamine meets him to show him their new home. She has found a run down old shack house almost falling apart, and while hanging in it and breaking some planks, the Tramp reads a new factory is hiring, and he manages to get a job. Soon enough just after starting, and getting a co-worker caught in a mess, they finds out the workers are on strike, and he gets arrested again because of a brick. Two weeks later, the Tramp is released and finds Gamine working as a caf dancer, and she tries to get him a job as a waiter/singer. He fails at the waiter job getting a duck all over the place, but he proves a worthy singer with his own improvised piece which proves a hit. In the end, Gamine is wanted for arrest, but she and the Tramp manage to get out of the caf, and the films ends with them starting a life on the road. Also starring Henry Bergman as Cafe Proprietor, Stanley 'Tiny' Sandford as Big Bill, Chester Conklin as Mechanic, Hank Mann as Burglar and Stanley Blystone as Sheriff Couler. Chaplin is lovable, Goddard is lovely as the troubled love interest, the feeding machine scene is great fun, and the other slapstick moments are memorable viewing, so it is a must see silent (there are sound effects and some dialogue) comedy. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 81 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something fundamentally sad about Modern Times, by the very fact that it shows an unparalleled genius making his last move in the now-defunct art form with which he made his name. Charlie Chaplin, undisputed master of silent comedy, had managed to bluff his way through the awkward early days of sound, but by 1936 the talkie had got its act together, and screen comedy was dominated by the witty wordplay of the Marx brothers and the smart sass of screwball. Slapstick had all but lost its market, and the picture is saturated with a feel of "One last time?" And Chaplin expresses his feelings with scathing satire. Modern Times is quite plainly a blast at many aspects of industrialised living, especially unemployment and Fordist production management. However the picture also takes several sly swipes at sound film itself. From the beginning, sound is associated with the mechanical, the authoritative, and the austere, with the few bits of spoken dialogue being via some piece of technology such as a radio or the boss's speaking tube. Sound effects too are reserved for nasty clanking and scraping sounds of machinery and things breaking apart. Finally there is Paulette Godard's pronouncement that "The words don't matter" as Charlie forgets the lyrics for his singing waiter act. Chaplin was of course very good at nonsense voices, as this and his Adenoid Hynkel act in The Great Dictator demonstrate, whereas meaningful verbal comedy was his Achilles Heel.Despite all this vehemence, Chaplin is making one or two concessions to contemporary cinema. Modern Times features a lot more camera movement and close-ups than we see in his previous pictures, where he tended to stick to static long shots to preserve the best flow of physical comedy. The more technical approach here is always done for a reason ? for example whip-panned close-ups are used for emphasis, and there is often a change of angle to punctuate a gag such as the half-built ship slipping out of dock. While they do draw attention to the funniest moments they disrupt the purity of the routine and are most likely concessions made by Chaplin for an audience not used to silent comedy. Modern Times is also much more variable and fast-paced than previous Chaplin features, skipping from factory to prison to department store and so on.And yet, of all his feature films, Modern Times includes perhaps the most protracted bouts of silent comedy, far more than the story-driven City Lights. Despite its linking plot, the various settings in which the little tramp finds himself each provide fully-fledged slapstick routines, and there are very few moments in which point or poignancy are allowed to overrule the comedy. The picture is in some ways like a compendium of the non-stop gagging two-reelers he was making in the 1910s. Modern Times may not be quite the tearjerker that The Kid or City Lights were, but it is the master's final great showcase of his primary talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satirical Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times is a satire on capitalism; it highlights the drawbacks of the Industrial Revolution and how machines have burgeoned into a menace, dominating all aspects of human life. It is the story of an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the various social and economic changes; generated with the advent of industrialization. It portrays how capitalism can push an individual to the periphery of the society. The first shot transforms from a flock of sheep to a crowd of people .Idea associative montage has been used to portray that human beings have lost their individuality and their lives are dictated by a social dogma. The movie was made when the world was going under an economic crisis and the political undertones employed, in this movie, are very conspicuous. Charlie Chaplin is shown as an industrial worker who is trying to cope up with the industrial and social changes. The movie is about his constant conflict with capitalists, police and the society in general; the movie is definitely a landmark in comedy. The impeccable humor timing of Chaplin makes him one of the greatest entertainers in film history; but despite being a comedy one cannot help but wonder about the various political and connotations made in a satirical and humorous way. The movie, in a subtle way, highlights the plight of the working class who are often exploited by the capitalists. The movie was made after the great depression during which thousands of people were unemployed and many families starved to death. The movie was light years ahead of its time and delivered strong thoughts in the form of humor; the movie has a lot memorable scenes which make us laugh and think at the same time. This movie is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedies ever made; made by a genius who was not only a great film maker but also a greet visionary. This piece of art has stood the test of time and has been appreciated by people of all ages. This movie serves as a testimonial to the artistic and creative genius of one of the greatest entertainers to have graced the celluloid screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humorous tale of life during the great depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" was released on February 25, 1936. This film would be Chaplin's last silent film. Charlie Chaplin reprises his role as the Tramp in this film set during the Great Depression. Chaplin continues his mastery of silent theatric humor in this film, whose storyline many people would have a hard time finding humor in. This film is fittingly produced in black and white. Modern Times is based in the midst of the Great Depression. The main theme of the film is to make the viewer aware of the conditions of the Depression and how they affected most people. This film raises our awareness of issues such as poor work conditions, unemployment, poverty, hunger, and the harsh reality of broken families during this time in history. Charlie Chaplin plays the Tramp who recently becomes unemployed after having a nervous breakdown, as a result of being worked too hard. The Tramp struggles to find and keep a job in these tough times. Discouraged, he resorts to trying to get thrown in jail so he has a place to sleep and food to eat. During his attempts to go back to jail, the Tramp meets the Garmin, played by Paulette Goddard. The Garmin is a young runaway orphan who recently lost her family, as a result of her father being shot in the street. The Garmin and the Tramp are now homeless, hungry and poor. They come find hope in each other and find a new determination to survive together and beat the odds. This film follows their struggle to overcome the odds, earn an honest living, keep nourished and maintain hope throughout all of the obstacles they encounter. Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, composed and produced this film. Chaplin's masterful use of sound draws the viewer into the scene. In this film, sound is vital in establishing mood and atmosphere of scenes. One defining scene in the film that is a perfect example is a scene where the Garmin loses her father. The Garmin and her sisters are on the dock collecting wood (happy, joyous music is heard), next a gunshot is heard and the music becomes frantic. The Garmin sends her sisters off and she rushes to see what happened. She arrives at her father lying in the street and takes him in her hands as the music turns sad and she mourns her father's death while holding him in her hands. Chaplin also uses masterful body language to portray the emotion and tempo of the film. This is a vital component to this film, like so many other silent films. One good example of this is when the Garmin and Tramp are sitting on the side of the road. The Garmin suddenly comes to tears and dramatically places her head in her arm to cry on. The Tramp and the audience are fully aware of her mood at that moment. This films overall theme is similar to that of Cinderella Man. Even though these films were produced about 70 years apart, they share a theme. Regardless of the circumstances you are dealt, you should never give up. While Cinderella Man is based on a true story of the Great Depression period, Modern Times is based on Charlie Chaplin's unique portrayal of the period. I would strongly recommend viewing this movie to gain a better understanding of this period in American History.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Said BarodiCharlie Chaplin And a Look at Our Own Modern TimesOnce again I get to enjoy watching Charlie Chaplin's master piece Modern Times. The movie possesses this quality that I can interpret it in many different ways according to the events prevailing in periods during which I watched it. The movie could be interpreted politically, artistically, socially and technologically. It possesses these prophetic and futuristic visions of the world we live in today. But this time, as I watch Modern Times again, it came at a very interesting period in my generation's lifetime which is the worst economic crisis since the depression of the thirties. Watching Modern Times reminded me that our economy hasn't learned the lessons taught by the depression of the thirties and that if we don't shape up the economy we might as well be heading for another one soon. As I watched the movie I couldn't stop thinking about my last tour in the state of Michigan with my in-laws. During my last visit to Michigan I watched the iconic state of United States economic power disintegrate in front of my eyes. They were abandoned houses everywhere in Detroit, lines of jobless people lining up in front of day labor spots and unemployment offices. The infrastructure of the city is falling apart, rust everywhere from abandoned factories to bridges. Roads were filled with pot holes. The iconic towers of GM simply looked miserable and macabre; the State of Michigan was dying. As we all followed on the news for the last few months, the iconic state of Michigan was falling apart as the big three, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler were preparing to file for bankruptcy and were laying off thousands of their workers and shutting down many factories and dealerships. The chain reaction from the fall was not limited to Michigan or to the auto industry, it was everywhere, it was nationwide. When I watched Modern Times again it gave me another insight as to what happened exactly, or part of what I believe happened. As Charlie Chaplin carries on his monotonic and tedious task of screwing two bolts to a part moving fast on a mechanized belt, I thought about the generations upon generations of blue collar workers who were brought up in an industrial culture that supremely valued efficiency to the point it neglected the human factor in the production chain. Generations of blue collar workers who where brought up in the auto industry of Michigan and other industries that use the same production methods as those portrayed by Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times. The results were disastrous every time an economic crisis hit, the industry produced hordes of unskilled workers who received no cross training or opportunity to advance within those industries in a way that would allow them to compete and obtain jobs in case they were laid off. The monotonic tasks immensely limited the workers' creativity and skill level to the point were they became solely reliant on the same employer and work place and unable to adapt to economic and industrial changes such as recessions and outsourcing. I believe that Charlie Chaplin's critic of the efficiency-above-all model of production is time-proof and still applies to our own modern times. It is time to restructure the US industry in a way that it puts emphasis on the human factor and instills ingenuity and creativity in the American worker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Times Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern TimesThe Tramp, a fictional character created by Charlie Chaplin, made his final screen debut in 1936 in the silent film Modern Times. Released after talkie movies had gained popularity, the film was directed in a classic silent film style with limited use of dialogue. By going against the newest technology, Chaplin creates a comedic story about the problems an average man has with technology. Modern Times is a reflection of Chaplin's believed that advances in technology, in particular adding sound to film, did not add to the average man's life in a significant way. Using advances in technology to highlight how progress could be detrimental to the average man by separating him from both physically and emotionally from others and creating a wider barrier separating the wealthy from an easily replaceable poor man. Chaplin's use of limited dialogue provided the best example of separation and isolation individual experiences as result of advancing technology. Most evident in two scenes in the original factory, the manager speaks to the workers on a screen from a distance place and the use of a recorded salesman to demonstrate the feeding machine. This creates a barrier between the actual speaker and those the information is being conveyed to. The removal of human interaction from the voices represents the isolation and feeling of man being replaceable. The wide barrier between the wealthy and the poor is highlighted by how the social classes use the technology. The poor are shown needing the technology to live but the wealthy is shown to have technology to help them, best shown by the manager's use of the radio in opening scenes. In contrast, the tramp rushes out on breakfast when the newspaper advertises the need for workers at a new factory. Hundreds of workers are cramped together like sheep, herding forward to gain employment. The actual hiring is based on the number of people needed not that actual skills or knowledge needed for a position. The ideal of all men created equal is quickly replaced, as poor men are replaceable because of technology. Originally written during the Great Depression Chaplin's story is still relevant seventy years later. Advances in technology have resulted in man feeling more isolated as computers and i-pods replace human interaction. The fast paced society of today is simplified in Modern Times as corporations continue to view workers as replaceable and trying to make workers able to do more by being more efficient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Times Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin is one of the actors, who gives us his body and his soul playing for the audiences in series of pantomimed movies. It is easy for all of us to express what we think, feel, and are concerned of by simply opening our mouth and speaking out, but Chaplin shows us that the ability to communicate with the other actors and the audience can be accomplished not only by the verbal speech, but also by the body language and our inner intentions. In the movie "Modern Times", he gives us a show of his sarcasm towards the fast-paced technology and the inability to catch up with the modernization in the world he lives in. The technology he describes and is concerned of supposedly should help us in our daily tasks as well as improve our life for the better; miserably it not only creates difficulties for him, but also makes it emotionally unbearable for him to deal with. He tries to be as fast as he could be when screwing in the nuts of the machines; he tries to adjust his attitude and physical body to perform and give his one hundred percent, but unfortunately he is left with disappointment when catching up with the rapid environment he is surrounded by. His skills and mind become rusty as he works only on one part of the assembly line over and over again like a robot without a break. His body is beaten- up from work and there is either no excitement at the work place or no direct benefits from the technological advancement. He tries to work hard and by the acceptable norms of the society, but his happiness is diminished as his soul and his inner self suffocate by the cruel demands from the management of the factory he works at. His dedication to accomplish his work requirements creates not only a problem for his co-workers and his superiors when slowing down the factory production, but also creates a nervous break for himself that only makes him physically and mentally weak and vulnerable when he foolishly plays around and annoys others by spraying them with machine oil. Throughout the movie Chaplin shows to us the dysfunctions of the new technology and he sadly transforms the difficult moments in his work career into comic laughter for the audiences. The situations he develops in front of our eyes make us question the advantages much argued and discussed to us about the positive influence of the new machinery. Back then human persona suffer to adjust to the new world which created obstacles and frustrations with the technology. The humanity was challenged by the new and changing future of the technological expansion. The movie shows us different unexpected scenes and aspects that the working class was dealing with at the times of scientific adaptation. Was it worth it or not for the human race to pass through the discomfort and discontent that the future had in store? Deeper insights are needed when conducting a formal or informal research on the case. Chaplin acts astonishingly in order to maintain his view for the present and future evolution concerning the human attempts to improve and benefit the society; and the movie brings us to our senses in observing the reality of the advantages and disadvantages in the new worldly- and quickly- changing technology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Buck up - never say die. We'll get along"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1936, Charles Chaplin was already an anachronism ? albeit, an anachronism who was also treasured as an artistic genius. The arrival of 'The Jazz Singer (1927)' did little to curb the director's enthusiasm for silent cinema, and, though he considered at length the commercial implications of converting to synchronised sound, his first film in the "talkie" age was almost completely silent (Chaplin compromised by composing a musical score). Nevertheless, the critical and commercial response to 'City Lights (1931)' was strong, reaffirming Chaplin's status as a cinematic master, and vindicating his decision to linger with an otherwise extinct medium. Thus, 'Modern Times (1936)' was to follow in the same mould, despite a synchronised soundtrack which includes a musical score, sound effects and several lines of spoken dialogue (always spoken through a mechanical "barrier," such as a record-player, radio or loudspeaker). The film is historically significant in that it was Chaplin's first overtly political work, raising concerns inspired both by the economic hardship of the Great Depression, and Chaplin's growing interest in socialism.The title 'Modern Times' is used to deliberate ironic effect. Traditionally, to be modern was to be at the forefront of human progress, a step forwards in Man's noble attempt to assert his dominance over his environment; in short, to further distinguish our species from the lower animals. Yet Chaplin believed that such widespread industrialisation was a step backwards for society. Even from the opening shot, he draws comparisons between the hustling crowds of factory workers travelling to work, and a flock of sheep being herded through a corral. The dehumanisation caused by the workers' monotonous factory work is played for maximum comedic effect, with Chaplin's Tramp eventually driven to a nervous breakdown by Frederick Taylor's apathetic brand of scientific management. In these conditions, direct human interaction is minimal, and almost always channelled through an mechanical mediator. In a scene predating Orwell's "Nineteen-Eighty Four (1949)," Chaplin is reprimanded by a telescreen in the bathroom, the image of his boss looming overhead like the spectre of Big Brother.Chaplin may also have been remarking upon the rise of the Hollywood studio system, which by then employed a comparable assembly-line approach to film-making. Chaplin, who was given full artistic control through his co-ownership of United Artists, worked in complete opposition to these practices, though it could be argued that his perfectionism and often improvisational style was so inefficient that only an artist as wealthy as he could have gotten away with it. Truth be told, there's nothing particularly distinguished about Chaplin's direction ? despite his strong reliance upon actions over words, his silent films were never as visually accomplished as that of Murnau or Lang, for example. However, his greatest talents as a filmmaker were concerned with the plight of people, and, however much sentimentality he liked to dish out, there can be no doubt that, in Chaplin's characters, one found individuals with whom they shared a very real human bond, of empathy and compassion. For all the director's criticism of modern society, he possessed a genuine belief in the value of human spirit.When Chaplin came under fire for alleged "communist sympathies" in the late 1940s, the content of 'Modern Times' was scrutinised for evidence to support the allegations. Certainly, within the director's distaste for industrialisation one may discern an underlying dissatisfaction with capitalism, but Chaplin was definitely not a communist; after all, a prime motivation in his choosing to continue producing silent films was to retain his commercial popularity in foreign-language markets ? that's the capitalist spirit! Nevertheless, Chaplin was eerily prescient when he included a scene in which his Tramp is falsely accused of being a communist, mirroring his own intense political troubles, which concluded in 1952 with the retraction of his US re-entry visa. Though he was initially hesitant about breaking his screen silence, as Chaplin's political convictions grew, so too did his desire to have himself heard. For that, he would, however reluctantly, have to embrace the technology of sound, and, for a mouthpiece, he would choose the most hated man in Europe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lady and the Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MODERN TIMES (United Artists, 1936), was written, produced, scored, directed, and stars Charlie Chaplin in what was to become his final role as the Little Tramp. It also marked the close to the silent screen era. In fact, MODERN TIMES, though not essentially a silent film in a sense, but more like some made between 1927-29 equipped with underscoring, sound effects and talking sequences. While silent movies officially ended by 1929, Chaplin kept that genre going with CITY LIGHTS (1931) and MODERN TIMES, demonstrating that silents is still golden. Chaplin, having come a long way from London music halls to American silent comedies dating back to 1914, not only developed his character but established the greatness in his work. Reportedly in production for two years, possibly more, Chaplin's ability to perfect comedy routines into a simple story like MODERN TIMES is amazing. Supporting Chaplin is Paulette Goddard, an movie extra since 1929, now awarded the opportunity in a major role opposite the comedy legend. Unlike Chaplin's other leading ladies of the past, Goddard is reportedly the only one to become successful, especially during the 1940s following her second pairing in Chaplin's first talkie as THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940).The opening credits super imposed in front of a clock, indicates time as now, while its opening title that reads, "Modern Times is a story of industry - of individual enterprise - of humanity crusading in pursuit of happiness" indicates something else, a satire of the machine age, past, present and future, while in fact being one story with two related themes. The first revolves around two people of different backgrounds facing uncertainties with their present lives while the second half turns into a love story between these two same people who have fallen through hard times of the Depression. Before their devotion to one another occurs, their introduction begins with Charlie (Charlie Chaplin), a factory worker of the Electro Steel Corporation where he tightens bolts on moving belts. Unable to adjust to the advanced technology as a tester to a a new type of feeding machine, he acquires a nervous breakdown that has him committed to an asylum for a rest cure. Next introduction is on the Gamin (Paulette Goddard), a waterfront girl whose unemployed father (Stanley Blystone) is killed in a riot, leaving her two younger sisters to be sent to an orphanage while, after escaping from the juvenile officers, struggles to survive in the outside world. Caught stealing a loaf of bread by the law, Charlie, who has since been released from the hospital and struggling himself to find work, comes to her defense admitting he stole it. The lady and the tramp meet again in the patrol wagon that soon breaks down in an accident, leaving these two strangers to make their escape together into the world of uncertainty. Their uncertainty finally turns to hope when a cabaret owner (Henry Bergman) hires the girl to work as a dancer while Charlie is employed as a singing waiter. All's well until the juvenile division track down the girl to have her arrested.For one of Chaplin's most admired films, there's no spoken dialog, at least from Chaplin's standpoint. Talking sequences comes from the factory president (Allan Garcia), who, at one point, yells at Charlie to "get back to work." Other sounds include a radio announcer's voice, police sirens, a barking dog and stomach churning. Chaplin, who preferred to keep his tramp character silent, did offer audiences the opportunity to hear his voice for the first time, in song, for the cabaret sequence, doing some double-talk rendition to "Titina." &nbsp; While MODERN TIMES has become relatively known throughout the years, it was rarely revived until Chaplin's reissued it some time prior to his death in 1977. Having attended the 1980 theatrical revival of MODERN TIMES at the Regency Theater in New York City where it played to a full house, I witnessed patrons, young and old alike, laughing hysterically and watching with amazement at many key scenes being the feeding machine sequence; Charlie roller skating around the department store blindfolded; and his method of feeding lunch to his employer (Chester Conklin) while stuck inside the machine's safety wheels. Considering MODERN TIMES to be not quite so modern by today's standards, it demonstrates how comedy never grows out of style. Acquiring less pathos than CITY LIGHTS, MODERN TIMES is most memorable in the way it bids goodbye to Chaplin's world of silent movie making through its underscoring to the sentimental "Smile (Though Your Heart is Breaking"). MODERN TIMES, along with other Chaplin features and short subjects, were distributed on CBS Home Video in 1989 to commemorate Chaplin's centennial year of his birth. Though frequent revivals on various cable channels, ranging from Turner Network Television (1989), American Movie Classics (1991-2001), and Turner Classic Movies (as part of "The Essentials") assures how this and many other Chaplin films are to remain in view as long as there are those around to appreciate his art and style the way he originally intended it to be, through laughter and a little tear, especially during these modern times.

		<shortDescription>Modern Times Is The Last Great Silent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the release of City Lights, Chaplin met with several world leaders as he toured the world for eighteen months. Chaplin formulated ideas for his next film during this tour while the United States was caught in the grip of The Great Depression. It was the wave of automation in the industrial economy which peaked Chaplin's interest. His visit to the auto and industrial factories in Detroit served as the basis for his opening scenes of Modern Times. Chaplin preventing his co-workers from chasing him by throwing the conveyor belt switch makes a huge visual statement which correlates with Chaplin's views of workers' lives being controlled by economic oppression. Chaplin, the artist unencumbered by daily life, views individuals in The Great Depression (literally) as cogs, in one late scene, in the industrial machine, left behind or replaced at will due to a changing economy. In Modern Times, Chaplin plays the tramp for the final time with his latest female protg: Paulette Goddard stars in her first featured role as the gamin. Chaplin again combines all the known trademarks of his craft into an immensely entertaining experience: Acrobatics and athleticism, allusions to previous films, crisp cinematography, great editing, pantomime, perfect comic timing, sight gags, social commentary, and some pathos. The combination is nearly perfect in a film which often feels not like a feature film but like a series of short films strung together. Several scenarios feature delightful changes in plot and setting, mirroring the necessity for the everyman to adapt to the changing world around him (although not always understanding it or being successful). The tramp is cast as an everyman trying to balance his penchant for protecting pretty girls with maintaining a job in spite of his inability to gel as one of the crowd in the industrial environment. The tramp works in an electric company factory, in a shipyard ever so briefly, as a floorwalker at night in a department store, and again in the factory as an assistant to a mechanic. In between, he spends a few stretches in the hoosegow. He defends the gamin, who tries stealing bread from a storefront. Bit by bit, the tramp and the gamin join forces and realize it's more hopeful trying to make it together in life than by oneself.Chaplin wrote, produced, and directed the film with a keen awareness of American society at the time. The film was released during the height of The Great Depression in 1936, and many aspects of the film speak to that, including the common themes of sticking together under trying circumstances and worker oppression. This is the second film which Chaplin composed the music for at the time of a film's original release. The song "Smile" can be heard multiple times during the film, has been used over and over many times since, and has become a standard in the cannon of great American songs.Highlights of the film include the factory scenes, reminiscent of both Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Rene Clair's A Nous La Liberte a few years before. Modern Times created a controversy between the makers of A Nous La Liberte and Chaplin, taking many years to resolve. The scene where Chaplin inadvertently leads a mob of protesters turned bitterly ironic when over fifteen years later, it was used against Chaplin by those accusing him of having communist and socialist leanings. Chaplin paid for it, informally forced into exile to Europe from which he returned only briefly to receive a special Oscar in 1972. The automation scenes, while highly exaggerated for 1936, turned out to be not so far-fetched in the end. Today we can see this in everyday life, like self serve pumps and checkouts, and not just behind the scenes in factories and businesses. The prison scene serves as a visual metaphor for the working man enveloped by the industrial economy; success may be just as much a result of fate or luck as hard work, just like the reasons for his arrest and eventual release from prison. As the night floorwalker, Chaplin recalls his two earlier films The Floorwalker and The Rink, displaying his extraordinary athleticism on the escalator and with the roller skates.Chaplin sings off the cuff (literally) as a singing waiter in a commentary about sound in films, echoing the public speeches at the beginning of City Lights. Chaplin has always relied on charm, facial expressions, gesticulations, and personality in films. In Modern Times, his message is clear that sound is as intrusive in film as the mundane requirements of the working world are in the lives of us all. He wisely chose to leave sound confined to the music he composed for the soundtrack and the factory's hierarchical communications filtered by mechanical means; an example of this is the big boss looking over the tramp's shoulder in the bathroom from the monitor, berating the tramp to return to work. The big boss also bears more than a passing resemblance to industrial giant Henry Ford. The film ends with one of the most recognizably upbeat scenes in American film history. Chaplin regular, Henry Bergman, makes his last film appearance as the caf proprietor near the end. Chester Conklin plays the factory's mechanic. **** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the mercy of the machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1930s America. The unemployment rate is sky high, the strikes are constant, and the unions and police force are in an undeclared state of war. Adrift in the chaos, the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) wanders in and out of jail, from one short-lived job to another, at the mercy of his nerves and his penchant for explosive accidents. During one of his many run-ins with the cops, he meets up with the gamin (Paulette Goddard) a poor but feisty patron of the streets. In love, in abject poverty, with nothing to hold onto but each other, they struggle to carve out a life for themselves, in spite of the odds and the brutal demands of a slapstick comedy.Unlike City Lights, my favorite Chaplin film, the screwball moments in Modern Times began to feel extraneous, and had me glancing at my watch, waiting to get back to the meat of the story. I've always loved Chaplin, but loved him for his skill as a director and actor, for his uncanny ability to make beautiful women look natural and unadorned, and for his knack at presenting poignant satire without ever sounding preachy, and not because I find him especially funny. The childish romp through the department sore is whimsical, heartwarming, and more than a little forlorn, but less can be said of the Tramp's accident-prone attempts to aid the master mechanic, which, like many sequences in the movie, feels overdrawn, and a little superficial compared to the weightier material it supplants.Sometimes I found myself wondering if the film could benefit from a hack job or two, yet it was never irksome enough to get between the movie and its reputation, for indeed, Modern Times is every bit of the classic it's purported to be. Chaplin was a man of great endings, and the ending of Modern Times ? first its triumph, then its tragedy ? leaves little to be desired. Also great are the opening scenes at the factory, which feel just as creepy today as they must have felt in 1936.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last and Greatest Incarnation of The Little Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well into the sound era of films, Chaplin was not quite ready to abandon The Little Tramp as a child-like mischievous bumbling misfit in his city world. In "Modern Times", the silent era and The Little Tramp return phoenix-like in arguably their zenith. Long after most talkie films released during this time are considered outdated, this film will be looked upon as an entertaining commentary upon disturbing technological and social trends extending well into the future. Although basically silent, with occasional written inserts, sound is sparingly used, though not in dialogue. Among Chaplin's films, it shares with its talkie successor, "The Great Dictator", the distinction of being not just a comedy, but a clear satire on the underbelly of evolving western civilization. In this film, it is the question of whether machines were rapidly becoming the new slaves of men or whether men were becoming the slaves of machines. The inhumanity of working on an assembly line that ever increases in speed is the first target of satire. Lucille Ball would return to this subject in one of her most memorable comedy skits. Henry Ford found that the cure for the astronomical turnover rate of workers on his assembly lines was to pay unheard of wages to his largely immigrant work force. The next target of satire is the invention of mechanical aids that are more trouble and danger than they are worth, or which rob us of our remaining sense of humanity. This is his famous automatic feeding machine comedy scene, one of the most hilarious comedy scenes in the history of film making. Next, Chaplin satirizes the increasing overcomplexity and bodily danger of machines and of life in general. Throughout the film, he mixes routine physical and situational comedy with occasional specialized situations.The Little Tramp is soon fired from every job he lands, whether it's on an assembly line, a construction job, a singing waiter or a mere night watchman. He lands in jail several times, sometimes for his own misdeeds, sometimes for the misdeeds of others. He is a misfit in an age where employees are expected to follow the rules to the letter and to be competent at their tasks. That's why he remains basically a vagrant, at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Each of us knows people who are less extreme versions of The Little Tramp. The Hippies of the later counterculture were rather like Charlie, except they mostly indulged in mind-bending drugs. Like Charlie, they thumbed their noses at the expectations of conventional society, often managing to survive on the throwaways of that society, by sometimes stealing the essentials for living or on occasional odd jobs. In the parting scene, Charlie and his street urchin girl friend(Paulette Goddard) are traveling onward, looking for a way to make their fortune or alternatively for work lives they can live with: something they are competent at, that doesn't maim them or give them a nervous breakdown and that gives them a sense of satisfaction. Most people in western society must travel this road at least once, if not periodically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laughter was a scarce resource in America during the great depression, which lasted nearly ten years from 1929 to 1939. Unemployment was extremely high and many families struggled to get food on their dinner tables. The world's economy was in shambles and many countries were on the verge of war in 1936 when Charlie Chaplin released his silent comedic movie "Modern Times". Just as many of Chaplin's movies he directed, produced and starred in this comedic masterpiece. Similar to his past movies Chaplin uses his "little tramp" character to illustrate the different trials and tribulations many men and women where facing during that time. This is one of Chaplin's first political themed movies. "Modern Times" is a story in which still relates to our everyday lives. As technology improves there will always be people similar to the little tramp character of "Modern Times", just not as hilarious as Chaplin's antics. This hilarious movie follows the Little Tramp as he attempts to find means to survive. Once he is laid off from his factory he is mistakenly identified as a communist protest leader, and quickly incarcerated. The hijiinks continue for the Little Tramp within the prison walls, one such instance was when he mistakenly consumed cocaine during lunch. As soon as the cocaine hits his system lunch is over and the prisoners must return to their cells, while he is being transported from one room to another a prison break erupts and he is once again thrown into the middle of an intense situation and he has no idea. Unknowingly he breaks up the prison break and is award for his brave actions with a pardon, once again he is free man, and however he is still broke, hungry, and homeless. Determined to get imprisoned again where he will receive three meals and a place to stay becomes his number one priority. Instantly his dream to be imprisoned again comes true as a young orphan girl whom is also dearly struggling to survive is caught stealing and as she fled from the police she ran into The little Tramp. He quickly takes the blame for the theft and is arrested. Once released from jail he his re-introduced to the young girl whom had escaped the police. The two of them immediately create a bond between them and vow to do whatever they have to do to survive. Chaplin eventually returns to work at the factory, and even though he's really not good at anything he still makes a valiant effort. His factory career doesn't last long before the workers go back on strike; once again he's unemployed and hungry. He eventually gets a job as a server/ entertainer at a local caf where his young friend is performing at. Similar to all his other professions, Chaplin is thrown into the hectic lifestyle that was prevailing at the time. The increased industrialization and modernization was a huge conflict for The Little Tramp, whom was incapable of adapting. Ultimately he finds his calling, without the intrusion of technology he perfects his natural calling of an entertainer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie Review: Modern Times The movie Modern Times provides a funny point of view about the unemployed people. Charles Chaplin characterizes an unemployed person who tries to stay in jail for life. At the beginning of the movie, he is wrongfully accused of communist and stayed in jail. One day after he is in jail, some inmates try to escape, but Chaplin killed them and saved the policemen's lives. As a result, he is freed from jail. However, he does not want to leave. He did not have a home or place to live. When he left the jail, he met a girl who is also unemployed and poor. He tried to get back to jail, but the girl gets him out of jail. After a couple of weeks, he found a job as a night watchman for a department store. However, he felt sleep at his job and was put back in jail. While he was in jail, the girl found a job as a dancer. After he left jail, he finds a job as a waiter and singer, but the police finds them and they escaped. Finally, they decide to move to another city to find new adventures.The music adds a special touch to the movie. Even though there are hardly any words, the few sentences that are pronounced or written in the movie helps the audience keep up with the story. It is a beautiful story where two people meet and fall in love. They are both poor, but with each other's help they decide to continue and try new adventures. I would have liked to see a happier ending where both will have found a steady job and bought a house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something modern in Modern Times?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Change the film to color, update the wardrobe, give everyone speaking parts, and you got yourself a movie one might think came out last Friday. Modern Times is a whimsical tale of an unlucky man, struggling with the oppressive, impersonal nature of technology and the unattainable "American Dream". Evidence of the film's negative take on technology can be seen in the automated lunch feeder, for which the owner of the factory reluctantly agrees to a demo, in hopes of cutting the costs of needless "break time". The machine inevitably fails and ironically, produces more problems taking up more of the worker's time. Another example is the assembly line, which could arguably be one of the most revolutionary technologies ever made. The assembly line, which requires a worker to know only one piece of the puzzle, thus making the worker replaceable, is portrayed in this movie as mind numbing and monotonous. Even after the worker is finished, he continues the physical motions until he zones back in to reality. If this film were made today, instead of an assembly line we might see cubicles and their anti-social effects on the employee. Maybe there's a scene where an employee requests an icon in "cornflower blue". Or maybe there's a scene that shows the pointlessness of staff meetings and how nothing gets done. Actually, updated versions of this movie have been made. All three scenarios are found in Office Space, Fight Club and the television show, The Office. Although the US is now an information/services economy, the ideal business is still seen as running like a well-oiled machine. Eliminating inefficient practices by maximizing employee output and eliminating service gaps. Although Modern Times is a comedy, specifically physical comedy, the message the creator is trying to send is clear. The negative effects of industrialization portrayed in this film are poignant and moving. These "modern times" only benefit a select few, those at the top. Maybe physical comedy was the creator's only way of getting his message across, knowing that if his film was a serious piece, he might have been ostracized, perhaps worse.John V.

		<fullReview>Modern Times (1936), filmed between 1932 and 1936, it was directed, written, and produced by Charlie Chaplin. This was Chaplin's first film after his successful City Lights (1931). This film is Charlie Chaplin's protest against what is lost from silent films through the sound industry revolutionizing the film industry. There is no traditional voice dialogue in the film - but voices and sounds do originate from machines (e.g., the feeding machine), television screens (i.e., the authoritarian on the screen in the lavatory), and Chaplin's actual voice is heard singing as well as special sound effects are used. Set during the Great Depression, the movie's main concern reflected the millions of Americans in the era - joblessness, destitution, and famine. It had a number of marvelous and memorable scenes that showed the frustrating relationship between man and machine in the Industrial Age and social institutions. The scenes of the Chaplin's character Tramp is alternated between scenes as a factory worker, a shipyard worker, a night watchman, a singing waiter, or a criminal put in jail. The Tramp also deals with various authority figures during his abuses: a 'Big Brother' factory boss, a minister, juvenile authorities, a sheriff, a shipyard foreman, a store manager, etc. Under the overlaid credits, a clock face approaches 6 o'clock. The preface explains the film's topic: "'Modern Times.' A relationship between industry, and individual enterprise - humanity exploring a median between efficiency and happiness." The film starts with an overhead shot of a flock of sheep crowding their enclosure, and rushed through a shaft. Instantly, sheep dissolve into a related overhead shot of industrial workers pushing out of a subway station on their way to work in a factory during their commute. Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin is a milestone film, showing numerous changes in Chaplin's film making. It is also one of Chaplin's most famous films. It contains quite a few first attempts by Charlie Chaplin. It is Chaplin's movie used to make a social remark. It introduced Paulette Goddard, his partner both on &amp; off screen. It is his first true talking film; in keeping with the movie's topic of the dehumanization of society, all of the voices in the film came from non-living sources (radios, a phonograph record, etc.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Modern Times" and the negative effects of modernization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Modern Times" by Charlie Chaplin is a comedy but also a scathing commentary on the effects of modernization on the individual. The movie shows one man and one woman's trials and tribulations during the "Great Depression". "Modern Times" follows the life of the factory worker (Charlie Chaplin) and the Gamin (his wife at the time). The factory worker's life is shown beginning with an incredibly poignant fade from a herd of pigs being corralled down a caged in hallway presumably toward their slaughter to a mass exodus of humans from a subway entrance. This immediately makes one imagine that the humans are exactly like the pigs being led to slaughter, but the slaughter the humans are facing, or so the film espouses, is the slaughter of their individuality. The movie shows all of the workers in the factory toiling very hard to keep up with their grinding jobs as the factory owner sits on his rear and has breakfast and relaxes as he watches the workers through a closed circuit television system. He constantly is forcing the workers to work harder for the same pay. One of the most interesting things done in the movie is having the thing selling the automatic feeding machine be a machine itself. This shows a glimpse into our own future commenting on machines taking our jobs like most jobs at car factories are now done by robots. The factory owner tries out the automatic feeding machine on the factory worker, hoping that the machine would allow him to stretch his worker's days even longer by ending the lunch break. This shows the rich, the factory owner, exploiting the poor, the factory worker, and how the rich continue to get richer on the backs of the poor. Eventually the stress of it all takes its toll on the factory worker and he cracks. The themes of modernization ripping away individuality, the rich exploiting the poor, and individuality sticking out in a bad way continue throughout the movie. You at once laugh at the factory workers exploits but at the same time feel his pain. The comedy shows a less depressing way to look at the problems allowing for a hopeful view for tomorrow and the possibility of finding solutions. The movie has great meaning even today about the injustices of modernization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Who's that goofy looking man with the over-sized suit stuck in that machine?" One would ask catching a glimpse of Charlie Chaplain's Modern Times (1927). Charlie Chaplain, bent and contorted between gears and sprockets, provokes laughs as well as thoughtful insight into man's relationship with technology. This film entices one to consider the conflict between the human body and machines.To stimulate thoughts on man's relationship with machines, Modern Times places the main character, a happy-go-lucky factory worker who inadvertently finds trouble with the law and has difficulty keeping a job, in a variety of awkward situations. In telling his story, the movie exposes themes surrounding industrialization, unemployment, and social stratification. These themes reflect the movie's main point that industrialization can lead to unemployment and a stratified social structure.Industrialization is a major theme in the movie. At a factory, it is obvious that machines play a large role. In fact, it seems that the men are secondary to the machines. The workers do their work based on what the machines do; a machine is even brought in to feed the workers. This is apparent during the main character's struggle to keep up with an ornery conveyor belt. Eventually, the main character finds himself sucked into the machine. Watching a man surrounded by the inner workings of the machine, one cannot help but reflect on the ubiquitous nature of machines in society. Although the machines are helpful, their presence causes hardship amongst many.The increasing use of machines is depicted in the film as a chief cause of unemployment. While trying to find work, Chaplain's character experiences the hardships caused by vast unemployment. A young female friend of his personifies the struggle endured by many who could not find work. The machines are directly connected to unemployment through a newspaper clipping. The clipping reads, "Factories Open: Men returning to work." Were it not for the machines in these factories, men would have no work, but one must remember that it was the machines who put them out of work in the first place.The movie goes on to suggest that machines have stratified society. While many suffer from unemployment because of the machines, others thrive. The president of the factory provides the best example of this. He sits in his office doing puzzles and occasionally shouting an order through a machine. While his workers exert themselves and others starve on the streets, this man has benefited greatly because of machines.Through these themes, one notices the constant conflict between man and machine. Chaplain's character struggles against conveyor belts and escalators and suffers at the hands of an uncontrollable feeding machine. While in a constant struggle with machines not to be replaced, man finds himself in need of them as well. They make his life easier in some cases. Although produced seventy years ago, the social commentary provided in this film raises pertinent questions for today. As machines become "smarter" and more useful, how can man maintain his value?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These are but a few delightful features of the Billows Feeding Machine?Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is a wonderful little film. It is in effect a series of shorts strung together and connected by the two leads, Chaplin's tramp and Paulette Goddard's gamin. The tale is about how the machine age has taken over industry, throwing men on the streets with no jobs or money to keep their families afloat. In a brilliant stroke of ingenuity, Chaplin decides to scrap the idea of making this a "talkie" and allows only machines to have a voice. For instance, if the boss needs to bark orders, he does so through a TV screen and if Mr. Billows needs to explain how his feeding machine works, he plays a record containing his full speech. The sound effects are great and the visuals stunning, especially while at the factory. What its essentially a silent film at its core, Modern Times is so much more. A commentary on technology and the dream of making a home for the ones you love, it is also a very sharp comedy that will have you laughing throughout with its physical gags.During the course of his travels, Chaplin's tramp gets mixed up in some impressive set-piece jokes. From the assembly line shenanigans, to the giant gear trappings, to the feeding machine, inadvertently leading a Communist march, a couple stints in jail, a department store disaster, a dilapidated house, and the struggles of waiting tables, he always finds a way to get out of trouble. With all these things happening, the film can appear a tad disjointed, but as his character continues to evolve and the title-cards give us elapsed time, it still holds together as a complete story. A king of physical laughs, Chaplin never holds back either. His nervous breakdown at the plant shows his dedication to the comedy by being unable to shake the arm motion of his job even when he is outdoors and, of course, the rollerskating stunt later on is impressive. I'd be interested to see how that was shot, either composed post-filming to add the drop, or if he really was that close to the edge.You can't deny the man's gift as an artist. How each vignette plays out is inventive and humorous on its journey. Even the moments with the beautiful Goddard are funny in their own right. Her manic facial expressions and piratelike mannerisms while stealing bananas on the docks during her introduction bring some good laughs. Her character is used pretty much as a straightman to Chaplin's lunatic, but she plays the part well. The dream sequence of the two living in a nice house with fruit hanging at every window is priceless and the final scene at the restaurant is a riot. With her trying to help him out in getting a steady job and him mucking it all up to end up needing to sing in gibberish, it is the best part of the movie.While I feel people of all ages can appreciate the film on its own merits?the comedy is broad and kids will enjoy the stunts and bodily harm stuff?it does contain some adult situations. Besides the Communist march mentioned previously, there is a short scene with Chaplin drunk along with a more lengthy part with him after imbibing some "nose powder." It is never actually labeled as being drugs and the scene could be effective still without knowing what the powder is, so one should not use it as the sole reason to not show it to children. Modern Times is a classic on many levels and has proved so by standing the test of time for seventy years thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Times--Hysterical Yet Substantial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times is a movie that impresses me on so many levels--not only for Charlie Chaplin's comedic genius, his use of dialogue through machinery to hold a deeper context, or the incredibly beautiful and optimistic final shot that seemed to speak to the millions of Americans going through the Depression at that time, but for the way in which Chaplin took on so many varied targets to base his social commentary upon (dehumanization from technology/automation, dehumanization from factories/assembly lines, the Depression, Communism, Big Brother, etc.) and did not allow his film to become bogged down or unfocused. Instead, he was able to craft a relatively simple storyline that allowed him to sling his satirical arrows at the social structures prevalent in the world at that time. And on top of it all, he used his genius slapstick humor to drive these points home.These are the very best types of comedies--ones that make you laugh and are entertaining, but also contain some deeper context about elements of a society just below the surface. It's a refreshing combination to see very funny set pieces (The Tramp trying to serve the man with the roast duck) and scenes where you just marvel at Chaplin's gracefulness (the blindfolded skating scene in the department store) mixed with elements of satirical social commentary (the comparison of a herd of sheep to people going to work by the masses). Especially when compared to the feather-light substance of Chaplin's first short, The Tramp, or even The Jazz Singer, it's remarkable to see American film evolve and develop from a medium whose main goal was to just entertain, into something much smarter and deeper through Modern Times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin Sticks to his Plan, Makes a Silent Film, in 1936 yet! It sure must be Great to own your Films, Studio and be a Founding Partner in the UNITED ARTISTS Corporation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Film by Charles Chaplin as Writer,Producer,Lead Actor,Composer of Musical Score. with Paulette Goddard,Henry Bergman,Tiny Sandford,Chester Conklin,Hank Mann,Stanley Blystone,Allan Garcia,Richard Alexander, etc,etc...... Mr. Charles Chaplin saw himself as a sort of "Champion of the oppressed, the Figting Hero of the Little Guy",a sort of real-life Charles Foster Kane; albeit one with his own motion pictures to use, rather than the mythical newspaper, The Daily Inquirer. To a high degree, this was largely true.His Little Tramp character was indeed a reflection of all of the countless anonymous, ordinary folk who go about their business, day in and day out, looking for no help from government or anyone else. Charlie's character is much more than an image of a man in a story. He is a sort of symbol, often times functioning like an editorial cartoon.Chaplin was also fortunate to have been a man of good business sense, as well as a singularly gifted Actor/Artist/Director/Writer/Composer. He always had a keen interest in Political and Socio-Economic systems, including the then fashionable types of Socialism in the world. This favourite party-time talk fodder was little more than that, in that he was never too willing to open up his check book in order to aid either the Fabian Socialists or Joe Stalin's Gang or whoever else. None the less, this interest would help to categorize him as "an Undesirable Alien", who was refused re-entry into the USA in 1952. As a further indication of his Business Sense, he had the re-release of the gems from his vault coincide with his triumphant return to the United States after 20 years exile.* That's enough of that business. We've all heard it before. Let's get on with the examination and evaluation of this film, this MODERN TIMES (1936).Chaplin definitely was also a champion of another cause, almost one at that. This would be the Silent Movie form. Here was a movie type, previously the only kind, but by now, the mid '30's, that was now old hat, pass, outmoded, old fashioned and all but deserted. Yet Charlie made fine use of the art form of the silents twice in what we will call the "Post JAZZ SINGER (1927) Age". Twice in the decade of the 1930's a Chaplin Feature was made as a Silent, the sound track being used for musical score and some sound effects.In this MODERN TIMES the period viewed by our 1972 audience was then nearly 40 years old. It could be even older in a sense; the period in which young Mr. Chaplin formed his attitudes and opinions would set this story,attitudinally,back to a Pre-World War I society.So, we saw a serio-comic look at Industrialization, Labor Relations, Economic Boom, Governmental "assistence", Red Tape and uncontrollable human emotions of true love and despair(leading to suicide!). In presentation of such matters, the Writer/Director was wise in spreading all the "bitter pills" throughout the story.And the scenario itself is slowly developed. The elements of the story line are given plenty of cushioning. The plot is unfolded in a series of extended situations, using different circumstances, changing settings. It is almost as if there were 5 or 6 2 Reelers contained within this one Supersized Comedy.Whereas this is a Chaplin homage to the Silent Screen, it was also their Swan Song. Sir Charles realized that no one, not even the Little Tramp would or could delay the eventual inevitable for very long. Here are several instances of dialog on the sound track. Other than a fine comical song an dance by the Little Tramp ,the other 3 or 4 occasions of sound all originate in a mechanical devise, Radio, Closed circuit television or phonograph record.So MODERN TIMES bids a fond farewell to not only the silent, but to a style of writing. In his previous films, the rule of thumb was avoid the use of Proper Names for the character in favor of only the descriptive terms of the characters in the story. Hence, we had terms like "a Tramp", "a Gamin", "the Mayor", a Drunk", "a Millionaire", "a Factory Worker", etc., etc. (For some reason "Tiny" Sandford's character in MODERN TIMES rates a name, "Big Bill"!) Chaplin Features made after this generally assigned full names to their main characters, e.g., Henri Verdoux-Charlie's name as the main character in MONSIEOUR VERDOUX(1947).So we, of the Post War Baby Boomer crowd were introduced to Mr. Chaplin's work. This was in a big way utilizing a whole season of screening most of his top features,rather than the viewing of an occasional old, butchered up Keystone Short, sans title cards. This was the story on early Television, and mainly on kiddie shows.The release schedule wenta lika thisa: MODERN TIMES(1936), CITY LIGHTS(1931), THE GREAT DICTATOR(1940), MONSIEUR VERDOUX(1947), LIMELIGHT(1952), A KING IN NEW YORK(1957) and the compilation, THE CHAPLIN REVUE(1959)**. After this series was screened, one could be properly classified as an expert in Chapliniana.As a sure sign of change, Chaplin's Signature Ending of Walking Off, Down the Highway of Life, features a companion. The Little Tramp is joined by the Gamin(Paulette Goddard),as an offering of Hope, but forever altering the Chaplin Film.NOTE* The invitation was from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &amp; Sciences. They gave Sir Charles a Special Oscar for Lifetime Service to the moving picture business. It was at the 1972 Oscars seen on ABC. NOTE** The film THE CHAPLIN REVUE(1959) was a fine compilation of 3 of his short subjects from his tenure at First National Pictures. It consists of SHOULDER ARMS(1918), A DOG's LIFE(1918)and THE PILGRIM(1922). Added footage is shown of super sped up construction of Chaplin Studios, mock "Rehearsing" for the Camera's benefit and original musical score and crisp narration by Mr. Charles Chaplin, himself!This film is highly recommended as a Chaplin Primer for anyone's initial Chaplin experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It will probably be close to being useless reviewing a classic film--especially this masterpiece of Charlie Chaplin, the best comic genius who ever lived. The movie brings back some memories of my theater class under another genius, Professor Anton Juan, who is probably already a legend in the Philippine Theater history. Sir Anton required us to watch Modern Times in order to get insights about basic acting movements. Back then in 1998, it was extremely difficult to find classic films because there weren't any pirated DVDs available. Good thing, a classmate found a video rental shop where classic films in VHS were available to be let. We watched the movie in White Plains, at the house of one of my classmates. Prior to watching the film, we haven't seen any single film by Chaplin. We knew who Charlie Chaplin was but we didn't know any of his works. He was just that funny tramp with a funny mustache known around the world.Watching Modern Times was a revelation for me. It was laugh-out-loud funny yet picturesque and thought-provoking. The film depicts the plight of Man in the modern world of industrialization, where men are like robots literally being winded by gears of monstrous machines or droves of sheep moving side by side aimlessly without a shepherd.It is a story of a factory worker who became jaded by the monotony of his job, tightening the screws of some metal plates. The dreariness of his life messed his sanity and he was sent to the hospital after attacking people with his monkey wrenches and tools. After being released, by pure unlucky accident, he was put into prison after being mistaken as a leader of a strike. Once in prison, he felt that it was much better to live there than out in the streets where people lead miserable lives, jobless, hungry, and desensitized. In and out of prison, he just survived--until he met a woman whom he felt a connection with--then, he started to live.Chaplin brilliantly explores and satirizes the greatest burden of Man: work. As time flies by quickly, Man finds himself unable to keep up with everything happening around him. He feels lost and defeated, realizing how small and unimportant he is in the society.Chaplin's remedy to this universal problem is simple: positivity. For the simple tramp who always sees the bright side of life thrives and survives. The world is one big comedic act. More than any other film, Modern Times was the first film that made me appreciate the language and beauty of film. It made me a film addict, rummaging through various DVD kiosks, looking for classics, searching for beauty.In our modern times, we are trapped in a fast-paced world, jarring with montages and mountains of images, issues and crises that have been unthought of in the past centuries. But as Charlie Chaplin delivers it plainly at the end of Modern Times, the only way to live through all of this is just to... smile. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film I will continue to watch for years and years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everywhere people look, there is someone staring at a machine. Computers have become more popular than they were ten years ago. Gameboys and iPods are constantly used by young people the world over. Even "mom and pop" stores rely on machines. Who predicted that all this was going to happen? One person did in 1936 and his name was Charles Chaplin. The world's greatest director said all this in his best film Modern Times. Obviously predicting the future wasn't Chaplin's only intention. He also wanted to take his beloved Tramp character to bigger and more exciting settings. The gags are important for all of Chaplin's comedic pictures and Modern Times is no exception. Finally, the Tramp was given a real love interest and one who the viewers want Chaplin to get together with. Modern Times stands as not only one of the funniest, but also one of the most important movies of all-time.One of the most famous images from Modern Times is one showing the Tramp in the middle of a group of cogs. What most people don't know is what occurs after, which involves the Tramp becoming crazy and being sent to a mental asylum. This represents something that was happening to factory workers at the time. Chaplin understood the workers' problems and was able to show what was happening to them on screen in a comedic, but respective manner. However, the main reason that Modern Times has become timeless is because it is still relevant in today's society. Technology can be found everywhere nowadays, so much so that people are now obsessed with getting the newest game system or portable video device. Chaplin feared that that would happen and he used his film to show the future decay of society. About a decade before the publication of George Orwell's 1984, Modern Times featured a factory president barking orders and spying at everyone using a television. What is even more impressive is that the television did not enter the world until the 1950's. Now, while Modern Times is a silent film, people are heard speaking, but only from electronic devices showing Chaplin's opinion on the "talkie" revolution. However, since this would be the Little Tramp's final appearance, it was time to give more space for more gags.Charlie Chaplin's short films concerned mostly simple gags repeated throughout its short course. When he made the large leap to feature-length films, he allowed the Tramp character to grow far from what he considered a comedy to be. He had said to Mack Sennett while leaving Keystone Films that all you need to make a comedy is "a policeman, a park and a pretty girl." Yes, Modern Times does have various policemen as well as a pretty girl, but it has moved far beyond the park. Chaplin's wonderful idea to lampoon Henry Ford's assembly line involved him moving the Tramp from the park into the factory. He also renamed him the "factory worker." People are so enthralled by the factory worker's actions due to how well constructed the story is. Chaplin's screenplay is so entertaining and thrilling. This is a story that makes one think and laugh at the same time. Only the Tramp could go through each job and fail miserably, but already be ready for a new adventure involving a new girl.In Chaplin's previous works, the Tramp is mostly seen going after a girl and trying to win her heart. However, there is always an obstacle in the way, whether it be a big bully also fighting for her affection or blindness. In the end, he never does get the girl and walks off into the sunset. For Modern Times, the Tramp and the gamin are a team ready for new adventures. With Chaplin not trying to get together with her, it actually works out better for him. Paulette Goddard's performance is very nuanced and she is a girl the audience likes and was probably the smartest female character in Chaplin's film. The Tramp and the gamin's combined knowledge of hard-knocked life make them fight the oppression of the world. Even when they're down on their luck near the end of the film, the Tramp gives this important piece of information: "Buck up - Never say die. We'll get along!" The Tramp was always not only raising the viewer's spirits, but the characters in his films as well. The gamin was the last character he'd give his advice to and it was probably his best. Anyone down on their luck should have a positive outlook on life, because it won't get better if someone mopes all day long. For those with negative minds will lead a horrible and unhappy life. These are the ideas that people should carry with them everyday.While one of Charlie Chaplin's main intention was to make people laugh, he also wanted to educate viewers about the problems facing people in America. Modern Times is a masterpiece where the Tramp fights depression, gets the girl and makes people have a jolly good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tramp goes out with a bang...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The arrival of sound to films in 1927 (in the movie "The Jazz Singer") was definitely a major turning point in history of cinema, and one that would have enormous consequences in the motion picture industry of those years. Only 2 years after "The Jazz Singer" was released, sound films ("talkies") became the dominant format in cinema, and slowly the silent era reached its end and with it the careers of those who couldn't make the transition. Of course, sound faced harsh opposition from many prominent artists of silent movies like directors Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin, who felt that sound diminished the art of cinema instead of elevating it. Soon, both directors would find themselves forced to get with the times and make the transition, but Chaplin wouldn't quit without a last laugh. 1936's silent movie "Modern Times" would be Chaplin's sweet farewell to his beloved silent era, and with it, to his most famous character: the Tramp."Modern Times" is the story of a factory worker (Chaplin as the Tramp), who works at an assembly line in an enormous industrial facility. The constant overworking begins to take its toll in him and suffers a mental breakdown that sends him to the hospital. After his recovery, he discovers that he is no longer an employee, as the workers are on a strike, and are now marching towards the factory. By a weird series of circumstances, the Tramp is arrested after being confused with a Communist leader, and sent to jail where he spends literally the best time of his life. After being released for good behavior, he finds himself again jobless and on a very difficult condition, so he plans to return to jail as soon as possible; however, his plans will change after he meets an orphan girl gamine (Paulette Goddard), who is living in a harshest condition than his.As usual, "Modern Times" was not only a movie directed by Chaplin, but also written and produced by himself; and once again he returns to his familiar mix of drama and comedy that he had been perfect over the years with monumental classics like "The Gold Rush" and "City Lights". This time however, Chaplin takes a more politically charged approach and fills his comedy with his ideas about the harsh life of factory workers, dehumanization, and the Great Depression. While this often unsubtle use of comedy as an outlet for his ideologies could had been damaging for the story in other writer's hands, Chaplin creates a joyfully optimist and very humanist plot that helps to make easier to enjoy and understand the overtly political tone of the film. The story is written in an episodic form, but it flows with nicely thanks to its nonstop series of excellent gags that keep the fun coming.Visually, the movie is probably Chaplin's greatest artistic achievement, as he extends the themes of his screenplay to the overall look of the film. With a clever use of montage (obviously inspired by Soviet filmmakers) and several nods to German expressionism, Chaplin brings to life his vision of society slowly transforming into a industrialized monster where there is hardly any place for love and happiness. The excellent art direction by Charles D. Hall and J. Russell Spencer is an essential piece for this and it's definitely a highlight of the film, as it truly makes "Modern Times" feel "modern". While for the most part Chaplin manages to keep a good balance between the drama and the comedy of the film, he can't help but fall on excessive sentimentalism, making the film feel a bit too preachy at times.The main cast, as in every Chaplin movie, is remarkable in their performances, and each one of them truly add a lot of their personalities to their roles. As his most famous character, the Tramp, Chaplin here is pure gold and as always, he fills the screen with his charming presence and enormous comedic talent. His body control shines in several scenes of slapstick comedy that are nowadays classics, and he also shows off his total domain of pantomime as he easily transmits the audience that joyful optimism that has become the Tramp's trademark. As the Tramp's counterpart, Paulette Goddard is simply beautiful, displaying a natural charm and freshness that makes her character the Tramp's best sidekick since Jackie Coogan in "The Kid".While this movie was supposed to be Chaplin's first "talkie", he quickly dismissed the idea as he considered that his Tramp character worked better without speaking; so with this in mind the legendary comedian decided to transform "Modern Times" into a hybrid: a "talkie" in the silent era style, where every sound in the film is audible except the human voice. In fact, the only spoken voices that become audible are the ones that come out of machines (radio for example), keeping in touch with the script's themes of humanity trapped by the modern industrial nightmare. This could also be seen as Chaplin making fun of "talkies", as while technically he shot a movie with sound, he faithfully followed classic conventions of the silent era like title cards and specially, the pantomime style of acting."Modern Times" is without a doubt one of Chaplin's best films, and one of the most interesting comedies of all time. While it kind of lacks that naivet that made "The Gold Rush" such an amazing experience, it offers a new and more sophisticated style of comedy. As the last movie of the silent era and the Tramp's final on-screen apparition, "Modern Times" is a timeless classic that even today helps us to remind that despite the advent of the modernization, there's still place for happiness, as in the Tramp's words, "Buck up - never say die, We'll get along." 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many arguments regarding the actual beginning of the modern era because individuals cannot come to a consensus regarding the factors and traits of society which represent the start and the continued progression of the modern era. In Modern Tines, Charlie Chaplain attempts to portray the industrial and technological boom and evoke feelings of resentment for governments and the sponsors of industry by use of satire, comedy, and drama. Although Modern Times is a near-silent film, the core themes, mainly industrial progression and the idealistic deterioration of society, spoke volumes during the Great Depression and even in present day.Modern Times by Charlie Chaplain was the first box office comedy released in the 1930s and perhaps the most marvelous of Chaplain's illustrious works in the 1930s and 1940s. There are several prevalent themes in the movie, the first one being the adverse effects of industrialization and technology. The second is the redundant nature of life as result of technology and over reliance on industry. The third major theme of the movie is the hardships faced by the lower classes during the Great Depression. The major bias presented in the movie is that technology and industry is overwhelmingly negative and will contribute to the downfall of American society.Charlie Chaplain's beliefs lean to the extreme left of the 1930s and 1940s which shared common ideology with Marx and the Communist Revolution. Many Americans felt that American society could not progress in an age dominated by machinery and technology. Chaplain's efforts to downplay the benefits of technology fall short of success because his notions and assertions are depicted on the big screen and not in real life. While the main character was supposed to represent the typical factory working residing in one of the many up and coming suburban areas of the US, the main character was viewed by many critics as a degenerate that was not able to conform to the new standards of society. Even though Chaplain includes plenty of satire, he attempts to contradict the thoughts and notions of modern times by portraying the downfall of the main character. Nonetheless, the film provided much needed comical relief in an age dominated by poverty and hardship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what I thought it was about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not about it being hilarious I just had to watch this movie too. Its about its social ties to the silent era. All the sound effects and voices were done in post. Its about Chaplin making fun of the new talkie movies of that time. He has an evil boss who talks notice. A new machine is made to eliminate the lunch hour. People trying to make more money on people who don't have any. The two main characters that are struggling just to get by never make a sound. Also when Chaplin does finally speak he signs a song to Americans in another language and they love it. Actions speak louder than words and that's what this movie is about. Chaplin pokes fun at the new films and makes a silent movie when they were all but over. Probably one of the 50 best movies ever made for its history, hidden meanings, and subtext.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern Times is the best of all Chaplin's movies. The others being City Lights, Great Dictator, Circus, Goldrush and Pawnshop. Modern Times is a special movie. Genius written all over in it. When Chaplin is doing comedy, I cannot laugh, rather there was an air of amazement at his mesmerizing performance, a thing of greatness not witnessed ever before. Modern Times had many exceptional scenes and my favorites include: The climax dance and the events prior to it where he plays rugby with that roast duck, relieving the ship from the dock, blindfolding himself and skating in a danger zone, The dream scene with Paulette in which he had grapes and apples grown inside his home and a cow that milks himself and, the test he undergoes with the food-machine.Rollie Totheroh's photography is masterful. The movie is my all time favorite and whenever I was not feeling well I'll run it in my DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Times - by a teenager</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always heard of Charlie Chaplin and saw a little bit of City Lights half way through. I was not really impressed and didn't really care. However I was determined to see Modern Times because I wanted to see what the fuss was about. At first, I wasn't really impressed because I didn't understand what they were doing. I also found the first few minutes pretty boring. I was wondering, "I thought he was supposed to be FUNNY." I even thought of calling this review that. I was not laughing. I felt that way until he does his hilarious signature walk, twirling around the jail. I was feeling very tired and sick at the time and I burst out laughing. I rewound it and I laughed again. That was a turning point. I was beginning to love Charlie Chaplin. Not only was I amazed by his comic genius, but his physically daring (or what would seem so) stunts. My dad and I were amazed at it! We had to rewind several scenes to try and figure out how it worked. It just worked perfectly. Another person who I was impressed with was Paulette Goddard. Although I think she wouldn't have been a good Scarlett, I think she is stunningly gorgeous in this. She really has a screen presence and I loved her in this. Yet another thing that was so relevant was the political element. Charlie Chaplin hits the nail on the head about the industrial situation in those days. So here I am, reflecting on this wonderful movie. Although it took me a little while to get into it, I am now a very big Charlie Chaplin fan. His modern genius amazes me. Not only do I love Chaplin, but this wonderfully told story. I am a Chaplin fan for life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was the end of the road for The Litte Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Modern Times" (1936): Charlie Chaplin isn't my favorite comedian from the 20's &amp; 30's. I'm partial to W. C. Fields, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd... Chaplin is a little too stylized and feminine for my taste, but this is an interesting film for a couple of reasons: One, it's presented as though a SILENT film from the earlier days of movies ? yet was more than a decade past silence by then. Two, the sets, costumes, and locations are pure 1936 middle and upper class Art Deco, which is a pleasure to peruse. WHY was "Modern Times" done as a silent? It HAS music and dubbed tracks of all sorts, so it's NOT actually silent, but all the dialog IS, with the old style use of caption cards. I think the film tried to straddle eras and audiences. It was the middle of the Great Depression. People needed laughs, and comfort "food" - so to speak. Presenting a new film in the old style took the audience back to BEFORE the stock market crash of 1929, if for no longer than 90 minutes. I also wonder (and have not researched) if Chaplin, though still famous, was by then something of an anachronism, and could not make the full transition. This WAS the last appearance of his "Little Tramp" character. LOTS of actors lost their careers when "Talkies" came along. They did NOT have good voices. Valentino apparently sounded like a girlie-twirp. Chaplin also got himself into trouble with the Government - OUR "free speech" Government ? by espousing unpopular politics. There are other reasons I enjoy this film: the black/gray/white value range is lovely, and so is the leading lady, a young Paulette Goddard. What a babe! She could easily be Courtney Cox's genetic Great Grandmother. Oh, and I laughed out loud a few times...some of the wit still holds up. You have to hand it to Chaplin ? he directed, wrote, scored...did it all in this film, and THAT'S a serious effort worth respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tramp's Farewell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chaplin's immortal comedy about industrial society is as funny and hard-hitting today as it was back then. His Tramp's constant attempt to find comfort in any way possible (even institutionalizing himself) along with the plight of the orphan girl is yet another example of his perfect handle on comedic drama and how to make people laugh while feeling really depressed at the same time.This movie was made in 1936, long after sound had taken over cinema, and beyond just being a satire of industry and "modern times", it's a farewell of sorts to the Tramp proper. People wanted to know what the Tramp sounded like, and Chaplin knew that his character didn't work in sound, so even though this was made late, it's still silent... except for sound added in primarily to create a feeling of abuse.A few things are turned around this time. Instead of trying to get the girl, the girl gets along quite fine staying with him. But what's most interesting, especially to Chaplin fans, is the finally where the Tramp "sings." Finally the image of sound as oppression is discarded, the Tramp learns to be vocal, everyone loves him and thinks he's brilliant, yet still the world oppresses and he's forced to walk away with the promise that "We'll manage." And we never see the Tramp again.It is quite a powerful film (even while it splits your sides with laughter) and definitely one of his best.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening credits show that Charlie Chaplin was more than just a funny little actor. He wrote and directed this film. He composed the musical score. He even holds the copyright.Brilliant satirical look at industrialized society.Currently, this film ranks #6 on Rotten Tomatoes' "Top 100 Movies of All Time". I've watched every film from #1 to #6. The Wizard of Oz, especially the colorized version, deserves its #1 position. However, I don't understand why "Modern Times" isn't #2. Although I dutifully finished "The Third Man", "Citizen Kane", "All About Eve", and "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", the experiences pained me, and I looked forward to "The End". Not with "Modern Times"--what a pleasure to behold!Interesting notes* Charlie Chaplin gets high on cocaine during the film* The film includes both audio dialog and intertitles* The ending is inconclusive at best, maybe even pessimistic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Satire on the Failings of Modern Society: Last of "The Little Tramp"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness" ? In the opening scene we see a herd of moving sheep which morphs into a mass of humanity (the working class) rushing to work in the early morning. Everyone in the throng is anonymous, like a vision of 1927's "Metropolis." In the president's office of a modern factory, the Electro Steel Company, the magnate occupies himself with a puzzle and reads his newspaper. He turns on his closed-circuit television to check out his workers in the vast complex (yes, TV was already available in the 1930s although its use was limited).Our hero Charlie is struggling to keep up his repetitive job on the incredibly fast endless conveyor belt. What is the uncaring mogul's response on the intercom to the turbine operator? "Mack, section five, more speed!" Charlie, who tightens bolts on a plate, becomes a nervous wreck, and staggers away on break time. There are absurd moments like the Billows human feeding machine, which is designed to feed men fast without wasting time on an entire lunch hour, improving production. Charlie is the guinea pig, and the machine fails (spilled soup, fast- spinning corn, desert shoved into his face). When he returns to work, his foreman is merciless (work, work, work). Charlie is forced on the conveyor belt into the insides of the gargantuan machine, moving along large gears. Although Charlie is helped out, he becomes a madman. Sent to the psycho ward of a hospital, he has his nervous breakdown cured. He is without a job, however. Trying to avoid excitement in a busy city is difficult, especially with fire engines, traffic noise, crowds, etc. Charlie picks up a flag (likely red) that fell from a lumber truck and inadvertently discovers that he is leading a Communist demonstration. He is promptly arrested.In a parallel story attractive Paulette Goddard (a 30-year old gamin, far too old to play a juvenile) steals bananas at a wharf and hands them out to poor folks. She and two younger sisters (the smaller one is Gloria DeHaven, who grew up to be a beautiful actress) are motherless, with the father unemployed. The depression rages and the girls' father dies in a demonstration. The gamin's two sisters are sent to an orphanage. Meanwhile in prison Charlie is exposed to the effects of "nose powder" (cocaine). Subsequently, Charlie thwarts a jail break, an action that first gets him a comfortable cell, and later a pardon. As he is unemployed he does not really want the pardon. While Charlie is walking the city streets, the hungry urchin steals a loaf of bread and runs into him. Charlie and the gamin meet for the first time, and Charlie helps her out of trouble. He takes a fancy to her (as he did in real life). In the meantime Charlie gets a job as a department store night watchman. After hours he lets the waif in, to eat and sleep courtesy of the store (lots of slapstick here, with Charlie floundering on roller skates). Charlie fails after lasting the night and is arrested again.After spending ten days in jail he is released; the gamin is waiting for him. She is thrilled to tell him that she found shelter in an abandoned shack by the ocean. There is more slapstick here: Charlie dives into shallow water; a board falls on his head inside the shack; his chair crashes through the weak floor. When he discovers that factories are reopening, he rushes to one of them and gets a job as a mechanic's helper. The machinery that they work on is as dangerous as they come: huge exposed gears and rollers with no guards or covers (or machinery lock-out procedures in place). The mechanic is soon trapped neck down between gears; Charlie tries to feed him his lunch during the noon break. The message? Machines dominate the working man. Before long the workers strike and there is a riot. Charlie is arrested yet again. Meanwhile our waif gets a job as a dancer in a restaurant/caf. Finally, out of her rags, the gamin looks clean and glamorous. After Charlie is released she helps him get a job at the establishment as a singer/waiter. Charlie passes as a singer, but you just know that the duck dinner will not make it to the customer (more slapstick)! They soon lose their jobs, but Charlie tells the scamp to cheer up. In the last scene, as they walk away together from the viewer along the center stripe of a rural road ? two bindle stiffs ? we hope for something optimistic. What will happen to them? Not only does the Tramp not conform to the modern world, but also Chaplin implies that the deck is stacked against the poorer classes. The waddling vagabond himself has no support system: family or funds or stability. As they disappear into the sunset, we say goodbye to the Tramp for all time. Note that Charlie Chaplin, well into his forties, walks away with a supposed teenager. Of course, in real life that's just what he did; Charlie always liked young girls. For instance, at age 54 in 1943 he married Oona O'Neill, who was age 18. The movie has mostly title cards with exceptions. Talkie sounds (sound effects) - that seem to be dubbed recordings, not synchronized sound - come from the radio, intercom, barking dog, Charlie singing, people clapping (but no speech). Chaplin obviously did not enjoy progress; sound killed The Little Tramp. Yet its lack is not detrimental to this particular motion picture. Chaplin ? writer, producer, director, actor ? made only two films per decade from the 1930s through the 1950s, and only five after "Modern Times." All in all, "Modern times" is so well done that it probably belongs on USA's Top 100 listing along with "City Lights" (1931).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A genius makes this. So it is wonderfully good. Chaplin has seldom faulted and here he is standing at his genius best.So many elements are new in this, the effect of industrialization on humans. The need and greed for money. Craving for love and doing work so as to keep the lover happy. This is one of the most poignant films culturally and on humanitarian terms. Charlie as the Tramp delivers an immaculate performance that is a treat to watch. From being a hero in jail and struggles outside of jail. He comes to terms with the world that has become a flock, like flock of sheep that braze on grass, humans now braze on their new jobs as workers in factories. OK, technically, this is a Silent film, now considering 1936 where the "talkies" have become regular in Hollywood, it seemed somewhat anachronistic. Yet, had the tramp spoke he would have become one among many, a common man and his mystic characteristics might have surfaced and he would have lost his charm. So it was a good thing that it was kept silent just for the sake of maintaining the uniqueness of "The Tramp".There are so many unique things in this film that even today, it would to be tough to scale the magnanimity of the sets involved, the charm of the love story and the simplicity of the humor. Be it a scene where he looks at buttons of a woman as nut and bolts trying to fix them, or his fall into the damp water realizing that it is not a lake or pond. So many moments are beautiful and simple and this is one of the rarest films, that will bring laughter irrespective of time and age. And it indeed brings a tear drop at times too. Emotions are universal, and the better connected they are, more beautiful the film will be. Chaplin knew the art if film making, yes and more than that he knew the art of being a simple human being. What it takes to live a life simply, what goes through a simple man trying to earn his bread. What goes through a lover who is trying to win the heart of a girl. He knew all this so well and many traits of his thoughts have surface in this film, making it a wonderful film and how many times ever I watch this, I never got bored and I never will. To distinctly say that so and so in this film is wonderful would be demeaning the essence of the film. So, everything is superb and I can bet on this for laughs any time. A 5/5 for one of the greatest films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monkey wrench...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES ranks as one of the greatest (and earliest) examples of the sorry plight of the working poor. MODERN TIMES begins with a shot of a clock (a time clock?) before cutting to a shot of sheep being herded along (to their deaths?), followed immediately by a shot of a herd of workers pressed shoulder to shoulder in their haste to get to work. Not exactly subtle, but the point is made. When The Assembly Line Worker (Chaplin) is selected to test an automatic worker-feeding machine (which will allow the workers to continue working during lunch), the contraption proves impractical. Not long thereafter, The Worker has a nervous breakdown and ends up quite literally caught up in the gears of The Machine. He's extricated and hauled away to a hospital. (Which means that he has better health care coverage than I ever did...) No sooner has he been released from the hospital than he's mistaken for a labor leader (a "communist") and hauled off to jail. He does his time, then meets a homeless girl ("the gamin") and they fall kinda sorta in love. He vows: "We'll get a home! Even if I have to work for it." And so it goes, from one f---ed up situation to the next. MODERN TIMES could very well be "rethought" for today's audiences, though I seriously doubt anyone could come close to what Chaplin wrought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Best, No Debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of the modern man, living in a time with busy streets, tiresome jobs and nervous breakdowns. How will he cope? What of the modern prisons and drugs? And of unemployment (between a Great Depression and a World War)? Written by, directed by, produced by, edited by, music composed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. A true genius.The factory is not just "modern" but futuristic in a sense, looking like 1950s and 1960s sci-fi films. There are monitors everywhere (shades of "1984") and gigantic switches and cranks, and robots doing uniquely humanlike things.Chaplin, a socialist sympathizer, was clearly attacking the capitalist system in this film, particularly the idea of the assembly line and how monotonous it is. The film even goes so far as to show ways a company could make men even more like machines -- feeding them in line so as not to need a lunch break.Hooray for the "gamin" (Paulette Goddard), the child of the waterfront who refuses to go hungry! (The film's use of "gamin" is interesting to me for two reasons: one, the word is male, with the female being a gamine; two, it is today a more or less dead word, with the current popular term being "street urchin".) And hooray for Chaplin's dancing, which was just about the highlight of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Human existence and technology have been consistently intertwining with one another. From the initial appearance of the steam engine to the embedded chip under one's skin, automation has portrayed its real facet, that of a persistent evolution which replaces man and his fragility with a more perfect machine and immortality. Is it nonetheless worthwhile? A 1936 Charlie Chaplin anticipates time and science by disputing the benefits of a technological contribution to life as we know it. Forcefully led as sheep into a subway, modern individuals sacrifice their Heimlich for the unknown; a rush towards a new slavery in order to acquire properties that are the fruits of personal fatigues rather than for overabundance. Useless belongings call for even lesser useful belongings, while the prize at stake would be an unconditional submission to a technological yoke that can induce the overpowering twitching of a body to relentlessly continue even when the machine stops. A machine that ought to remain a simple extension of individuals' will or greed, throughout perseverance accompanied by a considerable number of failures and short circuits, slowly takes over and transforms humans into its own prosthesis. In this Deus Ex Machina (ap m&#x113;chan&#x113;s thes) situation, human beings are no longer champions of the Tragedy, but surrender to the solution itself. It is the genesis of a manichaeistic battle between two worlds; one where the desire to remain faithful to senses is only achievable through nonconformity and another that provides means of sustenance only through conformity. The inability to cohabitate both existences becomes unsustainable. Traditional ways of providing food or a roof over one's head become obsolete, and Law itself no longer protects the accidentally defenseless but accuses him, or her, of treason ("the communist").What is one to do? Act like the cabman in Robert Louis Stevenson's short story The Body Snatcher, who shifts from an initial assumption of digging graves and provide corps for scientific purposes, to uncontrollable and impulsive murders? Perhaps abandon ourselves like Dr. David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy) to an emotionless, yet eternal, dimension in a 1978 San Francisco (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 1978)? Or possibly allow a victorious artificial intelligence to facilitate our final transformation into humans' next biotechnological essence, just like HAL 9000 (IBM) did with Dr. Dave Bowman by turning him into a new "Star Child" (2001 A Space Odyssey, 1968)? For what purpose is it all if, in the end, artificial intelligence is moved by the sole aim of resembling Human Kind in its "perfection"? Humanity would then face a situation in which a highly advanced robotic boy name David desires to become human in order to feel his mother's love (Artificial Intelligence, 2001). "Buck Up ? Never say die. We'll get along!" (Modern Times, 1968). Let us walk toward the sunset a little bit longer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's masterpiece is still heartbreaking when viewed today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many are partial to "City Lights", I regard "Modern Times" to be Chaplin's finest film. While both are equal for sheer poignancy, "Modern Times" is more interesting from a cinematic point of view. It is, however, an extremely close race between the two masterpieces. The odd thing is I've never regarded Chaplin as being absolutely hilarious. There's a bunch of other early screen clowns whom I prefer for humor value (such as Buster Keaton, who was always more innovative with the medium anyways). What makes Chaplin work though is his sense of pathos. The little tramp is one of film's most memorable and well-developed characters, an underdog whom the audience always feels sympathy for. Chaplin's sense of anti-authoritarianism (despite these films not being political tracts, the bourgeoisie aristocrats are never depicted in a favorable light) is also enduring.As usual, Chaplin's direction is quite skilled and "Modern Times" may be his most creative when it comes down to pure film-making technique. The combination of silent pantomime with sound is pulled off in a way thats so good no one else really dared to try it. There's several very memorable sequences, especially the ones in the assembly line factory (Chaplin's nervous breakdown is the comedic highlight of the film). As Chaplin's love interest, Paulette Goddard does a serviceable job and is certainly easy on the eyes. Unfortunately for her, like many other Chaplin films, "Modern Times" becomes dated and rather sappy when the little tramp isn't on screen. Still, there are few films are poignant as this one.

		<shortDescription>Modern, or Mean Times?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are among the audiences who have heard some points about the story but do not know how it will be told, you will most probably hope to watch a political and social film which talks in a 'political' way, to not to touch and disturb anybody else, especially anyone with a political and social power. As an accustomed cinema audience, who never expects a Hollywood film to tell about real life, I had prejudices about Modern Times before watching it. But all my prejudices have cleared out with an unexpected astonishment in the first scene of the film: a flock of sheep moving ahead with a strong and obvious oblivion compared to a huge group of labor at a rush hour peak. There could not be a more honest and brave way of explaining such a message: if the modernity, technology and the ambition for more money, that is 'Modern Times' turn the people into industrialized, standard and identical creatures, and make them forget their humanity; the society that they constitute will not be a society, but a herd. Just for this first scene, I can claim that there can hardly be such a film, which knows and explains what it wants to say without any fear of all the world powers watching.First of all, we watch the Modern Times through the life of Charlie Chaplin as the Little Tramp who works in a factory assembly line and the gamine who is terribly poor and has to live in the streets. Between these two, the audience cannot decide which one to have pity for: Tramp is in a better condition compared to the gamine; at least he earns money and has clothes to wear on. The gamine seems to be in a terrible condition with her bare feet and dirty face. On the other hand, she has something that Tramp does not have: her own willpower that she can use to choose what she wants to live. In contrast, Tramp even does not have a chance to go to toilet comfortably, because he is seen as a machine- a part of the assembly line he is working - by the system, and a machine can not go to even a toilet. The system, or the Big Brother as the icon of the system in the film, believe that making the production more effective goes on the way of turning the labor into machines. In his opinion, effectiveness of production only means 'producing as fast as possible'. You can increase the speed of a machine by using its buttons, but what about labor? At this point, the Big Boss chooses to see and behave the labor as machines. The way he gives his orders not physically but through the technology- those big screens and especially in the scene of the feeding machine, we can clearly see the mistake of the system about the labor class: working 'with' the machines does not make them machines.With the fact that Modern Times was shot nine years after the speaking films have started, it becomes even more interesting to see that Little Tramp still does not talk. We cannot say that this film is a totally silent film, because we hear voices and some specific people talking. But these specific people are the ones who have social status and power. Just as in the real life, we can hear only the powerful people of the capitalist system in the film. This is a genius contrast, because this film was made to be the voice of the people- the labor, the poor, the gamine - who do not have the chance to talk in real life as much as the boss, the rich- people who belong to the upper levels of society due to their monetary power. On the other hand, they still cannot talk even in this film, which is their voice. By this way, the Modern Times becomes the 'quiet scream' of those people, which makes this film even more dramatic and stronger. Another contrast is that when we hear the voices of those specific characters, such as the Big Boss and the feeding machine company, we do not directly hear them talking. Their voices come to us through an artificial tool, such as the big screens, the loudspeakers and the radio. As the age of technology, this is another criticism made to Modern Times. With all those tools that are named as technology, Modern Times kills our humanity. It becomes a barrier in front of us that hinders our communication and empathy. That is why the bosses start to see their labors as machines. That is a trick that Modern Times has made us since the day it was born: to kill the consciousness of being a human.To conclude, the movie Modern Times will certainly have its place in the cinema history, as one of the most brave and honest films, which warn the humanity against the danger of 'Modern Times' turning into 'Mean Times', that may bring unconscious, standardized societies full with people who have turned into easily controllable sheep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern Times is the funniest, most outrageos movie ever made by Chaplin. The story is about a factory worker who gets fired from his job and struggles to live in the modern times. Chaplin became the king of comedy in this film. Sadly, this is his last silent movie, but that doesn't mean it's the end of the world, eh? Co-starring: Poulette Goddard (SP?) If you miss this movie, which is my favorite movie of all time, you might miss one of the most funniest movies ever made.PS: In the movie, you might hear people talking, which is recorded from radio, because Chaplin can't avoid talkies after all.Other movies with Chaplin that I don't want you to miss: The Kid, A Woman of Paris, The Gold Rush, The Circus, City Lights, The Great Dictator, Monsiuer Verdoux, Limelight, A King In New York.Don't watch a Countess From Hong Kong, it sucks real bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still very actual&amp;funny!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie from the fist time I've seen it and would watch it for countless times without getting tired. This is what I call flawless&amp;timeless comedy.Yet a comedy of the more serious sort,a somewhat humorous version of a movie symbolically anticipating modernity,in the style of Metropolis or 1984. Instead of depicting this topic in an apocalyptic style,he analyzes the issue in a humorous style,at the same time critical. The story is set in hard(by the way might the title be inspired by Dickens's famous novel "Hard Times"?,Dickens also being a ruthless social critic,both Dickens and Chaplin having grown up in London's most desolate neighborhoods,both having experienced hunger,utter poverty,society's worst parts before they both became rich and famous)rather than modern times,in the time of the Great Depression.Whatever Chaplin stated,the film has a clear social message,the opening scene beginning with a black sheep among white ones,the very next second instead of the sheep you see a very sheepish crowd of busy workers flocking,hurrying to work(needless to say that the black sheep is,of course,the Tramp)-a brilliant symbol standing for the way consumer-society is altering mankind into animal-like,unidentified,mechanized masses. This time the Tramp,again nameless,appears in the cast simply as "a factory worker",but still he is nameless and also unfit for living in an industrialized(or any kind of)society. The way industrialism and modern living is altering our natural self is depicted in various scenes:long after work Chaplin's character compulsively and convulsively repeats the repetitive moments he is daily performing at the assembly-line(criticizing Ford?),the feeding machine: it feeds the worker automatically so he doesn't go on lunch break and therefore he saves time-it just shows how extremely thrifty and greedy capitalist bosses can be to introduce such appliances,and,the most iconic,best remembered scene from this movie when the little fellow is literally turned,twisted among the wheels of a huge and surrealistic industrial machine.Following various mishaps the Tramp is first believed to be a Communist,as a red flag accidentally fell of a truck and as he is following the truck in order to give the flag back he unintentionally waves the flag,attracting the masses of hungry,unemployed,angry people into the streets and into a demonstration(after all this is the Great Depression). In a series of adventures,in which the Tramp is involved,including being jailed,being taken for mad,being employed and then fired,he doesn't much alter his characteristic lifestyle-extremely miserably poor,yet somewhat careless. And he's got a female companion to stand by him,the(also nameless)Gamine,superbly acted by gorgeously attractive then-wife Paulette Goddard,as poor,wild,bohemian,good-humored as he is: they even fancy Paradise together,in a respectable home combining both modern comfort and luxury but also a return to a more natural,country-style living(almost like Biblical Paradise).Then comes my favorite scene from this movie,one of the most funny in movie history,the scene where Chaplin sings gibberish his all time hit the Nonsense song-pity that i don't have the text,I would so gladly sing along!Ironically Chaplin first wanted to sing the original version of it,the than famous hit "Titine" complete with all its lyrics but by not doing so he made film history-as the Tramp has the text written on his cuff which he accidentally lost he has to improvise in front of his audience,singing imaginary words sounding,without actually being so,somewhat French or Italian,accompanied by Chaplin's characteristic gestures,depicting a possible storyline for the imaginary lyrics-later on this scene was copied,without the same wit and fun in many films-for instance,look carefully at the act performed by the wandering entertainers at the hotel from Death in Venice or the carnival scene from Fellini's Vitelloni,where an overlong instrumental version of Titine is played by the band,the effect being,as expected,terribly entertaining and hilarious,matching the mood of the partying crowds,being still the perfect party music in 1953 like it was in 1936(and probably even today).Seldomly a film has captured the essence of consumerism more accurate than this-applying to our today's world more than ever,seldomly a comic has inspired so many other great comics. Should never be forgotten-that is if you need a huge portion of healthy and yet intelligent laughter over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As long as there is unemployment, poverty, or unhappiness in the work force, Modern Times will stand as a truly timeless masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Chaplin's 1936 masterpiece, Modern Times, reinvents its own title. It transcends what were "modern times" in 1936, and it every bit as relevant and powerful in 2005, our "modern times." A story of man vs. machine, individual vs. "the system," and hope in the face of a world that seems to have grown apart from humanity, Modern Times is an inspiration! It is not inspirational because of the laundry list of problems facing our heroes, but because of their unrelenting resilience, their ability to "Smile" at the end of it all. Chaplin social commentary is presented in a satirical, yet optimistic, way, so that we are free to recognize the size of the problems at hand, but never allowed to sink into the hopelessness that such troubles often bring. We are led by Chaplin through a tumultuous time in American history; one of labor disputes, high unemployment, poverty, and despair. Fortunately we are guided by The Tramp, in his final screen appearance, all the way to the light at the end of the long, dark tunnel, his humor and pathos as poignant as ever. Through his phenomenal brand of physical comedy and ingenious directing, we see that all we need to do is smile, and not give in to the world that surrounds us, and we will see a brighter day. An extraordinary film of great power, with a message that should be seen by anyone who has ever struggled through a hard time in their life! A masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Genius: Two Levels of Enjoyment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The irony (to a 16-year-old) of a 1936 film titled "Modern Times" notwithstanding, I can understand why anybody would like or dislike the film. On the surface, it's a black &amp; white feature with scarce dialogue &amp; cheap slapstick humor. I personally don't like slapstick comedy, but I realize that was Chaplin's forte. Besides, coming out of the silent film era, films had very little else to do for humor. Imagine a mute stand-up comedian (amen)!However, there's a second level. The opening title shot establishes that this film concerns the American dream. The next shots show a mass of herded sheep, then a mass of herded people on the street. Later, Chaplin's boss observes an automatic feeder meant to eliminate a worker's lunch hour; this demonstrates the drive for inhuman efficiency. Then, Chaplin meets the gamin, and they dream of a life together; Chaplin describes a dream home to Goddard's character. The film contrasts the ideal with their soon-acquired home, little better than a barn with a lean-to shed. This is a classic example of Chaplin's struggling common man in a time much larger than himself. I could go on, but it's 12:30 AM...Chaplin's ingenuity lay in the fact that he could convey a stark message while simultaneously providing cheap laughs/entertainment. Directors such as Michael Moore fail in that respect; I found Fahrenheit 911 alternating between thought-provoking and ridiculous, but unceasingly difficult to sit through. Perhaps somebody should have written an entertaining drama or satire about an inept president named after some piece of vegetation...well, you get the idea. That's what Chaplin would have done (see: The Great Dictator).</fullReview>

Charlie Chaplin keeps the pace and lightspeed, has you laughing around every corner, and even makesyou feel for some of these charecters, though they aren't very welldeveloped. Chaplin skipped all the rules of cinema with this film,including plot and well developed charecters and personalities.But he pays it off while writing, producing, directing, and starring inthis near silent film about a man who works in a factory butencounters many problems including unemployment, love, jail,and all that jazz. The comedy in this film can be enjoyed by just about everyone,young and old. The film is a landmark in cinema in that it hasbeautiful music, very witty and funny writing, and a likeable leadcharecter. It's hard not to enjoy this film, especially if you are intoslapstick, endless sight gags, and general excitement, no matterwhat is happening. I strongly recommend this film to viewersyoung and old, and hope that you will take the time to watch thisshort and sweet Chaplin film. 9/10</fullReview>

I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good laugh, or in the case of this picture, a million. Although at first when/if you sit down to watch it, you'll think what you're watching is a completely silent movie. Believe me, for a mostly silent film, it's pretty loud.

The boss wanting to maximize production, worker's strikes, drug use, jail life, he has to actually work to make money isn't always true, and life isn't always that grand; where Matchstick Men has a feel good ending that is false here Chaplin ends his film genuinely in a bittersweet ending. It still amuses me how he was locked up in the film for mistakenly being labelled a Communist while in a few years he is prevented from reentering the US.It's worth watching many, many times. And if you have a pair of wrenches in your hand, you will never look at a girl the same way twice.PS I still can't figure how many times he stumbled before getting the roller skating scene just right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often hilarious satire, Chaplin style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times is an excellent film. It is, at heart, a commentary on the capitalist economy. Chaplin focuses on the plight of the working man, and while his message is pretty well always hidden beneath hilarious and inventive gags, it nonetheless remains poignant. He frequently takes pot shots at the greedy factory owner, showing him as unconcerned with the work-conditions of his employees and driven solely by the desire for profit.For me, the film's dual-purpose makes it extra appealing. Being a Chaplin film, it is hilarious throughout, with scenes of Chaplin being forced to eat from an insane feeding machine (to increase productivity), and him inadvertently becoming the leader of a Communist demonstration. The extra appeal comes from its teeth, though. Chaplin obviously had some strong feelings towards the issue of the individual's exploitation at the hands of the corporate machine, and these feelings permeate throughout the entire film. And, best of all, he manages to mix the meaning with the humor so well that often you'll be unsure whether to laugh or to reflect on what the man was saying. My tip is, do both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first Chaplin experience and it blew me away. Most comedies dont stand the test of time and are dated 5 years after they are made, yet this little masterpiece from over 60 years ago is so fresh! It's fast paced throughout and very easy to watch repeatedly. It also includes 2 scenes which must have been considered "risque" in the 30's - The bit where Charlie tries to bolt down the womans nipples, and the Charlies accidental use of a white powder (cocaine , judging by his reaction)while in jail.One of the best comedies ever.</fullReview>

If you aren't a Chaplin fan now, or it's been awhile since you have seen Charlie's escapades, this one is a joy to watch. From jail to the factory and department store between, it's a wonderful ride that touches all of the emotions. You'll have the little "Nonsense Song' from the restaurant end-scene in your head for days..:) Although I am biased when it comes to Chaplin, this is a classic, do catch it..</fullReview>

Anyway, this is Chaplin's most overlooked movie and his best Comedy. Nearly every moment is flawless. The star chemistry between Chaplin and Goddard is outstanding. The visuals are great.

		<fullReview>Chaplin airs his left-wing sympathies in this polemic on the Depression and the rise of automation. At the start we see sheep herded into a run, and then workers emerging from a subway exit - industrial mechanisation is reducing humans to bestial anonymity. The profit motive induces factory owners to treat their employees with callousness. Not only are the workers coerced into repetitious, soulless tasks, but the boss even tries to automate their food consumption. The lunch machine goes wrong, and Chaplin is pointing out that mechanisation is far from infallible, and what is more, utterly absurd when inflicted on human beings. In the film, two men fall into the machine and are 'chewed' by the cogs, metaphorically having their individuality swallowed by the industrial behemoth.In 1927, "The Jazz Singer" had claimed to be the first 'talkie' by straddling the boundaries between silence and recorded sound. When Jolson sings, it is a soundtrack of a prepared recording synched with the action, rather than a rendition of the 'live' studio performance. In the nine years between that and "Modern Times", sound recording and reproduction made enormous technological leaps, but here is Chaplin using the Jolson format of a decade earlier. Recorded set pieces such as the Tramp's song in the restaurant, or the wireless set, or the 'mechanical salesman' are inserted into a soundtrack of incidental music.Nine years after they were rendered obsolete, Chaplin made a silent movie. "Modern Times" even has the old-fashioned caption cards of twenty years earlier: "Her Little Sisters - Motherless!"The real triumph of this movie is the musical score, composed (of course) by Chaplin. It is like a ballet score in feel, with great melodic variety and expressive changes of texture. It includes rhumba and waltz passages, as well as Chaplin's theme tune, "Smile".It's easy to lose count of how many times in the course of the film Chaplin gets thrown in the back of a van. He has a nervous breakdown at work and is chucked into a 'mental hospital' vehicle. Later, he gets the same treatment from the police for being a derelict and is slung in the van twice for leftist activities (a socialist demonstration and a labour strike). Society sweeps up its 'problems' and hides them away. In prison, the authoritarian regime which underpins capitalism on the outside exerts a malign influence on the prisoners, who are forced to stand and march on the spot after their meals. Being in prison is a mirror image of working in a factory. The socialist march and the strike are both violently attacked by the police. The Depression is causing righteous indignation among the lower classes: society is on the edge of open rebellion. The headline on the Tramp's newspaper as he reads in his cell is "Strikes And Riots". Thus Chaplin the socialist makes his points about the burgeoning power of the right.Paulette Goddard as "the gamin" is a delight. She brings an air of freshness to the proceedings, and her expressive face conveys the emotions of each scene very effectively. Whether a 40-something tramp should be taking up with a female juvenile would certainly trouble a modern audience, but perhaps the 1930's was a more innocent age.There are some good gags in the movie. Chaplin does his acrobatic stuff, with the skates and the waiter's pratfalls, not spilling anything on the tray. The scene in the dilapidated shack is rich in cleverly-worked jokes, and the heavy toolbox back in the factory is excellent. The hunting for the shirt cuffs during the song is very amusing. When Chaplin stops work at the sound of the lunch hooter, leaving his boss trapped in the machine, it is a reinforcing of the film's serious theme - that the rigidities of industrial life are distorting our human values.There are few criticisms to be levelled at this pleasant, well-paced comedy. One subjective observation is the 'bee' joke, which Chaplin can't resist including. I personally find it very irritating. If the Tramp is released from custody after ten days, why does he walk to freedom through the door of the police station? Surely he hasn't been held in police cells all that time? The 'Italian' song is somewhat over-indulgent. And if Paulette escaped from the detectives the previous night, wearing her stage costume, how come we see her the following dawn, on a lonely road, wearing a different get-up?These are minor carps. "Modern Times" is a well-made film and Chaplin's tour-de-force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MODERN TIMES is Chaplin's greatest film. In fact, it is one of the greatest films ever made! It stars the great Charlie Chaplin, who also (as usual) wrote, produced, and directed! His leading lady is Paulette Goddard, as the gamin. Henry Bergman is the cafe manager at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, and Chester Conklin is the mechanic caught in the machinery. Stanley Sandford is Chaplin's partner on the assembly line in the factory. Chaplin tells the story of a man who tries to succeed in these modern times. His opening title tells us "Modern Times-a story of individual enterprise, of humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness." This sets the stage for a realistic yet hilarious film about a homeless man who has lost his job at a factory. He meets up with a gamin of the streets. He is convinced to help them get a nice home in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Along the way on the streets, he is put in jail. Then he foils a jailbreak. Then he is set free. Then he is put back in jail. Then he escapes and meets the gamin. Then he gets a job as the night watchman in a department store and is sent back to jail for helping in a robbery during the night. He then meets up with the gamin, who has found a shack on the waterfront for them to live in. Next, the tramp gets a job in a local factory, but only succeeds in creating some havoc. Afterward, he gets into a fight with a policeman and is jailed. Upon release, he finds the gamin working at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, where he gets a job as a singing waiter. He proves a success at singing an impromtu song and dance number, but then the authorities arrive. They have come for the gamin. She has run away from juvenile officers after the death of her father! Together, Charlie and the gamin make an escape. The next morning, they decide to take life as it comes, and they set out down the open road, hand-in-hand. This is a touching finale to this story of technology. It is a classic and should be seen by everyone; not just as entertainment but as an eye-opener about today's modern times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A timeless classic, just as relevant today as in 1936.You have the usual Charlie Chaplin ingredients. First you have the incredibly funny and creative visual comedy. Pure creative genius. Plus you have the usual emotional content. Chaplin's previous classics - The Kid, The Gold Rush, The Circus, City Lights - all had these and are fantastic movies.However, Modern Times trumps all those. Not only is it hilariously funny and bitter-sweet but it has social commentary too. Chaplin takes aim at the dehumanizing effect of factory work, and the general way workers are treated. While the picture he paints makes us laugh, rather than make us angry, behind the comedy there is a lot of truth. This satire is still relevant today. It doesn't have to be factories, it could be any workplace.Superb direction by Chaplin. He is more known for his acting antics and creative scripts but the camera-work here is fantastic.Other than the all-round Chaplin brilliance, the other standout in the movie is Paulette Goddard, who plays his love interest. Beautiful with an endearing waifishness, impishness and sense of humour, she matches Chaplin step for step. (She was to become Chaplin's third wife shortly after the movie was released).An all-time classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Modern Times" would be Chaplin's last silent film stand against the encroachment of talking pictures, which in actuality were almost a decade under way by 1936. It also takes dead aim at the advance of a mechanized age, a modernizing society dependent on speed and efficiency at the expense of humanity. Fritz Lang's austere 1927 film "Metropolis" took a similar approach but with a much darker tone, daring to ask 'Who are the slaves of the machines"? For Chaplin, opposition to that slavery is on display in his comedic, almost manic depiction of factory life and the assembly line. One can't help but notice the influence Chaplin had on later film makers; I immediately drew a comparison to Lucille Ball's hilarious attempt to keep pace at the candy factory, blending elements of Chaplin's frantic pace on the assembly line with the dehumanizing aspect of the Bellows Feeding Machine.A startling aspect of the story line for me was the introduction of the communist element when The Tramp is arrested for accidentally leading a workers' revolt. One doesn't immediately connect the term 'communist' to it's Bolshevik roots dating back to 1917, but it was obviously on Chaplin's mind two decades later.Knowing that he did his own stunts, it was truly amazing to see Chaplin's dexterity on a pair of roller skates. The blindfold scene on the fourth floor toy shop was incredible, and made me wonder what precautions were taken to prevent serious injury in case all didn't go well. Obviously, the man had talents that went well beyond making films.I mentioned that scene from an 'I Love Lucy' episode earlier, but there's another observation I'd like to offer that might have influenced the opening to a popular TV show of the Sixties. In his domestic daydream involving The Gamin (Paulette Goddard), The Tramp is shown walking away from the camera and tripping over an ottoman as he approaches Goddard. One could surmise that Dick Van Dyke took inspiration for his own pratfall gimmick from the master Chaplin some quarter century later. Chaplin's genius would find his ideas being repeatedly recycled under the slogan 'everything old is new again'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I love Charlie Chaplin, I desperately wanted to see this film, and I am glad I did. It may well have a scathing and critical view of an impersonal society, but that does not stop it from being a wonderful film. What I love most about Modern Times is that it is both hilarious and original, and decides to bring a serious message in and a great one it is too.Modern Times is great visually, the cinematography and editing are both excellent and I loved the machines too as well as the stunning ending shot. The sound is also astonishing, as is the direction. Modern Times isn't completely silent, as it does use some rather nonsensical dialogue, which is used very effectively in mocking the characters. The comedy is very well-handled, we laugh at the Tramp's antics and their consequences, but not only we sympathise with the Tramp but there is also a very poignant love story. And I love the music, actually mainly because of the poignant yet hopeful Smile it is my favourite soundtrack in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The performances are great, Paulette Goddard is wonderful to watch but once again it is Chaplin with his faultless comedic timing and physical humour that captivates most.Overall, wonderful, another one of Chaplin's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must now shamefully admit that as a self proclaimed lover of movies,that this is in fact the first Charlie Chaplin film I have viewed from start to finish.I had always been aware of the genius of Chaplin,and had seen him in bits and pieces over the years,but had never viewed a piece of his work in it's entirety.Modern Times made a tremendous impression on me.Chaplin's knack for physical comedy was nothing short of impressive,and his talent did not stop there.In Modern Times,he not only displays that area of his genius,there is romance and a genuine tear jerking sweetness to his character,the Little Tramp that he no doubt displayed in the other films in which he portrayed the character,which I plan to view in the future.Another thing I admire about this film was that it was 1936.Sound had long been incorporated into films by then,yet Chaplin was still displaying his silent magic here,though it isn't completely silent.Chaplin placed sound where he felt it was needed,and even the way he did that was nothing short of genius.If there were a Mount Rushmore for comedians,Charlie Chaplin would indeed have a prominent place on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe not as entirely, artistically fulfilling as City Lights, but it might just be funnier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin is a true master of at least a few things, and all within a specific world that he's created and fully culminates in City Lights and, even more notably in Modern Times: he has running gags all over the place (his 'Tramp' character getting involved in that is), including always being an unintentional klutz by way of too many people or too much to get acclimated to with the machines and other little things in the world, and somehow getting into trouble and being thrown into jail. But there's also a lyricism to it too, a sense of pure whimsy that while it has been aspired to by the likes of De Sica and even Benigni (the former has probably gotten the closest and topped Chaplin's style), has rarely been matched. Modern Times is a very fine example of Chaplin's world, and when I wasn't laughing myself silly, aside from a couple of notable moments with the Gamin, I had a big goofy smile on my face, which in the end is Chaplin's main message (his final words, unspoken of course, are 'come on, smile). No matter what happens, there's always a good heart somewhere in Chaplin's work, probably one of the purest too.While I could argue about which one of Chaplin's great films, this and City Lights, triumphs more on the basis of being more memorable or not in terms of showing the sense of prevailing loneliness and despair, Modern Times ends up working so wonderfully in its comedy and absurdism that I would at least be more inclined to say this film is funnier. Sometimes I couldn't believe how ingenious the touches got, and it often was accompanied with a precursor- I often said a 'oh no, here we go again' before a gag I knew was coming, like when the tramp is eating a meal in prison and puts too much "salt" on his food (really a secret nose powder, a hilarious allusion to cocaine), or when he gets sprayed by the alcohol barrels (while still wearing roller skates he found in the toy story). I also couldn't get enough of the moment when working as the assistant in the steel mill he gets his supervisor stuck in the gears of the machine, only to break for lunch and though not getting him out right away, does do his best to keep the man sated with food. Or a little mishap that sends an unfinished boat sailing off, or getting a chicken stuck in a lamp in the buzz of a restaurant...And so and so forth. Chaplin puts his character- and his lady in the form of a 'Gamin' played brilliantly and charmingly by Paulette Goddard- in the time frame of the title. Not just with what happens at work with the introduction of new technology, and the insanity of the industrial age (another tiny running gag- the tramp can't stop moving his body even after he stops turning the screws), but the social side as well. It's sad that the United States immediately called Chaplin a communist, because for all of Chaplin's sympathies and depictions of the working class in the film, he's always playful in mocking the wealthy and considering the time frame (it was the depression after all, I'm sure more than few could relate to having a shabby house like the tramp and gamin get). There's the sense in the film too of how modern something like a union march or a strike are, and in general I got the sense that Chaplin was out to mock the dangers of going too far with the processes of industrial age and all, and of the added authorities that goes with it, not capitalism itself.Besides, Chaplin's sense of morality is meant to be a given- if one's seen City Lights one can see it even clearer and stronger there. The same poetry of that film might only come out in spurts here, like when the tramp has to sing for the restaurant crowd, or the last scene. But it's really how Chaplin pushes the boundaries of the absurd in a manner that's never meant to be too mean or cruel (even with the police he gets his jabs at them in a playful manner). The use of sound and music are also extraordinary here, as the only time we hear voices, aside from the singing, are through mediums, and also the sounds of gun-shots. There aren't any gray areas in Chaplin's black &amp; white world, but then there isn't any need for them, if anything it would shatter the atmosphere and innocence of the main characters. And even set in the 30s, it hasn't aged much at all; it's very likely one of the great comedies of its time, or any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie Vs The Industrial Revolution!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last silent (not really a 'silent' as such-more on that later)containing the Little Tramp's last film outing. It is a brilliant piece of satirical comedy that ranks right up there with the all-time greats. Chaplin's artistry as a film-maker, intelligence and social awareness was never conveyed so perfectly as it is here.Chaplin's tramp was always an outcast- yet here it is perhaps most obvious and poignant, as 'The Little Tramp' is an outcast fighting the overwhelming force of the Industrial Revolution. 'Modern Times' is brilliant in it's social commentary and nuances. For proof, just look at some of the subtle images used by Chaplin. The opening credits roll, with a a mob of white sheep flowing endlessly towards the bottom of the screen- and a black sheep is seen. Yes, symbolism at it's most obvious yet it's most subtle. Many people I know watch that shot and don't pick up on the importance- yet it is brilliant. Scenes and timeless images of Charlie being bamboozled and flummoxed by machinery serve as reminders of the loss of personality and the individual due to mechanization and capital gain.It isn't really a silent at all- yet it still is. We don't hear normal conversation, but commands given over machines, radio's blaring and the amazing and haunting factory big-screen that must have transfixed and inspired George Orwell somewhat in his novel 'Nineteen Eighty-four'. Sound effects are used for comic effect, and Chaplin's own voice is finally revealed in a nonsense song of gibberish. There is sound, and the Little Tramp does emit noise, yet the mystery and allure of silent film-making still remains.Chaplin's real-life love at the time was his 'Modern Times' leading lady Paulette Goddard, and she plays a feisty, determined 'Gamin' here. Chaplin's infatuation with Goddard is obvious- her character is given a lot more screen time than other Chaplin women. She photographs beautifully here, and her gutsiness is sexually inviting- look at the frank, uninhibited way she attacks that banana! You'll fall in love with her immediately- just one look at that gorgeous grin and I was hooked. Goddard adds warmth and a touching sensitivity to her performance, and she is wonderful in the role- The Little Tramp has found his soul-mate and equal in her, she's every bit the outcast he is. One can imagine the odd little pair marrying and producing a child like Jackie Coogan's 'Kid'.Chaplin's genius can only be done justice in full-length essays, so I'll have to keep it brief and somewhat convoluted here. A few short notes to finish off the piece: -Chaplin's essential theme of survival at all costs is brilliantly (I think I've used that word a hundred times already, but I'll use it again) displayed through the food motif, and the charming and extremely original sequence where the tramp imagines a perfect home for him and his girl. The American Dream of milk and honey, indeed.-Chaplin's mastery of physical comedy in his astonishingly graceful skating and excellent gags involving cigars.- Amazing, timeless score.- Extremely funny takes involving Chaplin being jailed for picking up a red flag (a suspected Communist agitator) and his encounter with 'nose-powder' at the jail are sly social references.-Beautiful ending. Just beautiful. Inspiring, very sentimental- only Chaplin could get away with this brand of sentimentality. Lovely.I can't use enough superlatives to describe this. Just watch and enjoy.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Individual Parts Greater Than the Whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of this movie's most famous images--Chaplin sliding around inside the gears and cogs of a monstrous machine--provides a handy visual to go along with my opinion of the film in general: there are individual cogs that I remember as being brilliant, but when put together they don't make a totally satisfying machine.Unlike "City Lights" or "The Gold Rush" before, or "The Great Dictator" after, I didn't get caught up in the narrative of "Modern Times," and I felt there were longer gaps between the funny bits. However, some of the set pieces in this are hilarious, most notably the scene where Chaplin finds himself strapped into an automatic feeding machine that goes berserk; and a nimble scene on roller skates that showcases his athleticism.Sadly, "Modern Times" was an all too applicable metaphor for Chaplin's place in the film industry. New technologies were beginning to make his artistry obsolete, and the sadness of that is palpable in the film's final shot.I'm recommending "Modern Times" because it's a very good movie. I just didn't think it was as good as some of Chaplin's other well-known projects.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless classic, Chaplin's talking 'silent' film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First we need the definition of a 'gamin', the role that Paulette Goddard plays. (gamin, n : a homeless child who has been abandoned and roams the streets.) Much of Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is a parody on modern manufacturing techniques -- assembly line and efficiency studies, the need to keep up with competition. That was 'modern' in 1936, and it is still modern today. It is interesting that years before commercial television came into use, this movie uses large TV-type screens for the factory boss, who works jigsaw puzzles in his office while workers slave, to monitor his workers, and for them to see him as he gives instructions. So what we have in this little movie is a commentary on working conditions, and a lot of typical Chaplin slapstick comedy. Looking at it fresh, I suspect that Rowan Atkinson got a lot of his inspiration for his Mr Bean character from watching Charlie Chaplin's 'Little Tramp.' Great old movie, but impossible to rate against all the fine movies made since then. Chaplin still preferred his movies 'silent', and most of it is. However, whenever there are announcements in the background, we hear them. When he dances, we hear the shoes slide along the floor. When he sings the improvised song, we actually hear his voice. The whole thing works very effectively.SPOILERS, for my own recollection, don't read any further. OK!? We first see him in a very fast-moving assembly line where is only task is to tighten two bolts as plates pass by. Later we see him on the moving belt, then sucked into the machinery, then he passes through the giant gear wheels. He loses this job, is unemployed, end up in jail and has it pretty good there. Several times, after he gets out, he tries to get back in, it is the best housing and food that he has had. When the girls' father dies her two young sisters are put into homes, but knowing her eventual fate she runs away, and is pursued by the authorities much of the second half of the movie. She and he meet, take to each other, and the movie ends with them walking together, away from the audience, down the middle of a rural two-lane road.</fullReview>

Chaplin succeeds in making a movie of almost 90 minutes of non-stop comedy.The opening sequence in the factory is hilarious and it doesn't fade away until the very end. Each scene is full of funny moments: The heroine scene in jail,the scene in which Chaplin picks up the fallen flag of a truck and while waving with it he finds himself in a parade of communists,the scene in the warehouse where Chaplin shows his acrobatic skills while skating,the scene in the old house where everything goes wrong,the second factory sequence and the grand finale at the cafe where he sings (he speaks!) and dances.Let us also not forget the supporting role by the beautiful Paulette Goddard as the sad orphan.All this together makes Modern Times one of the greatest masterpieces of all time and maybe even the best comedy/slapstick ever made (Busy Bodies and Way Out West,both Laurel &amp; hardy,are also of extreme high quality). An unforgettable movie! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Modern Times", Charlie Chaplin brings his class analysis to the Industrial Revolution. The opening scene shows sheep, to portray how the working class was being turned into such. Then, we see Chaplin in the factory, where he has the most mind-numbing job in the world: tightening two screws together as the products run by on a conveyor belt. To make matters worse, the boss speeds up the machine, and it gets harder and harder to keep up. This regimen eventually causes him to have a breakdown. Meanwhile, a young woman (Paulette Goddard) is forced into homelessness due to some tragic events. After their lives cross paths, they try to help each other through the hard times.It all may sound pretty grim from that description, but it wouldn't be a Charlie Chaplin movie without some humor: he gets cranked through a machine in the factory, he gets mistaken for a march leader when trying to give a truck back its flag, and he accidentally swallows "nose powder", to name a few. It's probably his second best movie behind "The Great Dictator".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin at his best...Paulette Goddard delightful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MODERN TIMES is at its best when Chaplin is doing the sort of physical comedy that is his greatest skill. The factory scenes and the skating scene in the department store are just two of the highlights--but all the way through he combines his physical dexterity with warmth as the Tramp struggles to survive in a world gone mad with new technology.And his partner in this happy excursion is PAULETTE GODDARD, a striking young beauty who a few years later almost won the role of Scarlett O'Hara in GWTW.The print TCM is showing is flawless and there is pure delight in watching Chaplin and Goddard romp through a series of vignettes that come together to produce a well-paced story where no dialogue is needed to tell the simple tale. Keeping the running time down to an hour and a half is an asset here--especially in an age where most major comedies are often told in two hours or more.Chaplin's background music is a good counterpoint to the visuals, although one wishes that one of his themes for the scenes where he cheers up the gamin (and later recorded as a hit song called "Smile"), had been given a more lavish treatment.Trivia note: GLORIA de HAVEN can be seen as Paulette Goddard's young sister. You have to look closely to spot her since she appears to be only 12 or 13 in the role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A delightful film with one great scene after another, Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" is hilarious, thoughtful, and timeless. Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music, and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings, to create a film that is very pleasing to watch. Chaplin's own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard. And the story itself, filled with twists and turns, is a timeless commentary on "modern" life, much of which is applicable to any era.Charlie's "Tramp" character joins up in this one with a lively, orphaned gamin (Goddard) to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fast-paced modern life. Most of their adventures are hilarious, but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age. Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survival.The movie has one great scene after another, from some wild sequences in a steel factory, to a set of sometimes breath-taking antics in a deserted department store, to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe, and many others in between. The settings are done with great care and wit, and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at hand.This is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy. Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give "Modern Times" a try. This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplin's or any other era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern Times exemplifies Depression-era America; a stream of disappointments, tattered dreams and missed chances that attempt to drag the characters down, but are defied by the ever buoyant hope of the American Dream.Scenes from Modern Times aptly capture the mood of America in the late 1930's; men superimposed by sheep shuttled into a waiting line, workers being pushed to go faster and faster, eventually consumed by the very machine they deigned to control. Yet elements of optimism shine through the weary film-Chaplin and his gamin dream of a home of their own, with cows ready to be milked and steaks crackling on the stove. Though their reality-a depilated shack "Is no Buckingham Palace" the two are able to sustain themselves on the "American Dream" of a more secure, fruitful life.Several aspects of the film called to mind a 1984-type reality (Though 1984 was written in 1949, 13 years after the birth of Modern Times) including the large two way screen in the factory, allowing the owner to be "Big Brother" to the workers as well as the police brutality and Ford factory line of men and machine.The film ends appropriately; dusty and bruised from pursuit, hardship and hunger, Chapin and his orphan girl head of hopefully into the sunset, convinced of a better reality awaiting them on the sun's return; a hope shared by many in America's Modern Times</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern Times owes a lot to Metropolis, despite the difference in tone. You can see this especially in the first half, with the giant gears and flywheels of the monstrous factory, as well as the two-way TV intercom the boss uses to give orders.Although there is a lot of serious content - strikes, riots, poverty, police killings - the serious and comic elements blend seamlessly. You never get the feeling you're being lectured about anything, you're laughing too much.The element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger. When Paulette Godard comes into the picture, the tone changes from industrial to romantic. And it must be said that she is one of the sexiest heroines to appear in an American film, more surprising since it's a farce. I'd go so far as to say that Godard out-performs Chaplin in this picture, even if her later career was less notable.You have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failure as a worker, humanist hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could any other actor recycle the same character so many times and make it fresh and insightful each time? I think not. The Tramp (Chaplin) does what most people would really like to do to the assembly line that underpins modern industry that we love for its bounty and hate for its dehumanizing characteristics; he thumbs his nose at it. For that his character pays the price. And, yes, he pays the price for some of the usual perils of 1930s life -- its poverty and its desperation. He takes the blame for stealing a loaf of bread that a damsel in distress has stolen so that she could sate her hunger. Picking up a red flag that has fallen from a lumber truck, he becomes by accident a communist agitator who ends up in jail for what was then a serious crime. He keeps his humanity in a world that punishes assertions of humanity with hunger and humiliation.To put it simply, Charlie Chaplin masters, as no comedian since has, the art of saying as much with the fewest words; insteadhe expresses himself physical comedy that nobody since can imitate. He demonstrates as nobody else could the absurdity of the harsh realities of the assembly line that dwarfed persons in his time -- and that there was still some life to the esthetic of the silent movie. He offers double-barrel laughter: we laugh at the circumstances, but laugh with him, with a twinkle and a trace of a tear. Nobody else has succeeded at that since. Today we see more talking heads, more people resorting to body functions, more self-pity, and lots of four-letter words and blasphemy. Yet it is Chaplin who puts humanity into humor as few others before (Mark Twain? Will Rogers?) and few since could. We laugh with him, and laugh at the things at which he pokes fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguably Charlie's best film. Maybe not his funniest but his best because there's so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly used.Frankly I don't know how the guy did it, being so consistently humorous without using any words. All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplin's genius for mime and situation construction. There ARE some words spoken on screen -- this was his last holdout against talking pictures -- but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another. There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics. And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium, a record player, a radio, a television set. Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country, after which he lived in Switzerland. You couldn't tell he was a Commie from this movie. It comments on its time, of course, the Great Depression, and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people. Management is shown as callus, playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line. There is even a communist demonstration. But it's all played for laughs. One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street. Charlie picks up the flag and waves it, shouting after the truck. As he begins to hurry after the truck, still shouting and waving, a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and he's arrested. Poor people steal, but they only steal food. If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist, because that's roughly what the unemployment rate was. "Modern Times" is no more communistic than, say, "My Man Godfrey" or "Salt of the Earth" or "The Grapes of Wrath." Besides that, Charlie is no classical Marxist. Marxism posited a transition from "false consciousness" (the feeling that one's miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck) to "class consciousness" (the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault). Charlie is no activist. He fumbles every job he gets. The other workers are hardly sympathetic. Charlie's not a working class hero but a black sheep. The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and it's hard to imagine that this was accidental.Actually, Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls. His second marriage resulted from a sixteen-year-old girl's (faked) pregnancy. Paulette Goddard, who became his third wife, maybe and maybe not, was twenty when this movie was made, and Charlie was forty-three. In any case -- boy, if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics. A sure-fire winner for the puritans. (It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind" because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the time.)I don't want to spell out too many of the gags because I don't want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlie's throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob. Charlie looks as if he's strapped helplessly into his seat, but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself. The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington, New Jersey. When Paulette Goddard first appeared, the man on my right chuckled and said, "Now that's a good-looking babe." On my left, my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life. There can be no higher recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Modern Times" begins with a shot of sheep going down a runway followed by a shot of workers entering a factory? Charlie is set down in the midst of industrial civilization, which is dominated by machinery and in which men are organized into mechanical units, Capital and Labor? Charlie's real enemies are no longer the Cop or the Boss, with whom he can always enter into some human relation, but a vast impersonality, invisible and invulnerable? "Modern Times" offered a variety of minor attractions: it featured Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard; it had wonderful gags; it indulged in tricks of sound which came to the very edge of being dialog? But what did the picture mean, what was it trying to say? Because Chaplin charged his usual enormous percentage for it, and because of foreign receipts, "Modern Times" made money, but exhibitors were not happy at the limited audience turnout? For the majority, the new Charlie was too serious; for the minority, not serious enough?Since the picture seemed to be about the dehumanizing effect of machinery, intellectuals called upon Chaplin to join them in reorganizing machine culture to some more human scale of things?Off the screen, Chaplin said nothing? On the screen, his anarchic hostility for any kind of machine culture expressed itself in scenes like that in which Charlie is fed by a machine and that in which, crazed by the assembly line, he runs into the street, his arms moving convulsively like two pistons? Charlie the rebel, Charlie the poet, Charlie the invincibly human, had been turned into a machine?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow, this very old film is particularly modern today and the exaggerations are not really sooo extreme compared with the real world. The humans, enslaved by the machines and by those who control them, become more and more small and insignificant, like the hero of this very funny comedy (one of the best in the history) that speaks about very ugly things in a very amusing way. The Tramp, is not a tramp in the beginning. He has a real job in a modern factory, that almost kills him, as the factory becomes more and more modern. He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job. Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police, who are there to serve and protect the rich. An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this. Even a new job. But honesty is not really enough. Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesn't permit you to make a new start easily.Love gives you wings, or at list hope and the power to continue. A beautiful girl of the streets is more than our hero is asking for and he is ready to do whatever necessary. Even put his safety in danger to take care of her. And she, appreciates this. In the end, when everything is lost once again, all they are left with, is each other and that's all they really need.For the first time is his cinema career, our Tramp will find a girl that will stick with him and support him. (Chaplin obviously felt with Paulette Goddard something that he didn't feel for his earlier women, and I don't blame him).And this story of modern times, like all of Chaplin's films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end. Never is everything lost.With obvious inspiration from Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" and maybe Ren Clair's "? nous la libert", it made the strongest point about THE where we 're going, in all the cinema of the 30's (I think) 8) and with only Marx bros' "Duck soup" being able to stand anywhere close to it. Maybe the most complete, funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art, with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer. If made without a single joke, this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See That Little Man Over There? Remember When No One Was Better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the early-1930s due to the advent of sound (a medium that just never seemed right with him). Chaplin, probably the best film-maker/performer of the 20th Century, did not despair though. He fought back with heart and emotion and by 1936 "Modern Times" was a major box office and critical success. It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change. As a factory worker in the film, Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing U.S. economy. He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard (who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life) and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change. "Modern Times" is one of those films that will put a smile on your face, but it could make you weep just as easily. Chaplin's world was changing (and not necessarily for the better from his point of view) and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted. Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplin's charm in one of his pictures. Their love for one another (even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life) just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heart-warming. Beautifully made, wonderfully written, perfectly performed, smart, insightful and always brilliant, "Modern Times" is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

Being a silent film, all of the humour comes from physical comedy and slapstick which is where Chaplin shines. The technical skill that went into getting certain shots and sequences was just incredible, especially the sequence where Chaplin is sucked into the factory machine and has to navigate his way around all of the different cogs.This notwithstanding the film isn't perfect.

The gibberish singing of the tramp will probably never get old, it's quite sublime.There's also some very cool cinematic tools such as the classic gear scene, which was probably pretty innovative, or the final scene with the tramp and the girl walking towards the camera.

Yet I cannot say the same about the story. Yes it did address many of the era's troubles directly and openly in an entertaining way.

		<shortDescription>Wildly Creative, Unexpectedly Prolix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1936 between "City Lights" (1931) and "The Great Dictator" (1940), Chaplin's "Modern Times" (1936), much like Lang's "Metropolis" (1927) before and Tati's "Playtime" (1967) after, depicts a society whose fabric is largely built on technology that does not liberate, instead enslaves. In Lang the society is infected and fallen, dystopic, but in Chaplin and Tati the society itself seems to be largely unaware of its mechanics, which adds a tragic dimension.In this sense Chaplin and Tati after him are more concerned with the individual's, the outsider's, perception of a world to which the general population seems to be oblivious to. That something's wrong is felt to the core by the poor workers within the factories in this film. It's this hopelessness that leads the Tramp to excel in Vigoan anarchism.Some of the jokes are iconic in their visual creativity, others make use of sound quite brilliantly. What is surprising is how Chaplin takes many of the jokes to their extremes, as the visual gag of the lunch machine plays far too long for my taste, just as the scene with the lady on the bench.This might summarize this film for me: on one hand wildly creative, on the other unexpectedly prolix, perhaps because of its self-awareness.</fullReview>

In Modern Times we see Chaplin's genius at work demonstrated via the character of the Tramp. Between the humorous and controversial scenes at the Steel Factory which seem as a direct jab to progress and the enslavement of men by machines, and the heartwarming scene at the restaurant where the Tramp tries out as singing waiter, Chaplin managed to mix all these elements together and with Paulette Goddard doing a wonderfully good job in the part of the Gamin, he conjures this immortal film which still captivates audiences almost eighty years after its' release. Modern Times is surely the perfect curtain call for the silent movie era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so in essence this movie perhaps is like the just as brilliant French comedy "? nous la libert" but "Modern Times" is a real classic on its own right. To be honest I think that some Chaplin movies and other classic comedies in general are a bit overrated but "Modern Times" always had been a movie which I enjoyed watching."Modern Times" is Charlie Chaplin's protest about the fast growing modern industrial society (seems a like a pretty silly to protest against now days of course). It makes fun of industrialism, with as a result some highly amusing and innovative sequences, when things start to go wrong in the factory, when the tramp starts to loose his mind. This spoof and protest however got him in trouble though, since the American government was not amused by it and labeled him as a communist from that moment on. After that Chaplin left to live for the rest of his love in Switzerland and he never returned to America.Although the movie does feature sound in it, the movie is still shot as a silent movie and also features hardly any dialog in it. It makes this movie of course quite unique and I actually wonder if the movie would had been better if it did feature full sound and more dialog in it. I really don't think so though. Charles Chaplin of course always had been a king of slapstick and silent comedy.Chaplin is in good form in this movie. He shows off his silly antics as his famous tramp character, although in this movie his character is simply listed as 'A factory worker'. His timing and execution is fine as always and provides the movie with moments that will make you laugh, guaranteed. Also Paulette Goddard is fine and looking lovely in this movie. She married Chaplin the same year but then again which co-star didn't Chaplin had a fling with throughout his life.Like so often he also directed and wrote the movie. With this he shows that he not just had a talent for comedy acting but also really for comical writing and directing. For a silent slapstick movie the movie simply features a good and likable story. Also the directing is done with lots of pace and sense for timing.It also has some great looking sets, for factory sequences of course most obviously.A great Chaplin classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic marvel too modern for its times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a single scene in Modern Times which perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the production, one where a blindfolded Charlie Chaplin, essaying his timeless 'Little Tramp' figure for the last time, roller-skates around the top floor of a department store, continually skating perilously close to the edge of a steep drop but each time miraculously changing direction at the last moment, danger averted by a hair. As well as a perfect example of the absurdly meticulous care Chaplin invested in his film-making process and enormous risks he took for his art, the sequence proves allegorical for the film as a whole: breathtaking, dazzlingly beautiful, hilarious and yet always on the brink of a fatal crash, each time veering away at the last moment. Considering all the factors against, it remains astounding that Modern Times works as a film - an almost entirely silent film released several years after talking pictures had permeated the film industry which also proved a daring social critique masked as a silly slapstick comedy. Yet despite what a difficult sell such a film must have been, Chaplin's frantic energy, confidence and eternal courage instead elevate the film into a monumental accomplishment, simultaneously challenging and enormously entertaining, decades ahead of its time, as its ironic title would suggest. Of course, as such it inevitably proved a box office failure, with audiences uneasy about a film seeming to rally communist support for striking workers (an interpretation Chaplin wryly mocks in a sequence where the Tramp is jailed for accidentally leading a worker's revolt), but such an initial failure only served to demonstrate how innovative Modern Times was and remains. For a film appearing to be loosely structured around a series of sight gags, it is easy to mistake the remarkable complexity inherent in Chaplin's masterpiece. The seamless integration of barbed satire of authority and social commentary on poverty into Chaplin's hysterical slapstick were hard worn cinematic traits of his by now, but his critique on the dehumanizing monotony of industrialization and factory work is what generates the real spark, providing a whole new setting for Chaplin's irreverent tramp to wreak havoc and expose the inherent problems of (one particularly witty situation sees the workers, chasing the tramp magnetically dash back to their assembly lines as soon as the lines are turned back on). But every time the depiction of rising poverty and unemployment rates grows too sombre, Chaplin veers the film emotionally off into the opposite direction, perfectly counterbalancing such sobering undertones with astonishing acrobatics, inspired silliness and an ever infectious cheeriness, even in the face of increasing adversity. While poverty may not be entirely avoidable, Chaplin seems to imply, everlasting persistence and optimism are often the best one can do - a potentially overly saccharine message, but from a film which produces such genuine, unfiltered movie magic (the aforementioned roller-skating scene being only one of countless examples) it is difficult to imagine a more fitting culmination.The fanatical dedication of Chaplin pervades every aspect of the production (most of which he personally toiled on) from his subtle but rock steady direction and perfect pacing, to his wonderfully resonant musical score to his usual knack for ingenious setting choices, firmly imbedding the viewer in both unsettlingly realistic dank, dirty depression era streets and one of the worst imaginable industrial black holes. Chaplin's factory setting is a fascinating, albeit grim cinematic marvel, both fantastic and frighteningly real, with horrific machinery no doubt inspired by Fritz Lang's dystopian Metropolis, but serving instead as an unconventional playground, with the nightmarish turning cogs and spewing bouts of steam making for some of the film's best sight gags. Of course to downplay the performance of Chaplin himself would be an unpardonable offence, as the last outing of the delightful Tramp proves arguably one of his most rounded performances. As the tramp is continually hard done by, struggling to survive in an impoverished, industrial nightmare of a world, the everlasting twinkle in his eye and bumbling gait make such a journey a hilariously enjoyable and poignant one instead of a melodramatically downbeat one. Ever hysterical and brimming with cheery pathos, Chaplin's tramp is as much a joy to behold as always, his final appearance truly one for the ages (fittingly enough, his 'last words' are "C'mon - smile!"). Backing up the irresistible dynamo of a lead, Paulette Goddard brings a rawly determined vulnerability and feisty charm to her impoverished female lead, making her infinitely more compelling and likable than the usual starry eyed love interest role. Easily one of his very best (if not singularly best) pieces of work, Chaplin's Modern Times is a masterpiece of film-making, a pinnacle of cinematic comedy and an exuberantly emotional triumph, perfectly blending an underbelly of dark satire and social commentary with irreverent silliness and wit. It is impossible to imagine a more fitting or all around majestic swan song to the tramp's legacy, instantly worth seeing for any viewers unfortunate enough to have not yet experienced it. -10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as sharp as I wanted but the comedy more than covers for this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Industrialisation offers potential for men who are willing to work to make money ? albeit not quite as much money as those they work for will be making but still. The work is there to be had and even the little tramp is gainfully employed. Sadly, a form of RSI sees him have a breakdown and find himself jailed. A series of fortunate events see the tramp foil a jailbreak and earn himself his freedom but life is almost harder on the streets now, with unemployment and crime soaring.Considered one of his classics, Modern Times was of course going to be one of the film that I come one when brushing up on my film education. Opening with a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek caption, the film delivers a story about one of the masses, lost in a world of working to earn enough to get by, where individualism is not encouraged and the pressure to do more with less is always on. Sadly it is a relevant theme more than 70 years later as it was then and I was looking for something sharp from it in this regard. I suspect it was my expectation rather than anything else but I was surprised that it didn't have more in terms of teeth towards authority figures. Instead it takes the softer root of supporting the little guy rather than attacking the big one ? the message of the film appearing to be "don't let the b*stards get you down".So in this area I did not get what I expected, but this was not a "failing" of the film so much as of my expectations of it. In the area of comedy the film does deliver with plenty of wonderfully delivered gags and routines. Of course the classic clips we've all seen are here (Chaplin going through the cogs of the machine) but there are plenty of other moments that are funny. Chaplin's delivery makes most of the material of course. It is testament to his talent that he did the same character so often but yet made it funny every time: his physical work is great. He is well supported by Goddard, who is fresh, charming and gorgeous even in rags, she really makes her character important. Sandford, Alexander, Conklin and others do well with Chaplin to deliver the physical routines.Do I think that Modern Times will wow audiences as it once did? Well, no because it is not sharp enough to build on the laughs. However this is not to suggest the film is not good, because it is very good. The story may lack teeth but it is warming while the routines and gags may vary in regards how famous they are but all very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterpiece for Chaplin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times (1936) **** (out of 4) The Tramp (Chaplin) and an orphan (Paulette Goddard) try to make a happy life even though unemployment is everywhere. I'd probably put this down as Chaplin's funniest film due to three segments, which make me laugh so hard that tears fill my eyes. The first is at the start of the film when Chaplin is on the assembly line and can't keep up. The next and perhaps funniest moment is the food feeder, which normally has me on the floor. The next sequence is the "nose powder" scene when he's in jail. All three of these are among the greatest comedy pieces ever but being Chaplin the film also has its moments of drama and romance. The fantasy sequence where the two dream of a house is brilliantly done as is the ending, which while abrupt, nails its message home. I find it rather amazing that Chaplin, one of the richest people at the time, could capture the heartache and loneliness of being unemployed and hungry. The message of the film about happiness is one that rings quite true as I guess this film will be modern for all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin at his Very Best: A Primer in making classic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Modern Times" is, quite simply, Chaplin at his best. The satire is as fresh and pertinent as it was in 1936. Unlike, "City Lights", Chaplin's brilliant but episodic 1931 opus, "Modern Times" displays a consistent comedic talent; also on display is the common touch that resonated with Little Guys, and which explains why Chaplin is so beloved among the masses. Beginning with the classic "eating machine" scene, and proceeding through the warehouse scene, etc., etc., ending with the classic closing scene of Chaplin and Paulette Goddard walking, optimistically and defiantly, into the distance: This is GREAT Chaplin, and we are all richer for the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One point some reviewers seem to have missed is that Chaplin, recognizing that the public wanted to her him sing, also recognized that intelligible speech would destroy the Tramp. So he set the stage for the Tramp to sing plausible-sounding gibberish. During the song, his acting was of the sort one would expect from a silent actor, not a singing one. His song was thus a parody of the emerging talkies.</fullReview>

Whenever I show modern moviegoers almost any scene from Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, they are busting out laughing. On the surface it's a jab at growing technology, but look at all the food references. Chaplin's lunch at the factory is interupted by first a silly nervous tick, as well as a hideous and lethal "feeding machine". He goes to prison, and his prison-issued slop is tainted with "nose-powder" The newfound love of his life (Real life soul-mate Paulette Godard) is arrested for stealing bread. Chaplin tries to return to prison by not paying for a monstrous cafeteria bill. Him and Godard fantasize about big healthy meals, and finally get jobs in a restaurant. This film would make a great double bill will another classic with a hidden food motif- FRENZY. MODERN TIMES was a classic made during the depression, when people were really starving</fullReview>

It's relevancy lies not in the message that 'technology is dehumanizing'; but rather that people of all times are apprehensive to new technology. I find it funny how we are always scared of technology that is coming, but we are not afraid of technology we already have and use.But hey, whatever the merits of the message in Modern Times, the film is very thought-provoking and it articulates its message very well. On top of that, the comedy is absolutely top-notch. My favorite: the Tramp's encounter with "nose powder."

		<fullReview>This is a superb piece of cinematic genius. The movie kicks off with a harsh comment on modern society as Chaplin combines a shot of sheep with people pouring out of the underground. A nice detail is the black sheep, which can be seen as a reference to the outsider (Chaplin) The strongest points of the film are the visual gags. Chaplin plays with his audience and opens every register of his acting-skills.Technically he uses a variety of shot-techniques without making them too prominent. Especially the fluidity of the movie comes to mind. Notice how he lets scenes intermingle by echoing the pose of the actor. The directing skill can also be detected in the way he avoids the problems connected with filming in black and white:we know the colour of the flag Chaplin is carrying is red, because it was attached to a truck with an extended load. The weak points are that he isn't able to keep up the pace all through the movie. Also his critique on society is not very sharp, and the end is moralizing and too positive. Nice detail: Chaplin's comment on the talkies. He sings a song with nonsensical lyrics, to prove that suggestion is as strong or even stronger than the real thing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very applicable to these modern times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some good analyses of this classic film, so I'll just take on my observations after watching it for the first time here in 2001, 65 years after it was made. I have been rediscovering the classic movies of the past, esp the comedies such as the Marx Bros. This is the first Chaplin I have seen outside of a few short pieces when I was a kid. What struck me is how applicable this movie is to the society of our times. I guess this transcendancy over time period is a sign of any good art. As I watched "Modern Times" I couldn't help but think that living in 2001 seems to actual be old-fashioned if you reflect on the dittohead pundits that rule the airwaves, mega-corporate owned &amp; controlled media, politicians that fire up the masses over religion, Iraqi radar, and the usual sanctimonious hypocrisy to make them forget about how they work harder &amp; longer for less, or other important problems. Heck, insinuating healthcare for the masses in our modern times gets one labeled a "commie pinko" by Rush Limbaugh et al. So can you imagine the reaction in modern times of a group of workers peacefully walking down the street with a guy waving a red flag? They'd have the riot cops out spraying Mace &amp; pepper gas before you can hum a few bars from "Smile." Can you imagine a film with leftist, socialist sympathies being released in these modern times? In makes you wonder which times seem more modern from a human perspective, the 1936 of this film or the 2001 of corporate America?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not bad. But it does not live up to it's place in the top 250. I believe this movie must have been fantastic in the 1930s, but today it just doesn't live up to the ratings. Mostly the film is pretty boring and moderately entertaining as best. Though it has some rather funny, more entertaining and touching parts, but seeing as this is and almost one and a half hour movie, those parts takes up a small percentage of the movie, and most of it is found in the end. Being a silent movie is something that doesn't help either. Seeing as we have had 70 years of good movies with actual voices in them just helps to make silent movies more dull, no matter how good they once were. Though as this being a silent movie, it is beyond expectation.So this is a movie with lot's of boring, but not necessarily bad, parts and a few better parts. it's not badly made, it's just not exciting, funny or entertaining enough. Though it is good for a silent movie, and the film is overall and OK film. But there is lots and lots of other ones in the world of film that one rather spends one and a half hour on.5/10</fullReview>

Watch this movie if you like comedy - any kind of of comedy.As a 1991 born kid, I did not think this would hit home, but it was one of the best comedies I ever watched. It was funny, sad and entertaining. The lack of color did not bother me at all, nor did the lack of sound. It is simply one of the best movies ever, even if it is very old.Charlie Chaplin is an amazing actor. Without voice he conveys so many emotions, so many feelings. If you think you like comedies you should definitely watch this movie.While one would think that "Modern Times" in 1936 would be different from present, it is not so. This movie, while being almost 80 years old, still makes sense, still is relevant.Newer titles usually focus on current things, but this comedy makes you think about our society, how did we get here and so on.I know no other titles that are such timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even it's still appropriate for developing country nowadays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, let's start with make some "time tolerance" for this movie. You know, it was on 1936 when this movie was released and it is a kind of critic for those days. Far from that era, I watch "Modern Times" on 2013, that's actually weird when a teenage like me curious about silent movie. But, that doesn't matter as long as the movie that I watch is a masterpiece or special feature of its time. And Charlie Chaplin, as everybody knows, is maestro for silent film era. He is funny but genius, yes, a best figure of early cinema."Modern Times" is my first Charlie Chaplin's, this is important because first time watching can create a pure impression. Yes, I surprised with Chaplin's impossible yet dangerous scene like skating in the second floor. That scene really makes me thump. Every single accelerated act is honestly weird for me, but sometimes it looks funny with great acting of Charlie himself. Other peculiarity is its absurd scene, like suddenly fallen to river, enter to the heart of machine, and singing also dancing. With some touch of sentimental soul, that's just make the whole film amazing.That's only the outer part of the movie, but the soul of the film is critic for the government, or economic system, especially in the United States of America. Explicitly, you can watch the crowd in front of factory to get a job, and some kind of misjudgment in the real life. What I want to say is even the innocent and kind man like the tramp will suffer if the system is not fit. That's the 1930's America, it's also like the system of developing country nowadays. As the country develops, it meets so many problem that's make many people become a victim. The Tramp is a symbol of poor man struggle with violent world, you must work hard and smart to be the "winner" of your life freedom. I mean freedom of possession, prosperity, and to opine.That's a deep message that is delivered with this complex yet humble movie, "Modern Times". The complication of the system translated by this single comedy film. So fun, so great, so critical. What a hilarious one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe's current Rank: 1/1034 Where to begin? How to describe a film of such beauty, genius and wit? In my opinion, not only the greatest Chaplin film, but the best comedy film of all time, and a contender for the greatest film of all time.This is Chaplin's attack on modern capitalist society ? attack is the wrong word, as Chaplin never attacks, he is too smart and too kind. He holds up a mirror and says, 'isn't this absurd?' We see the factory owner who constantly increases the speed on the assembly line, resulting in The Tramp being unable to stop wrenching things when he has moved off the machine and causing an uncontrollable twitch; there is the automatic dinner machine to prevent lunch breaks halting productivity; the state removing children from a caring sister in a poor but happy home; the homeless being arrested for stealing bread; the police attack on communists (a grim foreboding of Chaplin's later career). You could include all these areas in a social drama and it would be thought-provoking, but Chaplin puts these things in comedy and it is even more powerful. By representing something in drama, the creator is asking 'have you noticed that this happens in society?' But for something to work in comedy, the creator has to assume we all already know these things occur, he's showing that these things are commonplace, and yet they are absurd. There is even the great visual metaphor when Chaplin literally becomes a cog in the machine.But it's not just the social commentary that makes this film great, it's the beautiful sweetness of Chaplin's films that I love. Take the scene when The Tramp and his new girlfriend find themselves a home, a tiny wooden shack on the edge of a swamp, where a broom holds the roof up, and The Tramp enters and states, 'it's paradise!' Or when he attempts to get arrested, so whilst being held by the policeman (off screen) he helps himself to a cigar and hands out chocolate to children, taken from an unsuspecting shopkeeper trying to promote his goods.Then of course, there are the laughs. A few have already been mentioned, but the scene that, for me, is perhaps the funniest in film history, is the dancing waiter. Chaplin writes the words to a song he must perform on his cuffs, only for them to fly off as he swishes his hands in the opening of the song. His delivery is impeccable, he continues the same smile, unknowing of the situation he is about to enter, and the dramatic irony is genius. We know the problem, and our sympathy is with the poor Tramp, but we can't help but laugh. And so he quickly forms a plan to make up the words by stringing together nonsense French and Italian words (maybe others?) for the ignorant crowd, who lap it up. His delivery and timing of the song are perfect. The first time I saw it, I began by laughing so hard, then pausing and just staring as I realised what a feat of cinematic triumph I was witnessing, and then continued laughing hysterically again.If you're someone who doesn't usually watch films from as long ago as the 1930s, I urge you to reconsider and give it a chance, and this is an excellent place to start. There's a quote which I had wrongly believed was from Einstein but the internet tells me is from folk singer Pete Seeger: 'Any darn fool can make something complex; it takes a genius to make something simple.' Modern Times is the epitome of that sentiment, it boils down all the beauty of humanity and the absurdity of society into something sweet, hilarious and moving on the most basic of levels. It's the story of the pursuit of happiness in spite of the world's attempts to derail it, and a statement on the human condition. It is also very, very funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a delightful adventure with The Tramp, one of the most iconic characters ever created in the history of cinema. Charles Chaplin gives life to this factory worker who struggles to adapt to the modern industrial civilization, which is dominated by the intense use of machinery and standardization of work practices. Chaplin does a brilliant satire on the industrialization and modernization of society during the period of the great depression. The film can be truly hilarious and uplifting, but also touching on occasion. Just like in City Lights, Modern Times has several clever gags and they are usually packed with strong social commentary, not being there purely for the laughs. Paulette Goddard is an important companion to The Tramp as they represent together the will to live and perseverance towards all the obstacles in life. One humanizes the other so it's always heartwarming seeing them full of hope and dreams in spite of being in a miserable situation. I am finally getting more familiar with Chaplin's work and I can't wait to tackle his many other influential films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the many remarkable things about Charlie Chaplin is that his films continue to hold up, to attract and delight audiences. His name is enshrined among the greatest geniuses of film. Chaplin's foreword to his picture was dangerously meaningful. "'Modern Times,'" it reads, "is a story of industry, of individual enterprise?humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness." We should prefer to describe "Modern Times" as the story of the little clown, temporarily caught up in the cogs of an industry geared to mass production, spun through a three-ring circus and out into a world as remote from industrial and class problems as a comedy can make it.With "Modern Times," a fable about (among other things) automation, assembly lines and the enslaving of man by machines, he hit upon an effective way to introduce sound without disturbing his comedy of pantomime: The voices in the movie are channeled through other media. The ruthless steel tycoon talks over closed-circuit television, a crackpot inventor brings in a recorded sales pitch, and so on. The only synched sound is Charlie's famous tryout as a singing waiter; perhaps after Garbo spoke, the only thing left was for Charlie to sing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Humble Essay on Chaplin's "Modern Times"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film Chaplin explores the alienation suffered by men in, as the title goes, "Modern Times" in which man is just another cogwheel within a colossal machine -as can be literally observed at the beginning.The movie starts criticizing everyman's role in society: immediately after a shot of sheep passing by there is another one of workmen coming out of the subway for work. Man has become not only unnecessary but just a mere element of that herd unthinkingly going wherever the shepherd (i.e., the leaders) wants to.Chaplin displays strong criticism towards capitalist society for it seeks production alone, leaving worker's well-being aside (even trying to minimize lunchtime by using worker-feeding machines) and splitting work into minute tasks up to the level of driving the protagonist crazy: forced to repeat once and again the sole act of fastening hex nuts he ends up spastic and compulsively trying to fasten anything that might resemble hex nuts (we could say "he's nuts over hex nuts". Easy joke, but I couldn't resist it.) Critique goes on: constant surveillance (even in toilets), bureaucratic management of orphanages (already explored in Chaplin's "The Kid"); fear of freedom (expressed by the main character's willingness of staying in prison for he's much safer and even cozier); Police draconian measures (as seen when a starving kid is arrested after stealing a loaf of bread.) Chaplin employed sound to further elaborate his statement. Thus, even though the film is mainly silent, sound is used throughout its footage with a clear intention: voices are only heard when they come out of mechanical devices, meaning the dehumanization of technology (the president of the factory's voice whenever he speaks on-screen, the recorded disc that accompanies the worker-feeding machine, or the radio in prison.) Sheer differences between rich and poor, or political persecution of dissenting ideas are some other issues related to post-1929 USA's capitalism dealt with in this movie. Something which in turn cost Chaplin being blacklisted due to his alleged communism. Although he always denied these charges, pressure finally drove him out of the USA and to Switzerland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Chaplin six pack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brief review of Charlie Chaplin's last six feature films.A comical take on Lang's "Metropolis" (1927), Chaplin's "Modern Times" opens with the words "a story of industry and individual enterprise, humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness!", an ironic jab at the mantras of industrial capitalism. The film then finds Chaplin reprising his iconic role as "the tamp", a poverty-stricken but lovable outcast whose ill-fitting clothes epitomise, amongst other things, his inability to fit in.The film watches as the tramp struggles to survive in a depressed economy. Like "Metropolis", it satirises labour, management and dehumanising working conditions. Elsewhere life for the worker is seen to be precarious, alternatives to playing the game are but death or prison, giant clocks speak to the daily grid of blue-collar workers, bosses are shown to be obsessed with speed and production, the property class relies on police brutality and all-encompassing surveillance, and the workplace itself is painted as an absurdest torture chamber. The film ends with the tramp on a road, America's future uncertain."Modern Times" made waves when it was released. It was banned in fascist Germany and Italy, then allies of the West, and scorned by those in power in the United States. It was also heavily praised in the Soviet Union and France, particularly by philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merlau-Pony. The film's middle section, which featured Chaplin waving a red flag and unwittingly leading communists and worker unions, would get Chaplin on several government watch-lists.Chaplin followed "Times" with "The Great Dictator". Hollywood studios wanted the film scuttled, so Chaplin financed it himself. It contains two criss-crossing plots, one about a Jewish barber who is essentially persecuted by Nazis, the other about a brutal dictator, a stand in for Adolf Hitler. Funny, scary and sad, the film would rock the US establishment. Hitler was, at the time, a US ally and good for business. What's more, he was viewed by those in power as a tool to destroy communist Russia. For many, Chaplin was a "subverisive" who was "inciting war with an ally". Deemed particularly offencive was a last act speech in which Chaplin urges the people of the world to "love one another", "throw away international barriers" and foster an "international brotherhood". Though deliberately vague, this speech was viewed as inflammatory. Was Chaplin extolling the virtues of the United States or the Soviet Union? Regardless, the US' approach to the conflicts in Europe promptly shifted. It became an ally with Russia, Hitler became the enemy and Germany attacked Russia. In the blink of an eye, "Dictator" went from being sacrilege to prophetic.Chaplin, British, was born into extreme poverty and often found himself sleeping on the streets of London. As such, he identified with his "tramp" character completely, as did millions word-wide, who saw themselves in the tramp: desolate, poor and forever bumbling down life's highways. Prior to shooting "Times", Chaplin would embark on a tour of the world, intent on seeing the effects of poverty. He'd talk to many prominent figures, most notably Churchill, George Bernard Shaw, Einstein and Gandhi.As Chaplin grew in consciousness, so would FBI files on Chaplin. He was put under government surveillance and forced to appear before a Senate subcommittee in 1941 where he was accused of being "anti American" and an "unofficial communist". Many newspapers, including the Times, began a campaign attacking Chaplin, and called for his deportation. In the mid 1940s he was charged with the Mann Act and the FBI would collude with newspapers to smear Chaplin as a sex maniac who "perverted American culture". From here on, conservative political pressure groups would attack each new Chaplin release. Some of his films would be boycotted or outright banned. In 1947 he'd be brought before the HUAC committee.Chaplin followed "Dictator" up with "Monsieur Verdoux". A black comedy, the idea for which came from Orson Welles, the films stars Chaplin as a bank clerk who loses his job and so murders women for cash and land. The film's point is explicit: if war is an extension of diplomacy, then murder is the logical extension of business. And so banking terminology is used to rationalise murder, weapons manufactures are idolised and the poor are condemned for trying to play by the rules of the wealthy. "Numbers sanctify!" Chaplain says, pointing to Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the ruthlessness of post-war capitalism; kill millions and you're a hero.Next came "Limelight", Chaplin's ode to silent film. Elegiac and autobiographical, the film stars Chaplin and the legendary Buster Keaton as two fading comedians. A meditation on time's passing, the film's also relentlessly optimistic; man must assert his will, his desires, no matter how glum the times! The film would be banned from several US theatres. Chaplin himself was swiftly banned from entering the US and several of his assets were seized. He'd live in Switzerland henceforth."A King In New York" followed. It finds Chaplin playing an usurped "dictator" who seeks refuge in America. Also autobiographical, the film pokes fun at various aspects of US culture, its irrational hatred of all things left-wing and the way in which humans are both always branding and refuse to look beyond the political, beyond superficial branding, to tolerate even the slightest bit of difference or dissent. Chaplin's son would play a hilarious anarcho-communist, but the film as whole messily mixed silent gags with sound comedy.Chaplin's "A Countess from Hong Kong" confirms that Chaplin's films were moving from the lower to the upper echelons of society. Here Sophia Loren plays a Russian "tramp" who is taken in by a wealthy politician (Marlon Brando). His worst feature, the film watches as "humane" capitalism benevolently absorbs the "detritus" of Russia and Asia. Chaplin accepted an honorary Oscar in 1972. He received the longest standing ovation in Oscar history.8.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern Times is Chaplin's take on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions that people faced during the Great Depression that hit the world between the 1930s and lasted till the late 1930s or mid-1940s. Charlie Chaplin took the depression and the problems it caused and found a way to make you laugh it off. Modern times is an addition to the classic movies of the last 100 years, as it stands out as one extremely funny movie, that you have to see before you leave the earth.Modern times is a movie done in 1936, that depicts Chaplin's take on the modern world and what industrialization brought with it. Set during the Great Depression era the movie's plot is about how the tramp was coping with the depression and with him was an orphan who too was struggling with the causes of the depression.Our Tramp also discovered that life in jail is better than life outside.Chaplin had long been against "talkie" and his last film before this City Lights (1931) was a silent film and he began preparing for this flick in 1934, and it was supposed to be his first "talkie", but he later abandoned the idea of making a talkie because he felt the world was not ready to hear the tramp talk. The movie does have some dialogue, but that can be found in the early scenes soon after the movie went back to the silent film genre. Nearing the ending there is a scene where Chaplin's tramp had to sing to keep his job, this scene was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard in any movie. The song that the tramp sang (the song is known as The Nonsense Song) was Lo Daniderff's comical song Je cherche apr?s Titine. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie as Chaplin's version of Lo Daniderff's song was all gibberish with the lyrics being a mixture of French and Italian words in a nonsensical manner that it made no sense but his comical gestures tell the story of what he actually meant.The movie's opening scene shows where the tramp was in a factory and he had to keep up with the speed of production, this scene has been used by many filmmakers even Disney and in the sitcom I Love Lucy used the idea.Modern Times, is my 2nd favorite Chaplin movie after City Lights and the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) rated the movie78 in its list of 100. There is no reason why you should not get a feel of one of the best Chaplin's film out there, so find it and watch it.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant comic choreography with a story relevant to this day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I grew up knowing and seeing glimpses of Charlie Chaplin's work, this was my first viewing of a full feature film. I am glad I picked the right movie. I mostly am strict about not watching movies released before 1960s since I neither can connect with them nor appreciate the technology used. But this movie baffled me on both fronts dealing with everlasting topics like employee management, changing times, love and hope bundled in beautifully orchestrated scenes like the blindfolded skating, video teleconferencing and automation. Considering the frame rate, scope size, loud background score, this movie didn't put me off as much as I thought it would with a large help from the screen presence of beautiful Paulette Goddard.A Factory Worker (Charlie Chaplin) works in a large manual assembly line and due to his hypnotic work schedule goes into a temporary nervous breakdown causing havoc in the operations. When sent to jail, due to a freak accident and a bizarre incident ends up thwarting an escape plan by fellow prisoners thus building a rapport with the police. With the outside world crumbling in union strikes, unemployment and hunger, the little tramp seems to be making a good life for himself inside the prison walls. When the day finally comes for his release, he makes up his mind to do something to get back to prison which is when he meets a beautiful but down on her luck young girl A Gamin (Paulette Goddard).Chaplin's entire screenplay revolves around coincidences, pure good or bad luck and how he deals with his positive outlook. Though loud, light hearted and in your face on the outset - the power of human spirit, current political satire and hope are always the underlying themes of most of his movies. The perfection of the finished product is easily seen in most of the scenes which actually looked quite technologically superior for its time. Paulette Goddard looked gorgeous and her pleasing presence elevates the likability of the movie. The background score has some melodious tunes but mostly spoiled by the loudness and acoustic nature of the sound available at the time. The comic choreography is very imaginative and actually has a very solid plot even with very little said.Brilliant comic choreography with a story relevant to this day</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tramp finally speaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half hour might be the best critique anyone ever did on the society of the 20th and maybe 21st century. Chaplin was surely inspired by "Metropolis" here, but evolved the idea and made it understandable for everyone. We all know, Humor is the best way to tell the ugly truth. Even the first picture of the movie with the sheep and the men in the subway is epic.Another reason to see this movie is the sexiest woman I've ever seen on screen. I mean Chaplin always knew to pick his actresses, but this one is just breathtaking. Another reason: his dance and singing at the end of the movie. I really enjoyed that.So, "Modern Times" isn't as funny as "City Lights" or as touching as "The Kid" or as important as "The Great Dictator"(which achieved something, nobody had ever done before. It managed to break Hitlers heart), but I can promise that you will enjoy these 83 minutes of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 64In a way, Modern Times is the perfect conclusion to the Silent Era: a period comedy filled with laughs and a timely message from the godfather of silent film, Charlie Chaplin. Modern Times is Chaplin at his best as the Tramp, out of his realm: in the land of industry. The Tramp struggles to keep up with the automated world (hilariously) in setting after setting. But another layer to the film is its Depression setting, which results in more serious situations. But the end concludes with a line that applies to both angles of the film, the end of his era of work and outside life. The films looks very good: it held up well over time. The short spoken segments remind the viewer that Chaplin chose to make this a silent film. The music, very prominent, is excellent as well. The sets are huge, and I wonder how some of the factory scenes were made.The film is really funny, especially the first act in the factory. The food machine caused me to laugh out loud. Despite the serious overtones, the film is always light and provides countless laughs.Chaplin is excellent, especially with Goddard's Gamin. They're very sweet together, and the ending is very heartwarming.For sure this is the best silent comedy I've seen, a very entertaining film with substance. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could he not get crushed and still tighten the bolts like nothing has ever happened? How could he let his face smashed by a hydraulic mouth-wiper with his head held upright and tight and yet make us laugh? How could he skate with a blindfold and not topple? How could he dive in a billabong which is hardly knee-deep and not have a damaged cranium? How could he throw the cuffs on which lyrics of the song are inscribed and yet sing a song that even extraterrestrial life forms find it difficult to decipher and yet laugh without a hiatus for the entire running time of the movie? How could he make the world in despair laugh at Great Depression? Well, only Charles Chaplin can make you laugh without tickling you physically.If you felt 'Gold Rush' was the best comedy ever made until you watched 'City Lights' and called it the best, be ready to veto the idea after watching this film. While 'City Lights' could make you weep in the end after rib-tickling humor for more than an hour, 'Modern Times' does have a bit of Romance but leaves you with cracked ribs. And the scene at the restaurant in which he waits on tables has to be the superlative of all other scenes in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We saw it last night at a theater that runs "classic movies" from film prints.Paulette Goddard is strikingly beautiful as "the gamin" (="street urchin"). Chaplin is superb and athletic as The Tramp. The roller- skating scene in the 5th floor of the store, where there's a big gap in the floor, and he skates around blindfolded, is as scary as any cliff- hanger. There's another scene in the restaurant, where he's carrying a tray of food, and there's so much crowd activity that he falls and recovers, without tipping the tray or spilling anything.The scene on the assembly line was used in an "I Love Lucy" episode, where she and Ethel are on a chocolate candy assembly line, and it gradually speeds up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's Last "Silent" Film Is A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times is a 1936 comedy film by Charlie Chaplin that has his iconic Little Tramp character struggling to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization. The movie stars Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Stanley Sandford and Chester Conklin, and was written and directed by Chaplin. In addition to producing, directing, writing, and starring in Modern Times, Chaplin also composed its theme song, Smile, which would later be adopted as Jerry Lewis' signature tune.This episodic satire of the Machine Age is considered Charles Chaplin's last "silent" film, although Chaplin uses sound, vocal, and musical effects throughout. Chaplin stars as an assembly-line worker driven insane by the monotony of his job. After a long spell in an asylum, he searches for work, only to be mistakenly arrested as a Red agitator. Released after foiling a prison break, Chaplin makes the acquaintance of orphaned gamine and becomes her friend and protector. He takes on several new jobs for her benefit, but every job ends with a quick dismissal and yet another jail term. During one of his incarcerations, she is hired to dance at a nightclub and arranges for him to be hired there as a singing waiter. He proves an enormous success, but they are both forced to flee their jobs when the orphanage officials show up to claim the girl. Dispirited, she moans, "What's the use of trying?" But the ever-resourceful Chaplin tells her to never say die, and our last image is of Chaplin and The Gamine strolling down a California highway towards new adventures. The plot line of Modern Times is as loosely constructed as any of Chaplin's pre-1915 short subjects, permitting ample space for several of the comedian's most memorable routines: the "automated feeding machine," a nocturnal roller-skating episode, and Chaplin's double-talk song rendition in the nightclub sequence.The picture is grand fun and sound entertainment, though silent. It's the old Chaplin at his best, looking at his best -- young, pathetic and a very funny guy.Also,it is a gay, impudent and sentimental pantomimic comedy in which even the anachronisms are often as becoming as Chaplin's cane.And most of all,One of the many remarkable things about Chaplin is that his films continue to hold up, to attract and delight audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern backward-looking classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In which Chaplin demonstrates his mastery of his medium in instinctively reverting his would-be talkie debut to a mainly silent piece reliant on skilled writing, timing and direction in delivering an indictment of the "modern times" he was living in. It's a brave movie for much more than just flying in the face of the prevailing Hollywood "The Silents are dead" trend, in indicting the soulless dehumanisation of factory-working, imprisonment and on a deeper level the suppression of individualism in society, yet makes its point by making us laugh at all this and more in a succession of hilarious set- pieces reliant on the great man's genius for mime, slapstick and comic invention.Interestingly, the movie does employ some speech, but only from the detached, inhumane factory owner, in an almost eerie prediction of Orwell's "Big Brother" from 1984" penned a full 12 years later. There're also background sound effects and the musical number near the end is given voice too. However Chaplin's little tramp central character and Paulette Goddard's "the Gamin" utter nary a word and indeed old- fashioned title cards are used to convey speech as well as scene-changes.There's little to criticise here other than an episodic feel to the narrative, like so many silent-sketches knitted together, bit when the quality of the sketches are so well-done, this can be forgiven. Even Chaplin's much-criticised over-sentimentality is reined in somewhat (and Goddard never does get reunited with her two younger siblings who are put under the care of the court) with an open-ended finishing fade of the two-against- the-world deciding to take the hard road back to fight for the conventional house-on-a- hill dream of most Americans, all the more so given the background of The Great Depression.Some of the scenes are sheer genius, including Charlie's depiction as a cog in the inner- workings of the industrial machinery, his guinea-pig forced participation in the automated feeding process experiment if a dotty inventor, his foiling of the prison jail-break, the hilarious protest-march, his French song and dance routine near the end and so much more. In fact the only comedic scene which missed its mark for me was the tummy- rumbling scene with the visiting senator's wife. I also liked the more adult humour he introduces to give the lie to his cuddly family image as his traumatised factory-worker looks to tweak the dress-buttons-as-nipples of a passing female's clothing.Chaplin's direction show him at home in combining old-time fixed-camera slap-stick with sight-gags using combinations of imaginative camera-shots. His body movements and facial expressions are wonderful throughout. Goddard is beautifully fresh-faced throughout and successfully acts "older", which thankfully lessens the "cute" factor, if not quite belying the old criticism of his penchant of employing too young an actress as hi female lead.For me then, this movie shows Chaplin confronting the modernising of society (and Hollywood itself) with complete mastery and redoubtable courage, not to mention plenty of laughs too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece; the last of the "Little Tramp" series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Modern Times" was made during the Great Depression era (1929-41) and comments on surviving during that time as well as the dehumanizing effects of mass production assembly line techniques just introduced. If Jon Stewart (of USA's TV "The Daily Show") had made a movie during that era, maybe this is a much gentler version of what he might have created.World-wide, Chaplin was often called the most famous person alive on the strength of his many previous "Little Tramp" shorts and feature silent films. But the modern progress introducing "talkies" in 1927 meant the demise of silent films and of those rich techniques Chaplin had honed for communicating without speech. (This film is a hybrid between being a silent film and a talkie.) Also, just previously (the early 1930s), Chaplin had made a couple round the world trips in which he saw the effects of the world-wide depression and assembly lines in many countries. In the USA, some typical factory conditions of that era were described in a recent (April 2011) NPR report: (Google: "NPR Flint Sit-Down Striker: 'Equal Pay, Equal Conditions' ") Overall, this movie knits together five distinct segments that could be called: factory work; jail time; the night watchman; the waiter; building a life together. The sets for some factory scenes (giant intermeshed gears that swallow and transport people) were astounding; Charlie's waiter scene when he sings made up foreign words while dancing the intended words in pantomime is fantastic; his athleticism and coordination as he skates backwards blindfolded is breathtaking; his anticipation of television monitors is remarkably prescient/ foresighted; and the beauty of Paulette Goddard, (one of his many real-life loves &amp; possibly wives), is striking.The overall message of this film is to find a way to adapt to whatever adversity comes your way and to "smile." Chaplin composed all the music used in the film including the song "Smile" and its music and message often recur throughout. (Google: "Chaplin's 'Smile' Modern Times" for music &amp; words) ("MT" was shown at our monthly "Great Films at the Cathedral" series. We saw the Criterion version of "MT"; this includes a 2nd disk with several earlier "Little Tramp" comedy shorts. Comparing these early slapstick performances with "MT" shows how much work Chaplin put in to refining the Little Tramp's silent but so expressive communication with his audience. If you can watch this version, please do--no flicker, dirt, or extraneous noise.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still great today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of Modern Times until we watched this film in my modernism class. When I saw that we were watching a silent film, I prepared myself for two hours of boredom. I was extremely wrong. This is one of the funniest films that I have seen in a long time. And, not only is this film funny, it also contains a still-relevant theme. The tramp battles with the troubles of the times. This includes hunger, need for a home, unemployment, and public unrest. Due to the current political situation, some of these issues are becoming relevant again today. Another part of the movie dealt with the advancements in technology and factory assembly lines. The tramp is affected by the machine and goes slightly insane. This part of the film is still relevant today due to the huge technology boom that has occurred. Cell phones, laptops, iPods, and electronic books have greatly changed human actions, just as the machine changed the tramp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin was a genius filmmaker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first Charlie Chaplin film. Granted, I'm not sure if it was the best place to start, but, I don't regret starting here.Chaplin has an odd ability among actors, the ability to make an audience smile and laugh. Even when he doesn't appear to be trying to, Chaplin can, and will, put a big goofy grin on your face. I say it's odd for this reason: We're not laughing AT him, we're laughing for him. With him. We want him and the girl to get married, to have a happy life together. They need each other, and we, as the audience, need them to need each other. I think it's odd indeed that we can feel so deeply for a man who never speaks. It's odd and wonderful.Now onto the actual subject of the movie.What Chaplin does with the story is beyond brilliant. The Little Tramp lives in a world of whirring gears and blaring buzzers; a world where the only sounds are those of electronics. Machines are taking over and the Tramp has to deal with it. Then, in the final act of the film, the Tramp gives in, he enters this new world, he becomes a part of it even: He speaks. But it's like your grandfather trying to use a computer for the first time, it's a mess; his "speaking" ends up being a mess of gibberish, words from different languages thrown together randomly to form some strange, beautiful sounding poem. But, like your grandfather trying to use a computer, just at the end he turns back to the old ways: Pantomime and intertitles.He can't give himself over entirely; maybe next time, but not this time. Next time, yeah, yeah, next time.It's a beautiful film about technology and humanity; love and hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this film. As a boy, I didn't much care for the Charlie Chaplin shorts that were shown on TV - not even after I'd had an encounter with him as a schoolboy in Switzerland. He walked past me and said "Bonjour" as I was returning from the village bakery in Glion with some bread and milk for my school colleagues. I preferred Laurel &amp; Hardy. However, the position has now reversed.The film is a series of segments all of which contain amusing sections whether Chaplin is taking coke in prison, roller-skating blindfold in a department store or dancing at a night-club. There was a section that didn't need to be included - the 2nd time the machinery gag was used and the boss's head gets stuck. Paulette Goddard had some good moments, eg, she knows how to get by on the street and it's quite satisfying to see her going to bed in the department store, but I felt that she was too old for the character that she was playing. No way was she a teenager! I found the film funny. It's a love story with hope and it gives us the great message that you can have absolutely nothing and still be happy. Chaplin has converted me. I wish I'd said "Bonjour" back to him all those years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Often referred to as the "swan song" of the Little Tramp, MODERN TIMES is perhaps also the film which most thoroughly examines the various aspects of this character's personality. Equipped with the playfulness which turns him into a child-like creature in our eyes, he does at the same time possess an unquestioned humanity, and is clearly capable of showing affection towards others. True, Chaplin had demonstrated the multi-dimensionality of the Tramp many times prior to this film, but never, I believe, quite on this level; although never mean-spirited, the Tramp can still be quite outrageous to his surroundings, and sometimes prone to take advantage of others. Yet, he is also generally well-intentioned, and this soft spot is made all the more evident after acquainting "the Gamine;" the chemistry between Chaplin and Paulette Goddard may explain, in part, why the Tramp turns into such a full- fledged personality in this film.The seed of MODERN TIMES is reported to have occurred in Chaplin's mind after the comedian was invited to Henry Ford's factories. Although quite certainly invited due to his celebrity status, Chaplin turned out to be more shocked than impressed. Prior to his visit, Chaplin had recently returned from a year-long world tour, and actually considered retiring from making movies; one major reason being that he felt uncertain as to whether he'd be able to enter the world of "talking films." His first production completed after the "talkie" revolution, CITY LIGHTS, had been a huge hit despite being essentially a silent, but Chaplin felt far from convinced that he could sustain his popularity at a time when not only Hollywood, but the whole world had long since greeted synchronized sound on film with open arms. He finally decided to gamble on yet another silent production, albeit with a soundtrack and a few instances of audible talking now and then, not spoken by the Tramp but used whenever devises such as radio were required for in the film.The result is one of Chaplin's finest films. Although often considered a satire, the Tramp and the Gamine display a tenderness into the film which assures that the more thought- provoking moments never appear truly dark or depressing. The Tramp struggles to survive with the Gamine much as he had done with Jackie Coogan in THE KID; however, this instance is interesting in particular because it is Chaplin's very leading lady who is made into his partner for survival. The Tramp is finally united with a woman who is struck at the same level in society as himself. Although we are reminded several times throughout the film that their relationship is not really romantic, but rather has the feel of a sort of friendship, it makes for a fascinating contrast to Chaplin's previous feature films, where the leading lady to a larger degree had functioned as a vessel to the story.Besides Chaplin's ability to make us truly care about the Tramp and the Gamine, MODERN TIMES is also very arguably the comedian's funniest film. One highlight occurs early on in, while the Tramp is still employed in the factory, and chosen as a guinea pig in order to demonstrate a "time-sparing feeding machine." Inevitably, the invention turns out to be disastrous. So much time is spent on installing and repairing it that even a truly slow eater would be more effective. I've seen this sequence a countless number of times by now, but I'm still likely to lose my breath with laughter upon the next viewing. The feeding-machine is a great example of how Chaplin never abandoned a good idea; in his memoirs, he claims that the idea had occurred to him some twenty years before, when he'd briefly considered making a science-fiction comedy. Other obvious highlights include when Chester Conklin is served lunch by the Tramp while being hopelessly stuck in the machinery, or the Tramp's famous Nonsense Song towards the end. However, one should note that many of Chaplin's funniest moments include the small things which one might miss at first; such as when the Tramp, in a daydream he's sharing with the Gamine, with a solemn and proud expression picks a fruit from a tree, only to be told that dinner is served, whereupon he indifferently kicks it away!No doubt about it; MODERN TIMES is still hilarious and touching after all these years. One question hard to ignore, of course, is whether the satire on the industrial world still holds up; I do not quite share Stan Laurel's opinion that Chaplin made this film solely for the sake of comedy, though the plot's potential for great gags was obviously a major motivation. My own response is that yes, also as a satire MODERN TIMES definitely stands the test of time. Do keep in mind that the design of the "factories" in this film were likely seen as ridiculous exaggerations also in the 1930s; thus, it may not be too difficult to accept these as abstractions still able to get a point across to audiences of today. The essence of the madness which Chaplin portrays in these "factories" is highly recognizable. In my opinion, Chaplin does not so much criticize technology in itself; indeed, we are also presented here with examples on how technology has made everyday life more comfortable for many, as seen in the Tramp's daydream. As Chaplin himself experienced great poverty during much of his childhood, he likely recognized this. What rather was on Chaplin's mind, may have been how the employees at the factory were treated as part of the machinery. This may not have been that much of an original idea; but Chaplin's ability to make humor out of it, quite definitely demonstrates his uniqueness.By Chaplin's standards, MODERN TIMES was not such a huge financial hit; it made less money than his previous features, and reviews were mixed. Thankfully, today it is rightfully considered by most to be a masterpiece, and it provides several of Chaplin's most iconic moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Little Tramp's last is one of Chaplin's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1936 film, Modern Times, was the end of an era. Well, not exactly. The era was that of silent films, and the end had taken place nine years earlier with the film The Jazz Singer. By the time of Charlie Chaplain's farewell opus to his iconic "little tramp" character was released, silent films were out of fashion. The film is a commentary of both Chaplin's distaste for industrialized society and a "thumbing of the nose" to the "talkie" film as well. Modern Times' writer, director, producer, and actor Chaplin gives his charming "little tramp" a fine send-off in a film that is not only thought provoking but hilarious as well.The very first frame of the film shows crowds of workers pressing together to go to work in factories, superimposed over them were droves of sheep being herded. The viewer is then taken into a "modern" industrial workplace of controlled chaos. Chaplin works on an assembly line doing the same motion repetitively so that even when he's not working his arms and hand continue their jerking spastic motion that leads to some comical situations. He's later subjected to an automated "feeding machine" that goes berserk. The boss keeps an overbearing eye on everything happening in his factory by way of video cameras. Production keeps getting sped up and there's a building pressure to work harder. It doesn't take long before the little tramp has a nervous break-down (hilariously, of course) and is taken to a hospital. Paulette Goddard (who was secretly Chaplin's wife at the time) is introduced as the impoverished, and soon orphaned, female lead. Chaplain, after having been released from the hospital is arrested shortly thereafter under suspicion of being a trade union leader (and you thought you were having a bad day). He's released and he and Goddard meet by chance when she steals a loaf of bread and he tries to take the blame so he can go back to jail. He wants to go back so he wouldn't have to deal with all that was happening in the world around him. Neither ends up in prison and they begin trying to make a life together in a hectic society in which they don't seem to fit. Similar themes, though not presented quite as outright comically, can be found in the Terry Gilliam film Brazil.Though Modern Times was Chaplin's final silent film, there was some sound and even a few spoken parts. Music played an extremely important part from beginning to end. The music (written by Chaplin) reflected the mood of the characters or the situation in which they found themselves involved. Sound effects were also prevalent. Some were simple sounds of machines, or comic noises used to enhance some comedic situation. The spoken parts in the film were very few. Of those few, all but one of them came from inhuman things such as a radio, a recording, or the factory boss speaking on a large screen.Modern Times was a great farewell to a motion picture icon. Both poignant and witty, the film makes you laugh and think. Many, if not all, of the societal issues Chaplain touched upon are still around today almost 75 years later. The "little tramp" that never seemed to fit in anywhere was able to sing his first and last song on film, get the girl, and walk off into the sunset.</fullReview>

Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film Modern Times takes a different stance by portraying industrialization as one of the casual factor of unemployment during the Great Depression.To begin with, the movie opens with a graphic match between farm animals and factory workers. This aims to show that the workers are living the life of farm animals, which implies unsanitary housing, poor nutrition, and disrespect from those in charge, whether they be farmers or employers. This is further elaborated on when Chaplin is working arduously in the assembly line, where he repeatedly falls behind and gradually begins to loose his mind. Eventually, his condition deteriorates so that the movements of screwing on a bolt become a stereotyped behavior that he is unable to stop during even his lunch break or after he leaves the factory. Consequently, he looses his job and is sent to a mental institution. The efficiency of the machinery is so high that it becomes impossible for an average man like Chaplin to keep up with, making him obsolete to his employer.After recovering in the mental institution, Chaplin is in search of a new job. As he is leaving the hospital, the film cuts to images of automobiles and throngs of people in an urban setting. Not long afterwards, he is wrongly imprisoned as a communist. Both the hospital and the prison represent an escape from the world of fast-paced machinery and waves of people moving in a purposeful and robotic manner. This is evident in that Chaplin repeatedly attempts to be arrested throughout the film so as to escape the harsh reality of unemployment. Keeping in line with its classification as a comedy, Chaplin ironically portrays a mental institution and a prison as more attractive living options for the protagonist than facing the modern industrialized world in which he is unable to find a job.Later in the film there is a quick scene of the Gamin's father, "one of the unemployed," sitting in his empty kitchen, clearly concerned about the livelihood of his family. This is an important, although brief, moment in the movie because it deviates from the comedic tone of the film as a whole. Here, we see the serious impact of unemployment on a family, one whom viewers may better relate to. Due to the nature of the Chaplin's loss of employment, as a viewer we can infer that the Gamin's father has likely lost his job due to modernization. Had the father lost his job due to personal vices or lack of professionalism, Chaplin would have included a man drinking, reclined comfortably in a chair. Instead, Chaplin's use of an unadorned man sulking in a wooden chair shows that the man is more concerned than he is relaxed.Later in the movie, Chaplin finds work at a factory while staying in a rundown shack with the Gamin. The scene begins with a crowd of people outside the factory gates, all waiting to be let in for work. Chaplin has a difficult time learning how to use the new machinery on his first day of work. He accidentally places a co-workers jacket into a machine, destroying a "family heirloom" that was in the pocket. This can be interpreted as the end of older traditions which are being dominated by modern industrialization just as the watch was "ruined" by the machine. Chaplin's co-workers also gets trapped in the machine and despite Chaplin's efforts, he is unable to free his coworker. Defeated and hungry, the co-worker asks Chaplin to feed him his lunch while immobilized in the machine. This clearly illustrates the domination of modernized machinery over human beings.Chaplin's film represents his perspective on the negative effects of industrialization on unemployment during the great depression. Although he makes some good claims, it is important to note that he uses hyperbole of the workers' conditions for comedic effects. For example, workers are rarely completely immersed in work with new technologies without any prior training or introduction to the methods necessary to attain efficiency. Nevertheless, on a whole, Chaplin's Modern Times rightfully earned its acclaim as a "culturally significant" work as deemed by the Library of Congress because it intelligently highlights some of the key downfalls of industrialization?unemployment being the most significant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin ends the silent movie era with strong social commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known mostly as The Tramp's last motion picture, "Modern Times" is physical comedian and gifted writer/director/composer Charlie Chaplin's take on the quickly changing world around him. It's fitting for what's considered his last silent movie and the last hurrah of early Hollywood's most iconic figure and one of the greatest in cinematic history.In "Modern Times" the Tramp is fired from his assembly line job because he literally can't keep up with the grueling speed of his machine, a fantastic introduction to Chaplin's central idea of the breakneck speed of technology. He's even made the guinea pig for a new "eat while you work" machine that breaks during the test, resulting in the film's most comical scene. After surviving jail, the Tramp looks to find a new job, failing multiple times and dodging policemen left and right. Along the way he meets a gamin, a young orphaned woman (Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's then wife) and despite being at the bottom of the barrel, they strive to live in their own house and find work together.Throughout the film, the Tramp and his new gal desperately try and fit into a society that naturally rejects them like bad shrimp. The Tramp looks completely out of place and seems incapable (of course humorously so) of doing even the smallest of tasks, like assisting a mechanic by carrying his tools. But he will not be deterred, his ambition to live the American dream is as strong as every working class American who struggled through the tough times of that era (the film was released in 1936).It's not hard to draw a personal comparison between Chaplin's art form and the struggles of the Tramp in this film either. Silent movies were dying if not dead by the time "Modern Times" was released, but Chaplin was determined to prove that talking pictures were not the only suitable form of entertainment. He proves his point in an ending musical act where the Tramp speaks for the first time but must make up words because he's lost the lyrics. The ending shot is even more hopeful than the entire rest of the film."Modern Times" might not be Chaplin's most hysterical physical humor, but it's certainly one of his most biting social commentaries as well as a somewhat inspiring love story. As wacky as the Tramp might be, we certainly identify with his dream and secretly admire his propensity to act outside of social norms like we ourselves wish were more comfortable doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing but funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern times is a great comedy. Although it is a silent film it's use of sound is one of it's most interesting characteristics. When a man comes in to sell his new invention a record like devise plays the sound of a man speaking. Electrical sounds are heard playing in the background. It has got to be the only time I have seen something like this done. Normally there are just sound effects and not voices.The machine in this scene also is an object that creates one of the most comedic moments in the film. As a factory worker (played by Charlie Chaplin) is sat down and in a chair the machine is placed in front of him. At first it works wonders by cleaning and feeding him however, after a few seconds the machine goes mad and begins to move extremely fast. As items such as corn, and metal bolts are being forced into the workers mouth nothing but laughter can be created. Charlie's Wide eye facial expressions create such hilarious images.Some of the sets in his film are fun to watch too. One of which being the inside of a factory machine. the one in which the factory worker gets stuck in. It resembles that of the guts of a clock. This Charlie Chaplin film creates nothing but memorable moments. Wither it be him using a wrench to tighten a woman's bust buttons, eating a shoe, or being chased by the police this film is nothing but funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overworked Assembly Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see where the great physical comedians of the 20th century drew their inspiration from: straight from Chaplin. The skit here with the 'nose-powder' leads to Woody Allen's "Take the Money and Run" and "Sleeper"; the struggle to serve the roast duck was extensively borrowed by John Cleese in "Fawlty Towers" (and the hapless 'Manuel' character); the department store robbery was the basis for John Hughes' "Career Opportunities". The recently and sadly departed Marcel Marceau drew hugely on Chaplin's mastery of the physical language of silent film.In particular, when Woody affected silly, lecherous behavior (his 'Orgasmatron' skit), he tapped directly into what made Chaplin great -- his ability to simultaneously convey innocence and naughtiness. See how his Tramp attempts to adjust the strategically-placed bolts on women's outfits, and scratch your head as to just how this got past Code restrictions.It seems all the ingredients for greatness are there, the key being the brilliant idea of a 'talkie' vs. 'silent film' construction. But that's all it adds up to: a jumbled collection of ideas that is less than the sum of its parts. It tries to carry a 'message'; it tries to cross pollinate a satire of politics and the dehumanizing power of the industrial state with 'progress' in the form of talking films (all of the vocal parts emanate from machines); it tries to hold together a coherent romance. It's too much to assemble all at one time?I look forward to seeing 'City Lights', and then reconsidering this movie in the context of having seen both?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, poignant and brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin brings back The Tramp in "Modern Times," a 1936 film that also stars Paulette Goddard. The film is mostly silent - going against modern times in 1936 - though sound effects, music, radio announcements, that type of thing, can be heard throughout. The Tramp and the Gamin (Paulette Goddard) are always silent. Yet they convey anything anybody ever needed to know.Modern Times is about a little man who just doesn't seem to belong anywhere. In the beginning, he's working in a factory on an assembly line, and when an efficiency expert brings in a "feeding machine" that will require workers to take less time for lunch, our Tramp is chosen. The machine breaks down while still connected to Chaplin, making for a fabulous scene. In another scene, he becomes part of the machine as he goes through it.The Depression is on and jobs are hard to come by, especially when you keep getting into trouble, so the Tramp goes from job to job. Eventually he meets the homeless Gamin, who is quick on her feet, and the two attempt to survive the hard times together.A small but handsome man, Chaplin as the Tramp is still recognizable today with his funny walk and little mustache. The most astounding thing about Chaplin is the way he used his body. The most brilliant example of this is the roller skating scene, but there are so many others - Chaplin's flexibility and balletic grace made him the greatest comedian ever. When he fails as a waiter and is called upon to sing in a restaurant, his movements to the song are phenomenal.Goddard is young and beautiful as the Gamin and does a terrific job as a streetwise girl who can't help getting discouraged. But The Tramp won't let her - he knows that together, they can make it. As funny in parts as this movie is, we're reminded of how poverty victimizes people and how try as some might, some people just don't belong in these modern, practical times that don't allow time for some of the simpler pleasures.One scene that foreshadowed corporate America today - there is a large television screen where the boss can see everything that's going on, even in the bathrooms, where he yells at people to get back to work. I'm sure that, even if that isn't available in most, if any, companies, workers definitely feel they are being kept track of every minute, with the use of time sheets, security cards, sign-ins, computer monitoring and the like.A truly great film by a master. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Comedy and Social Insight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplan confirms his genius ability in the movie Modern Times. The movie captures the wit of Voltaire, the expose abilities of Upton Sinclair, and the prophetic social insights of George Orwell. On a more light-hearted note it is comedy at a beautiful pace and freshness. I recommend it for both the college student and the elementary grade school child.The opening scene of the worker being symbolized by running sheep is something that Orwell put in words in Animal Farm and Roger Water and Pink Floyd put to music in the 1977 album Animals.After viewing Chaplan's previous works such as The Circus, The Gold Rush, and City Lights, I can truly say that this is Mr. Chaplan's greatest and most relevant movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Charles Spencer Chaplin is one of the greatest directors and performers of the whole cinema history. Having produced countless amount of short-comedy movies Chaplin started to get concerned on more serious issues while the world was experiencing difficult times. Modern Times is one of his best movies as well as probably one of the most criticized ones as ironically it got too much critical. After watching the movie you can understand what Chaplin was trying to do was not simply making a movie but far beyond of it. You understand how well he digested what he had been observing during his era and the transformation of human power into the mechanical technologies. After all, the result was an intoxicating mixture of comedy genre and political criticism in a masterpiece: Modern Times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total classic ! A Must See !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly many young people have not watched Chaplin's movies. Hopefully this will change. This is an absolutely must see movie. Anyone will be entertained and touched by this timeless classical satire with a deep feel of humanity and warmness. Many people may understand incorrectly the idea of modernization as a nameless monster which obsesses peoples lives and souls through machinery, computers(which were still not present during the movie was shot - smile), etc. This is deeply wrong I think and this is for example the difference between this movie and for example The Matrix which is quite pointless obsession with the prehistoric, idolized fear for the unknown and of the brave new world. On the other hand Chaplin tells us a story about capitalism, bureaucracy, dehumanization, poverty, of the little man trapped in the big machine of the government and thrown out on the street as a piece of trash, after his employer have sucked his brains out of work. The metaphor es are so direct and colorful sometimes that you can only sit and watch speechless while the whole story is told. My favorite moments are so many but I cannot forget Charlie trapped in the big machine, Charlie going crazy on the production line, Charlie and his girl friend dreaming of a better life, etc.I repeat the story is so totally and overwhelmingly human that even the big factory and the machines cannot spoil but only stress the man, a man fighting for his normal life in a crazy and anti-human society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern film with the style of a classic silent picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most amazing thing to me about this famous film is the way Charlie Chaplin so ably duplicates the style of one of his earlier silent pictures. He knew all too well how fast the future was coming up, and how cinema had changed with the advent of sound recording. Like many, he feared mechanization and modern industry. He knew that his legendary Tramp character had to be put to bed, so he decided to go out in style. The picture is a tribute not only to The Tramp as a cinematic icon, but a showcase for Chaplin's truly varied talents as actor, writer, and director.To go without sound when you don't have to do so is a mark of true class. Chaplin reminds us of how much we can rely on visual information to understand a story. The quick close-ups, tight edits, and the slightly exaggerated, histrionic scenes with Paulette Goddard are a stunning and pleasurable flashback to the simple melodramatic silent films of earlier years. It is sophisticated and serious despite the hilarious scenes. It was almost as if Chaplin wanted to remind modern film audiences that pictures of the silent era are an entirely separate genre from the "talkies." The closing scene, with the two leads walking off down the road, is elegaic and touching. I simply cannot understand why the Academy did not recognize the artistry that went into so many components of this picture. However, this oversight was made up later by the well-deserved lifetime achievement award for Chaplin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholy Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I must admit that I usually have very little patience with silent films, this was a touching and often humorous effort by Charlie Chaplin. It is easily one of his best films. Even though this is a comedy, it's difficult not to sympathize with the plight of Chaplin's character and the series of hard-luck episodes that he must endure. There are funny moments, but it seems, at times, that the social commentary of the film overpowers them. The repetitive and draining nature of factory life, as portrayed in one of the opening scenes, is likely all too familiar to those who earn their livings in this way. Unemployment, homelessness and just plain bad luck are other elements that are explored throughout the film. On another note, the film doesn't remain completely silent since there are several instances when music or dialogue can be heard. It's a type of hybrid silent/talkie similar to The Jazz Singer. Overall, this is a good film that should be viewed and enjoyed by film buffs, but I would give a somewhat reluctant recommendation to casual film fans since it does require patience to allow the story to develop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as "City lights" or "The Great Dictator"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems the people who read my reviews always give the positive "helpful" votes for those films I praise, while they punish my comments for the films I don't like. I guess the same will happen now since "Modern Times" is the highest praised Chaplin film on IMDb.com and I'm giving it only a 7 out of 10. It's a very good film, a brave and interesting satire on the great depression in USA, but Chaplin's other films like "City Lights", "The Gold Rush" and "The Great Dictator" were in my opinion superior and much more enjoyable."Modern Times" starts with a frame of a herd of sheep, then cutting right into a mob of nervous factory workers, pointing out how the capitalism and the industrialization are treating people like a bunch of slaves. Chaplin's Tramp is one of those workers who looses his sanity from non stop work and gets fired. He then meets a poor girl, lands in prison, gets bailed out for helping stop a jail break and starts finding new jobs, just to get fired again. The story doesn't flow as smooth as some other silent classics from the famous actor/director and is made out of little bits and events which aren't connected. Apparently Chaplin made this without any script, and it shows. Also, some of his Tramp's goofy jokes today seem a little outdated and childish.------------ Still, putting the flaws aside, this is a quality film with human message. In today's mechanical age it even seems somewhat visionary since the poor, jobless couple back then can easily be found even today on the streets. But not to say the film is without humor, like when the Tramp picks up a red flag on the street that fell from a truck and gets mixed up with a communist leader or when the feeding machine proves to be a real useless disaster, something the machine haters will love to hate.Grade: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin. My goodness.Being a 23 yr old now-a-days is sometimes hard when it comes to expecting to see a good movie. I am a snob of sorts when it comes to movies, refuse to see beyond the first American Pie movies (and the first would have been the same if I would have known) and the Farrelly brothers make me ill, and there's really no way to change my mind when I see movies like Charade, and Pressure Point. Looking back on movies put out in the past and trying to compare them to movies now is like trying to compare a steak dinner to a BigMac. Sure we're all CG-ed up, and I enjoy my share of new movies, but last night I decided to watch Modern Times. Now, black and white? Silent? I was not all about it at all. I like old movies and what not, but Im not about to jump into Metropolis or anything, but I have to say that I laughed about 150% more then I thought I would. It had some great footage of the funny man of the early 1900's and the situations were just Laugh Out Loud.Even though I'm not a Chaplin follower I did get a wow feeling when he started singing in the restaurant, knowing that this is the first time Charlie Chaplin has spoken in a movie. On of my favorite scenes in this movie is when the Tramp tries to work as a night watchmen in a department store. He takes his homeless girlfriend in to have some food, fun and a comfortable place to sleep. Part of the fun is when they try out the roller-skates and its all funny from there. I truly enjoyed watching this little film and I will definitely be seeing more Chaplin movies. To think, I thought this was going to be one of those films where everything was spoiled because of the thievery that goes on today. Glad to see that this gem was virtually left untouched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its difficult to watch a Charlie Chaplin film without saying to yourself, "Oh my God, this is Charlie Chaplin." Being objective is difficult, but somewhere I heard that comedy is the only true form of justice on this Earth. If you are not funny, people will not laugh regardless of who you are. Fortunately for Chaplin, he is the genuine article and he has staying power (making several of his films legitimate classics to be enjoyed for generations to come). The automated food server bit has great, as well as the "nose powder" sequence. Several times I was laughing out loud watching this by myself. If a comedy makes you laugh with no one around, its great.There are few legends as powerful as the image of Chaplin's tramp character. Imagine you are sitting in your living room and the tramp walks in. You simply would not know what to do or say... Chaplin has become immortal in our culture and is one of the few people to transcend being human and truly live well beyond his years as a force to be reckoned with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scathing critique on technology and his times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times is a social critique of the new technology that dehumanizes people, and a powerful statement against the technology and rules that inhibit progress. Chaplin clearly holds an anti-"system" stance, and both his character and his leading lady refuse to reform. He likens industrial workers to sheep in an early montage, and squirts oil on them during his nervous breakdown, likening them to cogs in the machinery or automations. They are never depicted as humans. The most striking scenes often include shots of the machinery in the factory. When Chaplin is trapped in the machinery, he literally becomes a cog in the wheel, totally replaceable since he is fired soon after. Near the end of the film, he is again working in a factory and a long shot presents the machinery towering over the men, literally overpowering them and figuratively dominating their world. When a second man is stuck in the machinery, the viewer sees how the technology literally consumes his life, and he is not happy. He repeatedly yells to get him out, because humans have a natural desire to fight off the technology that oppresses and contains them.By taking technological mishaps to the extreme, Chaplin presents a powerful statement about progress. The Deluxe Feeding Machine spills hot soup on Chaplin, the mouth wiper slaps him, and the corn cob makes sizzling noises as he tries to eat it. This machine does not serve its purpose of feeding, but rather reduces Chaplin's power over himself and takes an aggressive role against him. In another lunch scene in the factory, Chaplin has to feed another man his lunch because he cannot serve himself; he is reduced to the level of a baby. Chaplin clearly holds a very strong view of what technology is doing to men in making them everything but men. The assembly line process gives Chaplin a weird walk with kinks, a comment on the strain of doing that kind of tedious work. This scene complements a montage of workers on strike, factories closing, and industrial people out of work, tying the movie's humor to the real life seriousness of the industrial process. While all of these people are out of work, only two fix the idle machine that is useless, unfixable and inefficient. Without it, many people would have work and be doing a better job.The other major setting of the film is the jailhouse, the scene for Chaplin's attack on "rules." Chaplin is arrested three times, once (wrongly) for leading a strike. Ironically, the conditions of the jail are better than the constant search for work and attempt to conform to societal norms. Chaplin tries to return to jail, where civilization seems to lay in this ridiculous world. Here he is treated as a human and has tea with the minister's wife. He who is viewed as a criminal is innocent and those typical criminal robbers of the department store we come to pity because they are simply hungry. It seems the "system" is as inefficient as the factory machines because the arrests, paperwork to find wanted people, and strikes waste time that could be spent finding work for the millions unemployed.Chaplin shows his contempt for the "system" in his statement that he would get a home even if he "has to work for it." He does not enjoy following the rules, which is why he is so often out of work, but even he espouses the suburban ideals of America that so many cannot attain. He makes the audience consider the inequity of wealth with his first humble abode that constantly falls apart. His critique comes through strongest in the closing scene. Both the orphan girl and he have jobs, nice clothes, and success, demonstrating that the individual can succeed when given the opportunity to have the spotlight. They can not succeed when they are just one of a million other "sheep." When they walk off into the sunset, they are two people against the "system" smiling as they walk down the road to opportunity, away from authority, industry, technology, and the silliness of the established rules.In a purely technical aspect, Chaplin reinforces his critique by largely ignoring the available addition of sound. Sound is linked to the dehumanization of people and is only used with those linked to machinery. He believed this new technology in the film industry would detract from the truer human emotions and messages that had been perfected in silent films. Modern Times is a perfect example, as the indigestion scene is a type of crass humor that does not work as well as the visual humor he presents. Chaplin has a physical grace and power over himself and each scene, giving him an aura of control that extends to audience interpretations of the film. In this film too, he perfects his portrayal of "The Little Tramp," a misfit in society. He stands for our common humanity and is the hero that transcends the oppression of the industrial machines, rules, and society. Chaplin is not just a talented filmmaker; he is also an astute social critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can only give praise. Chaplin was a genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is only the first Charlie Chaplin movie I have seen, I am already prepared to say that this is one of his best works. In this memorable, hilarious and touching movie, Chaplin takes on the modern era along with his newfound girl friend (Paulette Goddard) in a quest for happiness.Chaplin is a factory worker at a rather boring factory controlled by a boss who talks to his employees through screens (If that's not television, then I don't know what it is). With the same lame, repetitive work each day, Chaplin suffers a breakdown and is sent to the hospital. He recovers and is released, only to be arrested for accidentally being the leader of a communist parade. Goddard is a homeless girl who struggles everyday to live. Chaplin and Goddard eventually meet and the two vow to get a new home, `Even if I have to work for it!'There are countless memorable sight gags in Modern Times. My favorite is when Chaplin, employed as a mechanic's assistant, gets his boss stuck in a machine. Another equally memorable gag is when Chaplin, in prison, gets hyperactive after sprinkling ?Nose Powder' on his food and inadvertently adverts a prison break. There is much symbolism in this movie. For most of the film, the only things that have sound are mechanical objects such as machines, cars and radios. But for most of the film (As he was through the beginning of the silent era) Chaplin refuses to talk. His memorable song at the end, however, seems to show that he had given up and was ready to enter the modern times of cinema.But he did not change his slapstick humor. If only all comedians these days could be as funny or creative as Chaplin was without using sex jokes or molesting animals. I guess that's the `Modern Times' for you.</fullReview>

What I did not like about the film was its subversive left'wing and communistic tendencies. Better to forget about that side of it or it spoils the viewing. What I did like was the humour, the "eating machine" the cogs and above all the beautiful music. I have known for years that the glorious tune "Smile" is supposed to come from this film. Well you have to wait right until the last few minutes of the film to hear it ! I think it is a film to view several times over to fully appreciate all the gags.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MILD SPOILERS!Though far from perfect, "Modern Times" is a quintessential movie. Chaplin knew that movies were called MOVE-ees because they were a celebration of kinesis, that is, movement. In fact, according to Chaplin, only fights and chases were "pure cinema". Fortunately, his actual practice was less adamant than his rhetoric. "Modern Times" is pure cinema to be sure but in a broader sense than Charlie would've defined it. Though not always humorous (sometimes even when it's trying to be), "Modern Times" has some genuinely funny moments. I love The Tramp's morning swim in his new pond. Smartly outfitted, and spry of step, The Tramp skips out of the changing room, down the path, and to the end of the diving platform. Then, with prowess and aptitude, he dives...into about 2 inches of water! Of course, there are several delightful moments like this and, like so many of Chaplin's scenes, they are the stuff of legend. In addition to humor, there are some dazzlingly tense moments. As The Tramp is pulled through the gears of the machine you catch yourself saying, "That can't be safe, can it?" And, of course, the blind-folded rollerskating scene is as good as anything in "The Matrix" (and no CGI either). Finally, in my opinion, (don't know about Charlie's) my point of entry into the movie was due to its pathos. I liked the relationship between The Tramp and The Gamin (wharf-child). Paulette Goddard is a strikingly attractive woman (with an eerie resemblance to Molly Shannon) and their relationship is touching and innocent. As those first strains of "Smile" faded in, I knew that they had me. To me, this is just as much pure cinema as the rest. A second definition of kinesis illuminates what could be considered the flat side of the movie. Kinesis is also defined as a movement that lacks directional orientation and depends upon the intensity of stimulation. This is a pretty accurate description of large sections of "Modern Times". Like many of the early Disney shorts, it suffers somewhat from a manic, unpredictable plot. Until the middle section, "Modern Times" is little more than a series of gags. Of course, this was probably quite intentional and Chaplin could've done whatever he wanted. Nevertheless, I do think it holds the film back from perfection. Finally, (and, for some reason, this almost completely stops at the half-way point) repetition of gags has a way of subduing some of the humor. There CAN be too much of a good thing.Chaplin's Tramp, especially in "Modern Times" reminds me of two fictional creations, both on radically opposite ends of the spectrum. While I'm not the first to observe this, as an inveterate Disney fan, I couldn't help but notice the similarity between The Tramp and "The Mick", Micky Mouse. Like, Mickey, The Tramp is simple, uncomplicated, good (without being too good), resilient, and indomitable. It's clear that Chaplin had a large influence on this little mouse and (seen accordingly) Chaplin's influence on cinema (and the world) is immeasurable. Finally, and I just thought of this, The Tramp is a modern version of the mythical Sisyphus (especially as portrayed by Camus in his essay, "The Myth of Sisyphus"). Sisyphus was the guy who (due to his impertinence) was forever cursed to push up a mountain a boulder which refused to stay put. Camus sees all of us as toiling in equally grueling and fruitless fashion and yet sees something admirable in Sisyphus. Though he never seems to get it right (like The Tramp), he refuses to quit. Camus says that he imagines Sisyphus happy. I have seen with my own eyes that The Tramp IS happy. In a final act of blind un-reasoning optimism, The Tramp and his girl-friend walk away into the sunset in search of new ventures (and adventures). Their chosen path is right down the middle of an empty highway (desolate and empty as well as a blank canvas of hope). Their faces are turned to the future and, therefore hidden to us, but we KNOW that they are smiling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tramp says farewell with his best piece of advice for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Buck up - never say die. We'll get along."I can't think of a more fitting line than that final one from the Tramp to the Gamin to say farewell to silent films as they cheerfully walk towards the horizon. By 1936 everyone was watching talkies and they expected Modern Times to be Chaplin's first one considering his previous film, City Lights, had already incorporated some sound effects five years ago. Modern Times is considered one of Chaplin's finest movies and perhaps a lot of it has to do with the fact that it was his last silent film so it has the nostalgic factor going for it. The way Chaplin incorporates sound in Modern Times is pure genius because the only moments where we hear sound is when they come from mechanical devices, so in a way he blended the social critique of the Industrial age with his own critique of the use of sound in film. This mechanical monster that was taking over his industry was putting an end to the silent era which made him such a popular figure. Chaplin may have stated that his films aren't social critiques, but I don't think anyone managed to capture the human spirit during that era better than he did. During the first hour of this film which I earnestly enjoyed I couldn't quite understand why this film was considered superior to his other films which I enjoyed more. Up to that moment there wasn't really a scene that stood out for me like there had been in all his other features. Then suddenly when I was about to lose hope came the restaurant scene where the Tramp performs a song where we can't understand what he's saying, but through his gestures he makes himself perfectly understood. That was the scene that sold this movie for me and reminded me of Chaplin's genius. The ending in Modern Times is perhaps my favorite ending in all of Chaplin's films, although I still think I would rank City Lights as his best film. In his last silent film Charles Chaplin stars as the Tramp once again, and this time we find him working at an assembly line in a factory. The quick working pace and the mechanized movements he has to make slowly begin to affect him. He can't keep up with the pace in the assembly line and production is delayed because of him. During a lunch break he is chosen for experimentation with an automatic feeding machine that they want to sell to the president of the steel corporation. The machine goes haywire and the Tramp also begins to lose his sanity so he is sent to a mental hospital. Eventually he is released but after an unfortunate incident he is mistaken for a communist and imprisoned. In prison he becomes a hero by stopping several prisoners from breaking out of jail so he is released. Unemployed and unable to find a job all he wants is to go back to prison, but when he meets a Gamin (Paulette Goddard) and falls in love with her, he makes it his goal to find a job and buy a house where the two can live happily ever after, but in these modern times it won't be an easy task.Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard have excellent chemistry together although the film is a little too sentimental at times. In Modern Times, Chaplin manages to once again balance pathos with slapstick, but I found some of the scenarios to be a little too similar to his other films so I felt it was getting a bit repetitive. However, what Chaplin does really well here is include the social elements of the time and use it to his advantage by focusing on the struggle the people had adapting to the modern industrial age. He does this by using satire through his brilliant physical comedy. In an era of dehumanization, Chaplin humanizes Modern Times with a sweet and tender story reminding everyone that the obstacles can be overcome. With every new problem that the Tramp has to face somehow he always finds a way to remain hopeful and rise to the occasion. That is perhaps why his comedies still remain timeless and continues to touch the hearts of those who encounter Chaplin for the first time. They will also understand that dialogue was not always necessary to tell a story, and the best to do so was Chaplin with his unique energy and brilliance.</fullReview>

Failing as a worker on a factory assembly line, he gets into a series of misadventures, which leads to him meeting a young orphaned girl. They try to survive in the world together, both on the run from the law...Having never seen a Chaplin film before, I had no idea what to expect.After seeing this wonderful movie, I'm really disappointed as a movie buff, that I have never seen one of his movies sooner.His balletic approach to comedy is so mesmerising, that he almost hypnotises you whilst watching, all the while with an ever innocent face.In some instances, this could be Chaplins approach to the advent of the talkies, showing the struggle that some people could find with the implementation of new product, and the over zealous way manufacturers try to ooze every last bit of graft from their employees.It's shed a new light on the era of silent films for me now. Before this, it was Nosferatu, The cabinet of Dr. Caligiri, and metropolis.I'm looking forward to seeing more from this genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic even whose copies are classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never the biggest fan of the Tramp, gravitating rather towards Buster Keaton who was more humorous and less pathetic. But Modern Times is just a great flick.One of the last silent movies in the incipient era of talkies, it pits man against the industrial machinery created just a two decades earlier by Ford: the world of the assembly line that replaced the journeyman and artisan by the unionized factory worker.In some of the best humorous scenes without words ever filmed, Chaplin loses against the assembly line, which literally eats him up and passes him through its innards, and loses again when the idea is inverted and the assembly line tries to feed him.The visual idea is so cosmically comical that it begat classics of comedy as worthy as the original. Think of the inimitable Lucille Ball's fight with the chocolate assembly line!Later on the film drops to 8 stars as the story moves to the usual Chaplin pathos of mistaken identity and waif-like ingnues that share with him the rough times. Although the communist flag business can now be seen as the condemnation of US right wing politics that culminated ca 20 years later in McCarthyism.One of the great silent movies, and if you want some sound afterwards, play the "I Love Lucy" episode "Job Switching" from season 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Modern Times" - one of the all-time greatest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you ask people nowadays whether or not they've heard of a silent film, chances are they probably haven't. But worst of all, they don't have enough interest in seeing such a film because they simply can't stomach the thought of no sound coming from the actor's mouths. However, for those who do know what silent films are, the name that first comes to mind when talking about silent movies is usually Charlie Chaplin, and for good reason. I can't think of any silent filmmaker other than Charlie Chaplin whose works have still been able to please nearly everybody who's watched them several years later. So it makes it all the more interesting to note that his last and greatest silent film, "Modern Times" (1936), isn't really a silent film. Although there is a musical score and a couple bits of sound, it isn't even a sound film either. Basically, "Modern Times" is a silent film and a sound film both at the same time, but most importantly, it's a unique piece of art. "Modern Times" follows a factory worker (Charlie Chaplin) who loses his monotonous job on the assembly line after suffering a mental breakdown. He recovers from that breakdown, but he's soon mistaken for the leader of a Communist demonstration and is then thrown in jail. After he prevents a jail outbreak, he's released early for good behavior. While he's searching for a new job, he comes across an orphaned gamine girl (Paulette Goddard) who has recently been experiencing bad luck just like him. With no one else in their lives, these two stick together and do what they can to make it through a modern society in which more emphasis is being placed on industrialization than on the individual. I don't recall seeing a film that blended comedy and drama quite as well as "Modern Times". This truly is a film that's side-splittingly funny and heartbreakingly sad both at the same time. Though it's highly unfortunate that Chaplin's character accidentally lands in jail as many times as he does, life outside of the jail cell for him is almost just as harsh and unforgiving. He has significant trouble at performing his jobs correctly and he keeps getting fired from job after job as a result, and yet he still maintains a generally positive attitude and still puts in his best effort anyways. To create a likable character with those characteristics is no easy task especially considering that this is someone who lands in jail multiple times. But not only does writer-director Charlie Chaplin manage to pull off that tricky challenge, we're also able to relate to the main protagonist in more ways than one. An example of an excellent scene that shows the factory worker's humanity is on the first and last day of his new job at the shipyards. He has to find a large wedge for his boss identical to the one in his hand. Without ruining the joke of that scene, let's just say he finds such a wedge in the wrong place. There are similar scenes like that throughout that make "Modern Times" such a charming silent film. Another classic scene is when the factory worker has to test out the feeding machine. This feeding machine, of course, is designed to feed the workers their food while they are still on the job, so the company's production increases. And while this scene is very funny and executed exceedingly well, it makes us all the more grateful that no such machine exists in today's workforce due to its unintended consequences. But there's more to "Modern Times" than the straightforward hilarity and humanity that's melded into it. There's an important and life-changing message about society in general that Chaplin gets across very well. "Modern Times" is a film that emphasizes the idea that every person is different and that humans aren't machines like society wants them to be. No matter how hard we try, we all make mistakes and we can't please everyone we come across. We all have different strengths and weaknesses, we all come from different backgrounds, and we all have our own unique skills and theories. This film basically reassures even the least talented individuals that not only will everything still be okay in the end, but that it's also okay to stand out from the crowd. Chaplin expresses this encouraging idea to his audience perfectly through well thought out writing with brilliant character development and plotting, and excellent direction that blends perfect comedic timing with tender emotion. I loved Paulette Goddard as the orphaned gamine who accompanies the factory worker through tough times. I admired how active her character was and how she does whatever she can to either survive or help the factory worker out. By letting her do stuff like stealing bread, finding some sort of shelter, or even landing a job, she becomes a more three- dimensional character and easier for anyone to identify with her. I'm uncertain whether the relationship between the Goddard character and the Chaplin character is a romance or a friendship. But whatever it is, their on-screen chemistry works well for me. The fact that they're loyal and content with each other's company makes me warm up to them instantly. "Modern Times" was a very special film in my life the first time I watched it, and it still is now. It was the first silent film I'd ever seen, and I couldn't have been more blessed with this film having that distinctive honor. I've only seen a few silent films since then such as "City Lights" (1931) and "The Artist" (2011). Though the silent films I just mentioned are well crafted in their own right, it's still going to be exceedingly difficult finding a better silent film that "Modern Times". It's funny, sad, relevant, relatable, heartwarming, and easily one of the all-time greatest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make the modern comedies look like crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly one of the best works of Charlie Chaplin and therefore can be classified as one of the best movies in the silent era, and as I see it one of the all-time best comedies.The main character, "The Tramp", is a factory worker in the early days of industrial revolution who cannot really adopt to the changes. But along with a homeless young woman he is able to face every challenge that comes on his way and able to enjoy life.The movie when compared with modern day comedies, differs a lot. In-fact the modern day comedy producers should learn from watching movies like "Modern Times". The movie doesn't contain any profanity and sex at all unlike many comedies seen nowadays. However without any of these modern techniques of making people laugh, "Modern Times" is still able to make people burst out of laughter.Though it is a silent movie, it keep the viewers engaged in it for almost 90 minutes and makes sure that they get something for their lives at the end of it. It teaches how to enjoy life despite all the obstacles life bring along its way.Overall, this is one of the best comedies ever produced and will stay the same in centuries to come. So, don't hesitate to have a go at it even-though it is produced black and white. It will surely keep you entertained and is a movie that the whole family could watch together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm rating this as high as "8" out of 10 . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . because it's the best example in American history of how subversive ideas started to corrupt our nation, and how the brave boys of our American Legion fought back and won (even though they were still fatigued from having just beat Hitler in WWII!). A foreigner named Charles Chaplin plopped himself down in Hollywood for DECADES (but never took an oath of allegiance to the country which fed and housed him by becoming a U.S. citizen!) and took control of almost everything out there by producing, writing, directing, editing, scoring, and of course starring in a string of salacious flicks. MODERN TIMES indeed! The just mentioned moving picture was his worst assault on American values. Disguised as a "talkie," this throwback silent movie makes fun of the man who enabled modern America, Henry Ford, and his assembly lines. (No one would have a pick-up or an AK-47 today if the workers were like Chaplin's "tramp" character in MODERN TIMES, who gets fired from two factories, a boat yard, a department store, and a night club during his first day at each U.S. institution.) Chaplin's tramp snorts cocaine during one of his many prison stints, loafs, defies authority, and leads multiple Communist strikes when he tires of the taxing demands of workplace sabotage. For fun, he gives cigars to young boys and corrupts an under-aged orphan girl. Unlike James Stewart and KING KONG director Merion C. Cooper, Chaplin did NOT become a brigadier general in the U.S.A.F. during WWII. Rather, he became an apologist for Hitler with his MODERN TIMES follow-up, THE GREAT (!!!!!!) DICTATOR. Fortunately for U.S., the next time Chaplin left America our stalwart Legion guys did what was needed to make it illegal for him to set foot on our sacred soil ever again. When President Nixon gave this decadent director a 12-hour furlough to collect an honorary Oscar from his pinko Hollywood cronies, this "last straw" resulted in "Tricy Dick's" impeachment. He was forced to resign, just as Chaplin was forced to quit making movies at an age when Clint Eastwood was just getting started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chaplin's "City Lights" was my first exposure to silent films and to Chaplin's films. It was one of the best films I'd seen and I was eager to watch more of his films. "Modern Times" is hilarious, entertaining, inventive, exciting and heartwarming. Telling the story of The Tramp as he struggles with the change with modern society, he meets a young girl whose father was killed and whose sisters were taken from her, Chaplin forms a bond with her and does everything in his power to assist her. Perfectly directed with stunning cinematography and iconic shots (none more so than Chaplin in the interior of the machinery as he goes through the assembly line), Chaplin masters everything once more. The score is beautiful, his direction is perfect, his performance as perfect if not better and with a strong supporting performance, Chaplin's "Modern Times" masterfully conveys the struggle of poverty better than most "talkie" films ever could. Brilliantly paced for a film with no dialogue, "Modern Times" is a hilarious film that is satisfying in every possible way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Finale To Cinema's Most Iconic Character, The Little Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the timeless classics Charlie Chaplin came up with throughout his decades-spanning film career, Modern Times remains my absolute favourite. A perfect farewell to the era that made him a household name all over the globe and permanently engraved his legacy in the annals of cinema, Modern Times is the final silent feature film from Charlie Chaplin and also marks the last appearance of his signature character on the film celluloid.A satirical take on industrial age &amp; modern society, Modern Times follows the adventures of The Little Tramp who undergoes a nervous breakdown while working rigorously in a factory &amp; is placed in a mental institution. Once out, he's mistakenly arrested during a Communist demonstration &amp; put in jail again. Finally, he manages to secure a job temporarily &amp; meets a young homeless woman with whom he tries to survive the modern, industrialized world.Written, produced, directed &amp; scored by Charlie Chaplin, Modern Times presents his critical view on the transition America was going through during the Great Depression and how the reckless industrialization had reduced human labour to just another piece of machinery. The story is infused with social commentary from beginning to end but it doesn't rob its viewers from having a good time for Modern Times is possibly the funniest film Chaplin ever made.Crafted at a time when silent cinema had become a thing of the past, the film isn't silent in the traditional sense for it makes effective use of sound effects &amp; also marks the first time we get to hear Chaplin's voice on the film canvas. And the technical aspects are refined to the smallest of details under Chaplin's supervision for sets are meticulously detailed, black n white photography efficiently captures the unfolding events and Editing keeps a firm grip on its pacing &amp; action.The slapstick humour is used to perfection and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to be found in this film. From the moment we meet our protagonist on the assembly line to his final walk down the road, there isn't a moment when the film stops being funny and even after nearly 8 decades, it retains its ability to make its viewers collapse from laughing. How Chaplin continued to find ways that effortlessly evoked laughter &amp; admiration from the ever- changing audience is a strong testament to why he is still second to none.The background score in an amalgamation of adventurous, sweet &amp; melancholic tracks that are seamlessly integrated into the story and enhances the whole experience by a great deal. Coming to the performances, Chaplin is at his craziest here and the nervous breakdown his character undergoes in the first act is hilarious as hell. And that's just one of the too many rib-tickling segments present in the picture. Paulette Goddard also does an outstanding job in her first major role, and her chemistry with Chaplin is endearing to watch.On an overall scale, Modern Times is a masterwork of perfection from the perfectionist that bids an ideal farewell to the silent era of filmmaking, remains one of the finest achievements of Chaplin's illustrious career &amp; is rightfully acknowledged as one of the greatest films ever made. Just like every other Chaplin film, it has endured the test of time &amp; will continue to do so for as long as cinema lives. The final image of The Little Tramp walking down the road as the camera fades is poignant to watch but then, Chaplin couldn't have ended the journey of his most memorable creation on a more perfect note. A definite must for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last triumph of silence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern Times while a wonderful film also forever stamped Charlie Chaplin as the Philip K. Wrigley of film artists. As all baseball historians know Phil Wrigley was the last of club owners to put lights in his ballpark and the Chicago Cubs did not have lights on Wrigley Field and play night games until after his death. So to Chaplin was the last silent screen artist and Modern Times was his triumph in that art form. People actually did see it in 1936 and this was now an audience that was used to dialog from the mouths of movie performers.Modern Times has Chaplin and his little tramp character go after the effects of industrialization and how factory work robs the soul of its individuality and sense of accomplishment. The smarter bosses recognized this and provided workers with incentives and activities that ameliorated this feeling. Too many were like Chaplin's bosses who only thought of increased production.One of the great moments in the film comes when the manager selects Charlie as a test guinea pig for a feeding machine feeling that too much production time was lost while employees had their lunch. Charlie in that machine being force fed was hysterical. The gag was so good that Crosby and Hope used it for a double effect in The Road To Hong Kong.After losing many jobs and spending time in jail when he's picked up for union organizing, Charlie among other things gets a job as a singing waiter. Here Chaplin treads ever so gently into dialog when after losing the lyrics he sings a gibberish type ballad, similar to the Klopstokian language in Million Dollar Legs. Another treasured moment from Modern Times.Modern Times also introduced Paulette Goddard to the big screen and she and Chaplin were involved and got married. In his memoirs Chaplin ironically recounted that while she got many offers after the film was over he because he still would not consider a sound film just stayed at home until 1940 and The Great Dictator. He also said that costuming was difficult. It's easy enough to make a good looking girl enhance her beauty with the best of fashion. But Paulette Goddard who played a poor waif in the film had to look beautiful in rags. Chaplin recounts he spent a lot of time trying to get the right effect for Goddard.Among the many of Charlie's talents was that of composer. His famous ballad Smiles is heard throughout the film at poignant moments. Naturally only as an instrumental. I commend Nat King Cole's recording of the song.Speaking of poignant moments the uncertain future that Charlie and Paulette have at the end of Modern Times cannot be described. Charlie the tramp and Paulette the waif just looking for a spot on earth where they can be themselves. Isn't that something we all want.Though it has little spoken words and none from its leads Modern Times lived up to its billing in that it came out at a time when organized labor was given the right to finally organize and it was struggling to assert that right during the New Deal. A lot of the lessons of Modern Times on that subject need to be revisited. And often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humane Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never exactly been a fan of silent movies or Chaplin, but it's hard not to be captivated by this satirical response to capitalism, in particular, and industrialism generally. Of course, people should be the masters of the machines. The movie, however, pokes poignant fun at how machines have reversed the roles by becoming the masters over people. Of course, this mastery is presided over by an all-seeing owner, who must further mechanize (the automatic feeding machine, for example) or risk losing out to the competition.Chaplin manages to make his points in a number of amusing set-ups that are also poignant in what they reveal. For example, Chaplin's getting pulled into the machine's great digestive cog system amounts to a stunning metaphor. Of course, this was also during the Great Depression, so the threat of unemployment and starvation acted as goads to putting up with all the on-the-job humiliation (being surveilled in the bathroom, for example). Also, Chaplin's use of crowds of unemployed and cordons of mounted police makes its point without need of dialog.I suppose it's not surprising that the nation's anti-communist watchdog committee, HUAC, would 10 years later find a movie like this suspect. But, it strikes me that anyone finding the movie's overall humane message politically objectionable has already been absorbed into the machinery Chaplin so shrewdly satirizes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaplin's first popular drama, disguised as a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know that Modern Times were not Chaplin's first attempt at drama (the first one was A Woman of Paris, that did not go well with the critics or the audience, and the poor Chaplin even had to apologize for trying out something honest!), but it is his first successful and winning formula of smuggling a drama in the disguise as a comedy. While even City Lights showed Chaplin in a dramatic role, Modern Times seems to me, even today, as primary a dramatic, tragic film about the Great Depression, and only secondary as a comedy. Bear with me, I am aware that there are a lot of laughs in this one, yet watching the movie as a whole, as a context, they seem to be there to at least keep a little will for life in the otherwise bitter, sad and depressing story. Heck, even the ending is revealing.Chaplin here plays his iconic Tramp, except that this time practically half of all the characters in the movie can be labeled as such - bums, poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions, the story is even more relevant today after the 2008 financial crisis. Heck, you could screen this at the shelters, the people would identify with this for sure. Chaplin was rich, but he came from a very poor family and never forgot how it is to work hard for a living. He was aware of the changes in the society and how millions of people were struggling to survive, so he channeled their frustration into this movie, a warning to the people in charge to do something. Things eventually improved, only to just recently get back to a state Chaplin was warning all along. Modern Times are a classic of unobtrusive social commentary, an ironic tragedy where technology - instead of making jobs easier for the people - just made them work even more, and the wages were so low you could not afford to live. Inside Job (2010) or Capitalism: A Love Story (2009) cannot even hold a candle to this. The sequence where Chaplin is frantically trying to keep up with a production line, tightening bolts, may not be as iconic or recognizable as his 'shoe dance' in The Gold Rush, but it is way more identifiable and easier to connect with the daily life, at least for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a reluctant Silent Movie watcher and are an unable viewer of antiquation or the Classics of a an era gone by, you might want to see this one. It is forever talked about and made by a Director/Star who is relentlessly talked about and most likely anyone involved in Film History or just casual lovers of the Art will never go silent on the famous Chaplin.Charlie did shut up for the longest time. Here in 1936 he bucked all trends and common sense to produce a "silent" picture with the most amazing result. It seems that it is so well conceived, so rich in Sociology, so funny in its slapstick and biting satire that once the sheep were herded into the theaters everyone instantly forgot this was a Silent Movie.There are numerous set pieces that are part of the social consciousness and subconscious of American life that will remain as long as there is a collective. A sense that we all belong in some sort of macro life force and have the ability to empathize, and have an awareness of our social structure and can feel. Chaplin felt deeply. It is obvious in his Art. In real life he paid a price for anti-establishment views and expressions of discontent. But he never lost the Love and respect from his admirers and Fans. This Movie is considered one of his best. It is, because of its insights and sight gags, its heart and its mindful attempt to enlighten while entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Little Tramp tries to survive the machine age. Chaplin's last silent film came several years after the talkies had become the norm, but it is arguably his best effort. It's a simple film, but touches on the theme of technology gone wild and foreshadows Orwell's "Big Brother" ("1984" came a decade after this film). As with his other films, it is episodic and uneven, but it mostly hits the mark. Highlights include Charlie's antics on the assembly line and his stint as a singing waiter, but the most hilarious scene has Charlie testing out an automatic feeding machine that goes out of control. Goddard is lovely as the gamin that Charlie hooks up with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially, I found it hard to appreciate Modern Times because it is so unlike the films I usually admire and enjoy. I am used to feature films that either tell a story or expound a coherent and consistent idea. This movie does neither.It starts with the Little Tramp being driven to a nervous breakdown by the regimentation of factory life. He recovers but is then imprisoned (by accident). He meets the Gamin (Paulette Goddard). He then accidentally foils a prison escape and is released. He has a succession of jobs, each of which he quickly loses. He sets up home with the Gamin and finally gets a more permanent job but is then forced to flee with her when the authorities try to put her into an orphanage. The movie ends with the couple walking off down the road to bravely face whatever the future may hold.This is a sequence of events in chronological order, but not really a story.It does have some sort of narrative arc, but most of the individual scenes are irrelevant to it. Similarly, it does have some (garbled) ideas to expound, but Chaplin is quite happy to shelve the ideas whenever he sees a good gag on the horizon.For example, he clearly wanted to say something about the dehumanisation of the assembly line. This is the inspiration for the opening sequence in which the Tramp is literally chewed up and spat out by the machinery. This leads on quite naturally to his final breakdown, where he dances round the factory like a disruptive, anarchic imp. These two scenes have an obvious thematic and dramatic link, but wedged between them is a whimsical scene with an automatic feeding machine. Although this idea plays better than it sounds, it does not really help develop the movie's story or its themes and feels like an awkward intrusion.After the Tramp's recovery from his breakdown, Chaplin's attention suddenly switches from the demoralising nature of work to the lack of it. However, his concern with the problem of unemployment is completely undermined by a plot device which means that the tramp is actually able to get work whenever he wants it. Of course, he quickly loses the various jobs he lands, but that says nothing about the precariousness of employment during the Great Depression ? he loses the jobs by accident and purely for comic effect.The muddle and contradiction become even more apparent as the picture develops. After a period of deprivation, the Tramp bursts in on the Gamin to triumphantly announce that the factory has reopened and is hiring workers. He then thrusts himself to the head of the queue of people fighting for a job and is one of the last to make it though the gates. At this point we have to remind ourselves that this is the very factory, and the very work, that drove him mad in the opening scenes.There is also a scene where the couple try to visualise what it might be like if they were leading normal, middle class, suburban lives, but it is not clear whether Chaplin regards this as desirable or simply as a bourgeois trap, so the sequence ends inconclusively.And so on.At this point, it might seem that I am saying this movie is almost completely worthless, but against all these criticisms must be set the wonderful elegance, grace and precision of most of the comic set pieces.Chaplin perfected his art in a long series of classic short films, where he used the camera very simply, to record his performances, not to create them. Despite his growing ambitions in the Twenties and Thirties I don't think he ever really developed beyond this stage. His feature films, like Modern Times, are really just a succession of more or less stand-alone sequences, loosely strung together. He was still making shorts.Modern Times is undoubtedly less than the sum of its parts, but I found that once I had accepted this I could appreciate that most of the parts were pretty damn good. In the end I didn't regret the ninety minutes I spent on it.If you just ignore the pretentious claims often made for this movie (and Chaplin's own pretensions) I think you will find that Modern Times still has a quite a bit to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cog among cogs - but the little Tramp has the final word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chaplin's "Modern Times" is exceptional for several reasons. With it one of the most well-known characters in cinema history, the beloved little Tramp, bids his farewell as the time of silents had definitely ended in 1935. Yet despite the odds are against him and his girl (played by his wife at the time, the gorgeous, cheeky Paulette Goddard), the Tramp's departure doesn't end on a sad note. Rather the both of them set out to greet the dawn, smiling in a heart-warming finale...But "Modern Times" is also a film that addresses the dehumanizing aspects the rationalization of labor brings to the modern employee, where the sheep flock into the factories only to become cogs among cogs in a machinery which eats them up. You can take that quite literally in a Chaplin film. And to this day the poignancy of Chaplin's ingenious take on the consequences of industrialization which he fights against as the black sheep are as valid as they were when the film was made. And as funny - after all it's perfectionist Charlie Chaplin who is at work here, who wrote, directed, composed music for and starred in his film. See him tighten screws at the conveyor belt and everywhere else he is not supposed to, head a communist movement, sink a ship, roller-skate with a blindfold, being fed by a new invention, or cause chaos in a magnificent set piece that could have been taken right out of "Metropolis". Oh, and then there's of course that famous one and only scene when the little Tramp finally does open his mouth and, well, he surprises once more as you may discover. The language of the little Tramp is universal, you know, regardless of culture, color or age...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all time classic with modern day themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1936's Modern Times finds Charlie Chaplin's iconic Tramp character at work in a modern, mechanized factory. He struggles to keep up with the ever quickening pace of the production line where he screws nuts onto bolts and suffers a mental breakdown. After being released from hospital, The Tramp finds himself as the accidental leader of a Communist rally and is thrown in jail. Once released he finds life in the Depression ruined 30s difficult but meets an orphan girl with whom he develops a friendship. The film then follows their ups and downs as they try to scrape by and stay out of jail.Modern Times is one of Chaplin's best remembered films and features some wonderful set pieces. Just some of the iconic scenes include; when he gets caught up in the cogs of the factory machines, when he mistakes cocaine for salt, when he roller skates blindfolded and when he is used to test a new feeding machine. All of these scenes are laugh out loud funny. While the film features some of Chaplin's funniest moments, the laughs are spread more thinly than in some of his earlier films. This is much more of a comedy/drama than out and out comedy.Chaplin's politics are obvious to see throughout. The opening scene shows sheep being lead out and then cuts to men streaming into a factory. Once inside, the workers are worked to exhaustion and we see the harsh conditions of the unemployed. Chaplin is later falsely accused of leading a Communist march and gets thrown in jail, an eerie premonition of what later happened to him. It is obvious that Chaplin blames modern industrialization for the conditions of the Great Depression and understandable why it came under scrutiny at the time.Chaplin is joined on screen by the beautiful Paulette Godard, who was also his wife at the time. Despite playing a homeless orphan she still manages to dazzle and is also superb in the more touching scenes. Chaplin as always is sublime. There are little touches in every scene that cement him as cinema's greatest entertainer.The film is still considered 'silent', despite it containing 'talkie' moments. Most of these moments come from inanimate objects or from one or two characters but I wish it had been one way or the other. It's a bit of a cop out to be a mixture of silent and spoken but by 1936 silent films were considered very old fashioned so its understandable why the decision to introduce some dialogue was made.Unfortunately, Modern Times was one of Chaplin's final films and the last to feature his Tramp character. For that reason its ending carries even greater significance and is wonderful. The film contains some of Chaplin's best moments and is a wonderful reminder of his genius and the class of his film making.www.attheback.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen many silent films, but it's more because of not having the opportunity to. Being in Film class here at my school has helped with that a lot though, and this is my second Chaplin film. It's rather amusing, charming, and entertaining. It's hilarious, especially in the first 20 minutes, and there's always enough wit and creativity from Chaplin. If there's one problem to be had it's that the gags do feel repetitive and overwhelming at times. I felt this way with The Kid as well though, and while it does lose me from time to time it doesn't damper my opinion of the film overall. Also interesting to note the background of the film, and the title. Chaplin makes a goofy, light-hearted comedy not just during one of the worst times the United States has ever had, but also taking place in the middle of it all. It's a good contrast in tone, but the reality is there. Definitely recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1936, and more recently in 2008, two different directors made two mostly silent film about a devoted worker who finds love against all odds. Both of these films infused slap-stick with societal satire and won audiences over with its charming characters. A factory worker discovers a waif and a trash compacter robot discovers a probe droid; Factory Worker is to Gamin as WALL-E is to EVE. Anyone familiar with the working industry can appreciate the sequence of a herd of sheep turn into a factory line of workers or when Chaplin has to improvise the words of a song with nonsense. My favorite scenes in Modern Times include the nervous breakdown at the beginning and the roller-skating tricks in the mall. A must-see for fans of classic comedy and aficionados of Chaplin!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin was clearly a true artist- because artists are the observant types who think ahead while everyone is worrying about the now. He was capable of seeing the negatives of advancements in technology long before James Cameron's 'Avatar' would dumb down our views of cinema as to no more than film being just a painting, and the screen its canvas.At first, I wondered why Chaplin would show several hundred sheep wandering toward the opening of the film, until realizing what it was entitled to represent- us. We are seen as cattle. All the men in the opening sequence go to work at the exact same time, all dress in the same outfit, and most of all, live their lives in routine. We often tend to go by the likes of what an authority wants us to do, otherwise without order we are lost.For example, The Tramp is arrested for allegedly "harassing" a poor woman, which was a simple misunderstanding resulted from being overworked. He is sent to prison for some time. Once he is released, he does everything in his power to be sent back to jail, because that is where he is most comfortable.The Tramp has difficulty adapting to society and is used to being in a place of the same ol' routine, constantly being told what to do, therefore he cannot make decisions for himself. This is what has happened to society- technology has overpowered us to the point where we have created machines which control human, rather than human controlling the machine.Another aspect I noticed from the film is how the workers and everyone else around use The Tramp as a scapegoat. They blame him each time there is an issue within the factory. Not only so, but the boss also uses him as a guinea pig when testing the feeding machine. He is their favourite outsider, who is simply too trusting and rather clumsy when handling large tasks. This makes it clear where the unique Tim Burton got his inspiration when creating the quirky Edward Scissorhands, another beloved underdog in cinema.When does it end? Where do we put a limit as to how far technology can lead, or will it be like the 2007 Will Smith film "I Am Legend", where a lone man is forced to face the results of the world we damaged because of technology? Chaplin was decades ahead of his time when asking such questions. He knew people would be over-dependent toward technology, to the point where one could not survive if their computer broke down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie Does It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed the silent movie and once again Charlie Chaplin delivers. Although I have yet to see all of his performances, this one so far is the best that I have seen. Not completely a silent movie due to sound effects and an added sound track yet still delivers the same charm and eloquence, and again Chaplin puts his signature comic styling together with compelling social commentary. In this film, Chaplin's character, The Tramp, is mainly a factory worker, yet he takes on many roles from factory worker, to ship hand, even an extremely happy occupant in the city jail. Of course at the time this movie was set, jail was at times the best place to be and The Tramp tries many times during the film to return to the jail where he was the most comfortable. Set in the depression, this film is Chaplin's protest against industrialization and modern advancements. It also shows what life was like during that time in American history.During the film, The Tramp is accompanied by The Gamin, a homeless girl portrayed by Paulette Goddard. The two characters meet while the Gamin is stealing bread and runs into Tramp while trying to escape. Different plot points throughout the film involve the two characters, who eventually fall in love. There are many other lively characters in the film, from the co-workers at the factory to the inmates at the jail, all of whom play into and off of Chaplin's talents. Keeping with the theme of man against establishment, the characters that Tramp interacts with run the gambit. He has run-ins with many different authority figures such a factory boss, a minister, a sheriff, a shipyard boss, and different managers. All of these people Tramp saw as the source for all his problems, but even with the string of bad luck, Tramp as always makes the best of the situation. A central motif or repeated idea in the film is common working man versus the establishment. No matter how hard he may or in some instances not try, he gets shot down, is brought back up and is shot down again. This film is Chaplin's rage against the industrialized age, and against the ones in charge of it. This idea remains prevalent throughout the entire film.Another technique that is quite interestingly used in this silent film was the use of sound. Even though this was a silent movie, it did have a soundtrack. Some of the characters have voice overs, and there is a singing track in the cafe scene. The song the Tramp sings is interesting to say the least. I am not sure if it was his voice they used, if it were, it was the only time I have ever heard it, but it worked very well and was an interesting tune.Well although not of the same genre, Modern Times theme is reminiscent of a movie I watched called Metropolis (1927). This film was set in the future but carried the same premise which is basically man versus the establishment. Not sure why Modern Times reminded me of it, Metropolis is an old film and a lot of it was lost,but the general theme is the same. Not saying that Modern Times is a socialist movie, but it was filled with much social commentary on the time.There are ideas in Modern Times that I generally do not agree with, but for the comedic value Chaplin does it again. The industrial revolution has brought great wealth, and yes great poverty. Chaplin adds those characteristics of good and evil with his vast talents and weaves out a movie that manages not only to encourage thought of the times he lived but bring a smile and a laugh to a time when there really was not much to laugh at. Well done Charlie, The Tramp lives on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin's last semi-silent picture, and his final appearance as the little tramp. It's also a not-so-subtle critique of the change in America's popular attitude during his professional heyday, decrying the abundance of automation in local factories while the great depression still raged on city streets. Despite the weighty deeper implications, it remains a genuinely charming set of skits and Chaplin is at his emotive, expressive best from curtain to curtain. The film gets bonus points for throwing its star into so many unique, visually spectacular situations, including what's probably his signature scene inside the belly of a giant, mechanical assembly line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern or not, times always get better ... with Charlie Chaplin ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Chaplin specialized in short films, which might explain that "Modern Times" seems a little bit too long. The film has undeniably this 'great classic' feeling that never quite deserts it, but still, somewhere in the middle, it kind of loses its track and becomes an assemblage of cute sketches without the relevance and the power of the first half.The opening of "Modern Times" announces an excellent satire encapsulating its era. The score almost reminds of Bernard Herrman's "Pscyho" music, something virtually thrilling and disturbing. Indeed, the film opens with a powerful visual metaphor, sheep running to the slaughterhouse. The image directly dissolves to workers in the subway going to factory. We're far from the laughs and tears of "City Lights" or "The Kid", Chaplin shows that he's not just a slapstick director, there's an engaged heart beating, and the movie is not just made for laughs. It's Chaplin's more mature film before "The Great Dictator" and only for that accomplishment, it deserves respect.And the first part doesn't disappoint this feeling. It's well crafted, with a sort of perfectionism a la "Metropolis", combined with an incredible social commentary on the role of the workers as human sheep in the 'Industrial New Order' ? and it's just so darn funny. The part is full of iconic moments like the working chain mocking the secondary effects of the Taylorism, the eating machine, and the famous breakdown, a symbol of the alienation of a man trapped in his own condition. The iconic image of Chaplin eaten up by the whizzing gears is the perfect symbol of a man who's become part of the industrial machine. He's a piece that can be replaced any time. Chaplin clearly denounces the dehumanizing effect of industrialization when even the most basic actions must be ruled by a mechanic system, an absurdity reaching its paroxysm with the eating-machine ? Chaplin even denounces the way denunciation is handled. In the scene where he was waving what seemed to be a red flag fallen from a truck, which was mistakenly taken as a protest march, a bunch of workers join him inviting the Police to put them to jail. The jail sequence is full of amusing gags, among which the one where after accidentally putting "nose-powder" in his plate, in an epic fight scene, Chaplin prevents prisoners from escaping and the jail becomes a haven of safety. The film doesn't just play on slapstick, there's a lot of irony going especially when, as a free man, Chaplin wants to stay, underlining the idea, that in those days, prisons at least guaranteed a roof, and regular food. The efforts, Chaplin, as the Tramp, put to go back to jail are not only hilarious but very eloquent about these hard days. A hardship endured by the heroine of the film, the Gamin.There's no Chaplin's story without romantic subplot, without the heart and the tears, and the Gamin part worked quite well. Paulette Goddard has such energy, dedication to her family, such vivacity sparkling in her eyes that "Modern Times" opens ours to the people's routine with the right mix of pathos and optimism. And the death of the father, and the social workers taking the orphans was a touching reminiscence of Chaplin's "Kid". Of course, there would be no doubt, the Gamin and the Tramp would end up together. But when they meet, something happens, it's like the romantic aspect submerged the social commentary, and maybe Chaplin meant it as a pause, but it's certainly not the highlight of the film.It happened twice so I don't think it's a coincidence if I didn't enjoy the dreamy parts, or the rediscovery of childhood's joy in the department store. The movie could have made it with the same length than "The Kid" and be still powerful. I also think the part where he went back to the factory was useless, we've had enough of the factory and it was perfect, why bringing back the same stuff? Chaplin is my favorite director so I must be sincere, especially since I appreciate the film, and that it doesn't end on a wrong note. Anyway, as someone said, every film should feature at least three memorable moments, in "Modern Times", there was the factory sequence, but it needed something else to lurch it into Pop Culture forever, among the greatest classics, and this was the Restaurant scene, "Garbo laughs!" for the first time in "Ninotchka", now, Chaplin "speaks"! Questioning the relevance of this scene in "Modern Times" would be pointless, and this reinforces my disliking of the previous scenes, which could have worked, had they been funnier. But the restaurant part still remains as one of the most enjoyable moments from any comedic film, especially when you know what will happen, when Chaplin will sing his most memorable song. It's gibberish, but the sound, the music, will become Chaplin's signature. Everything was perfect; the timing, the build-up and Paulette Goddard, as beautiful as ever, finally enchanting the screen without her dirty clothes, she was Cinderella in the ball, and her little seconds of dancing were pure beauty in motion. And Chaplin's meaningless lyrics still sound as the hymn of an era and the pride that conceding words doesn't mean making them intelligible. Chaplin knew how to make his scenes universally appealing and this one is stuck in memories forever.And the third last memorable moment comes at the end, where the Tramp and the Gamin, after so many misadventures walk into the sunset for a better future, with a shining smile in their face ? this is Chaplin reminding us that it's still about optimism, about laugh and joy. And that as long as there are men with dreams, with hearts full of love, times, modern or not, will be better ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ending is heartwarming and there are a few standout scenes here - Charlie's song and dance at the end, his rollerskating through the department store, and his being fed by the machine early on at the factory. Otherwise it is short on laughs, and the story feels like some loosely pieced together fragments that don't totally belong together.The 1930's camera seems drunk on its ability to move freely and as such can't stand still, panning slightly this way and that, and dollying when there is no cause to, and all the while being completely unable to mask the lack of laughs - the complete opposite of Charlie's best work, which could make you laugh despite the most simple of camera set ups.It is also difficult to believe the lead female is in poverty. She is made up, beautiful, dressed nicely enough and has a face full of laughter and charisma - impossible to believe the circumstances of her life have been too difficult, as the film wishes us too. The apparent confusion on whether it ought to be a silent or sound film adds to the problems, sometimes giving title cards and sometimes spoken word, and to top it all off, even Charlie's performance is not at his usual high standard - tending to overplay things.Thematically it is splitting. On the one hand it may be an argument for creativity and individuality amongst a rigid, soul-sucking, mechanical world - and this is a fine message - but on the other hand it glorifies thieves. All things considered, I would say modernization did not suit Charlie very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not Keaton, but still priceless. (spoiler in penultimate paragraph)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The myth of the Garden of Eden is so potent because it is true. When I was younger, I was innocently enraptured by Chaplin and his balletic sense of physical movement, and thought all his films were works of shining genius. But the more I read about them, and the more I learnt about cinema, the less miraculous they seemed. Critics' nagging made me see all the flaws, the hesitant construction, the lack of visual inventiveness, the replacement of emotional depth or ideas with sentimentality, especially in comparison with his dark contemporary, Buster Keaton. The apple of knowledge had soured a little my taste for the Little Tramp.So how does 'Modern Times', a film I once considered his masterpiece, and one of the great American movies, hold up? Pretty well, actually. While you look in vain for the layers and nuances of a Keaton, it is heartening to think that a film like this was made in the largely escapist Hollywood of the 1930s. It might seem trite to us now, but can you imagine what a largely working class audience must have felt seeing themselves compared to penned sheep at the beginning of a comedy? That first sequence, of automated men going to work in a ghostly, futuristic city is haunting, owing as much to T.S. Eliot's 'The Waste Land' as Lang's 'Metropolis'.Similarly, it is fashionable to mock Chaplin's political commitment, and not just in the light of his tax-exile in a Swiss chateau. It is true that every time the tramp is thrust unwillingly into a collective, a political protest, a strike or demonstration, he manages to duck it, his individuality shunning group responsibility. It is also true that the Victorian mugging of the Tramp and the gamin contrast with the rough facelessness of the masses. But in what other film, American or otherwise, in the period or now, will you see vicious policeman brutally attacking peaceful protestors, or have theft, flight and mockery of authorities shown as economic neccessities? The taking over the department store by convicts, thieves, juvenile delinquents and the unemployed may not be as potent as the Last Supper scene in 'Viridiana', but it comes close, and how many Americans actually saw Bunuel's film?My comparison to Bunuel is not entirely gratuitous, and is one way of insisting on Chaplin's modernity, to rescue him from a ghetto of expert vaudeville. There is one scene where the Tramp, the Gamin and a policeman fall out of a prison van. We don't see the physical act of falling, just the scatter of bodies. The framing of this shot, the stillness, the silver stylisation, the lighting, the gestures, jerk the film out of slapstick comedy into something as magical as Cocteau. A later scene, the Tramp dreaming of domestic life with the Gamin, is a superbly comic variation on this.Another sign of Chaplin's modernity is the treatment of the Tramp. If we see him as a continuous character, he might seem insufferably unctuous. But the Tramp isn't a coherent character, but a cipher who fits the demands of wildly differing scenes, who serves as a figure with which Chaplin makes satirical points. He is no more psychologically plausible than, say, Candide. His appalling treatment of his co-workers in the factory, his decency to the Gamin, his life in prison cannot be plausibly reconciled as coherent character development.This makes the narrative and the form that contains it more interesting and full of tensions. For instance, in the opening factory sequence, there is an obvious opposition between the worlds of management and workers which is dramatised in the difference between silent and sound cinema, the latter linked to authority (the boss speaks and looks through cameras and cinema screens), the former is physical, disruptive, linked to the body, a real body that, even just tweaked a little, can destroy the mechanical body of a huge firm (and maybe the body politic?). When the automated worker becomes a human, his disruption is expressed as sexual, as, in wonderfully bisexual fashion, he tweaks and chases workers and women (how did they get some of these scenes past Hays?).'Modern Times' might seem like a ragbag of barely connected sketches, but the governing metaphor of the film is the circle, from the clock over the opening credits and the circular mechanisms of the huge assembly-line machine, to the circles the Tramp skates, or the dance moves as he does his singing act. The circularity of mechanised life, of doing the same routine, is formalised by a structure in which the Tramp ends each sequence where he began, having to pick himself up and start again, hence the physical circles he makes. But the circle is at least familiar and reassuring - you know at least what's coming up. When the Tramp and Gamin finally break it, take to a straight road, we have no more idea than they do of what will happen to them, as brave a Hollywood ending as there has been, and probably the reason Fellini loved Chaplin so much and, yeah, me too.I would only like to add that Paulette Goddard is a remarkablly rare thing in a Chaplin film, a non-simpering woman - her bug-eyed first appearance, stealing bananas from a boat, knife in hand, and later eating a very suggestive spoil, throb with fierce, libidinal energy, like some demon from a German Expressionist film. And yet she convincingly matures into a strong, loving woman, one who gets her man a job. The other thing, continuing the theme of the physical body, is perhaps cinema's first gross-out sequence, as the Tramp as convict and a vicar's wife belch-spar each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Funny Chaplin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if Chaplin's comedies have not aged well or if he is just not funny. Considering all the critical acclaim he has received, I can only say that Modern Times is definitely majorly overrated. I'll just start off by saying I do not like Silent Films. Yeah call me what you want, but I do not like them. I think they are boring and have no place in today's modern times. Modern Times, get it? This will be the last silent film I will review for a while, not even giving City Lights a shot. I will, however watch the Artist and another Chaplin "classic": The Great Dictator. Let's see how those do, since this movie is not funny in almost any way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having enlisted the talents of Paulette Goddard, Chaplin speaks for the first time in cinematic history despite the fact that speaking films were in their ninth year. Again, his films are slow and mundane, but this one had prophetic overtones by speaking about the mechanical age when machines would take over manpower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Working For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know. Maybe silent films just don't work for me. I found this movie quite boring. The scenarios just didn't interest me and I found myself falling asleep.The exaggerated and extreme acting by the main character only seemed to annoy me. I didn't find it in the least bit funny.The music was whatever and the plot didn't really make me think, make me laugh, or make me curious as to what would happen next.I pretty much just continued watching this because I had started and because this movie got so much praise. Basically, I only finished it after I had started because this is on the top 250 list. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amusing semi-socialist picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting historical film. When it came out in 1936, the Depression was at its height and unemployment was rampant. Because of this, Socialism, Communism and unions were all on the rise. Considering how poor everyone was, these seemed like pretty attractive alternatives. This film was actually a radical political/social message wrapped up in comedy set in the very near future--if it had been presented as a drama, there's a good chance Hollywood would not have made the film. It's about the dehumanization of the worker and this movie as well as Chaplin's political leanings would later come back to haunt him during the Red Scare.But, back to the movie. This film is essentially a series of vignettes all strung together with a schmaltzy plot. It's a shame really, as all the vignettes are good but the plot that connects them is by far the weakest part of the film--partly because Paulette Goddard was NOT a teenager (she was just way too old to play the part) and partly because the moments between her and Chaplin tended to be the slowest and most saccharine in the film. Now I am not saying it's a bad film--far from it. It's just that this element is not the best aspect of the film. Chaplin's timing and athleticism is actually the star of the movie. The film is incredible to watch as he roller skates, glides through AMAZING looking machinery and almost dances through the film. It's a wonderful film technically and fun to watch.PPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies. After each one, my appreciation for his talents increased. In hindsight, I think a score of 9 is more in order. While it's true I'm not much for pathos, I must acknowledge his amazing talents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Here's a strange opinion: I think `City Lights' is one of the best and most important films ever made. It will always be required viewing for cineliteracy. This one is superficially similar, but not nearly as enjoyable or novel.Yes, the factory sets are well architected to participate in Chaplin's ballet. Yes, the then current Mrs Chaplin has an aggressive feline sensuality. Yes, Charlie's energetic approach and commitment is admirable. Yes, this is highly visual, especially compared to the word gags of the Marxes. But too many elements have become already formulaic.In `City,' there was a clear dependency of concept, clear to us as viewer but built into the story as well: - we knew that at root this was a coherent statement coming from one mind rather than the common case, films designed by committee.- we knew that the goal was to amuse us in the tradition of the British stage: fun at all costs using clever extensions of extremely familiar notions and techniques. The world of abstractions into which we agreeable enter was known beforehand and part of the amusement; how they are bent is part of the amusement.- clearly subservient to all this was the creation of the character in a context of social situations. The relative importance of those was important: `City' was intended as a creative endeavor whose success depended on a collaboration between him and what we brought. But look what has happened to `Modern.' The situation: the Tramp, the technology and personal context of the movie, social injustice all have taken on lives of their own and become additional participants in the contract. No longer can we `let our guard down' and participate. Now we have to worry about how to receive the `message' of the movie.In this project, the hierarchy is all reversed. There is an element of overt social commentary, something that would become even more evident with the Hitler film. But there it is so bold and imaginative it is admirable in its own right.There is also the elevation of the familiar over the novel. There is no innovation here, in fact the whole idea is to emphasize the familiar. He himself is guilty of the same mechanical thinking he criticizes.That's the strange thing for me: the same recipe in two films with the slightest variation on emphasis: one is transcendental, the other amusingly troubled.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very difficult to believe the amount of pretentious waffle that has been written about this film. I am not a film student and so I can only guess that the film is taught to gullible undergraduates as an all-time masterpiece containing multiple levels of deep meaning concerning the loss of human identity in modern industrial society. It is nothing of the sort. It is a rather tedious mix of sentimentality and slapstick, and was anachronistic even when it was made in 1936 in that it pretends to be from the silent era, which had ended in 1927.To be fair, there are a few funny scenes, all of which take place in the factory. The ones involving food are the best. All the scenes outside the factory are boring and many of them are hopelessly sentimental. The music, composed by Chaplin, is horrendous. Chaplin's wife is pretty, but can't act.If the film had had a proper story developing the factory theme it could have been better. As it is, it is a typical collection of music hall / vaudeville set pieces which are only loosely connected. Many of these scenes do not advance the plot and aren't funny. The scene where Chaplin sings is also not at all funny.In my view Chaplin was a one-trick pony with one character and a silly walk. What he does, he does well, but there is really no range in it, and those who claim there is are deceiving themselves.In short - there is no deep meaning to the film at all - don't believe those who say there is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this review (if anyone reads it) will get way more negative votes than positive ones. It easily makes my list of worst movies I have actually finished of all time with McClintock, Twilight and Bus Stop. There are other worse movies that I have turned off.Nothing about this was funny. Perhaps all the things that are clichd to me were new 75 years ago when this movie was released. Even if that is so it doesn't help my opinion of it today. I honestly believe I would have found them clichd even in the movie's own age. To think of other similarly released films like Gone With the Wind and then to consider how backward and simple this movie is only underscores how out of place it is in our time. There is only so much hapless buffoon I can take in a movie. This film crossed that threshold and left it in the dust before the first minute had passed. Then there were 87 more of those minutes.The female lead is not as bad as Charlie Chaplin. For what it's worth her physical appearance reminds me a bit of Emily Deschanel of Bones fame. It may be that she is on screen less and thus doesn't wear as thin as Charlie does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a new, restored print of MODERN TIMES opened locally, itwas a chance to see a "classic" silent just as its original audiencedid almost 60 years ago. The print was magnificent, with a crystalline image quality and richsound. The film, sadly, was not quite as fresh. Chaplin dusts offhis hobo character yet again, and creates a series of set piecesthat are humourous to be certain -- but annoyingly inconsistent.The skating routine rates as a classic; others come off as old, oreven forced (like his nearly epiletic wrenchwork that lands him in amental hospital). In other words, it's broad physical comedy with atrademark humanism. It may be time to reevaluate what constitutes a "classic" film. ITHAPPENED ONE NIGHT, from the very early '30s, is as fresh andfunny today as when it was released. MODERN TIMES comes offlike a dusty antique. One audience member behind me laughed, and loudly. at everyjoke and pratfall. The dry, over-loud laughs gave one the feelingthat he was responding to what he felt he should be laughing at,rather than what was inherently funny. Maybe it's time foraudiences in general to respond honesty to a film itself, and not itsaustere reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what anyone says, this is a dreadful film.I laughed about 4 times during the whole thing. A lot of predictable, obvious, unclever slapstick, and awful lot of it really contrived or just stupid (I longed for death during the interminable scene where he goes round and round the dance floor carrying the tray).But the worst part of all was the "social commentary" aspect. This film is pure Luddite-ism. In a nutshell, Chaplin couldn't handle the fact that technology-- talkies-- was displacing him and his silent movie approach, and so he railed against all technology. NINE YEARS after talkies came in, he's still stubbornly clinging to silents; apparently these "talking pictures" are just a fad. It's the most pathetic of crusades.Oh, and it's not hard to see why people thought Chaplin was a communist. The character of the owner of the steel mill might as well have leapt off the pages of Marx himself, he's such a grotesque caricature of a capitalist, sitting around doing jigsaw puzzles, reading comics, and yelling at the proletariat to work faster.Happily, for the most part, the movie doesn't maintain this virulently anti-capitalistic tone. But its attempt to capture the pathos of the depression is itself pathetic. When the factory reopens, Chaplin exclaims "Work at last!"-- but the reality is that he's already had THREE jobs during the movie, and he lost ALL of them through his own incompetence, not because of the depression. The great moral stance that this movie takes is that it glorifies bunglers and thieves.Let it not be said, though, that I found nothing good in the film. Chaplin's stunt work (I assume that was actually him) in the blindfolded rollerskating scene is mindbogglingly good. Truly remarkable. I'd gladly trade the whole rest of the film for just that scene.</fullReview>
