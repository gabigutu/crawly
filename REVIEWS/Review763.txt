		<shortDescription>20-somethings and the Goonies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just prior to graduating with a degree in Film Studies a lecturer asked us, "So what's your favourite film now?" Whilst my peers spouted out Goddard films and obscure German expressionist shorts I sat quietly thinking; my favourite film has been My Favourite Film since I was seven... So when it came to me and I mumbled "The Goonies", I was expecting scorn, ridicule and possibly minor injury, but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of "Hey you gu-uys!" from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies; mention it in a room full of twenty-somethings and they'll whell up and utter "Sloth loves Chunk" or adopt a harassed Chinese tone "Thats what I said...Booty traps!". And if that room happens to be a pub, several chairs will scrape back and semi-inebriated grown men will lift their shirts, shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it's an Indiana Jones wanna-be I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We'd loved seeing Indiana's adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the mini-Indies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film, we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes, and we wanted to protect them, and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why, as adults, we quote them and 'become' them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy, having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey! I also think that this is why Goonies 2 is such a relevant and exciting concept. We've all grown up together and I'd love to see how the guys are doing now...I just hope it doesn't disappoint... So if you've not seen it do it right now, and if you have kids sit them down, hold their hand through the scary bits and enjoy! They'll thank you in twenty years time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goonies r good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who grew up in the 80's will list the Goonies as one of their favourite films, or at least look back at it with a misty eye.It had everthing you could want, thrills, spills, pirates, booty, adventure, freaks and bad guys. I just wanted to be a Goonie or go on a Goonie style adventure. Even the place where they lived was cool. A big old house in a picturesque bay town. You don't get houses like that in England. The only interesting thing you would have found in my loft would have been a dead pidgeon.Then there were the Goonies themselves who just seemed so cool. Data's gadgets and smart mouthed ..erm.. Mouth.We are first introduced to them one by one in the fantastic introductory sequence. The bad guys of the piece, the Fratellis, organise a jailbreak in a huge 4x4. In the process of doing so they speed past every member of the Goonies, introducing their character traits. Then they all get together at the leader Mikies house and just doss around for a while feeling sorry for themselves, because a property magnate wants to but there little town and turn it into a country club (although the bay looks like it would make a poor golf course, but hey). So this is the Goonies last day together and they have to do something about it. And don't they just.What follows is like a comedy Hardy Boys crossed with a game of Mousetrap. Some of the set pieces are genius (the pirate, One eyed Willie, had a penchant for elaborate traps to stop people pinching his booty) and the sets are equally inventive. The gang get themselves into various scrapes with the traps, or the Fratellis or both and somehow always come out on top.Richard Donner's direction is always brisk, the young actors performances are superb (specially the fantastic 'Chunk'), the senior cast is very good and the dialogue is chock full of hilarious lines.I must admit I look back at it through rose tinted glasses. I was in awe of it when I was a kid, and now when I watch it, it reminds me of my childhood and all the things that was great about it. I cant fault the Goonies, even now. I still believe it is the perfect kids film.I am probably preaching to the converted, but if you havent seen the Goonies, go and buy it now! And if you don't like it, what the hell is wrong with you!?!?!?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Goonies ARE good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was in 2001 or thereabouts that I watched and listened to the audio commentary track that is on the DVD version of The Goonies. Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, and seeing how the principal cast had aged (or hardly aged in Josh Brolin's case) was worth the price of admission on its own. But this is just one of The Goonies' selling points. Despite what the IMDb's ratings would have you believe, it is an immortal classic that warrants repeated and frequent viewings. It is not a coincidence that many of its cast and crew have repeatedly appeared in all sorts of productions before and since. Indeed, this was probably the first film that introduced me to the reality that the same actor will often play ten different parts in ten different films when I realised that Jonathan Ke Quan was the same brat that made parts of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom so amusing. Seeing him in the video-enhanced commentary of the DVD nearly two decades later was a surprise and a half.The film revolves around a group of children and adolescents who live in the poorer, less trendy part of a beachfront town. Unlike an episode of Barney, every member of this principal group is given a background and a string of differences from their castmates. You will not see the teenaged Brand responding to the same situation in the same manner as the ten year old Mikey, and that is where a major part of the film's strength is derived. The only weakness in the characterisations is with Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green, who join the adventuring boys a little way into the film. Exactly what they are doing other than giving the character of Brand something similar to himself to bounce his more adult-oriented lines from is anyone's guess, but they do work in their limited capacity. It is just a pity that Chris Columbus' screenplay did not give them a little more to do, other than defuse one fiendish trap towards the end of the ride.Speaking of fiendish traps, the adventurers journey from one puzzling location to the next with barely a stop for breath. It works because unlike similar adventure films where the director expects us to be impressed by a fiendish-sounding name, the specific places that are visited by the Goonies have function. The bone piano shown in one such sequence, for example, would appear in the nightmares of children learning a regular piano for years after the film's theatrical release. It also gives Corey Feldman a good chance to act out a character who speaks very fluent Spanish. And while I am on that subject, who could forget the immortal scene early on in the film where Mouth deliberately loses something in the translation when Rosalita is shown around? But the prize for scene-stealing goes to John Matuszak, who plays the unofficial eighth Goonie, Sloth, with a weird aplomb that may well scare the willies out of parts of the intended audience. But then, in 1985, scaring the intended audience a little was considered a healthy part of making a film for those in the age ranges depicted here.They say you cannot have a good protagonist without a good antagonist to bounce off. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano, and Anne Ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose the rule about not working with animals or children. The Fratellis work so well here because they are working with children. The late Anne Ramsey played her part so well that the mere thought of watching her in anything scared the willies out of me for years. Nowadays, as I have fully realised the mechanics behind film for some years, I am keen as mustard to see some of her other work in such pieces as Throw Momma From The Train (now there's a title that brings images to mind) or Meet the Hollowheads. That a performance can produce two entirely different reactions in the same person at different stages of their life should tell you all you need to know about its quality. Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here, but the manic, cackling quality of their introductory act also left quite a lasting impression.You might have noticed that I have so far only mentioned the special effects in passing while heaping praise upon the acting. This is because unlike films such as the recent Star Wars prequels, the effects complement the acting rather than overshadow it. From what I am able to tell, all of the effects in The Goonies are practical, and some of them quite inventive. There is no use of blood squibs, which may disappoint some viewers, but there are enough mechanical sets and air vents to fill three films. Some of these effects did not turn out so well and were cut from the final film (the squid sequence being the most famous example), but unlike a lot of films that depend on special effects for a crucial element, everything shown in the final cut is in perfect sync here. Suspension of disbelief is never an issue, which is just as well considering some of the preposterous things that roll by the screen with a certain nonchalance.I gave The Goonies a ten out of ten. Like Superman or the original Lethal Weapon, it shows that Richard Donner knows how to make a classic. Now that it is twenty years old, it stands forever as a relic of a time when the world of those under the age of eighteen was far less oppressive. If you have not introduced your children around the age of ten or greater to its joys and moments, then shame on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun fun fun, but first you have to do the truffle shuffle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Treasure hunts. Who doesn't remember digging under the porch, in creekbeds, hollowed out logs, etc to find the buried treasure you just KNOW is hidden there somewhere? The Goonies is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.I absolutely loved this movie. It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids. Of course the movie has moments of predictability, and no, the villains aren't all that intimidating...they're actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in (don't judge by appearances, right vs. wrong, etc), overall, The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.There isn't a character in this movie I didn't fully enjoy watching...you have the dim-witted, evil Fratelli's, heavy-set, melodramatic Chunk, Data with his "booty traps...that's what I said, booby traps" galore, the odd-looking but loveable Sloth, and Mouth with his, well, Mouth. Those are only a few...there are many more. A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments (the Truffle Shuffle). I've seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again.This is absolutely a pure, fun-filled movie to enjoy with your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, or simply by yourself. Hang on and enjoy the ride! The Goonies earns a solid 5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steven Spielberg exercises the farthest reached of his imagination in this unforgettable tale of childhood adventures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every kid has imagined what it would be like to go on great and glorious adventures. Pirate ships, police chases, treasure chests full of gold and surrounded by human skeletons with patches over the eyes, the inherent excitement in the possibility of a cavernous wonder world beneath the very streets where they live. The Goonies is about a group of kids who have grown up together and are about to be torn apart because their parents are being forced to sell their homes. In the attic of one of their houses (Mikey, played by Sean Astin), they find an endless supply of fascinating things - treasure maps, paintings, cryptic writings in strange languages. They find a map that sounds promising, and decide to see if it has any value, hoping to be able to find enough treasure to prevent their parents from losing their homes. Not only was The Goonies a brilliantly written, directed, and acted movie, but it was also so much FUN! The adventures of these kids through the underground world, while being chased by the despicable villains known as the Fratellis, are fascinating to watch. The Goonies is a great cinematic experience. It has everything that anyone who was ever a kid could ever want. Even the elaborate sets are very convincing. The sense of adventure and hope that are presented in The Goonies is very uplifting and inspiring. The lovable characters are perfectly developed and endlessly entertaining. Many of them, particularly Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, delivered the best performances of their future careers right here in this early adventure film. This movie can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, which is one of its best values. It is truly timeless, and it should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>80s adventure flick revives childhood memories!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw THE GOONIES was at a friend's house right when it was a "new release" on video. After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a "Goonie" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including "Data" and his supply of gadgets, and "Chunk" with his obese but likeable image (love that "Truffle Shuffle"!). But "Sloth" easily stole the show with his own likeable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually "good enough" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying! After all these years, I'm STILL waiting for a sequel!HIT PUREE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 80s flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love The Goonies. It is a classic 80s children-adventure film. They don't make movies like this anymore... of if they do, its children hurting other children (Cruel Intentions... etc). I do miss that from the 80's... during that time you can have an adventure film that relies on humor and "monsters" without an overt display of violence and sex like in todays "PG13" movies. Anyway.. I rant...I love all the characters from The Goonies. Chunk is my fav (truffle shuffle, hostage crisis, Dead things Mikey! Dead Things!, and when he starts spatting off Hebrew when he is captured by the Frattellis). Its amazing to see the changes in Josh Brolin (Brandon) from back then to his performances today.I have this movie although it must be a edited version because I heard there was an octopus scene in the uncut version.. Haven't seen it yet.I heard they were going to make a sequel.. My question.. Why!?! Don't ruin a good thing. Leave it alone and walk away. Resist all urges for a money-grubbing "typical hollywood second release" scenario.I love the music from The Goonies as I am a huge 80's music fan.Lastly, the scene is beautiful. I live in Portland, Oregon and have traveled to Astoria several times.. It is a pitty to know that the last time I was in Astoria, the house featured in the movie was run-down and looked to be vacant.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well,well,well.......this film has became one of my all-time favorite movie!The first time i watched the movie i just couldn't help myself wishing I was there with them.The movie is so full of adventure!But what really bothered me was the exact date it was filmed!Oh my gosh it was dated back in 1985!I was not even born by that time.....But hey they did a pretty good job!I wish i could owned this in DVD so i can watched anytime &amp; show this to my children.But it was so hard to find. So i guess i just had to stick to our cable.It was amazing to see Sean Astin(Mikey)so young and active.You could certainly see the difference he is now in Lord of the Rings trilogy. The story isn't like any...it was so unique!The place and view are awesome and was actually filmed in the City of Astoria.My favorite character is Mikey and Josh.They are two brothers who wants to help their parents.So Mikey,being the youngest wants to find that treasure to save them from Troy's dad.My favorite lines were.... "When you look in the sky,it will be another town,when you see your friends,it will be in another school".It's kinda touchy and sentiment....but good!I remember the new album of Ataris(So long Astoria)where it became one of their song.I was reading the lyrics and there was a similarity in the movie.The last part goes like this,"So long Astoria,i found a map to buried treasure and even if we come home empty-handed we still have our stories of pirate ships &amp; wounded hearts,broken bones and the best of friendships.&amp; when this hourglass out its final grain of sand.I raised my glass to the memories we had.This is my wish,i'm taking them back,I'm taking them all back."I remember mouth said the last lines when they were trapped inside the cave.I guess the band members of Ataris saw the movie in their childhood years and like them,we were spell-binded by its great story.So long The Goonies,you will be remembered as one of the most amazing movies we had.Just like the movie,"The relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks only they're gone faster than the smell of the rain."But for now,you became a resurrected memories from ashes in our childhood dreams.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to our childhood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when boys would spend a whole day watching their favorite heroes, dreaming of riding a crusade against Darth Vader's Empire or fighting the enemies among the Knights of the Round Table. Just like in the Fantasy Island, where Mr. Roarke and Tatoo would make all one's wishes come true, The Goonies has the special talent to bring our childhood fantasies back and remind us how great those years were.In this 1985 movie, a bunch of kids find a map which indicates the spot where the evil pirate One-Eyed-Willie buried a big treasure stolen from English ships in the 1500's. As we can predict, they decide to seek for the gold and precious stones to help their parents who are about to be expelled from their homes because they can't make ends meet and also because some wealthy men want to put their houses down to build a country club on it's place. Dangers, traps and even a family of thieves - the Fratelli - are after them.As the film goes on, we can see how closer the friends get and how supportive we all should be. They would always be there for each other, no matter how deep their problems are. Even a rich girl, Andy, is accepted by the group, in a very politically correct act, where no distinctions are made. The scene in which the guys are stuck in a hole, is very touching and really digs our sense of aid.Richard Donner directed this movie and another famous director, Chris Columbus wrote the screenplay, based on a Steven Spielberg's story. Matt Sweeney was responsable for the special effects and the main theme ( They 'r good enough ) was written and performed by Cindy Lauper.After the film, none of the kids became famous actors. Corey Feldman and Kerry Green took part in some teenage comedies, while Sean Astin showed up in "Memphis Belle" and Ke Huy Quan was the young Indiana Jone's chinese taxi driver in "The Temple of the Doom". The only one who joined some serious projects was Martha Plimpton.But these are just technical details. What really counts in "The Goonies" are the two hours of humanity, pleasure, inocence, friendship - and even the first love - that only children can show in their eyes. In fact, it's a small journey to our past, to a time when your deepest worries were about the girl (or the boy) on the next chair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the coolest adventure movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is eternally a terrific movie that anyone could easily fall in love with. I was a little surprised honestly that this movie isn't on the top 250, because it seems like everyone agrees with me that this is just a plain excellent movie. After all, it is directed by Steven Spielberg, when has he ever misled us? I think this movie is sort of like a time capsule, because you can tell that it was made in the 80's, but it'll forever remain a treasure that will pass on from generation to the next.It's about these pre-teen boys who are about to loose their houses to the local rich guys who will turn their houses into a golf course if their parents don't come up with the money that's wanted. When Mikey, the leader of the Goonies, gets his hands on his father's treasure map that belongs to his museum, he shows his friends, including his older brother, Brandon, that maybe this could be their last adventure to find the treasure and pay off the rich guys! Brandon, his girlfriend, Andy, her friend, Steph, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and Mikey come together to find the treasure. But it's gonna be hard when on the run Fratelli's want the treasure as well and will try to get there first! The Goonies are just so lovable and I would always recommend this not only for the family, but for yourself as well. Because it has great lines, exciting scenes, and just a fantastic story. Not to mention all the future stars who are in this film like Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, and Robert Davi. There are a few slight goofs that you notice off the bat, but you get past them because it's just such a charming movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are an adult and haven't seen it already, then don't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 18 when this was released. Just a little bit too old for it. Over the decades I've heard people just a few years my junior rave about this as if it were an Indiana Jones or a gremlins or the like. So finally at the ripe old age of 46 I've had a look. I cannot believe the hype for this. The director's overriding instruction to the actors, seems to have been, shout and scream and say your dialogue whilst everyone else is saying theirs. That will keep the audience thrilled and excited. It gave this member of the audience a headache. The storyline is weak, the characters 2 dimensional and the script is dire. I kept thinking these kids must be off their Ritalin. It was like an onslaught of annoyance. I get that people are nostalgic for movies they saw when they were kids. I still think jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, whereas people younger than me can't abide the plastic shark. But really, I'm amazed that so many people still seem to rate this. I challenge anyone over 40 (in 2013), who hasn't already seen this movie as a kid, to like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's definitely not "good enough"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember as a kid wanting The Goonies to be great, but when I saw it something felt wrong about it. I thought it was okay, but knew it was lacking. I recently saw it again (20 years later), and I know what the problems are. Bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. Everyone yells practically nonstop in the film. You don't believe for a second that any one of these kids is a real person. There's one hint of a decent performance when Sean Astin is recounting the story of One Eyed Willy to his friends in an out of breath monologue. I won't blame the kids, but Spielberg and Donner. Chris Columbus' script felt slapped together in a weekend (probably was under the orders of Spielberg). I have friends who love it, and have fond memories of it as kids, but I guess I've always been overly critical. It's just that I wanted more as a kid. I wanted the same feeling I had when watching Raiders for the first time, or Back To The Future. Those films had something that The Goonies lacked. I'm in the minority, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good natured and spirited adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When he learns his family are to be relocated away from their home, Mikey (Astin) and his friends The Goonies set out on one last adventure to find a Pirate's lost treasure.The stars of tomorrow. The kids are out future. Whatever expression you choose, it can be applied to this good natured romp that sees modern day stars in their opening roles.Sean Astin, who leads the way splendidly, would soon be hailed to fail in the Lord of the Rings trilogy whilst Josh Brolin would take up award winning roles in No Country for Old Men.But of course this was the time before such accolades and so we settle for more subdued but more fun style acting in a charming adventure that has the energy and mystery of an Indiana Jones adventure, if not the sophisticated mythology and independence.The opening scenes see a charming if highly unrealistic prison breakout that starts our adventure off in thrilling fashion. Followed sweetly by the sharp and memorable introduction of The Goonies and you'll be forgiven for smiling from ear to ear. Jonathan Ke Quan's introduction is one to not be spoiled, but watch out for never has a young actor made such an exciting appearance.As we have a political message thrown in and some sloppy information encoded for historical emphasis, we are finally under way with the group setting off on an adventure to recover the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The idea sounds absurd, and in many degrees it is. In context the whole idea of getting treasure to save their house seems far-fetched and a last ditch attempt but thankfully we can almost ignore the obscurity of this goal and simply sit back and enjoy the thrills and comedy spills along the way.There are some marvellous set pieces juxtaposed with stunning semiotics of piracy. The boat itself is a symbol of true fantasy gold and the sweeping set montages do justice to the story's potential. The action and adventure side, whilst Indiana Jones obstacles, is nonetheless fun and exciting and true gold for the younger viewers.When combining two such different genres in comedy and adventure it is easy to give one away to the other but somehow writer Spielberg and director Donner maintain both in equal balance, which is a stunning achievement given the complexity of different personalities of The Goonies and the massive adventure on hands, which makes this a wonder in itself.Where The Goonies falls is it's lack of realism in context. There are too many close calls and just in time moments and there seems to be lacking any real consequence, maybe because the characters are kids to give the viewers a more relaxed viewing.But this 1985 release is visually stunning, balancing the genres on equal length and when the laughs come, they really do. It's no Indiana Jones substitute but it is a smash</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm properly writing this at least 20 years too late but for anyone who hasn't seen this movie it is the ultimate must see. The film has lots of comedy moments as well as the love shared between friends. The Goonies is a classic film that has stood the test of time, and no matter how old you get and how many times you have seen this film you never get sick of it. It has a treasure hunt, pirates, and villains. The cast are brilliant and the storyline fantastic. We all wanted to be Goonies and I personally still do, it should remain as one of the most successful 80's movies ever, a classic in its own right. And deserves its place as one of the top family movies.</fullReview>

On that same day, Several families are devastated that they are losing their homes. Since the rich are turning their homes into a golf course. An young 13 year old boy (Sean Astin) discover a map that could lead to the missing treasure from a missing pirate ship.

This was one of the biggest hits of 1985. This is high energy film, which it was consider as mess by some critics. If "The Goonies" is a mess, it is an entertaining mishmash.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer an fine, digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's best feature is the commentary track by the director and the cast. which they are seen in the commentary on video at several moments. DVD includes Deleted Scenes, Behind the Scenes featurettes, original theatrical trailer and a two part music video.

		<shortDescription>Hands up, who wants to be a Goonie...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time before disassociated, mean-eyed teenagers, wore hooded tops, carried knives, bothered people on street corners, and passed the time drinking cider and daisy-chaining one another. This was a time when Michael Jackson moon-walked his way into the hearts of millions, Indiana Jones cracked his whip from jungle to desert, James Bond shot and slept his way around the world without a hint of self-mocking post-modern irony, and kids watched, enjoyed, and wanted to be in, The Goonies.Written by Stephen Spielberg, and directed by Richard Donner, The Goonies is a hugely entertaining film that encapsulates the naivety and sheer sense of adventurous fun that will forever be associated with the 1980's. The film follows the adventures of six friends led by Mikey Walsh, (Sean Astin) who in the best tradition of Robert Louis Stephenson's Treasure Island, find themselves hunting for the hidden treasure of the legendary infamous pirate One Eyed Willy. This is no idle adventure however as finding the booty will enable them to save their homes which face demolition to clear the way for a luxury country club.The film works so well because along with an exciting storyline, witty script, clever balance between comedy and tension, Spielberg, Donner, and the young cast have invested it with a youthful and at times anarchic energy that grabs the audience from the opening jail break right up until the closing credits. Anne Ramsey, Joe Pantoliano, and Robert Davi, play the villainous Fratelli family with just the right mixture of fun and menace. Mama Fratelli's 'tongue' is the only thing on the menu reply to a cocky request for food by Clark 'Mouth' Devereaux (the very funny Corey Feldman) is guaranteed to garner laughs aplenty, but through closed mouths of course.As well as the obvious nod to Stephenson, the film also lends from Bond, (Ke Huy Quan's gadget inventing 'Data' models himself on 007) Indiana Jones, (Spielberg's influence can be seen throughout the film but not least in the booby-trapped hidden caves) and also The Hardy Boys, and Scooby Doo. The tradition of youngsters roving off to have adventures and solve mysteries is not new, it can be seen in Ransome's Swallows and Amazons, Blyton's The Famous Five, Hitchcok's The Three Investigators, Lewis's Narnia books, and many other sources. They have all gripped our collective imagination at one stage or another and happily The Goonies does the same.The success of the film is helped in no small way by the impressive set design and location of the film in the leafy town of Astoria, Oregon. If ever there was a place in which adventure was to be had Astoria is it. Sit back then, relax, and free yourself of cynicism, because as an audience it is 'our time' to enjoy the magic that is The Goonies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It must be a nostalgia thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have friends who grew up in the 80s who swear that The Goonies is one of the greatest adventure films ever made. Being in my late teens at the time, I was a little too old to be interested when it first came out, and having finally caught up with the film nearly thirty years later, I can definitely say that I'm waaaay too old for it now. Although I'm usually a sucker for films involving the search for long lost treasure, this noisy, chaotic, poorly acted, desperately unfunny, unexciting waste of a big budget had me wishing I'd never bothered to see what the fuss was all about.When the most comprehensible lines of dialogue in the whole film come from a mentally disabled, drooling freak called Sloth and a character played by Anne Ramsey, then I know I'm in for a rough time. Quite why Spielberg and Donner opted for such an obnoxious collection of unruly brats for this film I'll never understand, the kids' incessant unintelligible screaming seriously grating on the nerves. Until now, I've always had time for Corey Feldman and Sean Astin, but here they are mostly unbearable; even worse are Ke Huy Quan as amateur inventor Data and loud-mouthed tub of lard Chunk, played by Jeff Cohen, both of whom deliver utterly charmless performances.If, like me, you've successfully avoided seeing this film for several decades, I suggest that you keep on doing so and save yourself the disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where's my aspirin? After watching this I have a headache. I must be one of the only people in the world who dislike this movie. Granted, I did not see it as a kid. As an adult, I found it obnoxious beyond belief mostly because of all the constant chatter and screaming. "Ahhhhhh" throughout the movie made me spend a lot of time fast forwarding. The stereotyping was beyond annoying; this is the kind of movie that gives kids permission to think its OK to be annoying and behave like dodos. Yes, I know it was a spoof, but it was still too moronic and sophomoric for my tastes.The script jumped around and didn't make sense in many places. And tell me why anyone would believe they were building a golf course in the hills of Astoria Oregon. The main house sits on a hill unsuitable for a golf course. We must have had a lot more tolerance for bad scripts in the 80's. I've seen a variety of 80's movies which had awful scripts and were nominated for Oscars.The Spiderwick Chronicals are 100% better. In fact, I can't think of a worse kid's movie than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The missing link between "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and "Stand by Me"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it's a fitting coincidence that it stars Ke Huy Quan, the kid who loved Indy one year before, and Corey Feldman who didn't want to be called crazy, the year after.But it's not just a matter of chronology, "The Goonies" marks a climactic point in the 80's with all the craze for youth-oriented escapism and more-or-less comedic adventure movies, released the year of "Back to the Future" and when Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus combined their talents again to make "Young Sherlock Holmes". I just watched this film a few days ago and looking at "The Goonies" again, I was thinking of that moment where Watson and Holmes are about to ride a sort of flying bicycle for the first time, a scared Watson asks "where have I gotten myself into?" to which Holmes answers "the adventure of a lifetime".The more I think of this sublime exchange, the more I appreciate its resonance in the very context of the 80's, and more specifically when Richard Donner directed "The Goonies". Movies were all about 'adventures of a lifetime' in that glorious decade, inaugurated with the iconic images of Indiana Jones escaping a giant boulder, children flying away from the Police to get "E.T" back home and so forth. The Goonies are like Elliott's friends playing Indiana Jones, living an adventure whose quest might not be as noble as in "E.T." (it's a treasure, something tangible like in Indiana Jones) but it does carry some symbolic value like living the last adventure before one of them leaves the town, enjoying youth, or less pompously: to have fun. And even if some of them, like the big brother Brand (Josh Brolin) or the two girls (Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton) wonder where they've gotten themselves into, they stick together nonetheless and enjoy (once again) the 'adventure of a lifetime'.And I think the reason why the film isn't as humanistic as "E.T." and borrows more from the 'Indiana Jones" franchise is because Spielberg didn't want to make some sort of hymn to childhood, which explains why for the sake of realism, there's a lot of profanity and many moments where kids talk and shout at the same time and it's barely audible. Despite some similarities, we're far from the universe of Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn where the two boys quietly wandered on the Mississippi River and where Injun Joe was really scary. In "The Goonies", there's no room for 'drama-realism' or 'dreamy-humanism' and Spielberg and Donner inject as many archetypes as possible. Sean Astin is Mikey, the voice of reason, the leader, the one who needs the treasure the most so his Dad can keep their house so it's not just about greed. He also respects the Pirate One-Eyed Willy, Mouth is the comic relief, Data is the nerd and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) is the fat insecure kid.And there are also a bunch of Italian-American gangsters, the Fratellis, played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantaliano, and Anne Ramsey's as their scary-looking Mama, the Fratellis contribute to one of the best moments of the film, the opening chase sequence and its catchy theme, and the hidden (and hideous) third brother Sloth (John Matuszak) would have felt like a gratuitous addition if his relationship with Chunk wasn't so touching and poignant. Only two outcasts can understand each other, the Fratellis and the Goonies were already outcasts, but when you're the fat, clumsy, talkative and misunderstood kid of the bunch (no way to go through life), maybe it takes a criminal Family's offspring who looks like a cross between Quasimodo and a Garbage Pail Kid to become your friend. In some weird twisted way, there are some Elliott-E.T. vibes in that relationship between Chunk and Sloth but I wonder if Steven Spielberg didn't mean that in a self-parodying way.Indeed, "The Goonies" is action-packed, filled with chases, screams, long slides, booby traps, romantic kisses in the dark, scary cadavers and skeletons, it's perhaps the most blatantly and shamelessly adventurous film of the 80's involving kids before a change of settings in 1986 with "Stand By Me". In Rob Reiner's film, the kids' quest will carry more macabre undertones, they go to find a body and get some publicity, but in the end, they choose the wisest solution and call the Police, it's the ultimate coming-of-age film. Kids grow up, their maturity also conveys the feeling of a lost innocence, emphasized by the epilogue that gives away the fates of the protagonists, and not all of them are pleasing. The 80's slowly slide toward the 90's realism so "The Goonies" is the last hurrah of kids-oriented movie, the same year where Marty McFly visits the past, where we get to the past of Holmes and Watson, the Goonies visit the past of their town Astoria, and fix one thing or two in their lives.In a way, it's like Spielberg revisiting his own childhood and translating his memories into the film. Of course, his perfectionism was more palpable in "E.T" which had a personal meaning and he directed it himself. There's some naivety in the way kids behave in "The Goonies", trying to sound too cool and too smart at the expenses of realism, but the film is so fast-paced and so oblivious to these subtleties that we ready to accept it's not "E.T." and enjoy it for what it is. And maybe that's the secret of its everlasting appeal, more than 30 years after, improved by the nostalgia effect, the same than can make us enjoy a film like "Police Academy". So, "The Goonies" might have too many 80's actors, too many recognizable Spielberg's tricks, hell, even a Cindy Lauper song, but maybe these dating factors are the film's saving graces, making it forever a part of the most fun cinematic decade."Never say die", like they say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, goofy ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is a wonderful children's film featuring suicide, torture, a deformed man chained up in a confined room, deadly booby traps, a frozen dead body, kidnapping, gunshots, foreclosure, an old lady threatening to cut off children's tongues and skeletons. It's probably the best family horror movie of all time. But seriously, it's hard to believe all this stuff is in a kid's movie. It just goes to show how powerful tone is. Because the music is never too dark and there's no nudity or swearing and because the children are all basically guaranteed to survive to the end, no-one bats an eye.The Goonies works because of its energy and innocence. It's a bunch of children being children, going on an adventure to find a hidden treasure in order to hopefully save their parents from having to foreclose their houses. None of the actors are slack, they all jump right into their roles. It reminded me of the raw energy of Star Wars, the way Luke and Leia say silly lines so sincerely and they seem so passionate about everything they do.The characters are a big part of the movie's success. They shout over each-other, tell each-other to "shut up", laugh and scream together. They make fun of each-other which is one of those signs of long term friendship. They know Chunk so well they can count down to when he'll drop something and break it. They infuriate him enough to make him unwittingly break down a door and then thank him afterwards as they walk over his body. They make him do a silly dance before letting him into a house. The gate is opened by a wacky, overly complex sequence of events including a chicken laying an egg and a balloon popping. I'm guessing Data invented it.I really liked the music by Dave Grusin. I'm not sure I've seen any of his other movies. But it sounded interesting all the way through. Not simply underlining the action or on the other extreme being distracting but adding lots of colour and variety. I really feel like I need to listen to the soundtrack to properly appreciate all the details and get familiar with the music.There is a lot of slapstick comedy in this movie. Joe Pantoliano asks for a sword from his Mother. She hands it to him and he yells as the blade part goes onto his hand by mistake. I was reminded of Home Alone and Baby's Day Out. The movie achieves a safe, silly, comedic atmosphere where everything just becomes fun. There is danger but it's fun danger. We hold our breath as the bad guys get closer and then laugh out loud as they slip and hurt themselves. We gasp when a bad guy appears out of nowhere and then cheer as another character swoops in to rescue the day.I get the impression many people love The Goonies from childhood and have watched it regularly for decades. I saw a lot of 80s movies as a kid but somehow The Goonies was left out. I don't know if it's great but it's a very likable and fun movie and I can see myself growing fonder of it with time. I think it's perfect family entertainment that a lot of children would find hilarious. My favourite things about it were Chunk, the bumbling and arguing villains, the sense of adventure and the cast of quirky, funny characters.Sean Astin is the heart of the movie and gives a solid performance that puts many adults to shame. He has braces and takes a puffer for asthma making him seem more vulnerable and innocent but he's not weak at all. I have to say, I loved when Chunk started confessing every naughty little thing he's ever done. And of course the part when he suddenly stopped talking and noticed some ice cream. Anyway, good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't just superficially watch The Goonies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1985 Steven Spielberg directed a movie titled The Goonies. There is much more to this movie than what simply meets the eye. The Goonies, follows a group of young hooligan boys around their hometown of Astoria, Oregon as they search for a mysterious buried treasure. The Goonies, one of Spielberg's funnier films focuses on younger people, because of this, many movie critics are harsh in their reviews towards. These reviews will sadden those who truly love the movie The Goonies. If watched superficially, what appears in is a bunch of annoying kids running around their hometown without parental supervision as they search for hidden treasure, as well as bad acting and not great filming. But The Goonies teaches lessons that are simple, beautiful, and even for some life changing. &nbsp;Although the movie is focused on the younger generation all, old and young alike can enjoy and learn from these lessons.&nbsp;Critics have stated, "The storyline was weak." Another said, "The story is annoying." These critics have only ever watched this movie with a superficial lens, sadly they have failed to see what the movie is all about. Spielberg directed this summer popcorn film in such a way that it can be learned from. These lessons come to us as the Goonies express attributes through their actions as they adapt to the life crisis on hand. One of these examples happens when the young Goonies follow a map to an old summer home, and despite a scary looking family occupying the house they press on to see if they can find the next step on the map. Through this experience the young Goonies teach us the lesson of determination and courage, the attributes are vital in order for us to get through our own life crises. As the Goonies press on they face many traps created to kill them or make them so scared that they would turn around but, these young boys and girls have something driving them. A drive is something that will always help us to get through our lives crises, it will push us not to quit and to do whatever is necessary to reach our goals. Finally, the Goonies show an incredible amount of maturity for their age, with maturity they were able to see and understand what really was important. Having a clear understanding about what was really important to the Goonies, they were able to know what they must do in order for them to get through their crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are only three examples of how the Goonies personality traits throughout the movie can teach us to better prepare ourselves for when crises come into our lives. These of course are not the only lessons to be learned form The Goonies, but it is a good start. The Goonies is much more then just a silly kids action/adventure movie, its for all generations to learn and grow from. Steven Spielberg produced this movie knowing that he could hide some awesome lessons from the beginning of the movie to the ending credits. As you watch this movie don't just watch it it superficially but to watch it in a deeper way, for in this way will you learn from its lessons, you will soon bee defending this 1980 classic much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 80s Flick, Though the New Generation Might Have Trouble Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved The Goonies growing up. There was something about small town living and that 80s charm that you couldn't get enough of. It was an innocent time, and in this generation, I'm not even sure if kids have any kind of crazy adventures with all of their iPads and everything else.The 80s were a great time to be a kid, and this movie definitely shows that. It was a time when kids just got together to go have fun, and possibly cause mischief. In this case here, it's to stop evil bad guys from hurting them and saving their homes from foreclosure and having to move away.Watching this movie now does bring back some serious nostalgia, even if a lot of the dialogue is really cheesy. ;) Perhaps the best aspect of this film is the adventure tied to it. Watching a bunch of kids overcome obstacles that stumped adults and the hilarity that comes with trying to outwit their nitwit enemies, the Fratellis, makes for a silly and entertaining adventure! Kids of today might not be able to get into this, but if you have kids that are still young enough that they just enjoying watching a movie with you, this is still great family fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies is undeniably a cult classic. Favored by Kids, teens and adults. This film is the reason I have loved movies. It is part of my childhood. And provides adventure, imagination,mystery,thrills,humor and action.From the opening scene we are introduced to the gang and the villains. The Score is mysterious and magical and is absolutely magnetic. The locations are superbly beautiful. ECola park is a location I have to see some time in my life. The cinematography is majestic most notably in the end showing the ship sailing away. Which gives me goosebumps all the time. The sets are just amazing. The set designers and production designers showed the adventure we want to be a part of. The Waterslides that shoot out the protagonists to the cave filled with an aroma of water which holds One Eyed Willies ship is a spectacular moment. One I have enjoyed a lot.The direction is handled perfectly by Donner. The film also has that essence of Spielberg due to the man himself. Without him this would not have been as good. Chris Columbus, I feel is very underrated and has created a magical script filled with beloved characters which are portrayed superbly.This film is fantastic. I recommend you go watch it. It will please the kid inside you and have a great adventure. One you can enjoy moment after moment. Just make sure you do the Truffle Shuffle after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates! Treasure! Rich stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>June 7th marked 30 years since the audiences first got to know the "Goonies". Whoa! Has it been so long? And is anybody still remembering this film apart from me? I honestly didn't expect there were so many people feeling so strongly about the movie, but it seems Goonies has indeed achieved cult status over the years (and decades). In retrospect, this is hardly surprising, considering the multitude of 80's films, both small and big, that have turned into classics. And Goonies exemplifies all the good qualities of the film fare of that time that made them unique. As for me, my story with the Goonies goes back a long time. I first got to see it on VHS in 1988 (apparently I was a little young to catch it in cinemas when it was first screened), instantly loved it and then by a fortunate turn of events I got to own a videotape copy of it. Over the next five years or so, it would be the subject of countless sessions, alone or with friends that got equally infected by the Goonies bug. There where times where I would get to watch it 4 times within the same day. I haven't kept track, but I figure my number of viewings must be approaching triple digits, definitely the one movie I have watched the most times, even though it isn't my favorite. From some point on I got detoxed, but even now I never decline a chance to see it again when it plays on TV. The film has also aged very very well, you can hardly tell it was shot 30 years ago, again, a testament to the production values of that time. Based on an idea by Steven Spielberg at the pinnacle of his creative period and scribed by a then up and coming Chris Columbus (before his mega-successes with Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise), Goonies is an adventure cleverly employing good old recipes but at the same time infusing them with loads of originality. Lost pirate treasure hunt has never been done with more fun and brio than here. And the movie is also bursting with great humor and immensely quotable lines (a trade that seems to be almost extinct today), thanks to its superbly written script. Richard Donner's direction is top notch and takes full advantage of the terrific ensemble cast of all ages. Almost all of the about a dozen characters are fully fleshed-out and some of them easily turn iconic. Quite a feat for a little children's adventure! And let's not forget Dave Grusin's fabulous score. Or Cyndi Lauper!Above all else, Goonies is a film filled with the children's magic and wonder of the early Spielberg fare, and even if he is not behind the camera this time, his fingerprints on the final product are indelible. It really is a shame that similar movies are hardly made anymore today. Columbus managed to recapture some of the early Spielberg magic with the first of the Harry Potter films, it didn't last long though and wasn't picked up by other directors. I know I would definitely sign up for a new movie of this sort any day, even if I'm not a kid anymore. Sadly, most are now preoccupied with remakes and franchises instead of coming up with original ideas. I hope the Goonies is left untouched by the remake avalanche.</fullReview>

It has the essence of childhood joy. The kids are a fun bunch. They have exciting adventures. Steven Spielberg is the producer. Chris Columbus is the writer. Richard Donner is the director. It owes most of its sensibility to Spielberg. It's essentially ET with a pirate treasure rather than an alien. I do have a minor warning for really small kids. The language, the action and a dead body could be a little bit too much for the little ones. It's not really a kiddie movie for the tiny tods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Goonies isn't nearly as serious as the other coming-of-age movies of the decade, but it creates a whimsical adventure full of likable characters and themes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1980s was the definitive decade for the coming-of-age film. Stand by Me, The Breakfast Club, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and The Karate Kid were all released within the span of the ten year period. Another sort of coming-of-age movie released in the 80s was the Steven Spielberg produced The Goonies, directed by Richard Donner. After releasing his successful Superman movie, Donner had a quick series of commercial flops before returning with the very successful The Goonies. The Goonies isn't nearly as serious as the other coming-of-age movies of the decade, but it creates a whimsical adventure full of likable characters and themes.The Goonies tells the story of a group of coastal Oregon boys who are known as, well, "the Goonies." These Goonies consist of Mikey Walsh, the leader of the group, Mouth, a smart mouthed rebel of sorts, Data, the genius who has all sorts of inventions under his coat, and Chunk, the lovable chubby sidekick. Living in the "Goon Docks" of Astoria, Oregon, these young boys and their families face the imminent foreclosure of their homes due to construction of a new country club. As they celebrate their last "Goonies weekend," the boys stumble across a map and artifact that lead them on a hunt for the treasure of pirate One-Eyed Willie.Also tagging along on the adventure is Brand Walsh, Mikey's older brother, Andy Carmichael, Brand's love interest, and Stef Steinbrenner, Andy's friend. The hunt for One-Eyed Willie's treasure isn't just a simple "X marks the spot" adventure, however. The first hint leads the Goonies to an old seaside restaurant that doubles as the hideout of a gang known as the Fratellis. The encounter with this criminal group leads to an adventure with more conflict than the Goonies had expected.The story of The Goonies is undeniably engaging and fun to follow. The hunt for One-Eyed Willie's treasure is quite whimsical and fun, with a very Spielberg-esque vibe to it all. The film manages to be kid-friendly, but also covers some rather intense themes. Occasionally, the group comes across skeletons of past explorers, the aforementioned criminals with handguns, and a disgustingly charming, deformed "Sloth." The Goonies is surprisingly enjoyable for viewers of all ages, even if it's coming-of-age themes are buried under the whimsy and adventure of the story.The cast is well-rounded and awesome all across the board. Sean Astin is a great lead character, who plays Mikey with great passion. Corey Feldman of fellow coming-of-age flick Stand by Me is a hilarious Mouth, who spits one-liners and quips regularly. Ke Huy Quan is a fun Data, who always has something up his sleeve for the situation at hand. Jeff Cohen is a very funny and adorable Chunk, who is undeniably hilarious. Rounding out the cast is John Brolin as Brand, Keri Green as Andy, and John Matuszak as Sloth, all of whom are fantastic.The Goonies is one of the classic movies to come out of the 1980s. Remembered for it's whimsical story and cute cast of characters, the film stands in the hearts of many as a film of nostalgia and memories. It's not quite perfect in the fact that the coming-of-age elements could have been stronger, but The Goonies is a fun adventure for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films from my childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those few movies from my childhood that still brings a smile to my face. It's an essential adventure flick, filled to the brim with comedy and thrills. No matter how many times you go back to revisit it, the entertainment value is never exhausted.One of my favorite aspects of this film is how real the kids seem. They curse and try to act more adult than they actually are, just as most preteens are wont to do.Anyways, this is an awesome movie. Even though it's dated in some ways (but then again, every movie that ever has been and will be made is going to be dated, even our fancy CG-saturated blockbusters), it holds up very well. Show the kids or treat yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood classic that I have never forgotten since!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I never heard of this movie before until on my seventh birthday, I received this on a VHS copy and a few years later, I saw that this was made in the 80s even I was more of a 90s kid at the time. So, I watched it to see if it could be really good. Turns out, it did thanks to it's premise: a bunch of kids find a treasure map that would lead them to One-Eye Willy's treasure in Oregon. That kind of premise looks really cool in terms of cinema and I agree with all of the users who gave it some positive feedback that this is indeed a classic. It doesn't matter if it sometimes get noisy which is the reason why I was prevented from giving this a 100% because I still love this movie ever since I was a child.The story is much more original with suspenseful moments with the main characters and the pacing is very brisk. The direction from Richard Donner (the guy who brought us Superman) is more efficient and the music from Dave Grusin is beautiful and memorable along with some nice visuals. The cast, however, steals the show for portraying the likable characters perfectly. Sean Astin (who would later be Samwise Gamgee in Lord of the Rings), Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Short Round from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the others are charming especially Chunk who makes me laugh in the "Truffle Shuffle" scene and the villains are menacing and hilarious as well.Overall, The Goonies is a classic and is more recommendable to everyone who was born in the 80s. Whether or not there's going to be a sequel, I can't to see it start production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw THE GOONIES was at a friend's house right when it was a "new release" on video. After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a "Goonie" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including "Data" and his supply of gadgets, and "Chunk" with his obese but likable image (love that "Truffle Shuffle"!). But "Sloth" easily stole the show with his own likable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually "good enough" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying! After all these years, I'm STILL waiting for a sequel! HIT PUREE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies is right behind Stand By Me for best coming of age feature in the eighties. Stand By Me touched me in a way that I have never been touched before. It was an iconic, moving, intelligent picture than gave all four of its characters a believable history and insane likability. Not to mention, everything was raw, realistic, funny, touching, and sincere. It seems The Goonies borrows a few of the characters from the film, like Chunk who is clearly a lot like Jerry O'Connell's Vern in Stand By Me, but it makes them a lot more relatable for the youngsters and a lot cleaner and brighter in their personalities.The film centers around many, many kids that nickname themselves "The Goonies" who live in the "Goon Docks" of Arizona. Because of a growing country club, the house they all live in is heading towards foreclosure. The gang, made up of an optimistic asthmatic, a chubby coward, a mouthy youth, an Asian inventor, an older brother, a cheerleader, and a geeky female adolescent, discovers a map in one of their friends attic which tells the story of "One-Eyed Willy" and his untold amounts of treasure. The crew sets out to find the map and have one last Goonie adventure before they are separated.One of the many problems with this adventure are The Goonies themselves are being hunted by the Fratelli family, a group of thieves that are looking to steal treasure. The mother, or the boss, of the group is played by Anne Ramsey, an amazing and underrated character actor. She plays one of the creepiest, most taunting villains I can remember from a kids movie.It may sound like the teens are a bunch of caricatures, waiting to evolve into something bigger, badder, and more film-sustainable. But the characters are draw to look like mannequins, when in reality, they are portrayed effectively by great child character actors like Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, and Corey Feldman. I think my favorite character was the lead, Mikey (Astin). His optimism reminded me of my own - as a young kid of course - and his overall cheery nature made him a very efficient protagonist.Obviously, the film is trying to mirror and duplicate the Indiana Jones for a younger, more pint-sized audience. It succeeds. There's enough wit, soul, and entertainment in the script and in the antics to keep fresh, while at the same time pay a thrilling homage. The sequences of peril are excellent, and the music always excites and compliments the scenes in true, Spielbergian style.The scene that has the best music is late in the film when the gang is sliding down a long water-slide that's not meant for sliding. It's complimented with exciting music, but also captures the innocence of doing something so bad then so good. It's difficult to explain, but you might realize it when you see it. Think of doing something bad, then doing something very fun, exciting, and somewhat dangerous. Like after you break something, you dart up the stairs jumping over obstacles and dodging everything like a stuntman.The Goonies is nothing but a fun, Spielberg adventure of epic proportions. This is also one of the coming of age films that furthers my sadness of the fact I have not had anywhere close to an adventure like this, nor have I had the loyal friends of this caliber. I believe that's because my life isn't a nostalgic eighties film.Starring: Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and Anne Ramsey. Directed by: Richard Donner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive childhood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the takeover of his home by the local country club imminent, Mikey (Sean Astin), a member of the 'goonie' gang who live in the 'goon docks' area of Oregon, plans a last adventure for him and his gang when he uncovers a map in his father's attic that may lead to the treasure of legendary pirate One-Eyed Willie. Joining him is Data (Jonathan Ke Quan), who is handy with gadgets, Mouth (Corey Feldman), who always lets his mouth get the better of him, and Chunk (Jeff Cohen), a bungling chubby kid who is famous for his 'truffle shuffle'. Meeting up with them later is Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and two girls, Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). The map leads them to a seaside restaurant that appears derelict, but they soon find it occupied by wanted criminals who may just be after the loot themselves.So here it is. When we started the Childhood Memories Project, The Goonies was always high on the list to watch, and why wouldn't it be? Virtually everyone from my generation and the generations around me who owned a television when they were a kid would have seen this film many times, and, like me, loved it. It seemed to be constantly on one of the channels, and is the type of film that you can watch from any point and instantly become engrossed. It has everything a kids film could need - pirates, lost treasure, adventure, boys comradery, monsters (well, Sloth). And it has a sad element that could upset any child - the threat of moving away to the unknown and leaving those childhood friends forever. These things make the film timeless, and a true childhood classic.This was the first time I'd watched the film since my youth, and the first thing that struck me was how dark the film is. There's some scary stuff in here (if you're a kid!) - skeletal bodies, a frozen corpse with a bullet hole in his head, a huge deformed monster chained in a dark room, and Martha Plimpton. There's also a lot of swearing. It's not the type of thing you get in modern day kiddy s**t. Those films are too busy breaking into song or filling the screen with flashy effects to stop the X-Box and iPhone generation from losing concentration for 10 seconds and checking their f*****g Facebook account. The Goonies gives us the real dirt, danger and sense of adventure that came with childhood, where an abandoned railway line would provide a whole day's entertainment (in my case).I also found it extremely moving. I'm not sure if it was the nostalgic man-child in me that was transported back to a time where getting back home in time for dinner was the extent of my worries, or if it was from the many beers that I had. Either way, by the end I got all soppy. The Goonies is by no means a brilliant film, but the legacy it left behind it and the sheer scale of it's cult, nostalgic fan base is there for a reason - because it's the perfect childhood adventure film. And for that reason, and for the fact that I've never felt two hours fly by so fast, I'm giving the film five stars. This is the film that gave us the truffle shuffle and 'hey you guys!' after all. I just hope younger generations get to see it and are capable of appreciating it after being brought up in a world of Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Miley Cyrus and Michael f*****g Bay. Goonies never say die.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies is a movie to watch on one of those cold rainy days.The Goonies are in trouble. The Goondocks is under a threat of being torn down buy a business tycoon who wants to build a resort on their property. The gang decide that they need to find a way to help Mikey and Brand's parents who can't come up with the money to save the house. They go into the attic to look around for something valuable and they come across an old treasure map that will lead to a treasure that used to belong to a pirate named One Eyed Willie.Along the way they run into the Fratelli's who are wanted for counterfeit. The Fratelli's try to go after the gang after they find Chunk who has gone to get help from the police. Chunk tells the Fratelli's that his friends went down the fireplace. Adventure follows.The Goonies have a wonderful cast. The late Anne Ramsey who plays Mama Fratelli qualifies as meanest mother ever. Even her own sons take a beating from her during the film. I love the little arguments she has between her and Mouth.My biggest problem with the film is that they don't decide to put the Octopus scene back in. You hear Data talk about it but we never see it. The people who own the film should re-release it with this great classic scene that I remember watching at a young age.Great classic 80's film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film that takes you back to the carefree days of childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is a film that I think can be enjoyed by people of all ages, unless you're a pretentious film snob who will dismiss any film that wasn't made by Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica or Stanley Kubrick. The Goonies certainly isn't by any stretch a groundbreaking piece of cinematic history or a masterpiece deemed worthy of mountainous praise, but it is a movie that is cherished by children and adults alike for its simple, but lovable qualities.To keep it brief, the plot follows a group of children living in the Goon Docks suburb who are forced to move away from their homes that they love to make room for the development of a golf course. The children discover an old treasure map that supposedly leads to a fortune in precious stones and jewelery and so they go looking for it to save their homes.A very basic premise, but that isn't the only source of the film's appeal. The characters Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk etc are all lovable and are played wonderfully by some of the best child actors ever. Sean Astin (Lord of the Rings) and Corey Feldman (Stand By Me) especially. The other characters are very likable and all deliver great performances In combination with a likable cast of characters and a dire situation, The Goonies has a strong adventurous quality that cannot be easily replicated in a film such as this. The comedic value, although often very cheesy, is very high, notably the antics of Chunk.You'd think that I grew up with this movie considering the positive comments I have about it, but I really didn't. I only saw the film a year ago and instantly fell in love with it. It's a film that perfectly reminds us of the wonders of childhood and why children should appreciate the limited moments they have. It's also a film that manages to cheer me up regardless of how upset I may feel. Because of this, The Goonies demands infinite rewatches.It does sadden me that my parents never exposed me to The Goonies as a child, but I know that after experiencing it again and again, I will not make the same mistake and I sincerely hope that after reading my review that you will do the same. The creative minds of both Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon, Superman, The Omen) and Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List) should be praised.The Goonies is a film that takes you out of a complicated world, spiritually transports you back to childhood and entertains you marvelously from the opening scene to the end credits. I love this movie and if you're willing to lighten up, I'm sure you will too. Thank you for reading my review.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Goonies Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is about a group of young adults that guide themselves into an adventure on the quest to find a legendary lost treasure. The film illustrates the importance of working as a team to beat impossible circumstances. Sean Astin plays the main character Mikey, who is first to discover an old treasure map in family home's attic. His brother Brand is played by a young, Josh Brolin. These two play opposites character wise. Brand is more athletic and strong while Mikey is smaller and has an external weakness of asthma. However it is Mikey that is the one who guides the group of misfits through an underground, booby trap adventure and discover the treasure. The brother's family home is about to be foreclosed on unless their parents can come up with the money.Other stars of the film include Goonies: Kerri Green, who plays Andy, a cheerleader and love interest to Brolin's character, Kerri Green, who plays Stef, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, and Ke-Huy Quan as Data. The group is constantly on the run from the Fratelli crime family, who in the opening scenes helps one of their counterparts escape jail. Anne Ramsey plays Mama Fratelli, who discovers what the "goony" group is up to and prompts her sons Jake and Francis, who are played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano, respectively, to chase after them. There is one more son, Sloth, played by John Matoszak, who is deformed and has a growling Frankenstein-like dialog. Sloth is left behind along with a captured Chunk who soon becomes friends over the love for food and they join forces to go save the "goonies" from the Fratellis who are on their trail. Each goony character played an important role in helping the group advance further in discovering the treasure. Those that stood out were: Mikey (Astin) who is the encourager that will not give up in helping his family and will not allow the group to give up either, Data (Quan), is equipped with special gadgets that help the goonies get through the trail to the treasure and Mouth (Feldman), is able to interpret the map which is in Spanish and helps to give the film a funnier edge with his smart antics. The character Sloth (Matoszak) ends up becoming an honorary goony for his attempts to rescue them from his family. The Goonies was an earlier kiddy version of the Disney film, National Treasure (2004), which stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who is looking for mysterious and unbeknown artifacts. Unlike The Goonies his adventures are around the entire country not just below one Oceanside suburb. Perhaps both films draw from the film, Indiana Jones (1981-1989, 2008), which stars Harrison Ford as a part time college professor and part time adventurous historian, who travels the globe to rescue artifacts from the wrong hands and put them in a museum. All these films focus on defeating the odds and a hero shining through at the end. However, I believe Goonies was the first to focus on a group of children on this type of quest. The film uses techniques in camera angles and lighting to give a more realistic feel to the viewer. There are points were you actually forget the adventure is really only taking place underneath a town. Throughout most of the film, low key lighting is used to draw the audience into the setting of the dark cave the group is in. It gives an eerie feeling while at the same time allowing for the element of surprise of what may be up next. It was also very natural like you are right there with the characters, especially when they use candles and flashlights as the main light source. A diagonal camera angle was used in some scenes to present an approaching feel. Especially when the group was traveling into the unknown as one. The characters are in a grouping of shortest to tallest from front to back to give this angle an even greater effect. These techniques were needed to bring the audience into the actions on the screen and engage their interest further.All the elements tie in to make this film enjoyable to watch and be a part of. Each character was able to hold your interest with their unique talent and ways. Each scene of their adventure will allow you to seem as if you are part of the effort to find the treasure. This film gives great significance to the word teamwork and will encourage those biggest to smallest to stop at nothing to make a dream reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey youuuuuuuu guuyyyyysss, watch this classic family film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>9 out of 10 may seem a bit of a high rating to some people and there's no deluding myself here that I am not also seeing things through rose-tinted glasses but the simple fact remains that The Goonies IS an enduring modern classic for all the family. I have watched it with a variety of age groups and have honestly yet to find someone who didn't like at least some part of the movie.The story is all about some young boys (and a couple of girls who end up tagging along) after the legendary treasure of One-Eyed Willie. They're desperate to find some riches so that they can actually keep their homes and not have to move, a decision being made the very next day. So desperate, in fact, that they brave both a series of booby-traps AND the pursuit from on-the-lam hardened crooks The Fratellis. The youngsters, who call themselves Goonies in case you haven't actually seen the film yet, work together to stay on the trail, stay ahead of The Fratellis and stay alive.I just don't know where to begin in my praise for the antics of this movie. The vibrant, memorable opening sequence? The booby-traps that kids of all ages will be thrilled by? The memorable appearance of Sloth? The confession scene that always has me in tears of laughter?The Goonies is much, much more than the sum of it's parts (thankfully, as there are a few low points among the many highs) and that's largely thanks to the perfect mix of great direction from Richard Donner, decent script from Chris Columbus and a superb ensemble cast. Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and Anne Ramsay are just a selection of the names you may recognise but the others, such as Jonathan Ke Quan and Jeff Cohen, are actually capable of stealing scenes and staying in your nostalgic memory bank for years to come. Cohen is especially good on screen, from the "truffle shuffle" to the confession scene already mentioned above, he may give a slightly OTT performance at times and is stuck with the shouty-klutz role but when he provides great comedy it's definitely a lot of fun.I could go on about the soundtrack, the effects, the supporting cast, the in-jokes and much more but I won't. Seriously, if you haven't seen The Goonies by now then you've a)been hiding away in a cave somewhere and b)missed a real treat. Go, watch and enjoy.See this if you like: Explorers, Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl, The Monster Squad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Nostalgic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I wait so long before watching this movie? If I had seen this movie as a kid my imagination would have gone wild. When I was younger, I was always into the whole Treasure Hunting thing, always making clues and hiding them and having other's find them. The Goonies is basically a treasure hunt, and it's a damn good one too. I watched this mostly just because people were saying how great it was, and how it was one of the movies that inspired one of my favorite films from last year "Super 8." Well before I praise this movie, first let me say a few things that bothered me.The character of Chunk, the fat kid, doesn't go in the caves with the rest of the group, and in the last act, we barely see him. Which is a shame. Also some parts seemed a little too adult, I could handle the skeletons, but I can't really see why they put in the scene with the statue's genitals falling off. Also Data's accent got annoying at times, he sounds like Short Round from "Temple of Doom." But this movie really put a smile on my face, it's a classic adventure movie about finding a treasure. Like I said, I loved that stuff when I was younger, so this really brought a nostalgia feeling. The characters are great, sure they all fit into a stereotype: fat, Asian, cool, leader, but they all are so funny and likable. I like that they have both kids and teenagers on this journey. That way more people can relate. The villains are great, and the film had me laughing tons of times. I could say more, but I assume most of you have seen this film, and if you haven't, go watch it.The Goonies isn't quite as good as E.T., Close Encounters, or Super 8, but it's still a fun, nostalgic, and very funny ride. I will be buying this as soon as I can and it will go right on my shelf along with those other three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, I was a kid in the 80's decade and this was one of the first films I've seen since I was about 8, I loved it then and I still love it now. This film is one of my personal favorite films in general.Everything about this film is just perfect (in my book)because it succeeded where most family/kid films fail to do for me which is entertain me, the film kinda manifests that dream we sometimes have of escaping from our usual existence or boredom for a while and going on some wild and fun adventure. It's one of those family/kid movies done the right way where it's not watered down, insult our intelligence, or even pulling off gimmicks just for the sake of it.I really love the set pieces their all practical and built, from the caverns and pirate ship you can really see the effort they put into it. I love the traps which were inspired by the Rube Goalburg cartoons, just seeing how they work is a joy and looks plausible if not entirely probable (some principles work). The music is great that theme song from Cindi Lapper is one of my favorite movie themes. It has good action and suspense that is in constant motion you almost can't take a breath, my favorite is of course the infamous music challenge where the characters have to play a skeleton piano (which looks like something out of heavy metal cover art), that part kept me on the edge of my seat constantly thinking don't you dare hit that wrong note. But the humor is great there are physical gags and verbal humor that beautifully go together, the things you see and hear can be just hilarious, like seeing Brent ride a tricycle sort of the equivalent of the clown bike.But what really makes this film of course are all the characters themselves. There are a lot of protagonists and usually this isn't always a good idea but this film managed to make it work because they all have unique distinctive developed personas where you know them enough but also have a factor of relatibility, I even like that these kids (as well as three teens with them) aren't stereotypical or look like pretty boys/girls(which is a look I can't stand) but looks and feel like regular people. What makes them standout more along with the film is the sense of relatablity, making these protagonists feel more accessible. I even like the location that this film takes place since my aunt, uncle, and cousin live in Oregon state, as well as the neighborhood they live in, looks likes the type I lived in. And all these characters are geeks (I mean that in a good way) and underdogs which I like those kinds of characters because that what I and my friends are, weren't really the kind of kids that were popular but had a lot to offer. I even like their motive for their adventure and it's not for greed or glory which I always believe are the wrong reasons for adventure but simply to save their neighborhood by being demolished by some greedy butt head land developers.As for my favorite character, I'd have to say it's Mouth (played brilliantly by Corey Felman) whom is true to his name. His character is practically the interpreter of the adventure. I just simply love his charisma, he's just funny a real wisecracker, just has some of the best lines in the movie and delivers them well like "Jerk Alert!".The others are great Data whom has as many gadgets as "Batman". Chunk whom despite a big kid, isn't stereotypical he also has some great charisma and lines, he might seem a bit clumsy but by it's nature it's actually dumb luck which really works to his advantage.Brent and Mikey like the back and forth between them how the brotherly relationship is portrayed, kinda similar with the character Pete and Pete in the TV show "The Adv of Pete and Pete". Mikey being the younger one is the most adventious and daring, he's smart but naive. Brent is more grounded, I like the fact even though he's a man of muscle he's not a jock he's an underdog doesn't have a car and probably not much luck with ladies, he gets the most grief from his brother but he goes along (probably also out of boredom) since he has to watch over him even if Mikey is leading him to the road to Hell.Well that's all I have to say, "The Goonies" is a treasure.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this seminal 80's classic in 1988, when it first appeared on TV and I was blown away by it. I was 10, roughly the same age as the lads and here was a film with a raucous sense of humour, strong child characters and large-scale plot which has made this film a multi-generational classic, with our parents, us as parents and our children all investing in the spirit of adventure of The Goonies.Named after the Goon Docks of which they inhabit, a group of kids, after finding a treasure map, decide that this is their last chance to save the town, which is to knocked down in favour of a Country Club. This leads them on an adventure through the booby-trapped underground catacombs of the town, as they follow the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure.They get mixed up with the Fratelli's, a matriarchal crime family who get wind of the treasure and follows them into the caves.The first ting that struck me about this, is after all these years what that it was still fun, enjoyable and even though I might not bother watching by myself, I would defiantly enjoy seeing again with the right audience. The raucous nature of a group of children together in a room is captured so expertly here, with a young Sean Austin, now famous for his portrayal of Samwise Gamgee in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, holding the pack together; but the chaos is portrayed perfectly.The language is good here too, with casual swearing amongst the kids, meaning that this must be one of the rare family films to truly capture the interplay between tweenage and teenage kids. Overall, this is a classic for all the right reasons, with the story by Steven Spielberg with only goes to further reinforce his status as one of Hollywood's greatest visionaries and a sharp, tight screenplay by Chris Columbus, who penned Gremlins the previous year and went on to direct the first two, but the weakest two Harry Potter movies.There is also the questionable issue of the way that the Fratelli's treat Chunk. When you think about it he is threatened with torture after being kidnapped and spending time with the murdered corpse of two 'Feds' who have been shot in the head, murdered in cold blood.I love this, treating the horror in a mature way, allowing it to used as humour but in a way to playfully scare kids, which it does. It is fun, but I do wonder where the PC brigade would let some of these plot points go in to a child friendly romp in 2011? I hope so, as it is the combination of elements that made this film what it is today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, and a childhood favourite of mine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies, what a fun movie. I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden. All in all, a fun adventure yarn. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Adventure For Kids ... and Adults Who Grew Up In The 80s and 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Goonies' is a cute adventure flick that revolves around a group of children and teenagers who set out on a quest to find treasure in order to rescue the Goon Docks. Chris Columbus is already popular with children's films and writes a good screenplay. The jokes are very tongue in cheek and laugh out loud. Many of them have adult connotations but nothing overtly vulgar. 'The Goonies', like many great movies of the 80s, has nostalgic value for me. While watching it, I felt like a child living back in the 80s (well, the good part of the 80s) and be a part of their adventure. I enjoyed the many pop-cultural references to the 80s and the energy. It was also funny to see all these actors like Joe Pantoliano, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Sean Austin who were so young. The kids were very likable even thought they were a tad too loud at times. My favourite character is Data played wonderfully by the very young Jonathan Ke Quan. Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton have some hilarious scenes. Josh Brolin is great as the protective older teen brother. Only a little more than two decades later when he would finally get his due. 'The Goonie' is purely classic children's adventure and a treat for those who were kids in the 80s and 90s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable 80's Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that it took me a long time to be able to watch this film. It came out in the mid-80's and it was a hit then. Everyone I know who seen this film says it's still a hit. Do I agree? This film has similar concepts to the Indiana Jones flicks. But this movie is more designed for kids. It's about a group of kids who find a treasure map and they follow it to see if they can find a pirate ship with gold.The acting is fabulous. This film jumpstarted the careers of Sean Astin and Josh Brolin. The three bad guys were evil enough. The kids are likable. Chunck did sometimes get on my nerves with his whining.The music and the special effects are good, not the best. Spielberg came up with a great idea and Richard Donner directed a good movie. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

Their beloved neighborhood is about to become a golf course, so they go out on an adventure to find lost buried treasure. Unfortunately three crooks Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) with her sons Jake (Robert Davi) and Francis (Joe Pantoliano) are also seeking the treasure.One of the most beloved movies of the 80's! this outstanding adventure from director Richard Donner and producer Steven Spielberg has made a hilarious and entertaining film for all ages. The film co-stars Josh Brolin in his debut as Brand whom is Mikey's big tough brother, beautiful Keri Green as hottie Andi and the lovable deformed man Sloth played by John Matsuzak all give good performances.This movie still holds up as a modern cult classic that has been embraced over the years, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word... Amazing!!! There is no other great movie where Sean Astin wears braces and has asthma. Corey Feldman is a sheer smart guy and nothing beats it. Chunk by the far is the best character especially when he is asked to do the famous truffle shuffle in his loud Hawaiian shirt. This movie even when I am 80 will be one of my favorites of all time and I by then will have seen over 10,000 movies I am sure. It is also sweet to see Joe Pantiliano in a criminal character role before the days of The Sopranos as Ralph. Sloth by far is the coolest character when he and Chunk become best friends. The young actors in this movie with the exception of Astin and Feldman did not have much of acting careers. Goonies forever!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Goonies"'s vision of childhood is flawed, but not so Spielberg and Donner's flair for spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The children who constitute the Goonies only really exist in the mind of Steven Spielberg, who produced and created the story. He sees boy children as fast-talking, fun-loving, dream-chasing rascals. Girl children older than, say, Drew Barrymore in "E.T." are valuable as targets and instigators of boys' sexual precociousness, but are mostly just taggers-along on boys' adventures. How much you like "The Goonies" depends in part on whether your perceptions of childhood are as simple and limited as Spielberg's, or whether you see with the jaded eyes of an adult who wants something more from a movie than a middle-aged producer's wish fulfillment.The plot of "The Goonies," a quest for buried pirate treasure on the northern Pacific coast, owes a lot to Mark Twain's tale of Tom, Huck, and Becky in Injun Joe's cave. Twain's kids were wise beyond their years and rough around the edges, a bit like Sean Astin's "Mikey" and Corey Feldman's "Mouth." But they were also complex figures with rich inner lives, not comic stereotypes like Ke Huy Quan's "Data," who does gadgets, Jeff Cohen's "Chunk," who loves food, and Kerri Green's "Andy," a girl who shrieks and likes jewelry and kissing. Twain's dialogue was characterized by colorful turns of phrase and carefully-observed dialect, but Chris Columbus's screenplay is all shouted exposition, easy barbs, and convenient moments of wisdom.The shouting is the hardest to tolerate as an adult, and unfortunately it is ceaseless. The movie's head baddie, having bundled the Goonies out of the room, exhales a line we're probably supposed to disagree with: "Kids suck." During the brief respite from the noise, it's hard not to share her sentiment. The Goonies are pretty obnoxious, but the movie doesn't know it.Whatever their flaws in the character department, Spielberg, Columbus, and director Richard Donner are no slouches when it comes to cinematic spectacle. "The Goonies" is longer than it should be, but it moves so fast that it seldom lags. The dungeon and pirate ship sets look great, and for buffs there are plenty of winking homages to great adventure films like "Captain Blood," "Tarzan," and "Raiders of the Lost Ark." As if to compensate for the underwritten child roles, Dave Grusin's musical score does a great deal of emotional lifting and at times obscures the ubiquitous screaming.Even if you find the Goonies less than lovable, the filmmakers' fondness for them is apparent and a little infectious. A final scene on the beach gives each child a neat resolution and some parting words (several of which are painfully unearned) before capping things off with a moment of hushed, magical awe. However uneven the underlying content, it is hard to resist the appeal of a totally un-cynical moment of Spielbergian wonder.</fullReview>

I myself use the name in most of my monikers including for these reviews here at IMDb.With the advancement of film making capabilities The Goonies is starting to look dated, but I still enjoy every minute of it.

		<fullReview>Fondly remembered 80s kids adventure film that had Sean Astin before he was Samwise Gamgee leading Short-Round, Corey Feldman, Chunk, Josh Brolin, and two cute girls on a treasure hunt to save their homes from being destroyed and turned into a golf course.Naturally, chaos and mayhem ensue. This was one of my favorites when I was growing up and I still like it after all these years. I can't explain it entirely, I guess it just appeals to the adventure seeker in me for it's sheer lunacy.Directed by Richard Donner (The Omen, Superman 1, Lethal Weapon 1-4, Maverick, Conspiracy Theory), written by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter 1 and 2; how such a good writer became such a bad director is beyond me), the film is loaded with gags that still appeal to young and old alike.Best of all is Sloth, the hulking mutant with the cone head who loves chocolate, Superman, and pirate movies and is strong as an ox.

When one of them realise that this may actually lead them to treasure he and his buddies decide to go on a fascinating hunt for it in a effort to save them from being forced out of their homes. Along the way they meet three crooks and Sloth- a lovable character who makes friends with the "truffle shuffle kid" Chunk, after he is caught by the crooks, and together they go looking for his friends to rescue them. So i advise you, anyone who has not seen this movie watch it as you will certainly be missing out otherwise. You will like this movie if you like films such as "The Never-Ending Story", "Legend", "Gremlins" and "Labyrinth"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best adventure movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of "The Goonies" since I was about 5 years old. I taped 2 different copies on cable, then bought it on home video, and finally on DVD. I have to say the DVD and its bonus features (i.e. deleted scenes, a "Making of The Goonies" featurette, current audio commentary with Donner and the actors, etc) are excellent! Mikey, Brand, Chunk, Mouth, Data, Andy, and Stef follow a map and go searching for buried treasure via caves and waterfalls in an abandoned restaurant along the Oregon coast. They do this because they believe it (the treasure of legendary pirate One Eyed Willie) will save their homes from being torn down by land developers who want to build an upscale golf course. The problem is that a group of ex-convicts (the Fratellis) also want the treasure, and are using the abandoned restaurant as a hideout. Moreover, the Fratellis will crush anything and anyone in the way of their goals. Can the Goonies find the treasure before its too late? I must say "The Goonies" has it all: stereotypical but likable characters, awesome visual and sound effects via Steven Spielberg, Richard Donner, and Industrial Light and Magic, as well as integrations of 1980s pop culture (Cyndi Lauper's "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough", Mouth wearing Prince's "Purple Rain" shirt, etc). Product placement is also highly evident: Baby Ruth, Rocky Road, Domino's Pizza. The sets, costumes, and props are wonderful as well (I have a Hawaiian shirt similar to the one Chunk wears). If you are a child of the 1980s, "The Goonies" is a must see! It truly brings out the kid in you!</fullReview>

The CONSTANT screaming and yelling by all the characters was more than I could take. The dialog was stupid, the characters over-acted, the fat kid was annoying as hell, and the amount of plot holes made this laughable at best. The premise of the movie is great...a remake could do well, but as this stands I couldn't stand to hear one more second of it.And seriously, they cast Martha Plimpton??? Of all the struggling actors in Hollywood, this is who they picked? I guess they needed a homely girl that couldn't act, so they picked her (with Kerri Green being a close second).</fullReview>

Spielberg's clich-ridden story seems to be made up of leftover ideas from "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The script is amateurish and has no rhyme or reason. It's as if they made up the story as they went along. The kids are simply obnoxious; they talk non-stop and don't say anything interesting. This film is supposedly targeted at youngsters, but it has crude sexual "humor" (not the least bit funny) and tasteless violence directed at children. Rather than direct it himself, Spielberg brought in Donner, presumably to spread the blame, but the latter does nothing to save this sinking ship.</fullReview>

The kids are all very good here, giving energetic performances and carving out unique and memorable characters in the process. The adults also fare well, with the Fratelli clan (Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and Anne Ramsey) making for a fun and eclectic group of villains.&nbsp;It also looks great, from the cinematography to impressive sets like One Eyed Willy's pirate ship.

		<fullReview>The goonies are The emporium of The 80s about a group of kids finding a treasure map and setting off on an exciting adventure. It's a classic in its own right that everyone has seen at least once and been referenced multiple times in pop culture.What makes this a timeless master piece is the themes about friendship, class structures and family. Brent taking care of his brother, willing to risk his life and watch out for him. His friends all have a skill or an ability that proves useful and support each other through the lumberous made. The poor are harassed by the rich and need to stop their houses being torn down for a golf field and the pirates robbing from the rich to give to the poor like robin good.Steven Spisburge adds his touch with the beautiful music, enchanting characters and delicately put together plot keeping you entertained no matter what age you reach. So many jokes you'll catch like the officer saying Lawerence remember the time you said green creatures were taking over the town (Gremlins) or when he puked at the theater causing everyone to (stand by me). The jokes are humorous and have you rolling on the floor.Join Mikey, the boonies and the Fratellis on this wild adventure full of "booby traps, that's what I said."</fullReview>

You had the criminal family in the Fratelli's hot on the children's trail to essentially rob the robbers (One Eyed Willie and Crew) who were dead anyway. 3. The "Booby Traps" laid out and the obstacles to get to the treasure was enough for me as a young man sitting on the edge of his seat waiting for something horrible to happen to the children. OVER ALL it was very well laid out as now has become an iconic movie in my books 10 out of 10, A great family movie....

Directed by Richard Donner, this film has a script by Chris Columbos based on a story by Steven Spielberg, and the cast is entirely made up of young stars still little known to the public at the time.An excellent comedy mixed with Italian gangsters and pepperoni pizza, this film was seen for many young people in the following years, and allowed to them to feel the magic of the treasure hunts, pirates and adventures (in that time, the pirate movies was an out of fashion genre). Perhaps this is the reason why this film became a cult classic and has been seen and appreciated for generations to date. And its well deserved, since there are no negative notes in this film.

		<fullReview>Haven't seen this till just recently, even though most people have seen this from childhood. I honestly regret it, it was such a fun movie. It centers around a group of little kids trying to find a pirate treasure using a map from the main kid's attic, which is a map of the city. They make their way to a cave within the mountains to get to the X, while being pursued by a group of bandits. Classic story that everybody knows and loves, and I haven't until now.Actors Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, and others as kids, trying to find a pirate treasure, how can you go wrong. The characters are all unique in their own ways, and are fun to be around. Even the ones that are annoying, you learn to love. Chunk is a classic character, but when I saw him, it's like "oh, they're trying to make him annoyingly charming, oh brother he's just annoying", but by the end of the movie, he was one of my favorite characters, so funny. There's so much fantasy and excitement in the film, it just lifts you up and makes you want to experience it yourself.One thing i'll complain about is that writing in the first half of the film is just kids screaming at one another and not being able to hear what anybody is saying, it gets a bit thinner later one, but still. That's about it, other than that I enjoyed the film to no end. Such a good adventure that, while i'm sad to have missed out on as a kid, am so glad that I got to be a part of now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of a teenage version of Raiders of the Lost Ark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1981, director Steven Spielberg made an adventure movie called "Raiders of the Lost Ark". That film features one of the most popular action hero, Indiana Jones. In that film, Spielberg's tale was about a archaeologist, who tries to retrieve the Ark, which was stolen by the Nazis. The concept of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is also used in the new adventure film called "The Goonies". The Goonies tells the story about a bunch of kids, who lives in Astoria, Oregon. They like to go on certain types of situations together, considering that they're all misfits. When one of the kids stumbles upon a treasure map in his own attic that belongs to an old pirate named One-Eyed Willie, the Goonies set off on their last adventure. The problem is that greedy real estate buyers want to foreclosure the house and the kids must save it before it is gone. Well, the Goonies runs into troubles on their own as well, Three bumbling bad guys are also chasing and going after the Goonies as they descent more and more underground. I thought the underground set design was impressive though I had some questions about the caves and one concerning a well but, nevertheless, convincing. The idea of the underground caves is probably set to be a kids' hideout of some sort. But, never mind about that. Anyway, the film gets better as the kids falls through all kinds of booby traps. The booby traps are sort of ripped right out of the Indiana Jones movies, specifically the first one and the second one. The ideas behind this movie gets even more better. An giant man named "Sloth", who has a grotesque, deformed looking face, joined the gang, and also several girls are added to the list of characters. There is a lot of fun in The Goonies. I admired its energy and its style. But, there are questions that I ask myself when watching The Goonies. Those questions weren't important as the movie. Basically, this is nothing more than a funny, exciting, thrilling teenage adventure story. One other thing that I didn't mention. Some of the young actors who played the Goonies, like Sean Astin and Josh Brolin were good as the roles they presented. And, also, I enjoyed the supporting characters as well. Anne Ramsey, who plays the mother of the two criminals who are chasing the kids in the underground caves is pretty good is this movie. She's convincing and intimidating as the supporting character. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every kid has gone exploring with friends, pretending they were in another world. Cops and robbers, space travelers, cowboys and Indians, knights and dragons, you name it. Hunting for a pirate's buried treasure is another popular childhood fantasy. In 1985, director Richard Donner and producer Steven Spielberg would bring it to life for the screen. The result of this collaboration is one of the most beloved and iconic films of it's time. It takes us back to a simpler, more care free time in our lives.Pros: Great acting across the board. Dynamite concept. Solid direction from Richard Donner. Clever script. Beautifully scored. Amazing production design. Great sense of humor. Also a few good touching moments. Brisk pacing. A few memorable set pieces.Cons: A bit all over the place. Just a tad dated.Final thoughts: Fortunately, 'The Goonies' has withstood the test of time. It's a lot of fun, but also has a lot of heart. This was no exercise in greed like the latest 'Ice Age' and 'Spy Kids' films. It doesn't patronize kids, nor is it too violent for them. However, it's also one of those films adults can enjoy too.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"80's Childhood Classic!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Jeff Cohen, Jonathan Kuan, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, John Matuszak, Anne Ramsey, Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi star in Richard Donner's 1985 adventure. This takes place in Astoria, Oregon and begins with a jail breakout with 3 criminals, Jake Fratelli (Davi), his brother, Francis (Pantoliano) and their mama (Ramsey). Soon, we meet young kid, Mike Walsh (Astin) who lives with his brother, Brand (Brolin) and they're getting ready to move from their home taken over by a rich snob. Mike's pals, Mouth (Feldman), Data (Kuan) and Chunk (Cohen) come to visit and they find an old treasure map. They decide to have one last adventure hunting for treasure found by famous pirate, one-eyed Willie, but become trailed by the Fratelli's. The late, Matuszak plays Jake and Francis' deformed brother, Sloth who befriends Chunk, Green (Summer Rental) plays Andy, a girl Brand gets close with and Plimpton (The River Rat) plays her friend, Stef who join Mikey and the others on their quest. I've liked this 80's classic since I was a kid. It's got a great cast and excellent score by Dave Grusin. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining adventure but with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a group of teenagers who embark on a treasure hunt to save one of the teenager's family home from being repossessed."The Goonies" is a series of adventures, ranging from fights to daring escapes. For a children's' and teenagers' film, I did find it a little surprising to find so many gruesome scenes. There are loads of graphics scenes of death, even though they are " just" skeletons arranged and decorated to portray gruesome deaths. I wonder what teenagers think of watching daggers in the eye sockets of a skull. I find it disturbing.Another thing that bugs me is the constant hysterical screams and the incessant talking by some of the characters. The neurotic behaviour is way over the top. If they are so chicken to start with, would they even be in the treasure hunt in the first place? Though I am not the target demographic of "The Goonies", I still found it entertaining, especially towards the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic adventure from the pen of Steven Spielberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so this is a bit of a cult film for people of a certain age. I am (maybe) a little old to have been captured by it (I was in my 20's when it was released), but having seen it a couple of times I can see why it got the following it did. The first time was on TV and it was a version that had been cut back quite a bit to allow a daytime showing. This didn't really work (for me) and so I got the DVD which has a much better, uncut, version of the film. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.The Goonies are a bunch of kids who live in Astoria. They are; Mikey, Mouth, Chunk and Data, joined on this particular adventure by Mikey's brother, Brand, and two girls, Andy and Stef. All of their houses are under threat of foreclosure as the local country club looks to expand. None of the families can afford to stay and it looks like they are all going to have to move away. On their last day the boys are messing about in Mikey's dad's attic when they find an old pirate treasure map. Mikey is a bit of a dreamer and persuades the others to go looking for the treasure. Throw in a criminal family, the Fratelli's, and you got yourself an adventure you just won't believe! I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police (pirate division) will have me walking the plank again.Beautifully made with some excellent special effects (remember, no CGI back then) and a great score, it's great to look at. All the kids did an excellent job; Sean Astin as Mikey, Josh Brolin as Brand, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Kerri Green as Andy, Martha Plimpton as Stef and Jonathan Ke Quan as Data. The Fratelli's were also pretty good, so honourable mentions go to; John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake, Joe Pantoliano as Francis and Anne Ramsey as Mama.With a story by Steven Spielberg and having been made very much in his style, I can definitely see the appeal. The dialogue and the style put me very much in mind of the old 1930's black and white comedies that featured kids as the main characters. Don't ask me to name any of them, I lost those brain cells many years ago. If anything, I did find it a little too long and some of the jokes did tend to get a bit tired towards the end. Having said that though, it's still a fine film and well worth a look if you happen to come across it? Recommended.My Score: 8.1/10.IMDb Score: 7.5/10 (based on 74,589 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 63/100 (based on 41 reviews counted at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hey guys, if we don't get out of here soon, there's gonna be a hostage crisis".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit right up front, when I first saw this picture, I thought Ma Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) was a man, and I wasn't a kid at the time. Using the term ugly would be too cruel to describe her appearance knowing now that she was a she, but boy, I just couldn't get over her characterization. The voice didn't help either.Well anyway, "The Goonies" is the embodiment of the kind of film one likes to look back on and reminisce about their own youthful experiences. For me, it summons up the adventure of my Scouting days hiking and camping, swimming and diving off Catfish Rock, and just the general camaraderie of hanging out with friends you'd like to stay young with forever. Back in the Fifties, you didn't have many fat kids around like Chunk because we were always outside running around instead of playing video games, so that's one concession I have to give the picture. 'Hey you guuuu-uys!' must be universal, because we used that as a rally cry whenever it was time to get together, which was just about every day after school and on the weekends.Our adventures of course could never match the one in "The Goonies", and we didn't have to watch out for characters like One Eyed Willie or Chester Copperpot. Or Sloth. But that's the fun of the picture, seeing how the gang gets into and out of their scrapes, coming of age, and triumphing in the end to win out over the bad guys and their own insecurities. If you're young or just young at heart, "The Goonies" offers up a fun time that captures the spirit of being alive, because after all, Goonies never say die!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dierctor Richard Donner gives an imaginative film titled The Goonies. The film follows a group of kids find a treasure map and decide to go look for One Eyed Willies Gold. Meanwhile a group of criminals just escaped from jail are also after the treasure but also after the kids. The Dialouge is crafty and hilarious, the story is well thought out, the acting is well done, and The sets are wonderful. Ifyou are looking for a very fun film from the director of Lethal Weapon that look no further. It is a very enjoyable film. This is my teachers favorite films and it is one of mine.Rated PG For Adventure Action, Peril, And Language.1hr 54min/114min. ****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First rate family adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is a group of pre-teen nerdy boys who hang out in a small town which is about to be destroyed by developers. They go off on one last adventure on a forlorn search for the long lost treasure of One-Eyed Willie. They are accompanied by an older brother and a couple of girls, and they fall foul of escaped convicts the Fratelli brothers.This is a highly entertaining adventure romp for a family audience, full of action, adventure, and humour, together with sufficient jeopardy to keep suspense alive, even though the sheer good-humouredness of the piece means that you never think these kids are in serious danger.There are good performances from all, with a number of familiar faces in the early days of their careers (Sean Aston and Josh Brolin as brothers Mikey and Brandon, to name but two). Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are full of comic menace as the Fratellis. Only Jeff Cohen's Chunk irritates rather than amuses - and, boy, does he irritate.This undemanding film is great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best family films EVER made! And when I say family, I mean ALL the family. Too often 'Family film' means a film for kids - not this. This is up there (and in some respects exceeds) the likes of Back to the Future, Karate Kid (original), Ghostbusters *and newer* Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc.This is one of my all time favourites I've introduced to my 10 year old daughter who is getting fed up with the poor quality of films coming out. She loved it, and I loved watching it with her. So few 'family films' nowadays hold anything for me, watching films with my daughter was nearing a chore. (a shame, because I LOVE movies). From the characters, all well created, unique, and instantly likable (mostly), to a well thought out, yet simple plot this film entertains everybody from Grandad down to young children. (about 8ish)And who can watch Goonies without a "Hey youuooo guys!!...?Squinty</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I was growing up that I wanted be just like Captain Hook or Captain Jack Sparrow and have all the gold and treasure in the world. I wanted to go on treasure hunts with Peter Pan and call it all mine?I made everything in my life an adventure. There were always new "caves" to discover and land that just had to have treasure in it somewhere. I was bound and determined to find it. The first time I watched The Goonies, I wanted to be as brave and determined as Mikey. I wanted to be a Goonie.When this movie caught my eye, I knew that we would have to have it. Adventure was my forte and I wasn't going to let this adventure slip through my fingers. It made me want to go find Mikey and say, "Hey lets go get that treasure together!" The movie is set in 1985 in Astoria, Oregon. Seven kids only have a few days left before their homes get bought and turned into a golf course. They are desperate to find anything that can help save their house. While digging around in the attic, Mikey finds a treasure map that leads to the legendary treasure of "One-Eyed" Willy. There adventure begins at an abandoned summer restaurant. It is owned by the wanted Fratelli thieves. Little do they know that trouble is coming their way when they hide in the fire place in the basement of the restaurant. This is a funny, action packed movie with twists and turns that will make you want more. Watch it and live the greatest adventure of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great, uneven masterpiece which resembles the work of Spielberg and Lucas. For example this movie reminds me a lot of the epic computer game "Maniac Mansion" because of the character of the kids and the weirdos in the old house. I grew up in the 1980s, and I still remember the scary scenes with the freak in the basement who eats chocolate. For some reason, it touched me a lot, that he was so hungry and starving. I just watched it again on DVD, and it is still pretty good, although somewhat uneven. I think it would have been even better if it had taken place in an old house or a forest or something, instead of the set-like tunnels it actually takes place in. However, the story and energy of the movie is so amazing that one cannot help like it. It is like other great 80s movies such as "Back to the Future" a great description of that particular generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is our time"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films defy true objective criticism since they hold so much affection in the hearts of viewers, and this would be one such movie. The '80s is one of the foremost decades for producing movies that were "of their time" and this is no exception. For many, the enchantment is closely tied to nostalgia for their childhood, and it is certainly true that many of the markers in our lifetimes are cultural references.However, as with "Gremlins" ? which is slyly referenced in this movie ? nostalgia tends to overlook the technical aspects of film-making. Objectively, "The Goonies" does not fare so well. Part of the problem is inherent in most of the cast being young children, and then asking them to all shout or scream loudly at once with their high-pitched voices, and have a murky sound mix try to cleanly catch the dialogue. Another problem is that once the gang set off on their quest down myriad tunnels and caves, with a restaurant fireplace substituting for the rabbit-hole, it is not easy to follow the trail and put together a sense of exactly where they are in each scene and how it ties to where they were in the last one. There are also times when the "this is our time" speeches by Sean Astin's character come off as being a little too heavy-handed.Yet another problem is the cutting of a couple of filmed scenes that cause slight disjoints in the narrative. Suddenly the treasure map is significantly damaged without due explanation, and there is a reference to an octopus that is nowhere to be found in the final print. The deleted scenes which explain these plot points are available on DVD.The film could also have used clearer elucidation in other places, including the attic scene in which the map is discovered, and perhaps a word or two of exactly why a pirate ship was off the Oregon coast pursued by the British as soon as the early 1600s. Not that the origin of the back-story makes or breaks this movie, which should be seen first and foremost as pure escapist fantasy. On that basis, the film comes through pretty well, and while it is not a particularly great movie, it does enough to merit the place it has in so many people's hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cyndi Lauper Nostalgia Machine still rocks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before tonight, it had been roughly 7 years since my last viewing of "The Goonies" (from an era where I bore the nickname 'Sloth' among a select few)...and at first, I didn't really know what to think. The hyperactive exclamations of prepubescent Sean Astin ('Mikey'), Corey Feldman ('Mouth'), Jeff Cohen ('Chunk'), and Ke Huy Quan ('Data')--the 'Goonies' of the title--kind of grated on my nerves with their novice, kitchen-sink performances (even considering the usual excesses of child actors, this was pushing it). But just as I was beginning to think that, the movie kicked into gear and began its enthralling course--yes, even at 25 years of age, I can say without a hint of shame that I had a lot of fun with this kid-friendly "Temple of Doom." Our titular characters live in an overcast seaside community, set to be razed by greedy land developers looking to put up a golf course. While messing around with the antiques in Mikey's attic, our boys stumble across a 17th-century treasure map, and decide to embark on a quest to find the (implied) riches contained within. In their travels, they also run afoul of the slapstick quartet of 'Ma' Frattelli (Ann Ramsey) and her three sons (Robert Davi and "Memento"'s Joe Pantoliano), one of whom is a hideously deformed--but very humane--Charles Addams caricature. The Goonies also run into booby traps aplenty, and the story maintains a surprising amount of unpredictability, considering its target audience (while *mostly* a kid's movie, the material isn't inaccessible to older viewers).That being said, Steven Spielberg's story credit seems a bit dubious, especially when looking at "The Goonies" from a distance: he could have very well approached Warners with "'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' only with kids instead of Harrison Ford!" and collected his check on the way out. Whereas Indy, Willie, and Short Round altruistically braved peril to save the children of an impoverished Indian village, we have the Goonies altruistically banding together to save their threatened community.Of course, this would be bothersome...if "The Goonies" wasn't so much damn fun. Like the endearing classic "Ghostbusters," "The Goonies" is a similar 1980s gem, with a sense of creativity, adventure, and humor (including some fine one-liners), with plenty of crossover appeal to individuals who claim to have 'outgrown' this sort of film. If the film is dated in any way, it's only in the Cyndi Lauper theme song (which is still a bitchin' tune) that gives "The Goonies" its adventurously fun, young-at-heart identity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a Movie for the 1980s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching the Goonies again. I wanted to be a Goonie in real life and live in Astoria, Oregon. The film is quirky about a bunch of kids who may be spending the last time together before their homes are torn down and made into a golf course for the country club of Astoria. It had a great cast especially young Sean Astin who really changed from being Mikey to the Frodo's pal in Lord of the Rings Trilogy 15 years later. Who would have thought that Josh Brolin who plays his older brother, Brand, would turn out to be Barbra Streisand's stepson? Martha Plimpton still acts as well. I don't know what happened to Kerri Green who played her friend. Corey Feldman had a difficult adolescence, his estranged relationship with Michael Jackson, his drug problems, and family problems as well. Jeff Cohen went on to college and I don't know what happened to the kid who played Data. Anne Ramsay has a great role as Mama Fratelli with her two sons, one who just escaped prison, and the other as his accomplice. She has a third son, Sloth, but he is locked up downstairs. The beginning sequence is always worth watching over and over again. The film shows lovely sequences of Astoria, Oregon which I have yet to visit but plan too sometime in my life. Anyway, the film was dedicated to Mama Fratelli and the actress who played her. By the end of Ramsay's life, this film and Throw Momma From the Train finally gave her recognition. Ramsay was battling throat cancer. She had tongue removed between films and she was a beloved character actress. I love this movie. It reminds me of my childhood and I wished that children would have that kind of childhood today and that's why I'm glad that I don't have children because I can't imagine them being in today's environment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I watched the summer between my freshmen and sophomore year. My favorite character was Data. It was the perfect adventure/fantasy movie. The kids saving the day and the neighborhood. My favorite scenes were where Mouth was translating into Spanish for Rosalita. Her reactions to his translation was funny. Josh Brolin was the perfect big brother for Sean Astin (son of the Riddler from the 60's Batman series). Mouth being scared and then becoming brave at the end was cool. I also remember Cyndi Laupers music video from this movie, I just don't remember the song that she sang, but the ending of the video was funny with her saying Mr. Spielberg get me out of here. This is a movie that I look forward to sharing with my kids. The DVD has the full movie being played with the cast (in current time) giving their thoughts during the commentary. A must have DVD for those who love the Goonies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest, best films of my childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that nearly everyone who grew up in the 1980s has seen this film at some point. When I think of 'The Goonies', I am always brought back to my childhood. This is a very 1980s film, and it is very nostalgic for those of us who grew up with it. I would even say that this is one of the best films of my childhood. It had virtually everything going for it: treasure maps, kids in control of their destinies, pirate ships, deformed and misunderstood Sloth, humour with outcast and overweight Chunk, revenge, 'booby' traps, evil/creepy Italians, and I could go on and on. There's a lot this film has going for it, and its highly engaging plot ensures that children will not be bored. Even, it is a little bit silly. The kids make this film what it is, and they are the ones that save the day. They outsmart the evil Fratellis and get the treasure. And, who could not find the scenes with Sloth and Chunk highly amusing, especially when Chunk confesses everything that he has done wrong? This is a pure gem. Very good, and it still brings back laughter into my 20s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reminded of this film when there was a reference to it in a recent episode of Family Guy. I thought I would put my fond memories of the film to the test (a dangerous thing to do usually) and go out and hire it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film manages to be entertaining two decades later.For those of you that haven't seen it, I'm not sure if I can promise a great movie experience, because I know much of my enjoyment of this film is connected to fond memories of my original (multiple) viewings way back when. But I would like to think that it is still a decent film for kids and young teens, and it goes without saying that for those of you reading this who are thinking about watching it again after many years distant from the last time, I highly recommend a revisiting of this film.This film is a fairly straightforward adventure movie, but very well done, and the feeling of empathy one has for the main characters is the thing that carries the viewer to the end. Twenty years is long enough for subtle but meaningful shifts in the cultural values of a society, and I did cringe slightly at times, but that is to be expected and not an indictment on the film.</fullReview>

Sean Astin, in the wishing well scene, is every young boy who keeps exploring in the woods after dusk. His mother wouldn't approve, but adventure calls to him and he must answer. Maybe he even owns a pocket knife that she doesn't know about, and out on his own he has the freedom to use it.Maybe there are better movies for children. But if you don't see the significance of "The Goonies" then you probably don't have a clue as to what it's like to be a kid.</fullReview>

It has wonderful characters beautifully played by Sean Astin,Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Jonathan Ke Quan, Kerri Green, and MarthaPlimpton.

I haven'tbought the DvD yet, but I heard it's great, I'm really looking forwardto the audio commentary. My favorite parts in the movie are when Chunktries to give the candy bar to the deformed guy and it hits his head and then he cries, and Chunk gives a hilarious scream, the deformed guy,Sloth, is the most hilarious character, him and Mama Fratelli. Anotherone of my favorite scenes is when the Goonies are running from theFratellis and then Data puts the water from his shoes and it makes theFratelli's slip, and I loved the opening with the wonderful music andthe police chase introduces all of the goonies. I totally love thismovie. It's beautifully acted, directed, and written. And I heard therewas an idea of a sequel, I hope they have one before the year 2005, Iknow that no one can replace the real goonies, but I can see Haley JoelOsment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I ever had to narrow my DVD collection down to ten, the Goonies would definitely be a keeper. I first saw this one sixteen years ago and, as anyone from the era can tell you, it only gets better as you get older. Who knows what it is about this film? I don't think it was inteneded as anything more than a good matinee time-killer, but when Spielberg and Donner set out to make this one with a cast of virtual unknowns, they created a true classic. True, it's a cinematic mess, but a wildly entertaining, inventive, cinematic mass with a dose of good ole fashioned nostalgia. I imagaine that if I had just now seen this movie for the first time, it probably wouldn't have had the same effect on me. It does something that no other movie (with the exception of Back to the Future) has done for me. It takes me back to those rainy days, when I was a kid. I still remember. You see, my house was the "kool-aid" house of the neighborhood and all my friends hung out there. When the weather was too nasty for riding bikes or whatever, you could bet that the Goonies would be in our VCR and we would be kicked back with popcorn and sodas, laughing our asses off at Chunk doing the truffle-shuffle or the bumbling Fratelli brothers bickering and pulling guns on each other.Over the years, I've owned probably a half-dozen copies of this movie and I just got the DVD last August. It was really cool to see the entire cast get-together for the audio/video commentary and see them arguing and laughing just like in the old days. It's still a mystery to me why they never did a sequel. With the popularity of this one, Hollywood would definitely have another Harry Potter on their hands.Although it may not have the same sentimental factor, I urge anyone who hasn't already seen this film to give it a try. It's great for kids and who knows, maybe 8 year-olds who see this now will look back on it the way I do. Donner, If you're reading this, please round up the old cast, call up Spielburg and get to work on the Goonies 2. We NEED it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhh, the magic eighties. When everything were simple. And when there was Steven. With his E.T. and The Goonies...O.K. I'm guilty of being nostalgic. But hey, that was the decade they made best teen-movies and The Goonies certainly classify here. Adventurous action, humorous scenes (just remember the one, when one of the kid at the start of the movie translate stupidities to the spanish talking maid), great movie music (the opening music is definetly one of best I ever heard) and an "Indiana Jones" scenes. Combinig that you get the movie almost every kid like. Or an adult. It is fun to watch and it certainly bring memories back, when everybody wants to be a Goonie. All in all, it maybe not a classic such as Neverending story 1 or E.T., but it's close. Very close.That's why, a great8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was three years old when this movie came out, so of course I didn't see it in the theater. However, growing up I've always thought "The Goonies" has been with me along the way. This movie is so good and such a classic 80's film that I can't express my feelings enough. I realize I'm making The Goonies sound like Citizen Kane, but really how many people can say that they don't remember this movie, or how much of an impact it had on you when you were little. Everything about this movie is great. Simply a wonderful movie... ROCKY ROAD!!!</fullReview>

All actors in this film give brilliant performance's. This film is action packed. Any young boy or girl for that matter should really watch this film if they are into adventures and treasure hunting...This film also has a great message of friends and family being the most important things in life. The story is well played out, though I would love to see this intact...All cut scenes fully restored. Oh, well I'm sure that won't happen. Still the film is excellent...The relationships between the boys is very realistic, atleast for the time period...I don't think kids are like this today....This is a great escape from reality film that is a true gem! Worth watching over and over again!10 out of 10</fullReview>

With this film's eclectic and amiable cast lightup the screen with their unique and honest interpretations, of agroup of friends that will do anything to prevent being separated ina mass neighborhood evacuation. Richard Donner does awonderful job conveying the atmosphere of mystery and suspense, as we follow "The Goonies" through their excitingadventure which entails a message that is two-fold: friends willalways be friends despite how far away they are from, and"Goonies' Never Say Die!" These two ideas describe thewonderful theme of the movie, which allows for an extremelyentertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was real little. I think I was about 8 or 9 years old. I had been visiting my grandparents and My cousin was with me, so my grandmother took my cousin and I to the video store to rent some videos. Well I was looking through what they had when I came upon this movie. I liked the picture was on the front of the box and thought this might be cool movie. Well, I was right it a fantastic movie. Ever since then every time I would go to a video store the Goonies was one of the movies I would pick to watch and it drove everyone nuts. lolWhen I would watch the Goonies I would Always wish and still do that I could have been on that adventure also. and My cousin said that he felt the same way that I did about this movie, but it wasn't his favorite. I think it is such a great movie kids to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nostalgic Adventure full of fun and excitement....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may have taken the newly released widescreen re-mastered DVD to bring justice to this classic family film, about a band of misfit kids, self entitled "The Goonies". This is not an endorsement or a review about the quality of DVD over VHS, but this is one film that truly deserves a re-visitation in its digital format. Richard Donner daunted - yet driven - succeeds in directing a child cast in a Hardy Boys/Indiana Jones adventure about friends who seek long lost buried treasure to save their doomed homes from being torn down. With so much at stake, Donner swiftly spins a lightly brushed, heavy-hearted film with strong character interactions, development and teamwork. There is a great sense of innocence in all the characters, who fight for what is right and predictably overcome great odds (what do you expect from a good family film?). The visuals are sometimes breathtaking (almost like a homeage to the seaside coast of Oregon). The soundtrack is intermittenly sweeping. It's a funny, over-the-top kids adventure that wins because it gave, and still gives kids a sense that they can do anything if they stick together and never give up. "Goonies never say die!". Final rating 7.4/10</fullReview>

I watch it now and I still love it the adventure aspect of it, that sense of wonder when they search for the treasure and the suspense when the Fratelli's are chasing the kid's, it is all good. The movie has great one liner's and the characters seem familiar in a sense. The movie was great and I always wanted to see a sequel, but had to settle for the NES sequel which was great in it's own way.

		<fullReview>I am now 23 years old, and I remember very clearly watching Goonies for the first time when I was nine years old. The movie absolutely dazzled me with its depiction of kids my age off experiencing wild and fantastic adventure. So watching this film now really takes me back to a great time in my life, where you could genuinely loose yourself in such stories.Another characteristic which I feel makes this film great is it has that definite 80s feel to it. People will give Spielberg a hard time, but I grew up during the 80s loving The Raiders of the lost Ark, and the Roger Moore James Bond films. Goonies is firmly placed within this group.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Child movies today are nothing compared to this classic 80s kid flck!Sure, Showtime has "Movies for Kids of All Ages" but this is truly a great kiddie flick, as well as a wonderful family film.I first saw this film in 1986, when I was around 4 years old. My parents must have been attempting to get me and my brother into something. I still love this film very much, even to this day, as an 18 year old. Some of the comments on here are pretty negative. Every American child around my age, maybe even older, has seen this at least once.I loved each character, especially Mikey, who was so cute! Each character had a unique personality, and all of them had some memorable moments. Two parts particularly tickled my fancy: When Chunk is tied to a chair and is told to spill his guts, he confesses absolutely everything he has done. It's amazing what you can get from Chunk! Also, the part where they slide out of the sewer system into the underground with the Pirate ship was classic, because Corey Felman, who as Mouth doesn't shutup, yells "F***!" when he comes out. I actually found out how they did so many takes of that scene, and in every one of them, Feldman yelled the same word over and over. Eventually, they gave up and put it in the movie. I also like Kerri Green as Andy, and Martha plimpton as Stef. Data and Brandon were also great characters.If you like kiddie flicks, or want to relive your childhood, I highly recommend this film! You will love it, and it brings back many memories!That's all, I confessed everything!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of kids who are about to be evicted from their homes discover a treasure map and get involved in an adventure involving pirates(Well, dead ones), a family of gangsters, buried treasure, and of course, intricate booby traps. This is an adventure that everybody wanted to go on as a kid, and is fully realized in this fine film. The acting is excellent, especially considering the sheer amount of child actors. Many didn't go on to have much of a career after this film though, except maybe Sean Astin, Josh Brolin and Martha Plimpton. As for the adults, they Fratelli's manage to be both sinister and somewhat comedic at the same time-fans of 007 and The Matrix might recognize the two brothers-Robert Davi(Jake) went on to play the sinister Sanchez in 1989's "License to Kill", and Joe Pantolino(Francis) went on to play Cypher in "The Matrix", although he's barely recognizable. From the Cyndia Lauper song to the fashions, this film has 80's written all over it, and is a huge nostalgia trip for many of the kid's who grew up during that interesting decade. A great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that most of you guys have already summed up the Goonies pretty well! Nearly all of the comments that i have currently read on this superb adventure film have mentioned the fact that it gives you warm and welcome memories of your childhood. I am only 14 years old myself, but even i can remember watching this film every christmas with my family and we all loved it! I think that most of the actors in this do a great job. It is a film which shows off the young talent of the eighties, and a lot of the actors have gone on to do bigger and better things. However, in my opinion Sean Astin steals the show, he is superb and although all of the characters (including his) are stereotyped, Mike Walsh is a young hero in this film and i love him. However, you could say that i like this film so much just because of my adoration for Sean Astin, but all of the other actors do a superb job as well for example Corey Feldman and the boys who played Data and Chunk (can't remember their names at the moment!) Josh Brolin also did a great job. The story line and script were superb and i love this film to bits. It has to be one of my favourite films of all time.</fullReview>

They still could as far as I'm concerned. It would be great to see a reunion movie of our favorite characters going on one more 'Goonie' adventure. Probably won't happen, though. Sean's involved with that LOTR trilogy now. Still, when he's through with that, he should get the gang back together and do this one just for the fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, one of those sweet childhood memories from the mid eighties. An excellent adventure that keeps you seated from the first scene to the very end. This movie includes a few teens from a boring town, a very old map, a Spanish boat, a dark cave filled with booby traps and countless skeletons. I liked One Eyed Willy - although he didn't say a word. And what would a good movie be if the credits didn't include the name 'Steven Spielberg'? Right...Although I enjoyed "The Goonies", I must say that the whole thing is about 'finding a treasure', a subject that doesn't look too exciting. In fact, nothing interesting happens in the first twenty minutes of the movie. All the fun begins when our Goonies enter the cave. Unfortunately,when the Goonies find the secret entrance caves, traps and bones are the only things that pass your screen until the end.Must-see and must-have movie, which deserves a **** out of *****.</fullReview>

We hit on many staple movies of the 80s and early 90s. Despite all of the competition, this movie jumped out at us.As soon as they started trying to fix the statue, we all wanted to be Goonies, and the desire just got bigger as we watched more. This is the fantasy of every kid come to life. You get to save your family, kiss the girl, find the treasure and beat the bad guys. What more could you want in a movie? Oh yeah, we also want a giant-but-friendly mutant, and this movie has that too.This movie is VERY highly recommended. If you have a pulse, rent this.

		<fullReview>"The" 80's movie. Ask anyone born before 1984 and after 1979 if they have seen The Goonies and a smile will no doubt come across their face. The plot is simple: a group of kids go on a journey to find treasure buried by the amusingly named One Eyed Willie. There's lots of skeletons and booby traps along the way, plus the threat of the Fratelli's, a family of robbers and murderders, catching them. From the silly chase scene at the start, to the grand finale, The Goonies is infectious entertainment. Although flatly directed by Richard Donner, the special effects and the kids are great fun to watch. The kids act like real kids, and the sharp script by Chris Columbus gives them realistic dialogue. The action scenes are standard Spielberg fare: bats attacking, skeletons popping out, and a deranged piano organ.Some of the fright effects can get a little grisly for younger children, and the film is usually edited when shown on television. But The Goonies is high adventure all the way, and is well worth a watch at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing brings forth memories of the adventures my generation took part in during our youth than "The Goonies". Every time I watch this film, I feel like breaking out my Garbage Pail Kids or my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or perhaps rounding up a bunch of my childhood friends to go out on a treasure hunt.This movie does such an excellent job of showing the free spiritedness of children, and their unfounded ability to stand by and support each other through difficult times. I believe that everyone can identify with at least one of the characters, which is a rarity in what is considered a children's film.If you were to ask anyone my age (males especially) if they remember "The Goonies", I guarantee that a wide smile will stretch across his/her face, and I know that he might then go on to unfold many a tale of his childhood adventures with his closest friends. This ability to bring out some of the most important remembrances of our past is what makes this movie so powerful; "The Goonies" will forever be the defining film of my generation's youth.</fullReview>

As if things weren't already difficult enough, there's a band of hardened criminals after them too...A fairly uneven movie. Is a decent adventure with some great moments, especially comedic moments, and some rollicking good fun, but is also quite silly at times. There's so many scenes that are random at best and sub-plots that add nothing to the movie. Anything involving the character Chunk you knew would just be plain irritating and involve a lot of mindless screaming...Performances vary too. There are some stars-of-the-future in the cast - Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton - and they give solid performances. However, consistent with the irritating nature of the character he played, Jeff Cohen almost ruins the show as Chunk. Kids will love the movie.

Nostalgic but also timeless, offering enough originality to make it memorable while also sticking fairly close to the typical treasure hunt adventure. The character development gives off the feeling like there were so many adventures before and so many more to come? but, behold, only one movie was ever made. Ramsey is always a terrific villainess, while Davi and Pantoliano have the right/intentionally-wrong chemistry as her two convict sons who are more interested in bickering and fighting for their mother's love than following the trail of the Goonies. Then we have the side-story of Chunk (Cohen) and Sloth (Matuszak), a duo that is worthy enough to have their own spin-off. Cyndi Lauper's song is also very fitting.***? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies (1985): Dir: Richard Donner / Cast: Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Josh Brolin, Kerri Green, John Matuszak: Overrated yet entertaining family adventure about a group of kids whose parents are about to lose their homes when higher powers threaten to foreclosure. Central plot regards a group of kids seeking out a treasure and a pirate ship. First issue regards the villains who are presented as juvenile morons for the family audience. Rather than be threatening and intriguing villains they are merely thugs and loud mouths. Many of the characters are interchangeable with the exception of Sean Astin who leads the group and has the spirit of adventure. Corey Feldman plays the rebellious friend very confrontational. Josh Brolin plays the standard older brother without personality. John Matuszak has the physical features to play Sloth who is kept chained up and eventually befriends the children. Kerri Green plays the ever familiar girlfriend material who will not realize it until the third act. Speaking of which, the climax and some of the humour is overly corny with images of decaying bodies that may be much for the intended audience. Director Richard Donner has created such great films as Superman: The Movie and The Omen. Here he presents a well made juvenile Indiana Jones adventure that may excite the imagination that we all had at that age as we sought out our own treasures. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can still remember my dad putting a VHS tape of this movie on when I was a kid, I loved it! The title and initial intro was slightly off-putting but it's one of those movies that you have to watch the whole thing of to really appreciate it. Sure, it's a little weird at times, there's a few crude jokes (the statue, oh my god), but at a closer look you'll see that it's a story about friendship and childhood adventures, something you never get too old to remember.The Goonies is one of those films that either you love, or you hate. I love it and I hope it isn't lost among the sea of bad remakes of other movie classics popping up in the 21st century. I hope other generations get to experience this film (though at that point it may be outdated since kids today are lazy as heck and slaves to Apple Inc.). This movie is somewhat of a cult film, it has a fanbase of people who grew up with it and love it and it's becoming more popular as a nostalgic relic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're Not Going to Find a Better Hokey 80's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This past weekend a local theater in my hometown showed Steven Spielberg's "The Goonies" on the big screen. I made it a point to go, as this is one of those movies that I know that I'd seen a time or two when I was a kid, but I also somehow managed not to ever see it in a theater when it came out. That may have been due to the slight bit of language in the film, which my mother probably deemed inappropriate for a seven year old. But what I know is that this is the kind of film that I either had watched at a friend's house during a sleepover or on TV with alterations, and as such was a movie that I had seen in bits and pieces, but perhaps not all the way straight through. At the very least I hadn't watched it in a very long time.Having now viewed the movie in a theater as an adult, I can say that it's an 80's masterpiece. The film follows a group of boys all of whom appear to be about 12 years old, along with their older, high school aged brother and a couple of girls from his school, all of whom set out (some unwittingly) on a scavenger hunt to find a buried treasure. The hunt finds them encountering a group of thieves who had robbed a bank in the movie's opening scenes, and the basic gist of the film is the hunt for the treasure while trying to evade these antagonists.What makes this movie special is that it's such a wonderfully told story, with fun characters and childish humor that is at both one and the same time juvenile and yet endearing. The film is perfect for youth who are coming of age, with a style that encompasses both child fantasy and adult themes. It's a great film for 11-15 year olds, but also for adults who just like fun movies. As I mentioned above, there is a very slight bit of language in the film, so perhaps my mother was right for not letting me see it as a seven year old. But, again, older kids should love it.The real genius of this movie, though, is that it's a perfect example of an iconic 80's teen movie. It's wonderfully hokey but still a real pleasure to watch. I give it 9/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is one's childhood without The Goonies? It's a childhood that misses out on unquestionably one of the most purely enjoyable and unbridled joyous adventures ever committed to screen and a movie that to this day stands the test of time thanks to it's witty script, fantastic child actors and a story that unlocks the adventurer that hopefully dwells within all of us.Coming from the great mind that is Steven Spielberg and directed by Superman/Lethal Weapon helmer Richard Donner The Goonies was and is the perfect melding of the Hardie Boys come to life and an adventure that is impossible not to enjoy. Much of the film's success lies in its un-tapping of what is essentially a longing in all of us young and old to discover treasure whether figuratively or metaphorically and the journey that our young "Goonies" take is the embodiment of this.Lead by the wise beyond his years and future Sam from Lord of the Rings Sean Astin as Mikey the group consists of the teenager older brother Brand (a young Brolin), wisecracking Mouth (an on form Feldman), poor old fat kid Chunk (Cohen), Asian inventor extraordinaire Data (Temple of Doom's Ke Quan) and female tagalongs Andy (Green) and Stef (Plimpton). This group presents one of the most fully formed and memorable gangs in cinema history a gang that can sit proudly along with the Breakfast Club, The Sandlot gang or any other iconic group of young adults. The gang's journey is given heart thanks to the meaning behind there want of riches, the want to save their homes and there friendships from being torn down by greedy land developers. The team behind The Goonies literally struck gold with the casting in this picture with a young cast many a film would die for and who are strongly supported by one of the nastiest screen family's your likely to see in the form of the Fratelli's who lock up their own disfigured brother "Sloth" (played by former NFL participant John Matuszak) who becomes a star of the movie.All the great casting in the world would not of made The Goonies such a classic if it were not for the playfulness the film finds in its traps and contraptions. The film is brimming to life with practical and special effects that hearken back to an almost teenage version of an Indiana Jones fable with skeletons, spikes, waterslides and pirate ships littering the scenery giving the film a sense of realism that would be lost today in a myriad of overused and unconvincing special effects. Those youngsters who will find themselves watching this film will be cast under its spell due to this much like I and hopefully you were at their age to.For the child and explorer in all of us there is no better tale to partake in than The Goonies, a film that has charm to spare and rewards for re-watch after re-watch. Much like the titular gang who never say die hopefully the film will live on and on and continue to put a smile on the faces of all who take the wonderful journey.5 truffle shuffles out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of kids go in search of pirate One-Eyed Willie's treasure to save their homes from being demolished to make room for a country club. An '80s classic full of humor, adventure, and heart. Great characters, fun story, lots of memorable lines and scenes. It's the kids adventure film all other kids adventure films should be judged by. There's not a flaw in the cast. The villains (Anne Ramsey, Joey Pants, Robert Davi) are all great fun, even when they're being evil. The Goonies (Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, et al.) are one of the finest group of kid actors ever assembled in one movie. They all play off each other so well and each gives an authentic performance. Who doesn't love Mikey, Chunk, Mouth, or Data? Not to mention Sloth. These are all memorable and likable characters. The direction is excellent. The sets and special effects are extraordinary. It's just a phenomenal movie. A true classic in every sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all time best movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying if you've read any negative reviews try to keep in mind these are people who never learned the lesson "if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all." There's a huge difference between saying "it's not for me" and running it into the ground. Whining about children yelling in a movie mostly cast with children, is kind of idiotic.That being said, The Goonies is one of the quintessential movies of the 80's, and it has never lost its shine. This movie is easily a 10, it will always be a 10...even after you've watched it over and over. It never gets stale. I loved it at 15 years old and I love it at 40 years old. It captures a little bit of everything...action, romance, drama, adventure, suspense..all wrapped in your childhood. If you want to have a good time, sit down and pay attention to this movie. A fun rousing adventure. Each of the actors and actresses (as well as writers and director, basically everyone involved) should be given a posthumous Oscar award, for touching people so artistically. I found it extremely distasteful someone called out Martha Plimpton and put her down over others. She was in integral part of the whole mixture. The movie just works. It's like magic in a bottle. Naysayers, take a hike...no one cares what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this movie doesn't make you smile then I don't know what does.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in the summer of 1985, The Goonies is the film that I always bring up when I challenge one's coolness. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but what you need to know in order to appreciate this film is that it's purely and simply, a fun adventure film. While yes, the script isn't the most clever ever written, I think that Chris Columbus brings enough character development and well written action scenes along with a lot of heart that makes it a really well laid out screenplay.Steven Spielberg had been in the spotlight for 10 years at this point, thanks to the success of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and most especially, E.T. (1982), which was in its day the highest grossing film in history. All films are absolute perfection in my mind and show us why we go to the movies to begin with. Spielberg was now everywhere and not only the most powerful director in Hollywood but also the most powerful producer. By now, he was even showing his talent as a producer and it was one hit after another. With Poltergiest (1982), Gremlins (1984) and the mega hit Back To The Future (1985), Spielberg could do no wrong and proving that unlike most directors and producers, he clearly knows what the audience wants but also what works and what doesn't.Which brings me to The Goonies. Spielberg originally came up with the story but brought in Gremlins writer and future director Chris Columbus to write the screenplay. He then hired Richard Donner, best known for films like The Omen (1976) and Superman (1978), to direct the film. In my opinion, one of the things that makes this film work so well (besides the script and the actors) is Richard Donner's direction. He brings a sense of excitement and also, tension to the screen. From the very first scene involving a jailbreak, this is a director who knows how to make a movie I think, his camera work and directing of the actors is amazing, it gets you hooked into the story which I have to give credit to Donner. Sometimes I wonder if the movie would have been just as great if Spielberg directed the film himself and don't get me wrong, Spielberg is one of the best directors in my mind but Donner's approach is something to be acknowledged. I actually think it's his film in a way.So yes, I do consider this a cinema classic. It's a film that we can all connect with. I remember one review on IMDb pointing out how this film unifies us and I couldn't have said it any better. Anytime you say The Goonies, people know exactly what you're talking about and they always quote a line from the film. This is the true definition of a cinema classic in my mind, a film that is loved all over the world and it's not just a part of pop culture. I would place this movie up there with Citizen Kane or Casablaca as silly as that may sound to some. If you're a movie lover like me who loves to go to movies to feel uplifted or just have a good time, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loud kids, always talking over each other, going on a treasure hunt coming in contact with two criminals, their mentally deformed(mistreated and humongous)brother, and bossy mother..that's pretty much the plot. Asthmatic Sean Astin and his big brother(always working out)are about to lose their home and their neighborhood friends decide to look for the treasure of an old pirate whose map they find in the attic. To be honest I was inspired for some reason to watch this after revisiting STAND BY ME for the first time since I was a teenager. THE GOONIES is raucus and busy, with kids bucking for their time on screen. A cast of child actors, some of whom would become successful adult actors(particularly Josh Brolin, with Astin would hitting paydirt with RUDY and the Lord of the Rings movies), I'm not sure how director Richard Donner escaped unscathed without a stint in the nuthouse. Entering into my thirties, I have been on a nostalgia trip and this movie, truth be told, was more fitting to when I was 10, now as a father I deal with kids like these and so I shutter instead of necessarily grin with affection for these wild brats. Oh, I'm no curmudgeon, these kids are near and dear to my heart--I was their age when this movie was made and had a little brat in me as well, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that a lot of the noise become a bit of an annoyance. Not too irritating, mind you, but putting together this many kids, crowding scenes with overlapping dialogue, can be a bit much from time to time. The energy and enthusiasm, though, is viable and rubbed off on me yet again, as always..I can not deny that. As you might expect, the Spielbergian schmaltz is laid on thick with the whole foreclosure subplot and how the Goon Docks kids ban together for one last great adventure hoping to save their home from being knocked down. Who'd of thought that caves were underneath the city containing booby traps with falling rocks, floors that fall away, skeletons galore, and even a pirate ship--those Warner Bros sets are utilized to the hilt. Even One-Eyed Willie makes an appearance. Kids should eat this up for generations to come even if we ourselves eventually grow up and find it less effective. Sloth and Chunk(with food always on the brain) are quite a pair, Mama's misbegotten(she dropped him on his face twice after giving birth to him, hence the facial malformations and child-like sensibilities)son becoming the hero at the end. Astin is the driving force behind the hunt, always motivating the pack to pursue the grand prize which might save Goon Docks. Feldman, as usual, is the obnoxious wisecracker whose use of the Spanish language is pretty funny, particularly what he tells the maid who can speak no English. I've got to be honest--Cyndi Lauper's titular song for the movie is awfully catchy.</fullReview>

Jeff Cohen (Chunk) makes me laugh all the time. Corey Feldman (Clark) is also hilarious in a cool style. Jonathan Quan is just great in his supporting role with all of his inventions. All the obstacles that these boys face trying to get a treasure is just hilarious. They are trying to save their homes from being destroyed. They find a map in their attic that may be able to lead them to "One Eyed Willys" treasure. They run into many obstacles and each one is funnier and funnier. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie.

		<fullReview>In an effort to ward off property developers and save the Walsh's from having to move away. Mikey Walsh, Brand Walsh and their intrepid friends, set off to look for pirate treasure they believe exists after the discovery of a dust covered map.Fun fun fun! Treasure, pirates, booby traps, crooks, weird cellar dwelling humans, water slides, wishing wells and budding teenager romances The Goonies has it all. Directed by Richard Donner and written by Steven Spielberg and Christopher Columbus, The Goonies is one of those rare animals that thrills the children and bewitches the adults in equal measure. Romping along at a fair old click, the film never stops to pause for breath, thus dragging the viewers along for the ride. There is no expense spared with the production (the sets are delightful) and the cast are mostly engaging, some minor annoyances aside {the girls are adventure caricatures for instance}. To leave a film that once loved in childhood, will hopefully stay far beyond into your adult years. A junior Raiders Of The Lost Ark perhaps? Maybe not, but still one wholly satisfying action adventure picture, one that's standing the test of time for many of us with our fondly nostalgic glasses perched delicately on the end of the nose. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child to teenager growing up in the 80's this was a memorable one. I remember really enjoying it when I was 9 walking out of the theater. One of the definitive 80s movies, The Goonies, a mid-80s movie pretty much defines the decade and adventure genre. Not really an important movie or particularly well done, it features some fun scenes and memorable chumming awash in perfectly 80s music. The cast of child actors seemed to mesh very well, obviously enjoying their moments together. The adventure is well paced, if standard, and the sets are fairly well done for the most part. Yes, The Goonies is one of those movies, you may stop to watch if you see it again for nostalgia's sake if you're one of those 80s kids. Recommended for 80's fans especially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Goonies" is a kids classic with a Spielberg-sized imagination and heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as "The Goonies" is distinctly an 80s film, there's no denying that sense of timelessness about it as a kids adventure film. It's got buried treasure, creepy yet conveniently klutzy bad guys, and that archetypal rag-tag group of kids who all go by nicknames. That's pretty much the foundation for live action kids movies for at least the next decade. Unfortunately, that kind of kids' entertainment has fallen by the wayside to make way for CGI in this century, but that shouldn't cheat "The Goonies" of its sense of magic, mystery and the courage of children who refuse to let rationality plague their thinking while they're still young."The Goonies" follows a group of kids on the Oregon coast, all with their own amusing quirks, as they search for a treasure that would give them enough money to save their homes from being bought out by the wealthy folks in town. There's Mikey (Sean Astin), the fearless leader, Mouth (Corey Feldman), the smart-ass, Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) the crazy gadget nerd and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) the rotund, hunger-driven, paranoid, klutz. When the boys escape, they're followed by Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and his love interest, Andy--the teenage friendly subplot. Of course the treasure is buried beneath the house of some insanely creepy murderers named the Fratellis who are completely stupid yet no less creepy. Joe Pantoliano plays one of them. They're your standard villains and perfect for the fantasy element of the movie. Obviously this film tries to play off producer/writer Steven Spielberg's success with Indiana Jones by setting up underground cave booby traps as the kids go after the treasure. This is a very funny movie in both the cute family way and clever way too. The humor that comes from these kids is fun for children viewers because it's visual and funny for adults because of what comes out of their mouths. While this is mostly a boys-oriented film, it's definitely intended for families, although I was surprised by the swearing of some of the kids in the film.Considering Spielberg, Richard Donner (one of the 80s most famous directors) and future Harry Potter director Chris Columbus all played a part in the creation of this film, it should be no surprise this film has the imagination and the talent behind it to work on all these levels for all these different audiences. While I do think the movie kind of fizzles in the last half hour with all the focus on the treasure and escaping, the rest is so strong that you can get through it easily. This is simply a kids/family classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't watched the Goonies in years, in fact I first saw it in 1987 on our new VCR and watched it over and over, but anyway it had been about 10 years since I last saw it. I came home from a long Saturday night and it happened to be on. As I was watching all the nostalgia came rushing back to me(about where Cyndi Lauper starts singing "Goonies R Good Enough"). What a great movie, you will never see something like this made today, it had some mature themes(although nothing really that bad) and kids were allowed to be kids back then. What's great about it is that the kids are real, swearing and all, and are not being tracked on GPS like many kids of today. Some people complain about the acting and the dialogue, but what are people expecting from a movie targeted towards children and preteens? The main attraction in movie's like this is the adventure, and with a man like Spielberg behind it, the adventure sure didn't disappoint. Adding the production values of a summer blockbuster adventure to a children's movie was pure genius. Anyone who can't appreciate this movie was probably forced against their will to do the "Truffle Shuffle" when they were younger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies is a 1985 kids movie produced by Steven Spielbergo himself has Corey Feldman and the screenplay was written by Christopher Columbus who would go on to direct the first two Harry Potter films. Very high budget film of the time most likely. Very nicely shot like many films of this time period they spared no expense. I really liked the adventuresome storyline that shows a unrealistic/realistic trouble this group of kids called The Goonies get themselves into. There is the cute boy/girl aspect to the brother and the girlfriend. I love the Chinese kid Data and his totally wacked out gadget belt. This movie is not overrated in any sense. I would have loved to see this in the movie theater but it came out when I was a baby. I remember seeing ET in the theater and that's one of the films that really influenced me and my love for movies. It's films like ET and The Goonies that are just fun films that never die because there so good that we pass them on to the next generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Steven Spielberg's work and "The Goonies" is another one of his masterpieces that have made their way into my DVD collection. "The Goonies" is a film about a group of boys, Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin), Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen (Jeff Cohen), Clark 'Mouth' Devereaux (Corey Feldman), Richard 'Data' Wang (Jonathan Ke Quan), who go on an adventure to find hidden treasure. The boys are followed by Mickey's brother Brand (Josh Brolin), Stef (Martha Plimpton) and Andy (Kerri Green). Through their adventure they meet twisting passages and outrageous booby-traps. If you like "Stand By Me", "The Breakfast Club" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" then you will also like "The Goonies"!!! A must see film!!!I have given The Goonies 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gold Standard for 80's kids films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is an absolutely classic children's film that will be a favourite for years to come. A superbly paced and well acted film, it keeps you energised and totally focused on the ensuing action.When I first saw the film, aged about 10, I was totally entranced from the dangerous treasure hunting stunts to the hilarious comedic elements involving Data and, of course, The Fratellis.I still watch this today on DVD (which by the way has a great reunion of the original cast on it - Chunk looks very different these days!) and it stands up as a film that can be watched and enjoyed by adults. It has a dreamlike innocence, without being mawkish, that is sadly lacking in many of today's films for children. Even better is the fact that this is achieved with a cast of kids who are not perfect, but reflect how kids really are. There are badly behaved, spoilt, obese, intelligent, sensitive, sports mad, vain, asthma-ridden and geeky characters on show but by the end you feel something for them all.An amazing film and a cultural reference point for growing up in the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is underdog does good at its finest. You've got kids who are about to be kicked out by the "rich" people just so they can build a country club ("I hope they sink their balls and never get them out.") A little crush ("shame, shame, we know your name"). A comic relief, popular in the 80s "fat" kid ("do the truffle shuffle" "oh, c'mon" "do it!") Even an escaped criminal and family who are on the run from the cops, their vehicle recognized by Chunk because it has "bullet holes the size of matzo balls!" They collide in a humorous way, leading to the kids through a secret passage underground -- finding the "rich stuff", and Chunk unburdening his soul of his very worst behavior (his uncle's toupee as Moses' beard...the pushing of his sister down the stairs -- blamed it on the dog --, and the "worst": taking a bottle of fake puke to the movies and unleashing it from the balcony onto unsuspecting viewers below accompanied by retching sounds...) Follow along as they turn into pirates, friends and equals, then into kids again as they are-rescued finally on the beach. You can't beat this film for great one-liners ("I'm setting booty traps", "we could be downing the brew-skies, scoping out some babes, but NOOOO, someone had to go and fail their driver's license test", "Hit puree!", "Drug dealers wouldn't be caught dead in those polyester rags!"...) It's a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good adventure, especially those who root for the underdog and like to see the antagonists squirm and get it in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie you're never finished with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only a few movies that can, and I would say should, be viewed again and again forever. "Goonies" is one of them. It captures the bond among a group of pre-adolescent boys (although the actors playing them were certainly adolescents) which, with all its rough-housing and name-calling, is fundamentally unswerving and tolerant of differences. Chunk's behavior may make the viewer want to cast him out, but his friends never even consider it. In a way, the boys' fellowship is emphasized by contrast with the relationships among the teenagers portrayed which already are distorted by dominance issues and sexual attractions. My one requirement for a movie with young protagonists, over and above decent acting and production values, is that the characters be true human "persons," -- who make decisions for themselves, act on them, and, for good or ill, experience their consequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is fantastic. I've watched it since I was very small and I'm 19 now and it still stands the test of time. It might be old and contain cliches and a predictable plot but that's all the fun of it. It's not a movie you have to sit and analysis, it's a movie to sit and watch and be enjoyed because of it's simplicity. It's a feel good film and that's exactly what it makes you do.Sean Astin and Corey Feldman steal the show but the rest of the cast hold the film together as well. I can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie because it's just soooo good. The story is great for kids and grown-ups and the characters are identifiable with.There's something here for everybody, watch it, it's enjoyable- no matter how many times you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though to fully appreciate this film you need to have been a child or early teen in the 1980's, this movie still provides excellent entertainment value for today's youth. This movie is pretty much an ode to childhood exuberance, dealing with such fantastical issues such as pirate ships, hidden treasure, bad guys, booby traps (or booty traps whatever's your poison) and the art of having fun.The Goonies themselves are fairly likeable, though they do have a tendency to talk over each other; but I guess that's what kids do. Joey Pants and band of bad guys make for excellent villains, and give our heroes a good run for their money.All in all, get your purple rain t-shirt and head band start bopping away to cyndi lauper and her terrible theme song!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me a cynic. Not only do I not like this film, but I am amazed at how many people here seem to love it so deeply. I did not see this movie as a child, so I don't have the same exaggerated emotional attachment to it as some. Still, I found it silly, overdone and incredibly annoying. Every one of the forced-cutesy kids in the movie (thanks, Mr. Spielberg!) needs a good throttling. The fat kid is the constant butt of cliched, mean-spirited joking. I have no idea what the Asian kid is saying anywhere in the film. Corey Feldman is obnoxious and, oh.. just happens to be able to translate Spanish and treasure maps and anything else when need be. Uh huh.The plot is absurd: are we really supposed to believe the kids could so easily track down a 400-year-old treasure that everyone else has overlooked? Would a group of professional counterfeiters run off and leave evidence of their crime in plain sight, knowing that a group of kids is nosing around? I don't think so.This lame movie is par for the course for Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Bicentennial Man) and one of Spielberg's weaker efforts (right up there with Hook, which suffers from many of the same problems as this film). There are some great films for kids out there. This isn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is not to like about this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the 80's. I feel that it is a generation of films that'sa little more pure than what we have today. There is a little more innocence in films like Raiders and Ghostbusters and Rambo and Back to the Future. But I guess if you were born in the 40's you would feel the same way about films in the 50's. It's all a matter of perspective. But watching a film like the Goonies brings me back to a time when my summers were spent not worrying about highschool, because I wasn't even there yet. But we spent time going to the movies, "sad risking", riding our bikes and playing tag at the park. It was a different time and a different feel. And watching the Goonies brings me back to that time. A time when friendship was different. Because when you hit a certain age, you have friends, but not the same way that you did when you were twelve or thirteen. When we were that young, we all had friends like the Goonies or like the guys in Stand By Me. And in a way, this film reminds me of Stand By Me. They deal with different issues but they both have friendship at the core of the film. And that is one of the reasons that makes it so enjoyable. The Goonies is blessed with an all star production team. From the direction of a pre-Lethal Weapon and post Superman, we have Richard Donner. The producers are the Amblin team of Spielberg, Kennedy and Marshall and then you have the writing of Spielberg and Columbus ( Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire ). With a team like this, you know you are in for a good time. But what really makes this work in front of the camera is the great young actors of the 80's. My favourites are Corey Feldman as Mouth and of course Chunk. Who can forget when he gets caught by the Fratelli's and he has to tell them "everything". So he proceeds to gain their liking by telling them that he has pushed his sister down the stairs and blamed the dog and then making fake puke and dumping it over the balcony at the theater. It is a very funny sequence. Indiana Jones' Key Huy Quan is also priceless as Data, a James bond wannabe. The cast of young greats really makes the picture. The adventure the Goonies goes on is great for an audiene that enjoys an Indiana Jones adventure, and seeing that would be almost everyone, there are very few people that won't enjoy this film, although to be fair I think if you are under the age of 16 you will like it that much more.I have nothing bad to say about The Goonies. It is funny, action packed, and has a lot to say about friendship. And if you are my age, it brings you back to a time when life wasn't so convoluted and strange. It brings you back to a time when going on an adventure that the Goonies go on would have been fathomable for you and your friends. So how can you not like a movie like this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may sound really puerile, but this film has been one of my personal favorites for years. Sure, it's about a bunch of obnoxious kids with perfect one-liners, a family of Italian crooks, snobby country club owners, booby (that's what I said, BOOBY!) traps, a goliath who looks like he spent the summer in a meat grinder, and more, more zaniness. This all accumulates, of course, into a plot of finding a lost pirate ship, inexiplicably trapped within a cave by the sea. The clever kids must use these jewels to salvage their small beach town from manipulative rich people. (The special effects along the way are better than the computer ones recylcled astronomically today.) I've nearly memorized all the lines, and the opening scenes never cease to appease me: THE TRUFFLE SHUFFLE! This film is resourceful if you're looking for stuff by Sean Astin ("Rudy") or the director Richard Donner ("Lethal Weapon" series). The screenplay is also by Chris Columbus, if anybody remembers who he is. For a swashbuckling morality tale, I'd recommend this to anyone with an enduring inner-child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really watch movies as a youngster back in the 80's so I never saw this as a child, therefore, the whole cult of The Goonies is something that has simply passed me by. It seems to be one of those 80's movies that has a certain nostalgic power over those who saw it back in the day. I can only imagine that the reason for this is primarily down to the kids themselves, as the film is fairly generic and not overly original otherwise. But the boys do act in an unusual way for a movie aimed at children. They swear, make sexual innuendos and joke about hard drugs. So I suppose they act similar to how kids do in real life and I am supposing this is a major reason for the film's enduring appeal. It's not as saccharine as most family movies.It also has Corey Feldman in it, which I guess for some people gives a movie a certain 80's seal of approval. I noticed that the hobbit fella was part of the Goonie gang too. And the little Chinese bloke from Temple of Doom. Leaving the fat funny one who was probably the best thing about the film. It was also nice to see an old favourite of mine, Cyndi Lauper singing the catchy title tune. She really was great.I'm not going to detail the story as anyone reading this will surely know it already. But suffice to say, the film moves along at a cracking pace and does not outstay its welcome. The film has Spielberg Production written all over it and that is certainly not always a good thing. But it's actually really quite difficult to dislike this movie as it does possess a certain 80's charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies is a great film for kids. It's basically "Raiders of the Lost Ark" for children, every bit as hilarious and exciting. It's the story of a group of friends (and potential girlfriends) who go searching for pirates treasure in the hopes that they can save their homes from foreclosure in the process. They come into contact with a family of thieves and a disfigured but utterly lovable "Sloth", along with a host of boobie traps that are so wonderfully simple, the spectacular events on screen seem really possible in real life.Another great thing about the Goonies is that it has a character for every personality type. THere's the cheerleader, the fat kid, the arrogant but witty best friend,the genius, and the idealistic dreamer. In short, there's a character in this movie for every kid to relate to.Unfortunately, I have heard that if you didn't see this movie as a child, it has substantially less value as an adult. Therefore, buy it for your kids (they'll treasure it forever), and rent it for yourself (just so you know what all the fuss is about)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely my favourite family movie! Although sadly this was not the greatest box-office success it should have been, it's still a must-see classic. You can't help but identify with this misfit group of kids. This light-hearted swashbuckler/treasure hunt/detective story will bring a sense of nostalgia to anyone. Mikey (Sean Astin) was my favourite; Although unaware of it, he led the goonies on their adventures. And I loved the set locations in Astoria and Cannon Beach Oregon. The Cyndi Lauper song "Goonies R Good Enough" wasn't so bad either! Many kudos to Spielberg &amp; Donner.Although I definitely prefer the widescreen version because of clarity and because it shows more, there are a couple of scenes where matting was used to preserve this aspect (for instance: where the chicken lays the egg in the gate opening scene--the egg is shown dropping into the pan in the full-screen version and cropped out in the widescreen version).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the only time ever, you'll have here three of the most obnoxious pop filmmakers alive: Donner Spielberg and Columbus. I cannot recommend this to you as something to actually watch, but it is a terrific example in emotional manipulation.Start with the notion that you want to be as effective and manipulative as possible, which means you want to be cinematic. Then go to the notion of the most cinematic of notions, noir. It has emerged from film, is unique to film, and it works.The characteristics of noir are simple. It is a world apart from the world of the viewer, but it has representatives of the viewer in it. The world is characterized by a capricious fate that toys with humans. Randomness and traps. Odd coincidences that simply seemed arranged for the benefit of the viewer. In mature versions there is a hint that the presence of the viewer is the reason that fate is arranged so cruelly.Now imagine these three kings of pop brainstorming on a successful kiddie noir. It would have incompetent parents, and tons and tons of boobytraps. This would have to be faced by the kids with only each other to rely on. Each kid would see himself in some one of the carefully chosen characters.And there will be folds. The young kids will be folded into the older dysfunctional family. And the movie we watch will be folded into a pirate movie. In fact a specific Errol Flynn pirate movie.Hey, it works, in the sense that it sells tickets. If you want a lesson in pop manipulation, play with this.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The eighties were above all the greatest decade for imagination. They were the days of more adventure, science fiction and action movies than one could count ants in an ant colony. They were the days when legendary Directors like Spielberg, Lucas, Cameron and Scott dictated movie making and redefined the whole meaning of movie-going. A time when CGI was scarce and unnecessary for make believe, yet where realism was at its peak and brainless audiences didn't require something blowing up every 5 seconds before they lost interest. In other words, it was the decade of wonder and patience. These directors pulled us into their vivid worlds - the worlds we only dreamed about - and we believed and loved every minute of them. Today films are so fast food, I just don't care anymore!It is this why I must write about 'The Goonies' (produced by Spielberg). Is there one guy in the world, born in the 80's, who wasn't affected by the release of this joy of a film? For whoever liked the Indiana Jones trilogy, this was an extension of that vision. It is a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. A pirate treasure story including caverns, mind boggling originality in booby traps, adventurous, inventive and resourceful kids just like Indiana willing to risk their lives for the desirable exotic adventure experience and the biggest and coolest water slide on the face of the Earth. Adventure was every kid's obsession and here is a film realizing that obsession - kids could relate better here than in Indiana Jones due to the leads being your kids next-door kind of 'kids'. This is why many from the eighties consider it their favorite film. This is not to say that this film hasn't got its fair share of obvious flaws, however the story, the acting and directing (as assisted by Spielberg himself) outweighs completely everything else.The story takes place in the coastal US town of 'Astoria', surrounding four friends around the age of 12'ish who call themselves "The Goonies" - Goonies being another name for an Albatross of some sort. Composing the gang are 'Mikey', played by Sean Astin (Toy Soldiers), 'Mouth', played by Corey Feldman (Stand By Me), 'Data', played by Jonathan Ke Quan (Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom) and 'Chunk', played by Jeff Cohen. Unfortunately for these kids, their friendship and their lives as they know them may be torn apart due to their houses being bought and broken down by a rich, greedy bureaucrat who wishes to build a useless Golf Course on that very same piece of land they live on. To the gang's coincidental surprise, however, whilst sorting through Mikey's dad's attic antiquity they come across a priceless and legendary Pirate Treasure Map. The gang figures if the legend is true and the Treasure is found, they can pay back for the houses their parents couldn't afford to keep. With little interest from the rest of the gang including his own brother, Mikey finally convinces them about the treasure hunt, reminding them of the importance of finding it and regaining their properties. With Mikey's resourceful and smart head, Data's ridiculous yet ingenious inventions, Mouth's unstoppable mouth, and Chunk's ever growling stomach, 'The Goonies' set out on an adventure, who along with Mikey's brother, pick up a few other friends along the way to join them. Unfortunately the clues that lead to the caverns of the lost treasure intersect with wanted thieving criminals known as the 'Fratellis'. However, this is not the only obstacle the Goonies have to conquer - for Spielberg and Richard Donner showcase their highly inventive and famous booby traps that still excite. What follows is the unforgettable pirate adventure story of 'One Eyed Willy'.The acting in this film is flawless. The kids, especially Corey Feldman who has always been a teen actor favorite of mine, had so much enthusiasm in their roles, that you are convinced they are for real. The Fratelli's were funny, but none funnier than 'Data', my personal favorite 'Goonie'. Set Designs were a marvel. Who needs graphics when you're working with Spielberg? The caverns looked so real, like it was an actual place - dusty and dirty and all....Most impressive however was the cinematography and the music, both which establish the atmosphere of the film so vividly and brilliantly. Every time I watch this film, I think of Cindy Lauper's great song. The orchestral music is also wonderful adding an authentic feel of adventure to the surrounding sets. Cinematography was masterfully realized and I loved the beautiful scenery of the coast and the caverns.This great film, although filled with many flaws, is one of my childhood favorites and even in this day and age with the world gone Topsy turvy, I still love this movie to bits - as well as I loved it the first time I saw it. It was directed by Richard Donner, but feels like a Steven Spielberg movie. It has his signature all over the place. I can only summarize this film in one word. It's a 'classic'. A must see for those who are young at heart and who have always had that longing for adventure.</fullReview>

Most critics here giving 7/10 upwards are just nostalgic freaks voting with childhood emotions. I fast forwarded after 30 minutes and kept doing until the end. It's inconceivable that people actually liked this movie. I read most comments giving 10/10 they are just saying the same thing "oh my childhood, oh my childhood, oh it's a classic". God!

		<fullReview>Mikey Walsh and his friends face separation as they all prepare to move away as developers buy up their properties. The only hope is that they can raise enough money to keep the house. When they stumble across a map relating to the long lost treasure of pirate `One-Eyed' Willy they go after the treasure but it leads them to tunnels under the hideout of the Fratelli family who are on the run from the law - the Goonies must get the treasure before the Fratelli's can find it.I haven't seen this film for many years and, when someone told me it was their favourite film I couldn't really voice an opinion (or at least, not an informed one). Having now seen it myself I must admit to be a little at a loss to understand the sheer amount of cult love it gets; I can only put it down to us all loving something from our childhood in a guilty sort of way! The film is enjoyable but no more than that, and I wasn't sure who it was aimed at: it seemed to be too scary for young children but far too childish and silly for older kids. The plot is a sort of Indiana Jones for children and it works reasonably well despite an excess of flaws in several key areas.The plot is silly and feels very disjointed, I was never totally sold on the treasure hunt nor the threat of the Fratelli's. It varies wildly between sickly sentiment (`I'm gonna take care of you', `you're my best invention' etc) and overblown action that doesn't really excite because it is so unrelated to reality. The effects can be forgiven due to the age of the film, but really it should have been more dramatic considering. The comedy also swings wildly from silly slapstick to some very funny lines; the whole thing is very rough around the edges and it is quite refreshing to see this in comparison to so many more `clean' and shrink wrapped kids movies - at least this has a touch of anarchy about it! That said, I didn't laugh that much although I did enjoy the rough edges.It is funny to see the cast now, although few of them have really gone on to become adults who did great things. Astin is a little too drab for the film, his role has to carry the story whereas the others get to have more fun. Feldman, Cohen and Ke Quan all get to enjoy themselves and are good value despite occasionally being more silly than funny. The adult cast are much better and it is a shame that they aren't used that well - Davi, Pantoliano and Ramsey are all good and I would have preferred to have had more laughs from them. Like the film itself, it's all very rough round the edges in terms of performances, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.Overall I have not been won over to the extent that the army of Goonie fans are. I enjoyed it even if I couldn't really get into either the comedy of the silly action. It has it's moments and is probably best used to start and wean children off more childish stuff without making the jump right into adult films.</fullReview>

You can read over the parental guidance link on IMDb to get the details. We watched the first 15 minutes of it on DVD and I decided to just turn it off. I don't remember all the profanity!

		<fullReview>a bunch of annoying child actors who aren't killed dead by the movie's conclusion. every now and again i'll enjoy a kiddie flick, but only those realistic &amp; gritty ones which deal with serious issues like abuse and abandonment ('matilda' is maybe a bad example which is in turn redeemed by its prevailing themes).as far as i can tell these kids are well and alive at the end and what's worse get to fulfill their narcissistic childish fantasies. they also scream a lot. in unison. loudly.how was this ever popular, i couldn't even make it five minutes thru this shite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid kids adventure, but not a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Goonies" celebrates its 30th anniversary this year and I must say it hasn't aged as badly as some other films from the 1980s, yet it's not an outstanding movie by any means. Lets take a look at cast &amp; crew first of all: Spielberg of course became an Academy Award winning superstar, but also many others reached great things in their careers long after this film. Feldman became one of the defining kids actors of his generation. Brolin is an Oscar nominee. So is Sean Astin apart from starring in the epic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Ramsey became an Oscar nominee the same year that this one came out. Columbus is an Oscar nominee too. Plimpton and Pantoliano are Emmy winners. Ontiveros is an Emmy nominee. Davy became a really good Bond villain. So there is certainly lots of talent united in this film.Unfortunately, these almost 2 hours (fairly long for a kids movie) did not turn out a 100% successful movie. There are some nice scenes in terms of adventure, comedy etc. for example the one when Chunk tells that he knows who the 3 villains are and can describe them to the police unknowingly that he is talking to them, but there are some bad moments too, like in the end when the father tear the contract into pieces. A classic example of overacting and there are more of these when the script simply tries to be too ambitious for its own good. Another example would be the meaningful speech by Astin's character down in the cave. So yeah, not a bad watch by any means, but not a truly epic children's movie either as many people consider it. Something in-between. All in all, I recommend it, but one watch is enough. Actually I am a bit surprised they never made a sequel for this one just like they did for many other very famous 80 films, for example "Back into the Future". Oh well, probably for the better I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent, must watch, extended version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is an must-watch film. It has become an iconic film. It is a masterpiece in the sense that most of the adventure movies for kids follow it in one or another way. It has elements that make it unique. For instance, the weird Slot. There is no real reason for him, but still, there it is, and it makes the movie a classic. There is a few things that can be better, like kids not knowing where to go or what to do instead of them solving all the problems immediately. One thing we all want is an extended version, Is it real the octopus scene? The scenes at the town buying maps where good, and also introduces the bully and the relations with the girls. This movie deserved a second part, but unfortunately actors are now too old and a new remake cannot be better than original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another All Time Favorite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is another of my favorite movies of all time. Who hasn't watched this many times over the years? When I was growing up many friends wanted to go on adventures like the kids in this movie.Mikey, Mouth, Chunk, Data and Brand are the Goonies. They find a treasure map and all except Brand think it will lead to something. Something that will save their homes. They have to over come obstacles and booby traps as well as being chased by three dangerous criminals, the Fratellis. They enlist the help of Andy and Stef along the way. Another enlistee is an unlikely ally in Sloth, who is a Fratelli, but is mistreated because he is physically and mentally impaired.The Goonies first encounter the Fratellis at an old restaurant along the coast. The restaurant is the starting point for the treasure map. They decide to wait until the Fratellis leave to explore the restaurant. The Fratellis come back unexpectedly while the Goonies are in the basement. Their only way out is to go through a secret passage in the fireplace. Chunk is left behind because he got trapped in a freezer when they found a dead body. Chunk escapes the basement through a window but is later picked up at the side of the road by... the Fratellis.Meanwhile Mikey, Mouth, Data, Brand, Andy and Stef continue on with the treasure hunt. They come across several booby traps and the remains of a former treasure hunter. They find a key around the neck of Chester Copperpot, the dead treasure hunter, and then set off a booby trap that drops large boulders from high above that are meant to crush intruders.Next the Goonies find a well and they think for a split second that they have found the treasure. Unfortunately all they found was a wishing well. A suitor of Andy's, Troy, happens to toss a coin in the wishing well. The Goonies throw the coin back up and he offers to help them out of the well. Mikey talks the others into continue on the treasure hunt.Back at the restaurant the Fratellis question Chunk. After finding out that the tunnel in the fireplace really exists the Fratellis leave chunk tied up in the same room where Sloth is kept. Chunk and Sloth become friends. Sloth breaks free and helps Chunk to get free. Sloth hears his echo coming from the tunnel in the fire place and follows it, leaving Chunk no choice but to follow.While in the well the Goonies find another booby trap that nearly kills Data, but he saves himself by using his "pinchers of Hell". They climb down into another tunnel. Having decided to get a pitstop out of the way Andy decides that it is time to make a move on Brand. Brand sends Mikey to see what Andy wants and ends up getting kissed by Andy. Andy thinks it was Brand that she was kissing.The next obstacle is a log bridge over a raging river. Data is the last to cross and he sprays oil along the log to slow the Fratellis down. It works.The next booby trap the Goonies find is a piano made of bones with a skeleton as the a head piece. Andy has to play the notes on the back of the treasure map in order to help the rest of the Goonies to continue on their quest. If Andy fails to play the correct notes the floor will drop away and they will fall to their deaths. Each correct note opens a door little by little so they can keep going. Andy is able to play the correct notes just in time as the Fratellis are right on their heels.The Goonies escape and come to a water slide type obstacle. The treasure map turns out to be real. The Goonies find the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The Goonies start loading the treasure into their pockets. Mikey empties his marble bag and puts several jewels inside. But before they can gather any treasure and get away from the Fratellis, the Fratellis show up and capture them. Chunk and Sloth catch up to everyone and help the Goonies to escape.As the Goonies and the Fratellis escape the cave that One Eyed Willie's ship is in the cave walls begin to fall in, eventually allowing the ship to set sail again. The police find the Goonies and the Fratellis walking up the beach. The Goonies' parents are called and they all have a joyful reunion. Eventually the jewels are found in Mikey's marble bag and they help to save the homes of the Goonies' families.I was six years old when this movie came out. I loved watching this movie every chance I could. Now that I have it on DVD I can watch it every day if I want to. For a kids movie it's pretty good, even nearly thirty years old. The acting is pretty good for a bunch of child actors, not forced. The action is pretty good; the story was pretty good. A lot of comedy; a lot of laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking for a safe movie to just succumb to? Try this safe harbor in the pacific northwest. Great "Goonie" Relaxation.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember seeing this several times in the theater with my friend Geoff Chisholm. Years later I would have the chance to see the house where the the "Walsh family home" was located (on a tour of Astoria, Oregon).Astoria, a safe harbor town in the peaceful pacific northwest is a rarity in this day and age. The film seemed to bring the town to life. Not featured in the film is a quaint street car line. It is quite a lovely place to spend a weekend and certainly the continued success of the film has contributed to its survival.One of the most interesting spots to visit in Astoria is the classic JC Penney store. The store on the outside resembles something from the 1930's. Inside you'll find much of the same contemporary merchandise you'd find at any JC Penney store in any mall. But Astoria, seems to have a magical ability to preserve its history and stay current at the same time.Same is true for this film. It doesn't SEEM like a 27 year old movie.But it is.Actually it isn't. The movie is the same. We are just all 27 years older.Watching it today through the prism of a man with 27 years of life experience doesn't make it any less exciting.The car chase on the beach.The creative gadgetry of "Data" sliding down the home made zip line. "Data" had a zip line BEFORE any one knew what a zip line was.Chunk knocking over the statue and "breaking Brandon's mother's favorite part".A very private part by the way.Jeff Burleson and Geoff Chisholm (we took the whole staff to a screening in Sisters, OR on Maple Lane at Loker Avenue) heartily recommend this film for anyone who loves teenage adventure, wholesome goodness and the hard work of Steven Spielberg BEFORE he became STEVEN Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Adventure That You're Sure to Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Goonies' is a classic adventure film that our youth film critics absolutely loved. Here's Raven's video review http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvpL7if8gGw and below is her written one. I remember watching it all the time when I was younger and I enjoy it as much now as I did back then.The cinematography is good because it shows the age of the film. I also think the visual aspects of the chain reactions leading up to the contraptions are cool. When I was little I traveled in the area where 'The Goonies' was filmed, which was pretty interesting to see.My favorite character is Data because he is very funny and all of his inventions are super helpful in the search to find one-eyed-Willy and his treasure. I think this movie is for ages 10 and up because there is some inappropriate language. However, I don't remember noticing any of that when I was younger and I recently watched with my little brother who is 7, and he didn't seem to notice either. I guess it really just depends on the maturity of each child.Overall, I give 'The Goonies' 4 out of 5 stars because it is very entertaining and it has a good story line.'The Goonie' is playing in August on HDnet movies on Kidscene.

		<fullReview>I guess if Evil Dead gets 37 different DVD releases and practically every film released in the last decade has three or four versions on sale, it's only fair that The Goonies gets a special 25th anniversary edition DVD release. After all this teen Indiana Jones featuring the pre-pubescent Breakfast Club holds a similar place for as many 30 somethings as Stand By Me does, and like Stand By Me this film holds up remarkably well.If you were going to make a movie that appeals to teenage boys what do you think you might put in it?- Bikes, inventions, skeletons, nutshots, potty humour.- Adventure, near misses and close escapes? Booby traps, codes and challenges.- Criminals? Monsters??- TREASURE MAPS &amp; PIRATES???How about all of the above? The Goonies are four pre-teen buddies with clever nicknames that also serve to explain more about them than 15 minutes of exposition would:Mouth ? The loud talkative one.Data ? The nerdy inventor one.Chunk ? The fat obnoxious and clumsy one.Mike ? The ummm? one named Mike? He is asthmatic if that helps.The first prison escape and ensuing car chase neatly intros every principal character that will appear in the film within an entertaining 5 minutes. Clever stuff really.After a couple more rambunctious pre-teen conversations ? and a plot device that finds them with the desperate need to find big cash quick or their house will be foreclosed to make way for a golf course ? the boys unexpectedly come across what appears to be a pirate's treasure map from 1632, made by the renowned local pirate One Eyed Willie (aren't they all?).So the four Goonies, along with Mike's older brother Brandon (Josh Brolin? Yep No Country for Old Men himself) and his cheerleader target of (PG13) conquest Andie and her buddy Steph unwittingly along for the ride; off everyone goes for an adventure.To ramp up the action a notch further the local crime family the Fratellis are injected into proceedings so that they might pose a threat by staying one step behind the kids at all times. Don't worry kids, the Fratellis are an old Mum and her two boneheaded sons, no-one gets hurt and there is never any serious peril or danger.With all the major players identified and in play the hunt leads all and sundry into a vast underground series of caves and tunnels, with booby traps and dangerous terrain all around, the traps were lain by the late Mr Willie who it was alleged would rather die wealthy than spread his booty around? unlike Jessica Simpson ? who will only die wealthy?Each Goonie gets their respective chance to shine as they come across each new obstacle or elaborate puzzle, the girls are their to provide love and lust interests and to shriek when the situation demands ? and if all that isn't enough a fourth "forgotten" Fratelli, the hideously disfigured ogre-ish Sloth pops his magnificently unique lump head into the fray? Again don't worry he's not a bad hideously disfigured, massively muscled ogre, he's a good guy (great 80s makeup job though!).Everyone learns something from the experience, there is some immensely entertaining action sequences and the whole thing is as light and realistic as a Miss Universe contestant, thankfully it makes more sense though.What sets Goonies apart is the little touches, despite the large number of characters in the group everyone is distinctly different, but aside from just the broad strokes mentioned above there are little touches that lend further human qualities to the boys that go beyond mere caricature ? the asthma inhaler, the inventions, the clumsiness and strange stories ? they all help.The plot is necessarily preposterous at all times, everything is skewed towards fun and escapism, and as mentioned previously this has been purpose built to entertain, amuse and inspire young boys ? just like Britney Spears. That's three pop-culture potshots at obvious targets in one review ? my parents must be so proud!Final Rating ? 7.5 / 10. As with many things The Goonies all appears effortless and straightforward, but as we should know it takes a lot of effort and planning to make things look this easy, even then this has the added bonus of being consistently fun and engaging. There's a reason this has an audience 25 years on when Due Date will be forgotten in 25 days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult Classic from the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When The Goonies was first made the prospect must have been sky high, with a story by Steven Spielberg and him being the Executive Producer, having established director Richard Donner directing, famous for directing the first Superman movie, and had at the time, the young and upcoming Chris Columbus wrote the screenplay.The Goonies tells an simple adventure story where a group of friends are being forced out their neighbourhood because of land-developers wanting to turn their homes in a golf course. Micky (Sean Astin) the leader of the group finds a treasure map and an ancient doubloon leading to a legendary pirate ship underground. They have one day to find it before their homes are foreclosed. Whilst on the hunt for the treasure the Goonies run into the Fratellis, a family of Italian-American criminals. One of them has just escaped from the local jail, Jake (Robert Davi), and the family an abandoned restaurant to counterfeit money. They are not afraid to murder number and go on the chase of the Goonies who could risk their plans.To people who grew up in the 80s and 90s love this film. A number of my friends really like it, and I remember seeing it when I was in Primary School. It is a simply a fun film with action and adventure, with a message of friendship. All the friends have their own character traits, like Mikey as the leader and the most committed to the quest, Mouth (Corey Feldman) as an little trouble maker, Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) the inventor and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) an child who wants to avoid trouble. There is also a good sub-plot involving Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and Andy (Keri Green) who slowly form a relationship during the film. Richard Donner is a good set-pieces director, and he is old-fashioned (and that's a good thing). They is excellent set-designs with good old style action. He used traditional techniques and not things like the birth of CGI and blue screen. He focused on this story and characters. They is a decent screen, and the first did feel a little like Chris Columbus directional efforts towards the Home Alone films. I also the score of the film.The film is not perfect and I did not like the use of proficiency by young kids in this type of film.Still an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Goonies" (1985) Have Their Roots in "The Little Rascals" (1937)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the eve of the 30th anniversary of this excellent entry in Spielberg's cinematic opus, it is wholly appropriate to explore the film's roots in the depression era antics of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" comedies. Those of us who, like Spielberg, grew up in the 50's with TV's version of "Our Gang" in the form of daily episodes of "The Little Rascals", quickly recognize in "The Goonies" Spanky McFarland's adventure as portrayed in the Little Rascal's "Night n' Gales" (1937). In that adventure, Spanky, Alfalfa and the gang are caught in a storm and must spend the night at Darla's house. There is much ado about the gang sharing a bed with Darla's father, skillfully played by Johnny Arthur, and after some comic bits, the boys fall asleep and dream about, what else but, pirates' treasure. The dream scene that follows with the Rascals finding a pirate ship and chests of gold and jewels and a giant pirate who protects it all lends itself beautifully to Spielberg's skillful rendering of the Goonies in discovering the treasure of John' Matuszak's Sloth. The squeals and screams of fear and the visual muggings of the Goonies as Sloth chases them are not just reminiscent, but rather they are identical to Hal Roach's scenes in which the Rascals are chased by the angry giant. Of course, this is where the similarities begin and end, as "The Goonies" grow beyond the fantasy dream world mischievousness of the Rascals and develop into a full-scale celluloid study of a group of prepubescent misfits growing up in an adult world that is seriously tainted with an inability to dream, to wonder, and to create the child's world of unlimited adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you have a family film produced by Steven Spielberg, the genius behind the only wonderful family film E.T., you're in for something really good. And the Goonies doesn't lie about that. There is humor for the kids and adults, also it has something that most family films don't, the characters actually are successful and they aren't all happy sappy.While parents might be shocked by the kids behavior (a 14 year old kissed a ten year old by accident OH NO! (sarcasm intended)) the kids wont imitate that impossible stuff. And sure the villains malformed son might scare kids. There's something in the Goonies that most family films are devoid of, imagination.</fullReview>

One-eyed Willie seems like a classic "caribbean" pirate, and it seems unlikely that with no panama canal back then, a Spanish armada would chase a fleet of pirates down around the horn of south America and up into the frigid waters of the pacific northwest. if anybody has any info about actual pirates in this area of the world at that time, it'll help me sleep at night... otherwise, good one Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for any childhood reminisce, full of pirate adventure and friendships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember fully when this movie came out. This was when Widescreen was a brand new cinematic invention, and we thought it was way cool to see this movie being shown of such surround screen magnitude in a theater that for our time (the 80's) was known as "upgrading". The sound quality had much improved, thanks in part to LucasFilm studios, and the cinema scope (modernized for 21st Century) difference was incredibly awesome. We sat in the theaters, completely mesmerized by all the special effects, sound, and camera takes that previous teen films really didn't offer too much of. And the incredible 'water slide' scene towards the ending, alongside that magnificent pirate ship, sent shivers down everyone's spine, with incredible tingling sensations. We were all still commenting about the incredible experience, many years later.This film touches me in so many emotional ways, embellishing from back in my childhood:: Here we have a group of misfit kids, who call themselves the "Goonies", being they live in a historical old section of a seaside village the wealthy yucks want to selfishly demolish in order to build a fancy golf course, with no recognition or acknowledgment of the residents' place, considering the area the "slums" or "goon-docks" (moderning,'back woods hillbilly-types') as they are thought of the "lesser" people's. Saddened and deeply troubled by the assumed outcome, brother's Brand and Mikey bond together, and try desperately to think of some way they can possibly help their working-class parents, along with the rest of the working-class neighborhood parents, keep the village free from the greedy hands of the developers. If only money was not the sleazy issue. As the story continues, along comes Mikey's small group of closest pals, nicknamed Mouth, Data, and Chunk, who fully understand their pals' plight. And humorously, bend to the affections of Brand (who inadvertently cannot take the boys anywhere, being he 'flunked' his driver's test), with methodical teasing the inability to cruise the town, etc. (mainly Mouth's comments). In order to ease the tension, sadness and pain, the boys farewell takes them into Mikey's attic, where a sudden turn of events brings them upon an old pirate treasure map. Of course at first the kids are skeptical, considering it just a piece of dad's untouched, stored antique collection, until one of the boys remembers rumors of an old legend of the village, of pirate adventure. Mikey is at first the only one who takes the legend seriously, and pockets an old Chalst found inside the map. Soon after, he convinces his pals to go searching for this buried treasure, because "what if"??? If there is indeed a secret buried treasure out there, then they already have the map to go find it, ease the boredom, do something exciting and adventurous for a change, and not continue moping around the house, feeling sorry. Alas, Mikey and friends go treasure hunting, only to run into the infamous Fratelli clan, notorious bank robbers on the loose, but then manage to escape, and continue embarking on their treasure-hunting journey towards the riches each of them only ever dreamed of. The Fratelli's get hot on their tale, once they find out about the map too...Then meet Sloth, the kindly 'Giant' who gets befriended by Chunk (whom the Fratelli's take hostage), then escapes, and goes searching after the friends. Throughout all the special effects, the Indiana Jones-like adventure, and musical score, next up we get first-hand at the camera-revealing pirate mystery, as the incredible buried "lost" ship is finally revealed in all its resplendent glory. The Frateli's eventually catch up with the "Goonies", threatening to defeat their riches pursuit, but are then taken down by Sloth and Chunk. The Goonies escape from the hidden cave, but not without sobby farewells....as the cave starts to unravel...Here come the Press and the worried folks, at the end, the kids getting their moments of news fame as the Fratelli's are finally apprehended. Then the climactic moment, while the Press is interviewing everybody....a secret legend is finally revealed a historical fact. "Holy Mary, mother of God..." the officer rasps. The pirate ship is seen, finally escaping its 300 year imprisonment, as the kids and Sloth watch it sail away...in the sunset. Mikey makes his final remarks, and blows the ship a kiss (ahhhh, thanks One-Eyed Willy).PEANUT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, The Goonies.The ultimate childhood adventure fantasy come to life. Every kid dreams of being Indiana Jones, but some of those battle wounds look pretty painful. And would I really have to kill so many people? The danger still has to be real, though. And I'd want my friends to be there. But where would I ever be able to find an ancient treasure trove that offers all these nuances without leaving my home town? Hmmm....My 9th favourite movie of all time. Sean Astin gives another flawless performance...and at age 12 to boot! Everyone else in this movie rocks, too. Every scene works perfectly and is filled with humour, thrills, and a lovely yet very true-to-life sense of friendship. This movie gets better each time I watch it, largely due to the fact that in becoming more and more familiar with the gang, they become good friends of yours. Which means you get to be one of the Goonies too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being only 14, I found that most people my age, have never even heard of this film, forget seen it, I however adore it, and it has been my favourite film for three years. I only saw this because my mother had recorded it off channel five and not being a film fan, had promptly not watched it, leaving it to me to tell her about it. I watched it and instantly fell in love with it. Even though at times it's corny and unrealistic, the enthusiasm in the little people and the amazing story makes up for it completely. One friend I showed it to, disliked it, however I am under the impression she is a crazed lunatic, who has had the disadvantage of pretending to be mature and therefore missed out on the wonder that is 'The Goonies'! You can quickly connect with the characters and their need for excitement and adventure. One can laugh at their jokes, and generally all the crazy things they say; scream at the bad people and the giant squid and join in their amazing adventure. This film shows you seven children's last desperate attempt to remain in the home they love, with the friends they have been forced to make after the rest of the world rejected them. Like 'stand by me' it is a story of growth and heroism and how friendship is precious enough to die for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is awesome. It has great characters and a good plot. It is a great movie to watch, and Mouth is probably my favourite. Chunk and Data are both funny too. Some parts in this movie are priceless, and make it an enjoyable film to watch. The main four kids (Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk) all contributed something to the film, but the only thing about this movie that doesn't make sense is what are the other three there for? I guess Brand and Andy add an extra element, but I honestly don't see the purpose of Stef's character. Oh well, all in all, this movie was great and I would definitely recommend it, for young and old people alike, this movie is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies ever. I have read some comments that said that this movie was to childish and that it could never really happen. But this movie is not supposed to be about truth it is just supposed to be about fun for kids. It was clever and fun. If you are to old not to get the magic of the movie then you should not be watching it in the first place. Sure people of all ages watch it. I thought the movie was very well written. It portrays all the thoughts of little kids. What kid doesn't want to find treasure on a ship. I love all the characters even though Chunk is still my favorite. He is just so innocent and funny. I recommend this to anybody who loves a good fictional adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent! It is one of the best I've ever seen. I'm going to buy the d.v.d. very soon because it's a favorite among my siblings and I. It has everything in it, great acting, production, directing, photography, script, costumes set decoration, art direction, etc. I give this film 10/10 stars. Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!Spoilers Coming Up!My siblings and I have many favorite parts in this movie. These include: when Chunk spots the police chasing the Fratelli's and runs over to window and spills shake on himself. Also, the part when Chunk does the dance at the Walsh's house so they will let him in, when Jake Fratelli is too stupid to know what up means, and when they find the hidden treasures.I like how Chunk takes in Sloth at the end. He was being loving to someone who needed to be shown love. I like that. Great family film. Go Goonies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Goonies .... just a nice movie with a few chuckles along the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie brought back memories of pretending to be this and that as we played in the yard and at the neighbours around our home. We would imagine, pretend and if I was a treasure hunter in some respects I think this movie shows how I would go about doing it ... mistake after mistake I would make but somehow I'd keep my sights on a goal and wouldn't stop til I reached it. Chunk had some funny lines including the one where he was asked to tell everything and he then proceeds to tell the bad guys his whole life story and then tells them the worst thing he did which was to pretend to barf and then he threw fake barf over the railing and it landed on people and it made everyone around that start barfing .... pretty funny life this kid had.It was also interesting to see product placement in the movie as that was not a regular thing back then and only in the last 3 or more years has it become common.I like the Chinese guy's gadgets and how they always seem to be flawed but at different points through the movie he somehow saves them from hurt or death but at the same time causes a few nerve-wrecking moments.Anyway it was a fun movie .... better than what has come out of theaters this Summer of 2005 although Star Wars was pretty good ....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies, in my opinion is one of the best movies ever made. The 80's proved to be the best year for movies that bridged the gap between adult humor and children's humor. The actors in this movie were so convincing that I dreamed of being a Goonie. This was the "feel good movie" of the century. We could only be so lucky to have films like this made these days. Prates, adventure, treasure, friendship, comedy, teenage crushes, and action with out the gore and sex scenes. What else could you ask for? The Goonies is a movie that can be kept, and passed down through the generations. I continue to enjoy this movie as much as an adult, as I did as a child. The Goonies movie has been passed down to my own children,and I look forward to the day I will be able to introduce The Goonies to my grand children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies of all time, as I grew up watching this I have seen it loads of times, and can say it is a genuine masterpiece. All of the characters fit the part perfectly. The plot is so interesting, and action packed that you just want to watch it again and again. The funniest character has to be Chunk (truffle shuffle), the best looking Andy (obviously), and the most annoying Troy (grrr). There were talks of there being a sequel, but I think it would most probably ruin what has been built up in the first one, and without the original cast would be pointless. Lets hope they don't make it. My advice, WATCH THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

I could quite easily sit down in front of this film now, after seeing it like a billion times and still enjoy it. Quality acting, and I must say, these young actors were so well scouted by Spielberg. In fact, looking back I am surprised that Corey Haim wasn't in this, but not to worry.The Tarelli's were played so well, and you just wanted the Goonies to get the better of them. And Data with his wacky gadgets you just had to love (Slip Shoes!) Its one of those real feel good films that you cant help but like.Well done to all involved in this film.

		<fullReview>It has been years since I saw "The Goonies", when I was 10 years old back in 1985, it was one of my favorite movies. I recently found the movie on DVD, and it still has all the charm and fun that I remember.The Goonies are a group of friends who's families are being evicted from their homes by a rich family to make way for a new country club. On a typical Saturday afternoon, the boys find a treasure map in their father's attic, and decide to try to track down the treasure to save their homes.With a great fun story, classic comedy lines, "The Goonies" is definitely a film that the whole family can watch. It is interesting to see Sean Astin as a young boy. How different he looked! Josh Brolin was also great.This is your typical 80's film, but is timeless and still stands up today. Check it out with your kids. It is worth the effort to find on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit,i was 10 years old when this film arrived to rent on englands shores. I was captivated by the posters,trailers and talk of this film. Of all the childhood movies that capture youth,fun,excitement and the fairytale adventure element.This film seems to do it all by the truck load. I also love the fact it captured the 80's so well with the fashion,hairstyles and music,so even now it feels not so dated,but charming for its decade. Rather interestingly,the actors involved have nearly all come into a rather colourful on/off,or non existent career path since this film. Was it a curse??? OK,so the adult actors seemed to have made it unscathed,but practically all the child stars have become wayward shadows of the movie trade. So sad seeing as this film is most definitely a firm fave of people in my generation.It never fails to deliver that excitement even now and despite its age,first time viewers much the same age as me,are instantly drawn into the world of adventure seeking boys.We all played these games as youngsters.You might have been a pirate or a young romantic.Cops and robbers or cowboys and indians.Its this imagination thats stunningly played out in a fantastic movie. Theirs actually little to fault with this film.If your honest,it would be shortsighted and cruel to judge such a film on critique applied to weightier titles.It is after all,a childs film forst and foremost,and with that said...it lives on inside me for all the smiles it brought me as a 10 year old boy all too full of his own flighty dreams and ambitions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goonies are Good Enough! (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is yet another 80s teen/youth targeted movie that will transcend its time for years to come. In fact, I had just gone to a free screening of The Goonies in the park and the audience was primarily people in their early and mid 20s. So it looks like the people who loved this movie as a kid will cherish even as they get older. I'm one of them. As one of the greatest adventure film, The Goonies were a group of kids out of the Oregon boonies (aka The Goondocks). The Walshes who's son, Mikey (Sean Astin), is the unofficial Goonies leader, knows that his folks need plenty of cash fast to cover the back taxes and save the Goondocks from the like of that sniveling Troy Perkins's father.Hanging around the house one afternoon and driven by the curiosity of what Mikey's father might do with all that cool junk in the attic, the boys come upon a great discovery: a map of One-Eyed Willy's (yes, there are obvious synonyms to be made from the name) "rich stuff." So The Goonies are on one last adventure!Only, the map leads them to a bunch of fugitive gangsters called The Fratelli's (a terrific cast of villains featuring Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli; Joe Pantoliano as Francis; Robert Davi as Jake; and the late John Matuszak as the large, deformed and loveable Sloth Fratelli). When one of the Goonies get's captured by the Fratelli's, it doesn't take them long to figure out that these kids are sniffing a trail of treasure, and the Fratelli's want to get to it first, no matter what.Aside from a great story and a great soundtrack (featuring 80s queen, Cindi Lauper in the soundtrack and music video for the song, 'Good Enough'), you have a priceless cast and film crew. Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton, and Corey Feldman (to some extent) have surpassed their transition into adult roles, so they've been around quite a while. Nostalgic viewers should get a kick out of seeing them a squeaky voice little kids--except for the gorgeous Josh Brolin, who was already 17 at the time of the film's release. None of the kids are annoying as those cast in family films often tend to be (and with the exception of some of Sean Astin's dialogue, it is hardly corny). You have a good assortment of characters like fast-talking Mouth (Corey Feldman), braniac inventor (Data), and the hyperactive fat kid (who may be the most well known character in the film and turned Jeff Cohen into a cult star, despite his not doing much in movies afterwards).And of course, it is especially helped by filmmakers who always work well with family film material and young casts and scripts (like Speilberg with E.T.; and Chris Columbus with Home Alone and the Harry Potter movies), especially when it comes to the adventure genre. This movie really has a lot going for it and gives a lot of laughs from beginning to end.Kids will surely enjoy this great modern pirate adventure! If you're a kid, it probably encourages you to seek out some Goonie adventure yourself, afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pinnacle of 1980's Kid's Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is the pinnacle of 1980's Kid's movies - it tells the story of a group of misfit kids (called.... The Goonies) who embark on a adventure (old school style) to find the hidden treasure of One Eyed Willy (no that isn't supposed to be a rude name). All the kids are fouled-mouth and they mess around with the Fratellis - some crooks on the run from the long hand of the law. This is one of my top 3 kids movies from the 1980s - it is totally cool - with the bracers wearing Mikey, the jock older brother Brand, the loser fat kid (Chunk), the gadget kid (Data), the wise guy joker (Mouth), the sweetheart of the jock (Andy) and her nerdish friend (Stef). The characters, the dodgy child acting, the action, the bad guys, the lines - it's all here. Probably people who didn't see this in their childhoods wouldn't appreciate it - but I do!</fullReview>

So they go in pursue of finding treasure which would be there way of not moving.On there adventure they run into a problem actually 3 the Fratellis's whom own a restaurant above where the treasure is supposedly being hid.Some of the Goonies Mouth,Stef,andy,brand,mikey,and Data found a secret passage way under the fire place and still went in pursue of the treasure while Chunk went to find the police.But chunk got a ride from the Fratellis's which didn't go to the police ,the fratellis's went to go find the other goonies while Chunk then found his new friend Sloth who ended up saving the Goonies.While not realizing it Mikey accidentally took Gems which saved there house.It was a real great adventure movie and i would recommend it to any one who wants to see a great movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!love #1 rtist</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goonies and Gremlins never get old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like making a comment No 2364 or more, so I keep commenting less popular movies. But reading some recent comments I just want to add a few words.This movie passes the test of years very good. I saw it few days ago for the first time, together with my teenage kids who watch South Park, Resident Evil and other action, horror, violent movies made last few years, that I never heard of (and don't want to). But they were delighted watching Goonies. My fifteen year old sun said "Now I'll have also something to recommend in school!". And I like that the main characters are "real" kids. Today so many movies show early years of movie heroes. First it was in cartoons ("Young Tom&amp;Jerry, then Bungs Bunny"), but later we have young Indiana Jones etc. It seems noone has imagination to make new kids characters, so I'm expecting to see young Schindler as a kid-hero of WWI, or young Rocky as sport star of his college. Some scenes probably couldn't be made today, especially in "PG" movies, because US censors and movie-makers protect children (releasing South Park in the same time - "not for children" of course, so they get even more interested in it). But this scenes make the characters much more real, and give the movie less sterile look as many recent movies have (unless they're made in France, Sweden or somewhere else in Europe).And one remark that might be dropped out and swept away by the administrators, but I'll write it anyway. I read a comment posted by DonFreidle. It was a bit surprising, so I took time to read his comment list, and found out that he signs himself each time from different place or even continent (Europe, North or Latin America...) and his comments are sometimes distasteful, sometimes humiliating - all of that is his right if he feels it and it's his style; but these comments are often misleading (read e.g. what he wrote about Kubrick's 2001). Suggestion: when you decide to watch some movie or not according to comments in IMDb, and find something like this (he is not the only one, of course!) read some of poster's other comments to understand him as the person and make a final decision only after that! And, watch the Goonies, but not because I write it, but because so many others do it too!</fullReview>

Sean Astin points out his mistake in the DVD commentary. But I notice that Data(Key Quan) does the same mistake in the attic and says "Don't Touch Josh!" Just makes me laugh everytime I hear it!

		<shortDescription>Entertaining story of a quest for lost gold, totally unoriginal but done in the right spirit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most youngsters have a liking for this lively adventure movie. Much of that is probably due to its action-packed ingredients - pirate treasure, a dusty old map, twisting underground passages, booby traps, teenagers in peril, and some genuinely hissable bad guys. Adults might not be so enthralled, as many of the plot devices are pretty unoriginal, but all the same the pace is lively enough to pass the time agreeably. The "Goonies" are a bunch of kids who live in a sleepy coastal town. They are on the verge of having to sell their homes and move away as greedy developers have acquired their land. Only a massive cash windfall can prevent this from happening. One rainy afternoon, they are fooling around in the attic when they come across an old pirate map. They decide to hunt for the treasure (it might, after all, be their final chance to get the money they need). But the route to the loot is riddled with deadly traps and puzzles, and things become even worse when a trio of murderers get involved in the race for the treasure as well. Many of the film's young actors went on to bigger things (Sean Astin in Lord of the Rings, for example). They show quite a lot of star quality and manage to give performances beyond their years under the assured direction of Richard (The Omen) Donner. In many ways, the film plays like a juvenile variation of the Indiana Jones movies, and is a very competent and fast-moving yarn for those who like this sort of thing. It's not a film that was ever destined to win any awards, but if fun and adventure is your kind of thing then you could do a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice adventure movie for kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid, I saw this one at the theater. As a kid it is a really fun and funny action ride. A bunch of kids getting together find a map in the attic of one of the kids and they decide to see what they can find. Meanwhile, some criminals are loose and they find out about the map as well later on as their hideout is the starting point. A very good movie for kids, but it is just ok for adults, though it is a lot more watchable for adults than most of the kid oriented movies these days. Though there are a few instances that may be to dark for the smaller tykes out there as there are a couple of dead bodies here and there. Looking back at this movie, one thing is interesting. When seeing this movie as a kid, it seemed like their adventure was really long and they were underground a bunch. When I saw it later again, they really weren't in the underground chamber all that long. One thing though I would like to see is the octopus scene that was cut out of the movie, but the one kid refers to at the end (when the kid refers to it should have been cut out as well).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having watched it over and over and over as a child, The Goonies was on TV just this week. I hadn't sat and watched it for over 10 years, plus i hadn't shown my daughter it. Being 4 1/2 i wasn't sure if it would keep her attention. However, she instantly got into it. I can remember my parents desperately scraping around for a VHS to record it from the television and yet here i was sitting with my child watching it. I didn't see that coming. Not only do you love this film as a child, but you love it as an adult also, wishing for your childhood back. The Goonies is a family classic, 6.9? Its worthy of a lot more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw 'The Goonies' when I was 10 years old and it instantly became my fave movie but I'm older and alot wiser now and would'net give it another glance.The story is about a group of adventures kids who discover a pirate map and set out on a fantasy treasure hunt to save there neighbourhood. This is the bottomless pit of the Spielberg genre, a silly tale which takes forever to get going and is acted by children who have not studied elocution. The trick effects when they come are OK, but it's a long annoying haul to that point.Mark: 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, in short, a classic. It's a favorite of mine, ever since I borrowed it about 3 months ago. It was hilarious when I saw the look on my friend's face... "You've never seen The Goonies???" Well, now I'm part of the group who have seen the movie and love it.I can't stand it when people criticize movies so brutally, like a comment I saw on here. But, I admit, there are some movies out there I would like to trash, so I'm not saying anymore.The movie is a great adventure movie, even though some of the language might not be good for younger kids.

This is so memorable, it has it all, Sloth, Chunk, Mikey, Mouth, Data, Momma Fratelli, etc, everyone loves the goonies. I could stop anyone in the street and ask them if they'd seen the goonies, and they'd probably reply with a quote from it! They just don't make kids films like this anymore, I must have seen it a hundred times and still it never gets boring, I was so pleased to buy the US dvd last year, and to actually here from the Director himself ( Richard Donner ) that the sequal is in the works, is just the stuff dreams are made of, there will be a whole generation who will make this one of the most eagerly anticipated films ever, ( I just hope it takes off ! ) I would like to say I wish some 'cool' director would give Corey Feldman a really good role, such as someone like Paul Thomas Anderson, this man needs a comeback more than any other actor! it was good to see him in the Moby music video for "we are all made of stars"Goonies fans: if you love this film buy the dvd now!!!!!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best movie of the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I saw The Goonies for the first time. I was 8 years old and saw it at the cinemas and it became my favourite movie. After seeing it my friends and I started our own Goonie club and would go on adventures in the bushland as we lived near a reserve and we would create our own treasure hunts. Jeff Cohen as Chunk was fantastic and not a single actor was miscast and the scene where Chunk confesses to the Fratelli's the worst things he's done in his life were hilarious. I hadn't seen this for years until it was released on DVD not long ago and when I watched it again, my childhood came flooding back and it hasn't dated at all. This is one movie that appeals to all ages and I am disappointed that there has been no sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just bought this one on DVD after I stumbled upon it in the shops and childhood memories came back to me. Those who grew up in the 80's will be pretty familiar with Goonies. It's one of those films you can easily show a young audience and keep them occupied for 2 hours. Now I've seen this movie after let's say, 15 years or so and it was one nostalgic treat! Sure it isn't as tenseful as it was when I saw it at a school screening but it is still one rollercoaster of fun and adventure. I recommend Goonies to everyone who has kids to keep busy and to those who want to recall childhood memories.</fullReview>

I love Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, they are such great actors... and how great, they're in a movie together! Sean plays the leader of the gang who's a little cautious and is known to get him and the rest of the goonies into trouble. Corey plays Mouth..my favorite character. He's the wise cracking one who think he's cool. Teamed up with other cast members, Ke Huy Quan, Jeff Cohen, Josh Brolin, Anne Ramsey and some great other this movie gives off a feeling of humor and the fun of being a kid.

While I'm older and have different tastes, I have no problem sitting through it on television or whenever my friend wants to watch it. Unfortunately, "kiddie" films like this aren't made with this kind of passion anymore.Granted, Spy Kids may have reestablished this medium, but that film didn't have the dialogue and wit The Goonies possessed. Its hard to say something like this, but this film is definitely one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Goonies for ever since it came out in the theaters. I bought the storybook way back then too. I've seen the movie a dozen times on different cable networks, and tonight I caught it on TBS. This time I saw it was different; there was a scene in a convenience store that was told about in my storybook as well as Data having trouble with his Spy Eyes and Pinchers of Peril before they entered the restaurant; both things I've never seen before. How come suddenly I'm seeing this different version on TV? Is this new to all of you too? Are these extras on the DVD? I've already read your posts on the Octopus; but it's still on as I'm typing so I haven't seen that yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This adventure movie is great and I would definitely show this classic to my kids, grandkids, greatgrandkids, etc. This movie was non-stop excitement from beginning to the end with a total of only less than 5 minutes of bordom. It is funny with the kids who go on an adventure for the pirate ship of the captain one-eyed WIlly. This greedy, chatterbox kid called CHUNK becomes friends with this deformed person who is the brother of one of the bad guys named SLOTH. Thank god the DVD was released because you can look at the deleted scenes and see this scene with the octopus monster known as SEPTEE who tried to rub Steffanie's legs but got upset thinking that mouth was sexually abusing her. Cyney Lauper made an appearance. This movie is so quick that a different scene happens in 2 or 3 minutes. This is definetly the movie worth watching if want excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Goonies" is definitly one of my all time favorite movies! It reminds me of adventures I always use to fantasize about as a kid. The plot is about a group of outcast friends (they call themselves the Goonies) who find a treasure map of a long lost treasure. The kids, who are about to lose their houses decide to try and help their parents by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. On their search for 'the rich stuff' they uncover the hideout of the Fratelli's, a family of bumbling bad guys. The child actors are amazing. My personal favorite is Mikey, (played by an adorable Sean Astin) the leader of the group. You may also see some other familar faces, like Corey Feldman-the wise cracking 'Mouth', Josh Brolin-macho big brother 'Brand', and Martha Plimpton-Andi's friend 'Stef'. This movie is a great childhood classic. I highly recommend it even if you are just a kid at heart. It has great 80's styles and feeling. It is a movie you can never get tired of, (believe me, I've seen this movie atleast 30 times!!!! And it is still one of my favorites.) If you haven't seen this movie yet go out and rent it! And if you have a DVD player, check out the DVD. It has a full length commentary by 'The Goonies' all grown up!I give this movie a 10/10!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the Goonies because it's silly. It's a classic movie dealing with kids on an adventure to save their home from being foreclosed. The leader of the Goonies, Mikey (played by an adorable Sean Astin), finds a map of an ancient pirate's ("One-Eyed Willy") treasure. The Goonies follow the map and wind up in caves deep underground and have to keep their wits about them to get to the coveted treasure. The characters are extremely comical, and there is an element of romance between Andy (a cute cheerleader) and Brand (Mikey's older and hunky brother). I will never get tired of the movie, simply because it is silly and it fun to watch. The story is so out there that you can't help but like it. It makes you want to be a part of the adventure and makes you feel like a kid again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were a kid in the 80's, you must have LOVED this film!!It's probably the best film I'd assossciate with my childhood. It's got everything you want - action, comedy, a little bit of romance, adventure, and it all revolves around young teenagers!God, I really wanted to be one of those guys - I'd like to think of myself as a Mouth type character, but the reality was, that I was Chunk type character. That's what's also so good about this film, you have all the stereotypical kids in this movie - from the fat stupid kid, to the brainy kid who is just a little bit too brainy!We all know the plot - or at least we should, and it's a good one too.The film has a nice appeal to it, me and some mates watched it very recently, and though it seems a little dated, it still is a lot of fun to watch. Now that we're older (all roughly 20/21) we get the subtle nuances of the jokes. I mean is it just me? or did I completely miss the sexual reference to 'One Eyed Willy'????!!!!!!!!! I'm soooo naive!!watch this film, re-visit your childhood and enjoy a great piece of the 80's.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the DVD last night, I am totally impressed. If you are a fan, go and get the DVD today! The menus are fun to play with, the special features include outtakes (including the infamous octopus scene), full length commentary featuring donner, and all the goonies (except sloth, who is deceased). The best feature is the two part music video for Cyndi Lauper's "Good Enough" song. If you've never seen it, i'll describe it: it features lots of the original WWF wrestlers (remember when wrestlers were like super heroes and super villians not just a bunch of oversized rednecks?) like Andre The Giant and Rowdy Roddy Piper! The dvd is presented in widescreen, so you get that great movie experience you come to expect from DVDs. The cut is remastered, of course.Nostalgia is very important with a movie like this. It might not have the most original plot, or the best acting, but for anyone who grew up with this movie, it's possible that this movie can instil the greatest feeling of nostalgia in us 20 somethings. I practically have to hold back the tears everytime I hear "good enough." Having the music video to remind me of those old saturday afternoon wrestling matches, a making of feature, and a brilliantly restored print, really brings out the nostalgia. Now if only they'd make that sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies was one of the first movies my parents took me to go see when I was a little one. In fact, it was third behind Return of the Jedi and The Karate Kid. Since I was only 5 at the time, there are scant images remaining from that first showing. One being my Dad laughing his ass off during the interrogation scene between Chunk and the Fratelli's and a poster for Psycho II out in the lobby. It wasn't until this film came to video that I started fiending for it like a speedfreak on pay day.From a one year period between 1987 and 1988 I must have seen this movie at least 2-3 times a week. I knew every line by heart and I even went out and bought as many packs of the Goonies Trading Cards I could get my grubby little hands on. I always kept on getting the card where they get attacked by the octopus. This always p***ed me off because there was never any scene with the octopus in any frame that I ever saw. I must have seen the flick about 75 times by then and still no frickin' octopus. Damn Richard Donner and his scissor happy editing.Anyway, by the time I got to third grade I was so burned out on the movie that I refused to watch it for over ten years. But when I did finally see it again, the magic was still there. This has to rank as one of the best kid flicks of all time. I say that because it doesn't tone down on the swearing content. Some parents would argue with me on that point but it's time to face the truth. Unless you haven't been to a school playground since 1965, you know that little kids are capable of saying stuff that would make a Hells Angel blush. It's a kid flick for real kids.And what the hell ever happend to Chunk? I know Mikey went on to become Rudy and he's gonna be in Lord of the Rings, Brand is now engaged to Minnie Driver, Martha Plimpton does mostly stage stuff, and Corey Feldman is...well...Corey Feldman. But Chunk fell off the face of the Earth. I thought that was him as the guy at the motel front desk in Memento but it turned out that it wasn't. Somebody help me find Chunk!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe those who didn't see this movie as a kid will not like it, but I have seen it countless times. It's plain and pure fun all the way, taking things lightheartedly, but so what if it's a kiddie flick? We are given some of the most memorable characters such as Chuck, Data (slick shoes anyone?), Mouth, and Mikey. The villains, those infamous Fratellis, are a blast to watch. Everything feels so 80's, much like the Breakfast Club or Mannequin. Not to mention Cyndi Lauper! Goonies are good enough ... oh yeah. Some people have to understand that when something struck a chord within a child, the experience will carry on until adulthood, and I guess that's the case for me, as well as for the many, many generations who grew up listening to Pet Shop Boys or Duran Duran.

I was too young to see it when it was first released, but i have watched countless times since then, and it's one of those films you keep watching, over &amp; over because although you know every single detail of the film, you have to go back to it. The actors were pretty good for their age, and the comedy element still creases me up. I'd recommend this film to anyone of any age. I'm glad there wasn't a sequel though, this is a one off classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a true kids' classic - you just don't get films like this anymore - what's the best this new millenium can come up with? Pokemon! Digimon! Or Dungeons and Dragons, which kids nowadays won't even have heard of. This is a must see for all Richard Donner fans, Spielberg fans and Chris Columbus fans. You could say it's a childlike replica of "Temple of Doom", but much funnier and with a faster pace. Great to watch time and time again - reminiscent of the time when kids actually did things like this and didn't just play on their PlayStation! To all parents - get your kids to watch this - you'll love it as much as they do - in fact, probably a lot more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the greatest films of the 20th century!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter who you are, or where you live, The Goonies should always stand out in your mind as one of the greatest movies churned out of tinsel town. I am so happy that this film has not only touched me, but many people the world over. This film is probably the most important film of my childhood. I can remember many a rainy day where my Dad would take me to the local video store to hire a film and we I would always pick up the same video.....The Goonies. After 12 years things don't change. It still rains in England, and I still watch The Goonies on a regular basis. Didn't we all at one time, wish that we were a Goonie huh? I personally always wanted to be Mikey, leading the gang to "One Eyed Willy". It's that kind of interaction that is missing from films today. I just hope that the good people at Warner Brothers and Amblin Entertainment deside to release it on DVD. This film deserves to be dusted and polished digitally so that future generations of young kids can enjoy it as much as I have. Whoever you are young or old and haven't so already, I strongly suggest that you watch The Goonies. I hope it touches you as much as me. With rumors of a script going around Hollywood to do a sequel, now is an excellent time to catch the original and see why it is worth a sequal! For anyone who doesn't love this film all I can say is.....I don't understand. Everyone should love this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about 'The Goonies' that hasn't already been said? It is, quite frankly, the best kids movie of the 80's! Mikey, Mouth, Brend, Andy, Data, Chunk &amp; Stef were the surely the icons of everybody's childhood (If you grew up in the eighties that is!). There is nothing to hate about this film. From the singing of Cyndi Lauper on the TV to Data's 'Fifty Dollar Bill' exclamation to Mikey's passion for 'One Eyed Willy'. If you like this film you'll like 'Hollow Man' because the guy who played Brand in this plays Elizabeth Shue's boyfriend in 'Hollow Man' - waddya know!. Back to this film - it's so ace! Buy it, watch it, love it...it'll become a part of you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I can't even tell you how many times I've seen this movie. I could sit and tell you each line and what is going to happen next. This movie is a classic from the 80s and a good memory from my childhood. "This is our time" and "Hey, you guys!" are favorite lines. The Goonies is a good conversationalist piece because people remember it and love it. It has a good story and not bad acting. Sean Astin is a cutie in this movie. We all know that we had friends that we did crazy things with when we were kids. This movie just lets us remember them (well not looking for treasure, but something close).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the best. You can't fault it. It's like a wild fairground ride that you want to ride again and again. I first saw this movie when I was six years old, and now, all these years later, I found a copy at a garage sale. It's a great movie about a bunch of misfit kids - the loudmouth, the overweight kid, the wallflower, the high-school jock - they are all here, and together, they spend a day following a local legend for pirate's gold. Unknown to them, first class criminals are hot on there heels for their share! The Goonies has aged pretty well - Cyndi Lauper with her bubblegum soundtrack, An excellent group of kids and a hilarious Anne Ramsay as Mamma Fratelli, Chris Columbus' funny dialogue,and Spielberg's genius. Put it all together - you've got a movie that you can watch over and over again without ever tiring of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I hear the wistful old saying of "ah, they don't make them like that anymore", this is probably the first film I think of. It is also one of those films where, after watching it, you beg and prey that there will be a sequel, just so as that you can see more of the characters, but you know that there won't be - like all great fantasy tales (the never-ending story not included!), it is a complete adventure with no loose ends. A timeless adventure that cannot be recreated. If you have not, for some insane reason, seen this film, do so. If it doesn't warm your heart with nostalgia, congratulations - you had a perfect childhood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our IMAX theater has begun showing "cinema classics" late on weekends - including this 1980s standout. Having not witnessed it in a theater in oh, say about fifteen years, I marveled at just how well it retained its 'fun factor'. Like many others, I originally saw "Goonies" when I was ten years old. It was a thrill-ride of adventure, jokes, comraderie and sheer 80s icons too numerous to name (the combination of Corey Feldman, Sean Astin, Anne Ramsey, the kid who played Short-Round and a soundtrack featuring Cyndi auper is lethal in its 80s-ness). Seeing it again not only brought back memories, but reminded me of how a good movie can sometimes be the one that is so much fun it masks the absolute absurdity of its plot - something about a group of outcast kids searching for pirate booty to save their neighborhood from greedy developers (like I said, absurd...but so 80s, you know?). Add to the pros of "Goonies" its kitschy band of ragtag characters, some of whom stay with you (Sloth, Mouth and the irrepressible Chunk) and some who don't (the older brother, the girls), and you have a movie that stands the test of time, for better or for worse. Damn fine movie. The Goonies were, and are, good enough for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult favorite speaks to pre-tech generations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the amount of comments here alone, I would have to say this film has become a cult favorite. Once a film reaches that status any form of critique based on technical or artistic achievement becomes meaningless. Perhaps the reason this film strikes a chord is that it spoke to a generation which still hadn't been polluted completely by video and computers. Videos were still pretty new and most households did not have a VCR. AOL was just three letters in the alphabet. Kids still had the opportunity and time to explore and use their imagination. In this respect the film speaks to all childhoods up through the 1980's and can be enjoyed by all generations up to that era. Of course, today's children can also enjoy the film but unfortunately they may not identify with this type of adventure. However, it may inspire today's kids to go outside and use their brains and imagination instead of their remotes or keyboards and therefore giving this film more strength than it had the first time around. Incidently, during the eighties Mr. Speilberg enjoyed placing Disney icons in his films (try looking for them in E.T., Poltergeist, the Indy films, 1942, etc...) In this film, his production crew copied the set pieces of the Disneyland ride Pirates of the Caribbean for the Pirate Ship/Treasure Cave scene. In an era when movies are turned into rides (especially Speilberg movies like Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, etc...) it's neat to see a ride turn into a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see this movie, and it always reminds me of my childhood. This movie is exactly how I was in my adolescence. I ran around, pretending to look for treasure and such. However, these kids have one slight difference from me, they really looked for treasure. This movie plays off of stereotypes for kids, the cripple, the brain, the mouth, the clutz, etc. and binds them together in a realistic manner. Plus, it's a good old fashioned adventure. Another added plus is I work with the mentally impaired a lot. John Matuszac's portrayal of Sloth is very realistic, and I think he should have gotten on Oscar for his portrayal. And, just so everyone knows, I have a friend who acts and looks like chunk. Overall, it was an excellent movie, and I would watch it constantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to our childhood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when boys would spend a whole day watching their favorite heroes, dreaming of riding a crusade against Darth Vader's Empire or fighting the enemies among the Knights of the Round Table. Just like in the Fantasy Island, where Mr. Roarke and Tatoo would make all one's wishes come true, The Goonies has the special talent to bring our childhood fantasies back and remind us how great those years were.In this 1985 movie, a bunch of kids find a map which indicates the spot where the evil pirate One-Eyed-Willie buried a big treasure stolen from English ships in the 1500's. As we can predict, they decide to seek for the gold and precious stones to help their parents who are about to be expelled from their homes because they can't make ends meet and also because some wealthy men want to put their houses down to build a country club on it's place. Dangers, traps and even a family of thieves - the Fratelli - are after them.As the film goes on, we can see how closer the friends get and how supportive we all should be. They would always be there for each other, no matter how deep their problems are. Even a rich girl, Andy, is accepted by the group, in a very politically correct act, where no distinctions are made. The scene in which the guys are stuck in a hole, is very touching and really digs our sense of aid.Richard Donner directed this movie and another famous director, Chris Columbus wrote the screenplay, based on a Steven Spielberg's story. Matt Sweeney was responsable for the special effects and the main theme ( They 'r good enough ) was written and performed by Cindy Lauper.After the film, none of the kids became famous actors. Corey Feldman and Kerry Green took part in some teenage comedies, while Sean Astin showed up in "Memphis Belle" and Ke Huy Quan was the young Indiana Jone's chinese taxi driver in "The Temple of the Doom". The only one who joined some serious projects was Martha Plimpton.But these are just technical details. What really counts in "The Goonies" are the two hours of humanity, pleasure, inocence, friendship - and even the first love - that only children can show in their eyes. In fact, it's a small journey to our past, to a time when your deepest worries were about the girl (or the boy) on the next chair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't even born when it was made, so no one can say I like it for nostalgic reasons! Adults with no sentimental attachments probably wouldn't like it too much, but it's a good kids movie, and, I guess you'd like it if you were a kid growing up during that time. I did like seeing those clothes, not to mention the working out and cheerleading, very 80's. One thing they should do is put back in the cut scenes (the Stef &amp; Mouth scene most especially) and re-release it! How about a 15 year anniversary or something?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hey you gu-uys!" Because I grew up in the 80's, I like to watch movies that remind me of my childhood- and this is certainly one of them. It brings back memories of what it was like to be a kid- of getting into mischief and hanging out with your friends. The characters in "The Goonies" grow on you and you see them as real, not fictional-- as they portray their parts in a way that any kid (or any adult who has even a spark of childhood nostalgia) can relate to. This movie will never grow old to me- it will remain a classic forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adventure film for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is great fun to watch. A group of kids nicknamed The Goonies try to save their small town in Astoria from property development hell. They find an old treasure map and go in search for the lost treasure of One-Eyed Willy. What follows is a great load of gags and little adventures. Great to watch with the kids. This bunch of actors were supposed to be the new generation of brat-packers but it never really hit off for them, pity but it's still a great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The answer just has to be no. No matter how juvenile, silly, and down right infantile, people call the film, it is still my favourite. Right from the day I first saw it to fifty viewings later, it still has lost none of its charm. Every single line is memorable, and still has me reciting the film. A true children's classic, with such brilliant characters as Sloth, Chunk, and the ingenious Data. When I watch this film I can become Nine years old again, if only for a short while. A True True children's classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misadventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is a childhood adventure best left to children. Kids might find the movie enjoyable. Maybe. But viewed through the eyes of an adult the movie is a flop. The script is dire, the acting is rather terrible, a number of the characters serve no purpose while other characters serve only to annoy. And the supposed great adventure our young heroes go on is not even particularly interesting. There is very little excitement to be had here, honestly this is a rather boring movie.The story follows a group of kids as they search for long-lost pirate treasure. A very simple plot but that would be OK if this treasure hunt was exciting. It is not. The kids find many obstacles in their way. There are booby traps to get through and some hapless villains on their tail. It all becomes repetitive rather quickly. Make your way through this trap, then that trap, then another trap. All along the way spout terrible dialogue and in many instances have many kids spouting that terrible dialogue all at the same time. These kids talk, and scream, over one another for two hours. Get me an aspirin. The acting is completely unconvincing. Child actors are capable of great performances. Not in this movie. We get grating performances from the whole lot of them. Sean Astin, playing the leader of the group, is probably most annoying of all though Ke Huy Quan, who you may remember as the incredibly annoying kid from Temple of Doom, runs him close. There are a couple of girls tossed into the proceedings and they add absolutely nothing. Meanwhile the villains are total duds. There is very little good to say here. This is one dull, empty adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Goonies' is more than anything else a hysterical movie; almost every character seems to be screaming most of the time. And quite a few characters are pretty annoying even beyond that, like Chunk (didn't he look like Bette Midler's grandson?) and his obsession with food, Mikey (Sean Astin? Really? I hadn't recognized him) and his ability to be utterly corny to the point one would call a doctor, or Mouth, who is just plain annoying. The plot itself is like Indiana Jones for kids, without the traveling, plus a dysfunctional Italian crime family.Nearing the end, things got better, with the dazzling water slide and that terrific underground set with the pirate ship (though that town and its surroundings were great to look at as well). One character who was over the top also, but still has my sympathy, is Sloth. Mother Fratelli, by Anne Ramsey, was quite 'lovable', too. All in all, a kid's film that is just about doable if you can take all hysteria, though I'd expected to feel more sentimental than I do.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie with a bunch of kids who save their part of the town from being turned into a golf course. There are lot of times in the movie when you might feel 'that's silly' but it might be a nice watch for the kids. Kids might have lot of fun watching a bunch a kids trying to pull off a breath taking treasure adventure. But for an adult mind it looks too childish and at times boring. I gave this 6 considering it might be lot of fun for kids under the age group of 15 or maybe 12 but I would have personally given it only 4 or 5 out of 10.Maybe I expected a lot from this as the story was from Steven Spielberg. But the whole movie is based on some impulsive events that take place all in one day. The connectivity is loose at many instances and the humour is real immature or too juvenile. The movie starts with a small introduction of each character but is very lame. Overall it's good if the kids want to watch some adventure flick but otherwise it's a total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun, light "Indiana Jones" for kids is this story from Steven Spielberg, adapted to the screen by Chris Columbus. Stars up and coming actors of the time including Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan and Martha Plimpton. Also starred Joe Pantoliano and the wonderful Anne Ramsey.Richard Donner directs (why is anybody's guess) this journey into fantasy as a group of young kids stumble through caves and booby traps in search of legendary treasure. "The Goonies" has all the ingredients to thrill the younger ones, with scary villains, thrilling traps and an amiable cast. For adults: don't expect the greatest adventure film ever.Theme "Goonies 'R' Good Enough" came from Cindi Lauper. Remember her?Friday, February 20, 1998 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember lazy weekend days watching this flick with my sister and cousins, laughing and repeating our favorite quotes out loud. And then, after our imaginations had been fueled, it was off to find a treasure map of our own.This movie is a classic. Bottom line. I have seen it more times then I can count, and it never gets old, even as I do. It's great to watch alone, but even better with friends or family. When the day comes that I have children, this will be one of the films I make sure they watch.The cast is excellent, and all the characters are quirky and fun. It's not scary (so don't be worried to show it to around 5 and up), though they do say 'crap'(and I think some other soft 'naughty' words), don't know how many parents would be upset about this...If you love adventures that seem possible, and yet just out of reach, this is for you. But, remember, this is an older movie. Don't expect dazzling effects. Generations right after mine have been spoiled by high-tech, flashy works that lack decent plot. Watch for the fun, not to be overly impressed by 3D awesomeness, or anything like that.One of my best loved childhood memories. Must watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film for at least the 5th time and it is just a great, funny bit of escapism. It takes me right back to being a kid in the 80's, and almost anyone who grew up then who by some weird twist of fate hasn't seen this should watch it immediately.There is some great comic acting. I don't know why Corey Feldman hasn't done more - his performance as the wisecracking Mouth really stands out. The scene at the beginning where he shows the maid around the house still makes me laugh.This is a kids film I am absolutely 100% unashamed to enjoy at the age of 32. If I have kids, I can't wait to watch it with them.Hollywood gets a lot of stick for churning out dumb movies these days, and it hasn't made family entertainment likes this for a long time. For me, this is Hollywood family entertainment at it's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving this film a ten for reasons that are closer to my heart than a technical breakdown of cinematography, acting etc etc.I love movies; the older ones rather the than the newer. Because in my opinion, the older ones serve as reminders of how it used to be.I remember when I was that age, and I watch them on bikes and hanging out in their 'goonie' world. It is (excuse the oxymoron) almost exactly how I used to act with friends when the world was our own magical empire. We were never out to hurt anyone and we knew everyone in the neighbourhood and they knew us. The worst thing that could happen to us as kids was getting called in to supper when it got dark.I'm giving this film a ten, because of what it represents and how it does things. It reminds me how things used to be before I had to start being responsible for my life on a bigger scale.I think, though society has changed and kids are just not the same anymore (me being second generation in my late twenties), there is a goonie in everyone somewhere, and this film brings it out, and makes me laugh every time. It takes me back, excuse the clich, to the wonder years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering what it tries to do and what it succeeds in doing, this could be one of the top ten movies of all time. I could show this movie to my audience (boys age 8-14) once a week forever and they would never tire of it. Say this about any other movie, I dare you. Everything about this film, from production values to special effects to sets to music to camera work to editing is A+ and deserves all the accolades it can get. Apparently I need to add lines about the characters to get over the ridiculous minimum requiring padding even if you've said all that needs to be said in a line or two. Sean Astin is cute, asthmatic and vulnerable and will grow up to be a good character actor, and type cast as a Hobbit because he is short. Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Corey Feldman continued on to OK careers as older characters. In short, the whole is much, much more than the sum of its parts and is altogether a work of genius.After another 5 years my opinion has not changed one iota. This is a 10+ fivestar film for the ages; it appeals to kids of all ages and adults also because we (I'm 65) can at least identify with at least one of the weirdo goonies. Forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the start of the opening credits of Ma and her two sons fleeing through Astoria at high speeds whilst introducing us to a small band of kids who we lovingly came to know as the Goonies, to a pirate ship sailing into the distance which puts POTC to shame with it's authentic grace 'The Goonies' is one of those movies which aimed to please and did so much more.It's the grand adventure which every child young and old wishes they could have lived and nigh on twenty years later still impresses. The eighties produced some memorable movies in it's decade and 'The Goonies' along with others stands the test of time. With the small band of heroes Mikey, Mouth, Chunk and Data with the addition of some older but non the wiser teenagers of Brand, Andi and Steph we are taken on the grandest adventure with the simplest of terms. A treasure hunt. Every trick in the book is thrown in, A car chase, a treasure map with cryptic clues, dubloons, pirates, underground caves, dead guys, bad guys, pirate ships and skeletons. And of course Sloth.It's the stuff fairy tales couldn't get enough of and yet it was so real you almost wished yourself to Astoria to live the grand adventure itself. You can't help but laugh at each small intricate detail to the sarcasm of Mouth and how to 'pack the drugs' to poor Chunk relaying his life story to save his poor fingers from the blender. Throw in Mikey to touch the soft spot in your heart and raise a tear, and Data who has a gadget to get you out of every situation. Andi and Brand provide the romance, although in saying Mikey gets a look in too and Steph tries and fails to provide the adult expertise before reverting to perfect sarcasm battles with Mouth. And all this whilst being chased by the Fratelli's.All in all, praise upon praise cannot say how good 'The Goonies' is, I was five when it was released, and it's been a favourite from then, although I do remember being scared of Sloth at the time. I killed off the version I watched and re-watched and re-watched recorded onto video from all those years ago, bought it on VHS and killed that version too, Thankfully DVD's are that little bit more hard wearing. I hope to be watching it in another twenty years time and still loving it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies might never be hailed as the best movie ever, but for a lot of people who grew up in/were born in the 80s, its one of the most important films of that decade... ...Most of the negative comments here are from people taking the film out of context - its not meant for everyone, and its definitely not supposed to be taken as a serious cinematic achievement... Its also not made for people who intend to make harsh judgements about the acting or the political correctness of the characters - its made for people who either arent looking for or couldnt recognise those things... It's easy to just dismiss a film like this as badly made just because you didnt get it, but if you try and watch it as its meant to be seen, it could reward you...The Goonies was one of the first films i rented more than 10 times as a kid... Theres something about the exaggerated stereotype characters that helps the film still have an emotional effect on me 15 years later - Mouth's 'this was my dream...' speech still makes me wanna go out in the street and shout goonies never say die... The film kind of grew up with me, too - when i first saw it at 5 years old, a lot of the jokes were lost on me, and re-watching it over time has let me get more from it each time...If you're gonna watch this film for the first time, dont go into it expecting some kind of classic work of cinematic art or even something that rivals Indiana Jones as an adventure film - The Goonies was specifically for the young (or people who dont want to grow up), and if you're over 14 and watching it for the first time, you'll probably have to try and see it from a kids perspective - its worth it to, just for an hour and a half, forget you've grown up and appreciate the fact that it's a kids fantasy adventure film...Oh, and if you saw it as a kid and havent seen it since, its definitely worth watching again - especially if you can get the chance to see it in public with other people who grew up with it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this Steven Spielberg-produced cute-fest when I was twelve. I like it even less now. Pretty much any Gen-X-er is familiar with the movie's plot: seven kids (including future Lord of the Rings star Sean Astin, future has-been Corey Feldman, and future indie actress Martha Plympton) venture into the caves of Astoria's Cannon Beach in search of a long lost treasure supposedly hidden by a legendary pirate hundreds of years ago. There are a few good moments along the way and Richard Donner directs the action scenes with his usual zing, but the kids' performances range from irritating to just plain lousy. The characters are worn out clichs (the shy book-worm winds up the hero, the fat kid is a pig, the Asian kid is an inventor, etc), and the Chris Columbus screenplay is dull, predictable and uneven. It's saved somewhat thanks to terrific performances by Anne Ramsey, Robert Davi and Joe Pantaliano as the bad guys, not to mention more than a few glimpses of Kelli Green's underpants. The DVD includes the legendary octopus scene--and it's very clear why the filmmakers chose to cut it out. This, of course makes the scene at the end when the kids yell "the octopus was scary" make no sense, and anyone who isn't aware that there was once an octopus scene will think the kids are making up stories, when they have no reason to after all they've been through! I simply do not see in this movie what apparently every other person my age does. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: If you haven't seen this movie, (And I advise you to :) I might give away little details about it, so be forewarned.The Goonies is by far my favorite movie of all time. I remember seeing it for the first time at my cousin's house on T.V. when we were eight. Then, it was just a funny movie that had a funny fat kid, some other funny kids, and a funny-looking guy who yelled funny stuff. Now, it's definitely the best.It's about 4 boys (Mikey, [who was always my favorite,] Data, Mouth, and Chunk) who are about to be separated because their housing development is going to be torn down to make room for a snotty country club golf course (headed by none other than the boys' least favorite person's father)The boys go up in the attic and find a treasure map. Thinking that they might be able to find the treasure and be able to "save to goon docks," they set off on what will be the biggest Goonie adventure they've ever done!It's rated PG, although there's an awful lot of swearing. No "f-words", but they say "shit" about every other sentance, and "damn" occasionally, so if you're gonna watch this with younger kids, think about it first. In all, I rate it a definite 10, for hilarious mishaps, fun quotes, great fun, and 'the funny fat kid'. :) (It's in English, by the way.)"...con las cucarachas, por DOS semanas, sin agua y sin comeda!" - Mouth, in the "Translate into Spanish for Rosalita" scene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many comments about this film, it's a wonder it wasn't a bigger hit when it was released. It seems to be one of the first films to really find an audience on videotape instead of in the theaters.Kids should really enjoy this, or people who were kids the first time they saw it and would now enjoy it for nostalgic reasons. Anybody else will probably be annoyed by all the contrivances and the maudlin script. A LOT of stuff in the movie doesn't make sense.For instance, if Chunk could sneak out the window of the basement, why did the rest of them crawl down the hole in the fireplace? How come Mikey &amp; Brandon's father never got the idea to go after the treasure? If they were so hard up for money to save their house, why did he have so many expensive gadgets in his attic (and a real Spanish dubloon, no less)? While One-Eyed Willie and his men where trapped in the cave for six years, what the heck did they eat? What did they drink? Why does Mikey call Willie the "first Goonie" when he so obviously slaughtered his own friends just to save his treasure? How did the pirate ship set sail against the tide, unmanned no less? How come Sloth seems to sacrifice his own life to save the kids, and then suddenly both he and the other Fratellis just appear on the beach? What would really have happened to Sloth after that day, anyway? Could Chunk really just take him home, like he was a pet or something? Shouldn't he have asked his parents about that first?Ultimately the movie works though. There were certain scenes that actually make me choke on the silly dialog (could any kid have ever been as sappy as Mikey, with all of those speeches?). I'm guessing it was Steven Spielberg who came up with the idea to have obviously stereotypical kids like Data (who is, at times, impossible to understand) and Chunk, who was one of the funniest and most interesting characters in the movie in spite of the annoying "fat kid" clichs they put him through. Most of the appeal for me as an adult is the antagonistic banter between Mouth and Stef. Stef runs away with a lot of the best jokes too, like when the bats invade the cave and she shrieks "RABIES!! RABIES!!!", and the kooky scene where she and Andy step on the rake and then hysterically insist something "disgusting" tried to attack them.In fact, I think the sense of nastiness is the only thing that saves this movie from being totally boring. Anne Ramsey is classic in her role, a real treat to watch in how mean she is to the Goonies, and the bad language that the kids use is actually a refreshingly realistic thing to see in a movie about kids. The too-tidy resolution almost comes off as too heavy-handed, until they bring back the hilarious Mexican maid...whoever the actress is who played her did a wonderful characterization. I get the feeling that, ironically, the only thing that kept "The Goonies" from being a major hit instead of a guilty pleasure is Steven Spielberg. If the film had simply been directed by Richard Donner maybe it would have been truly great, or else maybe if Spielberg had just done the damn thing all by himself it wouldn't have seemed so jarring to have a mixture of their two distinctly different visions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, for me, is the epitome of childhood adventure. It's every kid's dream to go hunting for treasure - along with being chased by a bad guy that you'll repeatedly outsmart. It has laughs, love, adventure, thrills, and much more.I probably have such a connection to the film because I saw it when I was 12. I think you keep movies you love as a kid close to your heart for your whole life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for kids of all ages...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was ten years old when I watched The Goonies for the first time. Mom took me to the cinema, and I bet she wasn't aware of what that film would mean to me. Now it's a bunch of years after, and it remains untouchable on my list of favorite movies. I think it's so charming, I mean, the whole mixture of pirates, adventure, humour, friendship, treasure-hunting, bad-but-dumb-criminals...even hints of teenage love! It's got everything you need to have a wonderful time in front of the T.V., just couch-potatoing with a big bowl of popcorn...I'd just say The Goonies is a must-see for kids of all ages, specially the ones in their mid-late twenties now, as that means they were same age as The Goonies when the movie plot took place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever I find myself becoming over-stressed from my college workload; I take a break and pop in the Goonies. I work part time in a video store, and with all of the movies I can choose freely from, I still consistently watch this movie over any other. It probably symbolizes the 80's from a kid's point of view better than any other single film, and it brings me back to that time in my life when I didn't have to worry about exams, rent, and career choices. While I might not have searched for buried treasure, we all have those moments from childhood that we would like to live again. The Goonies is my piece of mind packaged in an endearing tale of friendship, adventure, and that timeless experience of childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Goonies" not good enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the Steven Spielberg school, a calamitous kid-fracas which was inexplicably popular in its day, now a faded hit dressed with product placements and dated topical references. Spurred on by their dad's pirate-memorabilia collection in the attic--and with foreclosure hanging over their parents' heads--two brothers and their juvenile friends hope an ancient treasure map will lead them to One-Eyed Willie's buried fortune; an escaped convict and his brood are after it, too. A grab-bag of ideas, each one a surefire audience-pleaser (if you're under 12). Jeff Cohen, as "Chunk" (the chunky kid), is stereotypically clumsy and food-crazy (the other kids make him jiggle his fat before they'll let him in the house); Sean Astin is the dreamy, talkative boy whose braces keep glinting in the movie lights; Josh Brolin is the oldest kid who is pulled into the mystery against his will; Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton are the token girls (who squeal far less than the guys). None of these young actors give actual performances as much as they do mouth-off--sometimes all at once!--while director Richard Donner just keeps the cameras rolling. He must've known he'd be chortling all the way to the bank. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of young people of varying ages trying to save their home from being lost to re-development decide to use a treasure map they have found in order to locate a long-lost pirate ship, supposedly loaded with jewels. The kids then encounter a family of crooks who also want the treasure, and won't stop at kidnapping or worse to get it. They eventually do find the ship in a secret underground lair, and must overcome the crooks and other menaces to claim the treasure.Though popular with kids, this film is exceedingly loud and obnoxious. Every line of dialogue is not spoken, but screamed; the characters are heavy handed and deafening, the action even more so. I could not wait for this headache inducing nonsense to be over, despite the actors and director.Still, mine does seem to be a minority view...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To ^stupidity and beyond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seems to be considered a minor classic for children. The rating is quite high, many people have seen the movie, there's been a video game inspired by it, ... and there's Spielberg who produced and wrote the film. Then it MUST be good? Think again! The truth is that this is an inconceivable mess. Whoever thought this was funny, should be locked up and put away forever. There's not even a chuckle during the whole length of the film. And I can assure you that this film seems to be going on forever! So is it entertaining then? Surely not. This film is as boring and stupid as it gets. Imagine a bunch of irritating children( all with some sort of speaking disorder, it seems), yelling their way through the "story". Think of PROBLEM CHILD, LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO, even the POLICE ACADEMY FILMS... get the picture? Not yet? Then picture three idiotic villains (does Joe Pantaliano even recall his "performance" here?), a search for a hidden treasure (it takes a while to figure that out)and some sort of friendly "monster" (that reminded me of THE TOXIC AVENGER!), all of which seems awfully out of place in this film. Of course, this is a children's movie, I can understand that. And, like so many others of its kind, it's stupid, very stupid. And I guess you have to be a kid yourself to enjoy such films. But "stupid" doesn't actually mean "bad". There are many enjoyable, clever and sweet "family films". But this loud-mouthed, dumb mess isn't one of them. Oh, and there's actually a scene in which there's being referred to GREMLINS, another Spielberg production from a year before this one. Check out that one instead, at least there's a whole lot more cleverness in it than here. And don't say that it's too scary for children, THE GOONIES is ten times more scarier. And boring. Did I mention that already? 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I have to say I loved the review by 'Susannahvwhite' brilliantly described and well put. This movie will always hold that special place in my heart and in my collection of films. The Goonies defined my childhood, watched it for he first time as a kid and immediately wanted to be a Goonie :-) It had the same impact as Indy did on me, gave me the lust for adventure and action! It has great directors, great producers and great actors who just fit the bill perfectly. It's hard to pick a favourite character because they're all good but the 2 that crack me up most times I watch it are the Fratelli brothers! Very funny bumbling idiots who get bullied by their mum lol. Overall this movie is an all time classic and will stay that way through the generations in my opinion. If you have never seen it, treat yourself to a gem, I hope you won't be disappointed :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Live The Goonies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There must've been at least one or two kids in every household who would punch the hell out of you if you'd never saw "The Goonies" or know some of the scenes and characters. I was one of those household kids who cherish this 1985 classic as if watching "Raiders of the Lost Ark" as a kid where every weekend when I didn't need to do homework, one of my favorite eighties classics would be playing in the VCR from Ghostbusters, Goonies or Raiders of the Lost Ark.The Goonies is about a group of four young boys who are considered losers and outcasts to the popular kids. Mike (Sean Astin) is the leader of the group where he's always being teased and corrected in conversation by his older brother Brandon (Josh Brolin) who's trying to fit in with others. Mike's friend include a chatterbox know-it-all name Mouth (Corey Feldman), an inventor and James Bond fanatic Data (Jonathan Ke Quan), and chubby and great liar Chuck (Jeff Cohan). Mike and Brandon are upset that a group of rich snobs have seized the property of their parents house along with the rest of the community where all the houses and docks are going to be tear down for a country club to be made. Mike and his friends investigate the attic with Brandon where they try to seek any hidden treasures around the city before tying up Mike's brother.There is a subplot behind this comedy caper where the group of boys see that other people are at an abandon building with the treasure being hidden inside. More things are hidden inside as well before Brandon rescues Mike and others for any huge embarrassment. New characters enter from pop tart cheerleader Andy (Kerri Green) to geeky Stephanie (Martha Plimpton) who not only know Brandon and the kids but get involve with them as well with one thing happening over the next."The Goonies" is a funny movie where despite a few harsh languages here and there, especially the young kids saying a four letter S word (and I don't mean suck), there's nothing offensive about it.</fullReview>

I did some research on the filming locations, which took place mostly in Astoria, OR. &amp; I hope to take a trip there (I'm only in CA) to see the filming locations &amp; get photos of what it looks like today, compared to 26 years ago. It's also pretty cool how a movie you enjoyed as a kid still has you entertained &amp; now entertains your child! Oh yeah, Chunk is now a lawyer in Los Angeles.

		<fullReview>this is by far my most favorite movie in the world (with Stand By Me running a close 2nd) it has adventure,romance,comedy every thing a person would want in a movie. I'm only 13 years old, i wasn't even born when this movie was made. but my sister used to babysit for two kids, whom introduced this great movie to me, then i often saw it on t.v, but never the whole way through. then i rented it and completely fell in love with it. then i immediately started looking around in the phone book for movie places, i called about 16 places. until i found it at a used place. for $12.00. i asked my mom if we could go get it that night, but she said no. so then a couple nights later she surprised me with it.now i am pretty much making it a habit to watch it every single day. i can pretty much tell you when and where things are going to happen. i always say to my friends who watch it...look here comes the good part. i have memorized th whole movie.i have always liked 80's movies. my favorite used to be the breakfast club. i first judged it by the title i would say, Na it sounds pretty stupid. then i watched it and loved it then i soon became obsessed with Molly Ringwald movies like Sixteen Candles, which my mom showed me as one of her favorite movies. and the pretty in pink and all of that stuff, until i decided after i saw the goonies and stand by me that they were my new breakfast clubs (to which i memorized the whole movie too) i liked 80's movies with kids my age. even though stand by me had maybe one girl in the film (and that was Gordie's mother) AND THE GOONIES only had 2 girls who weren't my age i fell in love. i think that Richard Donner...a brilliant man.i HIGHLY recommend this movie to all adults who have had a pirate adventure once in they're life</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the child in all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Goonies" was the the film my brother, sister and I watched everyday of the holidays as children, we played on our bikes, made up maps, made camps, tried to invent cool contraptions and always went looking for treasure. This film captures the essence of childhood, when you believed in miracles, had no fear and thought you could do anything. The film although made twenty years ago hasn't aged in a bad way at all, however it does manage to show just how bad the so called kids adventure films of today really are. "The Goonies" requires kids to use their imagination and to pretend. No matter how many times you see this film it doesn't get old, I still want to be a "Goonie", it's for the child in all of us and I always feel nostalgic seeing it again. If you are going to watch this movie, do yourself a favour get it on DVD. Do not watch it on television the film is always cut to shreds and parts of it do not make sense, besides it's one you should really own. If only they still made films of this quality with this much magic.</fullReview>

Corey Feldman provides plenty of laughs as the mischievous Mouth (I loved the bit where he 'translates' Mikey's mother's instructions to the Spanish maid into Spanish). The rest of the group are colourful, with each one being made an individual. The late John Matuszak is great as the deformed Sloth who ultimately helps to save the day and the villainous Fratelli family are portrayed in a very funny light as well.The only really hateful villains are the country club crowd who want to tear down the Goonies' houses to build a golf course, which is why our group embark on their journey for buried treasure in the first place. The underground caverns and the various booby traps set by pirate One-Eyed Willy are very brilliantly done. There's also great music by Dave Grusin. I recommend THE GOONIES strongly. It's a great, fun movie.</fullReview>

I have seen the film about 50 times and I never get bored with it.The Goonies are a group of kids who are trying to save their homes from developers. They find a map in one of the kids attics and a hilarious and touching adventure follows, with an idiotic gangster family and dead pirates somehow in the middle of it all.One of my favourite characters is Mouth, one of The Goonies who as his name may suggest lets his mouth run away with him and lets slip some very funny bloopers.But the best character is Chuck an accident prone tail spinner who can eat anyone out of house and home. The truffle shuffle scene was one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ( I can do the truffle shuffle but choose not to). The scene with the blender was also hilarious.Sloth and his wiggling ears are also legendary. Sloth and Chuck make one of the best partnerships EVER.The adventure is exciting all the way through and it is very easy to watch. Some of the effects are rubbish but that just adds to the charm.Great stuff</fullReview>

However, as a child growing up it was a film I would see on the TV (usually around Christmas, when a lot of films were previewing) - and for some reason it would always be my luck to only grab the last hour or thirty minutes of the film.However, nearing the age of 7 years old, my dad set the timer for when it was on - he knew how much I wanted to see the whole episode! I watched it, at at 7 for a film, 9 years old. It became my favourite film ever.For me it just sums up childhood 'one big adventure' - now a fixture in my DVD collection, I could watch it every night of every week and never get boured.

Even though I was in Massachusetts and had no clue of any pirates had been there in the past 400 years, I was determined to find "One Eye" Willies treasure behind my house. Seeing this movie for the first time at the age of 8, I was one of millions of kids who were blown away by this Family action / comedy.A modern day fantasy that is still as good when it came out almost 20 years ago, the story of beating the odds, good verse evil, finding hope in the most unlikely of places, the under dogs winning the day, and the age old take of discovery is what Goonies is all about. An interesting cast which makes the movie, the story is an adventure of youth and exploration, even though they never leave their home state. A terrific movie for the entire family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching The Goonies countless times as a child &amp; I recently bought a DVD copy expecting that the film isn't actually as good as I remembered. How wrong I was!Basically ,&amp; I know its a clich, but they don't make movies like this anymore. Its a typical lads fantasy movie &amp; I'd put it up there with Rob Reiners Stand By Me (also released in 1985) as one of the greatest 'bonding' films ever made.Surprisingly it comes from the director of the classic horror film The Omen, but not surprising is that a certain Mr Spielberg has put his stamp all over the film. The cast are all likable characters - especially the sensitive Mikey, the loud Mouth, the inventive Data, the lovable Chunk (who could forget 'The Truffle Shuffle'!), the clumsy Fratelli family (especially the brilliant Anne Ramsay - now sadly deceased) &amp; the heroic Sloth ("Hey you guys!").Some of the actors have continued their success - Corey Feldman (Mouth) went on to the aforementioned Stand By Me &amp; Gremlins (then sadly made less successful films), Sean Astin (Mikey) has made himself immortal in the movies as he played Samwise in Peter Jackson's awesome Lord Of The Rings trilogy, Josh Brolin (Brad) has continued to work in films &amp; Martha Plimpton has gained critical acclaim for her theatre work.The movie has all you need for a couple of hours of pure escapism - a treasure map, an secret underground passage, booby traps, pirates and of course the good old "good vs evil".The Goonies has stood the test of time 20 years later. If you remember this film from your childhood I urge you to re-visit it - you won't be disappointed. A bone-fide movie classic!</fullReview>

This is definitely one of the best children's movies of the 1980's, next to "E.T. The Extraterrestrial".Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen was the most hilarious kid I had ever seen at this time. He kept me laughing thru the movie as well as everyone else in the theatre. I don't think I had ever laughed so hard in my life, especially when he did that belly shaking thing. What was it called ?

Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg did very well in making this a class act movie with highly supportive fans that could talk about this day and day. You will also laugh your head off at most of the characters like Jeff Cohen and the Chinese inventor kid. There are also memorable lines that are still talked about today. The Goonies is very impressive and you will have a very fun time watching it.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Find the child inside yourself! (not in a Gary Glitter sense)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is one of those brilliant little films that are best watched on a rainy sunday afternoon*The sense of adventure that Donner creates is brilliant (I would suspect that the insight into child psychology Spielberg has helped him along the way, however). The pacing of the film and its set-up is perfection - the children have seeminly no way to save their beloved homes (the most important place to yound adolescents) but their is a glimmer of hope with a fluke attic based discovery; and we've all, at some stage, gone snooping around in the attic looking for treasure (usually only finding our dad's secret porn stashes, sadly).The Fratellis are the best crime family ever created (after the Corleones) it really is as simple as that. Check out Ma Fratelli giving a young Sean Austin (Mikey) a glass of whisky, and when he looks on in shock, stating "It's wet ain't it!"Sloth is a living god, as is everyones favourite chuck-a-lunk Lawrence "Chunk". Fieldman shines as "Mouth".My only problem with the film is that it was not made with the intention of ageing well - its cleary an eighties film - which is no bad thing if you are a buff of the era, but may be hard to stomach if you're new to the film.A bit of a sleeper hit, and a modern classic. 7/10 Highly recommend it.*For imdb users in Africa and India this may not apply.</fullReview>

Whether it was Josh Brolin and his "older wiser talk" or Sean Astins "i love the adventure"...or Corey Feldmon a.k.a. Mouth and, his, well, mouth, there was always something to laugh at or feel some sort of emotion to...i love the fact that there is a film that can make me feel this way...the casting, and characters, and screenplay were excellent, that is why i rated this fun and adventurous movie at a 10...if you agree feel free to email me and talk with me about this great film of the 80's...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater during its original release and it has continued to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Whenever this film appears on television I find myself helpless to turn the channel or shutoff the TV. I later found out that my father was good friends with Curtis Hanson, who played Elgin Perkens (Troys Father). He gave me a few little in-depth stories about the parts of the movie he was involved in and I found it quite interesting. I have seen this movie countless times and I was very pleased when the DVD was released and there were previously deleted scenes added. I love having a film that you have loved for years and years and then a special release comes out with scenes that you had never scene before. Anyone who has not seen this movie should put it on the priority list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies is a perfect example of everything that is wrong with society. The title is perfect, as these kids are indeed Goons in every sense of the word.How can parents take their kids to see such a violent, harsh movie. When the Goonies go "wilding", and rob, beat, and terrorize the innocent townsfolk, well, call me horrified. I say that, because, I was, uh, horrified.The only thing about this movie that I liked was the previews, when the Soda Pop danced with the Popcorn. That was delightful! Indeed!Much like Faces of Death, and The Wayne Brady Show, Goonies is a bad influence for today's youth and should be banned worldwide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is 'The Goonies'? It's The Hardy Boys with Annie, The Breakfast Club, and Romancing the Stone thrown in.The most interesting thing is how Columbus' script handles the kids. Compared to the script for Home Alone, where Hughes treated an eight-year-old like an alienated teen, Columbus makes these kids into the archetypes we've been seeing all along--only slightly better than 'Gremlins'. There's the fat kid, the jock, the nerd/inventor, the braggart, the worrywart, and their feminine counterparts. This is more collective than his pedestrian work on the 'Harry Potter' movies.Since this is really Spielberg's movie, he is the most concerned about getting the right crew. As such, he brings along his better editor, Kahn, and the sound crew from Raiders. Furthermore, Steven gets a director known for self-play to manage everything and lets Donner organize the rest of the crew.Astin probably learned a few things about exploring for his later roles in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Feldman also took a few cues from this for both Stand by Me and Lost Boys--there's even the lardass spin-off. Davi and Pantoliano are Columbus' obvious inspiration for the Wet Bandits.Spielberg reuses material from his second 'Indiana Jones' movie including Ke Quan and the environment. The production design is Star Wars in detail, a Henson level of detail. The biggest problem rests in the photography. Nick McLean is one of the worst cinematographers ever and his work on Spaceballs and now TV, it's clear that he was never meant for cinematic images. Image if Spielberg had ringed Dean Cundey, Allen Daviau, or even Bill Butler into 'Goonies' instead. Even the finale, crucial for a kid/family film like this, is done in a humdrum and bored fashion.But this film is simple. It's filled with Spielberg's usual 80s symbolism, but none of the sentimentality of E.T. That's 'Goonies': a Star Wars story set in the a child's reality. That's the most interesting aspect. We also get the Donner in-reference. Is that great or what? Spielberg would try again with Hook.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this movie ever since I was 5 years old or younger. I used to watch it everytime I went to my uncle's house (he had it taped form the tv) It ended up getting so old from me playing it over and over again. Finally my parents bought it when i was about 12 yrs. old and my sisters and I played it at least once or twice a month. Christmas of 2002 my parents gave the DVD to me in my stocking and I cherish it!!! it's the best of all! I also have two Goonies shirts, and a Goonie patch. My favorite goonie is Mouth "Jerk Alert!" I read the script for the sequel to the Goonies and it sounds good but I'm kind of skeptical, I'm affraid it won't do the first movie justice. Well peace out everyone and remember... "Goonies never say die!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday night, I've watched "The Goonies" again, after more than 17 years, together with my 7 years old son. It was amazing to watch and see that this movie is still as exciting as before. We both loved to see it!Of course, it's visual effects cannot be compared to actual movies, but the script is fine, the actors performed very well and the result is really impressive.Sean Austin, which is actually performing "Sam" in "Lord of the Rings" series, was 12 years old when he performed Mikey in "The Goonies" and anyone who watch this movie will see that he was already a great actor at that age."The Goonies" is a very good movie about friendship, where several children will use a map to search for a treasure left by the famous pirate "One-eye Willy". The action is fast, the script (co-written by Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus) is very good, the actors performed very well and the Richard Donner's direction is almost perfect.It's certainly a very good entertainment for all your family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best kids film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every child dreams of finding treasure and in the Goonies they showed how a group of kids gets to actually do this. So many films aimed at kids are too cutesy and gloss over the more serious points in life. This film doesn't and has a realistic feel to it, maybe not in the actual events portrayed but in the feelings of the children in facing a family crisisWhen I was a kid this film scared me pretty good and its not silly like Scooby Doo or tosh like Inspector Gadget. More like Indiana Jones or Star wars. I'm 28 and I don't care who knows I still watch it!!!I thought the acting was good considering some of the complicated lines, Chunk I found very funny and he has some classic scenes in the film. The stereotypes are fun and are not done in a negative way, the bad guys are truly bad and played without overdoing the humour - we can still laugh at them and be frightened without going too far either wayI think this was destined to be a cult film because its not one of those forgettable easy to market films, the effort went into the script and the story telling instead. Theres not even any real hero's, just a bunch of everyday kids doing cool stuffI would recommend this film to anyone with children who don't get scared too easily and every adult, don't be boring and have some fun!Major Spoiler: I always noticed how they didn't get to keep all the treasure in the end, only a few jewels. I now realise that this is the way it should be</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic adventure tale that no kid should grow-up with out seeing. This is a quintessential fantasy adventure movie of the 80s. This is every child's dream! To go on a huge adventure, and find pirates and treasure, being the heroes in the end! Just a great flick.I firmly believe that every child 10 and up should probably see this movie. There is a little language, but if your child is 10, they have heard it before. I recently returned from the 25th anniversary of the film in Astoria, Oregon June 2010, and the Mayor Officially Declared June 7th, Goonies Day in Astoria. Over 2500 people traveled from all over the globe to meet cast, each other, watch the movie, etc.. it has endured the test of time, and people ranging 4-80 were in attendance. If you like coming of age/childhood adventure movies, this is hard not to like. 10 out of 10, my favorite movie.</fullReview>

In fact, it sold out and had to be moved to a larger screen to accomodate more people - and then it sold out again.Why? This film is timeless. Yes, the music holds it back and yes, it is a bit jumpy (the cinema print anyway) but there is nothing like this film and there will be nothig like this film. The only thing that comes remotely close is Indiana Jones. It is was and always will be original. No-one will ever top it.The Goonies. You know you love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goonies. I still don't know what a goonie means, but this film encompasses everything good about childhood. The film empowers boys as well as girls realistically, and with a fanastic bent. Especially, since recently, they discovered Confederate gold off the American coast worth over a hundred million dollars. This could only be accomplished with the boyhood fantasy of wanting to discover buried treasure. Who hasn't seen this movie ten times? This film has elevated itself from technical analysis to the level of "classic." On a level of Wizard of Oz-without the singing. The film has all the elements: a young boy falls in love with an older girl, a child prodigy who is fascinated with technology, classic gangster "ma" and bumbling stooges, the chubby kid, a beast with a heart of gold (who can say Baby Ruth after seeing this movie without pronouncing it gutterally), kids uniting for a common cause, and pirate treasure.Disney has a big hit with Pirates of the Carribean. But as that Led Zeppeling song goes: "All that glitters isn't gold."But this movie is a gold nugget. Watch it today and take a trip through childhood.</fullReview>

It is absolute magic, and a classic that will never be forgotten. See if you can pick which one is Sam Gamgee in Lord of the Rings! I wish there really was pirate ships and other buried treasure around the place, infact form tomorrow I am quitting my job and am going to come and explorer, all thanks to the Goonies. P.S.

		<fullReview>Certain films seem to evoke childhood memories and playfulness. It makes adults remember back to times when they were children and when they cared about things more important than what adults worry about. It seems that once humans reach a certain age they lose their childhood fantasies and immediately become adults; but "The Goonies" seems to bring some of that back, and tells us that instead of worrying about pointless things, we should worry about family, friends, and neighborhoods. Yes, neighborhoods. That's what "The Goonies" is about.You see, the story is about a small strand of houses, called "The Goon Docks," located off the ocean. But the houses are all going to be destroyed because none of the owners have enough money to keep them standing.And so a sad group of children, called "The Goonies," are depressed and...well...sad. Sean Astin (now seen as Samwise Gangee in "The Lord of the Rings") , Corey Feldman, and a bunch of others are determined to get enough money to keep their beloved homes. In the attic of Astin's home, they find an old treasure map detailing the route to the treasure of an old pirate. Many have tried to get the treasure. None have succeeded. And so the boys (and eventually, girls, of course), embark on a journey to find the treasure so they can keep the "Goon Docks."This film is like so many others from the eighties; "Gremlins" is a lot like it. The way the set decorations are, the way the special effects are...The end of the eighties really marked the fall of campy-looking sets; now we see tons of "realistic" sets that aren't nearly as fun depending on the genre of the film. Comedies like "The Goonies" not only have great sets, but also some great gags and great memories. It reminds one of when one was younger; the Goonies go on an adventure looking for treasure, and which one of us hasn't done that before? When hadn't we, as children, worried about things that meant so much to us (such as the Goonies' homes)?Yes, "The Goonies" may not be the greatest film to ever hit the streets, but it's pretty darn entertaining and a pretty nice ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an outstanding kids movie which has transcended film and and made a life of its own in the hearts of millions of kids that grew up in the eighties, myself one of them. Centering around a group of kids on the search for treasure to save their community, it manages to conjure up amazing feelings of youth and adventure when watched in hindsight, especially if you ever wanted to be 'Mikey' or 'Data' or 'Mouth' while playing with your childhood friends. I saw it recently at the cinema for the first time, after years of watching it on TV and video, with about 500 other like minded people my age who all had the same feelings i did. Although the print was pretty bad is was still the greatest cinema experience of my life. Admittedly, if you hadn't grown up with the film and all the things that go with it, then you might not love it as much watching it for the first time as an adult. But if you ever had a BMX, a tree house, or a NES, then you are in for a treat.A rumored sequel could be on the way, and although fans have reservations about it's faithfulness to the original, i know most couldn't resist another trip to Astoria. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such an entertaining film. The kids (who today, are no longer kids)really held it together. Sean Astin as the pubescent, not so healthy dreamer who fills his friends with hope, and Josh Brolin as his older brother, handsome even at that age, leading their friends in the quest of their young lives...to save their homes from the &lt;obligatory and hateful&gt; land baron and his vapid son. But the villans, especially Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, keep this movie moving along. Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey), evil and partial to her son, Francis (Joe Pantoliano)growls and sputters delightfully. Robert Davi, however, crooning Italian opera, made the biggest impression on me. This movie made me a big fan. His delivery, presence and comic badness coupled with that incredible singing voice and unforgetable face keeps me looking for his name in newly released films. Goonies was a wonderful introduction to Mr. Davi and, since Profiler is in reruns, I hope to see him in more featured roles.</fullReview>

Even today, over fifteen years later, The Goonies still stands in my mind as a monstrous monument to the depths of trashy, idiotic, lowest-common-denominator-appeal film-making. Hyperactive, annoying stage-school kids screaming their way through a sub-standard Indiana Jones scenario does not make for good entertainment. In fact, the producers, actors and everyone involved with this nauseating garbage should be hauled up before a Hollywood equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials for inflicting mass brain damage on an entire generation. Except maybe the Bangles, who contributed a half-decent song to the soundtrack, but I still can't bring myself to seek out the album. The cover would doubtless bring on a severe bout of eczema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A childhood classic. I grew up on the film, so I am biased towards it. I love each character, the musical score, and the story. The theme can be interpreted in several ways. Kids will love this movie. A magical adventure of a group of kids looking for one eyed willie's pirate ship treasures. This is the type of film you could watch at any time. It never grows old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if this is not the greatest film ever made, i dont know what i will do to myself. You can keep all your citizen kanes because when i watch a movie i am looking for 100% entertainment. And luckily enough this film provides 101% entertainment. I could talk about how much i love this film all day and how brilliant all the characters are. But the single greatest part of the film is the relationship between sloth and chunk. They both would be amazingly funny by themselves but pair them together and you have the single greatest comic duo on the face of the planet. How can you not laugh when they are declaring their love to each other or the lines which sloth comes out with, "hey you guys" for instance. But my favourite line is where chunk screams, "its a stiff". It still has me in stitches at the 100th viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goonies is my all-time favorite movie. I've seen it hundreds of times and I never get tired of it. It came out when I was 5 years old and I remember being so facinated by the adventure &amp; props, especially the pirate ship. I've had the video for some time now, and the only reason I got a DVD player was because they just put the Goonies out on DVD with the cut-scenes.This movie is what friendships are made of. That's the best thing about the movie, I think. What could be more fun &amp; exciting than an all-out adventure complete with pirate ships, booby traps, &amp; a treasure at the end? Going through it with your best friends!I'm 22 and this is still one of me &amp; my friends' favorite things to do- hang out, watch the Goonies &amp; recite every single word!</fullReview>

Best of all real sets!! A couple of bad blue screen shots and some other mistakes that can easily be over looked.DVD has a great commentary from the actors about 15 years after the film was made. Good to see them grown up and hear what it was like as they look back. They seemed to have fun pointing out mistakes, some of which I hadn't even noticed.If you grew up in the 80's and missed this movie run to your video store and check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone growing up in the 1980's, especially kids, this film is a great bit of nostalgia. I remember going to see it with my family back in 1985 and loving every minute of it. Even today as a film student I still enjoy it and somehow find the time to watch it at least twice a year. The story is good. The acting is okay, though the characters are quite memorable. Who can forget Data, Sloth, Chunk, Mouth, etc.? I know I can't. The music, especially the theme by Cyndi Lauper, is firmly set in the mid-80's which really adds to the nostolgic effect (I still have the 45!). The score is also good and I think it actually adds something to the feeling of the film. I would definately recommend this to anyone who was a kid in the early/mid 1980's. When I watch it I always feel like I've been taken back years to a whole different time and world. It really is a modern classic!</fullReview>

Donner and Spielberg put a lot of time and energy into this one, and it shows. What makes the film even better, at least for me, are the moments where it alludes to scenes cut from itself (the octopus, Mouth and Stef, etc.). The alternate version is even better than the original. I can only hope for a DVD for the movie. Go see it, and have a good time.</fullReview>

Sean Astin and all the others made the movie a wonderful treat to watch. I got my best friend into it. We both loved it so much that we began to write a sequel to it and almost (but not quite) succeeded. We'd still love to see a sequel made, but it looks doubtful since talk of one years before this died out almost immediately due to lack of interest from many cast members. It still is a classic kid's comedy. I've got the whole thing practically memorized too, Ash! Think they should have a 15-year anniversary re-release??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this as a kid, and being generally disappointed. I was just getting to the age when I had twigged that certain actors, or directors might mean a movie would be better than another. And one of the names I had grasped was Steven Speilberg. The fact Richard Donner (I also like) actually directed it passed me by at the time, but I think I can put the finger on my disappointment:1. Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark had already fundamentally upped my expectation of what movies could be. 2. Speilberg's Close Encounters, Raiders and ET had all been fantastic 3. I had heard of Gremlims and Jaws but was too young to see them (I know Spielberg didn't direct Gremlins); but heard they were also good (I have a different opinion of Gremlins now...) 4. I think I saw Back to the Future just before I saw Goonies, and I really liked that film - and credited it to Speilberg (again he didn't direct though!) 5. I hadn't heard of 1941... ;-)I was expecting either Fantasy or Sci-Fi, but what I got was a bunch of cardboard cut-out kids going on what appeared to me (as a child) a rather childish adventure (the fantastical element was fairly minimal). I did like Mikey, I didn't like Mouth (is Corey Feldmans top lip paralysed? it gets on my nerves for no good reason...), I did like Data (hey! I was a kid!), but didn't like Chunk (too stereotypical even for a kid): result, mixed.Did I like it? Yes, it had lots of good moments, but overall I felt disappointed that there wasn't more to it.Last time I saw it I was about 15 (on video), so my views may be much better now - especially in light of it's cult following, and a number of rave reviews on this board. I am curious to see Sean Astin again (now he is even more famous); but I suspect that it will still be rather average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the child minded only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine told me about this film a few days ago. I thought it sounded kind of childish. But because I know some of the actors and Spielberg produced it, I watched it. My friend told me it was a bit like Indiana Jones, so I was expecting a mixture of Spy Kids and Indie, which could be quiet good. But this was not the case.The film starts with some rather childish jokes, but I thought to myself, that this is a children's film. But then people started swearing and talking about drugs and sex, nothing too serious, but I wasn't expecting the `S' word. This made be wonder what the target age group for this film was. Of course there could also be censored versions of this film, but the one I saw was not.One of the children is Jonathan Ke Quan, who played a very similar part in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I found his Goonies Character extremely annoying. He has these gadgets, like a boxing glove on a spring attached to his chest, which seemed kind of stupid to me. If you find jokes like this funny then you may enjoy this film. If not, you probably shouldn't watch it.The film starts of rather quickly and the bad guys are soon introduced. One of them is Joe Pantoliano, from The Matrix and Memento. I liked his character in The Matrix and Memento, he seemed kind of smart and made a good bad guy. I thought he might be the same in The Goonies. No such luck, in the Gonnies he plays a really stupid bad guy with a wig that drops of, he reminded me of Daniel Stern in the Home Alone movies.The Story, which is by Spielberg who doesn't do that much writing, could have been better. It didn't seem interesting enough. And not that much really happens in Chris Columbuses Screenplay. I can't really remember much of the middle of the film, which normally means I either fell a sleep or I got really bored and started daydreaming. I had this problem with Gangs Of New York.At the end of the film, I felt that Sean Astin's character, Mikey should have been more developed. The story seemed to be mainly about him, but he didn't really have many lines. I suppose a child wouldn't really be bothered by this much. But a good children's film should be suitable for older people too. Or it wouldn't really be a Family Movie.I can't think of anything good to say about this movie, I didn't like it much. It wasn't all that bad though, I still found it slightly entertaining. But I enjoyed Spy Kids a lot more. I give this film 3 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Donner has always been known for making fast-paced and fun movies. Most people probably associate his name with the Lethal Weapon series. But whenever I hear his name, I always think of The Goonies.The Goonies is one of those movies that always brings out the kid in me. Everytime I watch it, I fall in love with it all over again. This isn't the usual teensploitation flick, filled with glamorous, ultra-cute teenagers with whom you can't relate. These are characters you can relate to. The kind you could swear lived right down the street from you. It's hard to not become attached to them and their circumstances. So when they fall head-first into the adventure of a lifetime, they take you along for the ride.The awesome thing about this movie is that you feel like a member of the group all the way thru the movie. You feel like one of "the goonies". All the way from the beginning to the end. It all starts when they find a mysterious treasure map in Mikey's (Sean Astin) attic. This then triggers a chain of events which eventually puts them into an adventure of Indiana Jones-esque proportions. As they dodge the many pitfalls and problems that come their way, you find yourself rooting for them, and almost feeling like you're a part of the action. Never will there be another movie as fun as this one.The acting in this movie is top notch, considering the majority of the actors and actresses were pre-teens at the time of filming. Like I said, these characters are everyday characters you swear were ripped straight from your childhood. Sean Astin is great as Mikey, a teen in his early, and awkward, pubescent years. He's kind of the all-round average guy, but is the glue that holds the group together, thus being the hero. Josh Brolin is great as his older brother, Brandon. He does everything you picture an older brother to do: picks on Mikey and his friends and acts like a toughguy, while at the same time adding some guidance and looks out for his younger bro. Chunk, my favorite character, is played brilliantly by Jeff Cohen. I never fail to laugh at him bumbling around and shooting his mouth off. Corey Feldman is in top form here as "Mouth", playing the part of the cool guy (as usual). Jonathan Ke Quan is hilarious as "Data", a child genius with all kinds of quirky little inventions to help his friends out along the way (yet not very skilled at using them just yet). Kerri Green is great in being the pretty face of the movie as Andrea ("Andy" for short), and is a possible love interest of Brandon. Martha Plimpton is good as Andy's friend, but doesn't have too many lines. She does provide good chemistry between her and Mouth, though, hinting at a possible relationship in the future. The Fratelli family is portrayed quite well by Davi, Pantoliano, and Ramsey. I'd say they do a sufficient job at being as scary as possible in their given roles as a family of hot-headed criminals out to find a stash of treasure, thus bumping heads with the kids and posing much of a threat.This movie might not carry the same worth with others as it does with me, given it's nostalgic value. So I must admit that my views may be a little biased. But, I feel that this film works on all levels at providing comedy, adventure, and thrills galore. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch, I HIGHLY recommend giving The Goonies a chance. I know very few people who have been disappointed with this movie, so I think it's definitely worth a shot. It's too hard not to fall in love with this move and it's characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was as good as it was. I rated this based on zero being the Paris Hilton video and 10 being The Goonies. ON this scale, this was most definitely a 10. I don't know what 5 would be on this scale. Some movie that is not the Paris Hilton porn or The Goonies, but is something else altogether such as Stephen King's IT. This movie could therefore not be a 5, as it is not Stephen King's IT. Much as it is not the Paris Hilton video. However this movie is The Goonies, so it is therefore rated a 10, as a ten is The Goonies. This movie had actors in it. On a scale of 1 to 10 for the actors, 1 being a completely different movie, and 10 being this movie, this movie is rated a 10 for the actors. I hope you found this helpful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Goonies: This is the ultimate crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So how can I explain why this remains as the ultimate crap? I thought "The Goonies" was supposed to be a great exciting kids-adventure, but this is a horrible thing from start to end. Everything in this film could be so much better. It is never exciting and never funny, even if it somehow tries to be funny with stupid jokes. The characters are empty all over and really uninspiring. You just want to stop watching. The end is stupid and without any kind of joy, the villains are not really menacing or frightening as I thought they would be, they are just dull. The film doesn't have the guts to take it self seriously any time. And I really hate irritating fat children in movies that just can eat and scream! If you want to experience proper 1980's adventure films you could see 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Stand by Me' instead.Richard Donner proved that he can direct entertainment with "The Omen" but "The Goonies" was a big mistake, with horrible bad uninspired direction - all the acting was worse than it could be and the film didn't have any atmosphere or mood at all. Spielberg and Columbus' script was also awful and should have been less dull. Maybe "The Goonies" had some potential to be a good adventure-movie but it failed at all points.Rating: 1 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat with amusement reading these ridiculous "reviews" on The Goonies. Ninety-nine percent of them written by people who saw it when they were five or eight and who are 80s children. Well, what a stinker it is. I've avoided it like the plague all these years, but now I've seen it and I'm here to tell you I almost threw my shoe through the TV. The "characters" are so unrelentingly stupid and irritating, the "script" is one bad sequence after another and loaded with some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a mainstream film. It is a career low for everyone, if you ask me. You know, I saw lots of movies when I was a kid (not in the 80s) and while I can think back with fondness on some of them, I'm also not living in my past - and I can recognize that while it may have been swell when I was five, while it may hold some nostalgia value, I can also recognize a stinker when I see one from my past.But that's the deal with 80s children - they don't grow up. Same with 90s and the 2000s. Nobody grows up - thirty is the new ten and the world is not a pretty place. The one redeeming feature of The Goonies is its Dave Grusin score, which is terrific. Simply put, one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen some doozies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Goonies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those 80's family films that probably gets talked about a lot, and I suppose rightly so, from writer Chris Columbus (Gremlins), producer and writer Steven Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Back to the Future), and director Richard Donner (The Omen, Superman, Lethal Weapon). Basically the neighbourhood of "Goon Docks" in Astoria, Oregon is threatened by developers who want to buy the area for a golf course, unless enough money is raised to stop the construction, Michael 'Mikey' (The Lord of the Rings' Sean Astin) and his friends Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen (Jeff Cohen), Clark 'Mouth' Devereaux (Stand by Me's Corey Feldman) and Richard 'Data' Wang (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's Jonathan Ke Quan) are hoping to find a way to stop it from happening. It is while rummaging through old stuff in the attic that Mikey finds what looks like the treasure map of the famous and legendary pirate One-Eyed Willie, he is sure that it leads to a hidden fortune, so he and his friends, who call themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest following this map in the hope of finding the valuable treasure to save the neighbourhood. Along the way though the Goonies get themselves in trouble getting too close to a family of fugitives, the Fratellis, the brothers Jake (Licence to Kill's Robert Davi) and Francis (Memento's Joe Pantoliano), Mama Fratelli (Throw Momma from the Train's Anne Ramsey), with Chunk ending up their hostage for a little while, however the hideous looking but much nicer member of the family, deformed brother Lotney 'Sloth' Fratelli (John Matuszak), helps him out. Mikey, Mouth and Data are eventually joined by Brand, as well as Andrea 'Andy' Carmichael (Kerri Green), and Stefanie 'Stef' Steinbrenner (Parenthood's Martha Plimpton), and they follow the map through a series of underground caverns, with many booby traps along the way to try and stop them in their tracks. They manage however to get through all the traps and reach the large pirate ship, getting on board Mikey is beaming to see the skeleton of One-Eyed Willie, the Fratellis try to steal the treasure for themselves, but with the help of Chunk and Sloth the Goonies manage to defeat the bad guys, and in the end they get a bunch of valuable jewels out of pocket in time before the signature for the construction is put down. Also starring Lupe Ontiveros as Rosalita, Mary Ellen Trainor as Mrs. Walsh, Keith Walker as Mr. Walsh, Charles McDaniel as Chunk's Father, Elaine Cohen McMahon as Chunk's Mother, Falling Down's Michael Paul Chan as Data's Father and Nick McLean as Mouth's Father. All the young leads are a likable bunch with their individual characteristics, Ramsey, Davi and Pantoliano are good exaggerated villains, the story is definitely inspired by the Raiders of the Lost Ark with all the effects and scenery to create a child friendly romp, an entertaining adventure. It was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film both enjoyable and Funny..when I saw it as a Kid...But i had a few complaintsThe first is....I found it was too childish (probably at Steven spielbergs insistence)......When I first saw it, I was 13...and even then I couldn't get into it....I expected a more Indiana jones like film...Or one with more mystery and swashbuckle....But obviously the filmmakers didnt want to upset the kiddies...so everything is toned right dooownnnnnn. Even the car chase scene at the start which I hoped was gonna be exciting...was played simply for laughs and nothing else. The kids are likable enough...But only Feldman seems to Really deliver.My other Complaint was Sean Astin...I got nothing against him as an Actor....Its Just his Character..... His Character is so weepy and sentimental and goodie two shoes, that he got on my nerves after a while...When he lectures the others about continuing to find the Gold...or Crying to his dad about how he felt they had Failed....All Im thinking is...SHUT UP sean, I dont give a damn, Spare me.I liked Robert davi and joe pantiolo as the baddies...they bring something to the Film... This Film does bring back a few Memories...But from Now on mr speilberg...Aim above kiddies level please...We adults like to enjoy the film tooI give it 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film that I use as a Litmus test to whether or not a person that I am talking with has good taste in movies. If they say they liked it, then I know we're going to have a difficult time picking out a movie to watch together. Now, I have to admit that I never saw this film as a kid. However, that does not mean that it gets a pass. A movie should be able to hold up, whatever stage of life the viewer is in. Some people have nostalgic memories associated with films like the Goonies, which confuses their judgment of the quality of the film. Just because it's something you grew up with does not mean it is something that other people should enjoy. There are several movies that I enjoyed as a kid that I still enjoy. Likewise, there are several movies that I did not like as a kid, that I still dislike. I'm sure that I would not like the Goonies now, even if I had seen it as a kid, because I'm sure I would not have liked it as a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Overrated - Childhood Memories make the rating of most people not the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This basically is 100 Minutes of people screaming at each other. It's hardly bearable. Really. There is almost not a single minute of normal volume talking in this movie. Screaming, shouting, screaming from beginning to the end.They have a cool adventure and the story is funny enough for children and some adults. This is why I give 5 stars and not 2.The music is terrible too. Slapstick Sound effects in some situation make it even worse.When this was released it might have been cool and appropriate and especially children don't care so much about the screaming, so this made it great for many who today still like the film because of their children-bias.But really, seen from the eyes of an adult, today in 2014? 5 Stars at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dashes of Spielberg magic, but the characters sorta annoy me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I've never bothered to watch "The Goonies", which according to most definitions of the term means I haven't had a childhood. Today I've finally made up for lost time, but unfortunately I was a tad disappointed. The story about a bunch of kids trying to trace a pirate's treasure has all the potential in the world, but all this old trilobite got out of this movie was a migraine. There's so much high-pitched screaming going on in this movie I've turned on my alarm clock just to relax a little. And generally I have nothing against stereotypes, but come on: 80% of the fat kid's lines is about food, the Asian kid invents gadgets, it's just sorta painful here. Why these characters get so much attention while the at the time still cool Corey Feldman barely gets to do anything is beyond me. The movie's obviously well-made and it definitely has some bright spots (Sloth!), but you just miss the heart-warming friendship between boys you saw in things like "Stand By Me" or "The Lost Boys". Not my cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could have been a whole lot better! It has everything going for it in the budget, scenery, special effects and costumes. The older actors are talented and fun. For some peculiar reason the director decided that the children should deliver their lines in the most annoying, raspingly loud voices they could muster. They never shut up for a moment in most of the scenes. Donner's "don't tell it, yell it!" direction makes for a fingernail's down the blackboard effect. The fat little kid, for whom there are not enough meals in the day, is particularly annoying - also because there isn't much funny about obesity, particularly in a 10 yr. old. I'd suggest viewers watching this keep the sound down. Overacted and crass.</fullReview>

My brother and I used to think the Goonies was so cool and their adventures were the very adventures we used to dream of at that age, it was only healthy after all to dream of such things and maybe write about it in your school essays, you know discovering a pirate ship and all.

		<fullReview>What is entertaining about this? I fail to understand what is so great about it. I am 13, I should be the target audience. I saw this movie during a kids film camp, and everybody thought it was so hilarious that.. what? Is it funny that a fat kid jiggles his fat and that there are kids cussing and whining. What really shocks me is that the kids in the camp loved this and hated "Spirited Away". IS MY GENERATION THAT STUPID?! I'm going to analyze this film a little further to prove my point, though:ACTING: The actors themselves aren't awful, although they become so annoying at times, you kind of wanted them to die. The one playing the kid with asthma was not captivating at all. He was bland and never showed any real emotion. The others weren't bad, and they probably did the best with the script they were given, which lead to my next point...SCRIPT: Oh yeah, this is where the movie gets awful. The script is just all around unoriginal. In 4th grade,(before I saw this film), I would write adventure stories that were at the same level of this. These stories I wrote were all, honestly: There's a group of kids they go on an adventure underground involving many obstacles like:balance beams, swinging axes, etc. they find treasure, then get out and return to normal life. Sound familiar? I mean, nothing original or interesting happens. I guess you could argue that the piano scene was O.K., but even that wasn't fantastic. The characters were beyond shallow, all bogged down to just stupid quirks. They have no depth and just come off as whiny. Don't believe me? Well, how much development do they have besides fat kid-wimpy, loves food,lies Asian kid-invents things main character- asthma, whispers teenage boy- works out other kid- tries to be cool, but is annoying. YOU NEED TO DEVELOP! but the one element of the movie that really pisses me off is the deformed brother that the villains were keeping in their basement. The fact that they could stoop that low to produce comedy is just horrendous. And what was funny about him? Was it funny that he couldn't talk properly and communicated through yelling? Was it funny that he was wearing a superman shirt? No, it's actually kind of sad, and I'm surprised a lot more people don't hate this movie for exploiting people born with physical deformities like that. They deserve as much respect as people, and this just cruelly makes fun of them.EFFECTS: The main reason I gave this film such a high rating is because the effects were really great. It wasn't beautiful, it was all very brown and gray, but I guess that isn't awful. That was at least pleasing to look at.Well, this is getting pretty long, so I think I'm going to stop. To summarize; while the special effects were great, that doesn't make up for undeveloped characters, a plain, boring script and just O.K. acting. I really, REALLY hate it, but if this is what appeals to you in a film,and it appeals to a lot of people, then just keep enjoying it. Just, don't ask to me to watch it with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXTREMELY crude for a kid's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry to inform that the Goonies were not good enough for me.I know this movie is famous and all, but it kinda grossed me out with the crudeness. I never saw this movie as a kid. I just saw it recently for the first time ever, and it wasn't the best childhood film ever-- sorry! I can't believe this movie is rated PG, it has some bad crudeness for a PG. But good points of the film I liked is the (slightly random) adventure and the development of the gaggle of kids, who are NOT perfect angels (if you thought that), none the less maybe that's why they are called the Goonies.PLOT: On verge of being kicked out of their neighborhood, a rag-tag group of kids randomly find a treasure map in their attic (I guess that's childhood-dreamish). But around that time a tedious family of criminal have their hearts set on the treasure too (oh joy). They set out for their excursion hoping to find riches so that they can pay the financier allowing them to say in their neighborhood. Soon, 3 teens join them as they delve deeper following the map while escaping the petty criminals. It actually has sorta an exciting atmosphere to it.CHARACTERS: Mikey,the protagonist is childish, simply and likable. His weird dialogue towards 1-eyed Willy really erked me. He's sorta clean. Data I liked, he was clever and funny, very clean most of the time. Mouth was kinda annoying but kinda sincere, but like a annoying toughboy. Chunk, he grew on me-- though I didn't like his use of profanity in his 1st scene. The infamous truffle-shuffle (I don't get th name) was kinda sad and pointless, many people said it was offensive to over-weight people (it gotta agree) but I guess it was used to force laughter out of children (I didn't laugh). I still just kinda liked Chunk though, he was pathetic and fun. Brand was nice (to his bro, that scene was good) and intelligent but his tough-guy rendo was typical and idiotic, his love interest with Andy grossed my out (she looked young). Andy herself was cute and smart, but her use as the sensual object erked me-- she was just a young girl, let her be one. Stef, I really liked her. She was awesome, with her geek's getup, she rocked! She was calm, pure, caring, passionate and panicked very little. Sloth scared me most of the time (always smiling) but he served well. The Fretelli were petty and demented-- singing spontaneously, trying to kill kids, and ultimately dull as hey were used as comical villains. That Mama Fretalli was wicked, not scary just sadistic. I felt sorry for the kind Roselita, a Latina housekeeper. I hated how Mouth made fun of her.The acting just about good enough, but still the kids seemed fake, being in a shallow cave with horrific booby-traps they should have been out their minds scared making it realistic, but it's a kid film (still can't believe it though). At least the kids had fun doing the movie.One scene in Mikey's house is the crudest, sexually horrible, unhumourous and unneeded. The kids cussing makes them lose innocence fast. Mikey's mom looks like she takes horrible care of her kids. There's a horrible scene where the younger kids bribe each other with porn (not a magazine fortunately, just something lesser). There's a gross scene with these men at the showers (upper torsos shown, fortunately) and a disgusting scene with a man at the restroom.In the end, everything gross ruins the film. Maybe you'll like the bad kids or not, I know crudeness can be expected from kids, but this is overdoing it. It would have been so much better without the crudeness!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, "The Goonies" is cool for pure entertainment value, but otherwise it's kinda lousy. This story of several Astoria kids hunting for long-lost treasure to keep from getting evicted isn't half-bad if you accept as a straight popcorn flick. But they really could have done without that whole "...we're on an adventure and it'll be ruined if we go up there with them..." sequence.Ah, and of course there's the octopus - or rather, there wasn't in the original movie, even though Richard "Data" Wang (Ke Huy Quan) mentioned it. I bet that when the movie first came out, people were wondering "What octopus?". Apparently, some TV versions include the octopus scene. When I saw "The Goonies" on Joe Bob Briggs's show "Monstervision", he explained that the octopus scene was edited out of the theatrical version.All in all, there's nothing particularly bad about this movie; just a few unnecessary scenes. We now may recognize Francis Fratelli as Joe Pantoliano, who co-starred in "The Matrix", "Memento" and "The Sopranos". Mama Fratelli was of course Anne Ramsey, aka Danny DeVito's mother in "Throw Momma from the Train". The kids were mostly brat-packers, so most of them seem to have disappeared since "The Goonies".It's weird to think. Richard Donner went from directing a "Gilligan's Island" episode, to "Superman", to "The Goonies", to "Lethal Weapon". The things that we see in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-remembered, but hardly a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen THE GOONIES when I grew up during the 1980s, I remember it fondly: a kind of Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew/Enid Blyton-style adventure put on the big screen, filled with excitement and danger and the kind of anything-goes mentality that made Spielberg films hits during that decade. Watching it now, as an adult, I'm slightly disappointed; the performances of a lot of the kids are shouty and grating rather than endearing, and despite the plentiful nods and jokes for the adults in the script, it just isn't as inventive as I recalled. In many ways this is simply an Indiana Jones film made specially for the kiddies.Still, there's plenty to love here, not least Richard Donner's focused direction and, of course, the hulking giant that is Sloth, who dominates all of his scenes. The villains are decent too: Robert Davi gets to show off some comic flair (and singing skills) but the real star is the irascible Anne Ramsey, who of course went on to greater fame in THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN. There's also undeniable charm in seeing familiar child stars of the era (Jonathan Ke Quan, Corey Feldman) alongside those who have become better known as adult actors (Sean Astin and Josh Brolin).The imaginative plot elements include treasure maps, pirate ships, deadly traps, dead bodies and criminal gangs, but it's the central bonding of the Goonies themselves that holds it all together and keeps it so watchable. Maybe this is no classic, but it's still a good time?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a big budget Steven Spielberg production the initial setup frugally takes place within one house, getting to know each kid's quirks and then, in the same house but upstairs, the ragged clan way-too-easily find a treasure map and the adventure begins: with a bicycle ride occurring in the course of a Cyndi Lauper song as "The Goonies" (never sure why they're called that) find another house where they spend the rest of the film: only underground where there are several mazy levels. Tons of bickering chatter, gratuitous product placement, hijinks-action and toilet humor make this flick, which could be retitled THE GARBAGE PALE OUTSIDERS VISIT THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, more suited for teens than children. Three villainous yet goofy thugs provide filler as they thwart the Gonnie's quest: which, despite the grandiose musical score, is really just a lot of running around. But the main problem isn't the plot - treasure hunts are always intriguing - but the Goonies themselves: it's never really clear why they're outcasts... or from what exactly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, here I have to face one particular phenomenon. The Goonies is said to be a very famous and important movie, almost as good as Stand By Me (as far as I've heard and as some folks state). However, I didn't actually like it that much. I mean, it was okay; I didn't loathe it or so, but it was never something special for me. Never. The actors are doing a nice job, you can't complain about that, and the story itself isn't even boring nor weak. What I didn't like was the odd malformed guy. I did neither like his character nor his physical appearance. He's so dumb, in my eyes. So, what do I make of The Goonies? It's oversubscribed and unrealistic, the characters are unidimensional and the plot is witty but surreal. However, it has some good and entertaining bits. Ke Quan portrays an interesting character and delivers funny performances. Something you should see once, but nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Adventure Film with One Magical Moment After Another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goonies, The (1985) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Steven Spielberg produced adventure film has a group of kids trying to help their parents out as a country club is about to bulldozer all of their houses. The only hope is to try and come up with a lot of money and all of this is going on as the kids find a treasure map and set out to try and locate a legendary riches hidden by an infamous pirate. THE GOONIES is certainly a kid's movie but it's so well-written, acted, directed and fun that no matter how old you are you're going to get sucked into the story and the adventure. This has long been a favorite of mine because I think the story by Spielberg and the screenplay by Chris Columbus really hit on the type of adventure that a child would have in their mind. Everyone has been a child and everyone remembers coming up with some vivid adventures in their head. Sometimes you'd get together with your friends and go off on these adventures and that's pretty much what this picture is. The kids are performed by Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton and Ke Huy Quan. All of them fit their stereotyped roles very well and they really come across as a real group of friends. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and the unforgettable Anne Ramsey play the bad guys chasing them. Together this is certainly one of the most memorable casts from the 80s and it's really amazing how well suited they all are for each other and they really add up to something special. The screenplay perfectly captures the fantasy/daydream side of a child's mind but it also delivers an extremely good adventure. Throughout the film there are a few nods to older adventure movies and you can't help but think the filmmakers probably had these same type of dreams when they were a kid and you can tell that there's a lot of love in the production. Another major plus is that the sets are so extremely well-done that you really feel as if you're in this dark, creepy cave. Being a "kids" movie from the 80s means there's a lot of stuff that would be a major no-no today including the constantly profanity, some mild sexuality and of course the dark and at times gruesome images. There are many scenes where the kids are in serious danger, which adds to some great suspense and it's one reason why the film never gets old. I certainly won't ruin the ending but it's quite moving as well. THE GOONIES is a classic example of an adventure and director Richard Donner does a terrific job bringing it to life. It's certainly one of those rare examples where in order for a film to work everything must have been in its proper place and that's exactly what this film is. It's certainly something special and something that it's doubtful anyone could capture that pure magic again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXTREMELY crude for a kid film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry to inform that the Goonies were not good enough for me.I know this movie is famous and all, but it kinda grossed me out with the crudeness. I never saw this movie as a kid. I just saw it recently for the first time ever, and it wasn't the best childhood film ever-- sorry! I can't believe this movie is rated PG, it has some bad crudeness for a PG. But good points of the film I liked is the (slightly random) adventure and the development of the gaggle of kids, who are NOT perfect angels (if you thought that), none the less maybe that's why they are called the Goonies.PLOT: On verge of being kicked out of their neighborhood, a rag-tag group of kids randomly find a treasure map in their attic (I guess that's childhood-dreamish). But around that time a tedious family of criminal have their hearts set on the treasure too (oh joy). They set out for their excursion hoping to find riches so that they can pay the financier allowing them to say in their neighborhood. Soon, 3 teens join them as they delve deeper following the map while escaping the petty criminals. It actually has sorta an exciting atmosphere to it.CHARACTERS: Mikey,the protagonist is childish, simply and likable. His weird dialogue towards 1-eyed Willy really erked me. He's sorta clean. Data I liked, he was clever and funny, very clean most of the time. Mouth was kinda annoying but kinda sincere, but like a annoying toughboy. Chunk, he grew on me-- though I didn't like his use of profanity in his 1st scene. The infamous truffle-shuffle (I don't get th name) was kinda sad and pointless, many people said it was offensive to over-weight people (it gotta agree) but I guess it was used to force laughter out of children (I didn't laugh). I still just kinda liked Chunk though, he was pathetic and fun. Brand was nice (to his bro, that scene was good) and intelligent but his tough-guy rendo was typical and idiotic, his love interest with Andy grossed my out (she looked young). Andy herself was cute and smart, but her use as the sensual object erked me-- she was just a young girl, let her be one. Stef, I really liked her. She was awesome, with her geek's getup, she rocked! She was calm, pure, caring, passionate and panicked very little. Sloth scared me most of the time (always smiling) but he served well. The Fretelli were petty and demented-- singing spontaneously, trying to kill kids, and ultimately dull as hey were used as comical villains. That Mama Fretalli was wicked, not scary just sadistic. I felt sorry for the kind Roselita, a Latina housekeeper. I hated how Mouth made fun of her.The acting just about good enough, but still the kids seemed fake, being in a shallow cave with horrific booby-traps they should have been out their minds scared making it realistic, but it's a kid film (still can't believe it though). At least the kids had fun doing the movie.One scene in Mikey's house is the crudest, sexually horrible, unhumourous and unneeded. The kids cussing makes them lose innocence fast. Mikey's mom looks like she takes horrible care of her kids. There's a horrible scene where the younger kids bribe each other with porn (not a magazine fortunately, just something lesser). There's a gross scene with these men at the showers (upper torsos shown, fortunately) and a disgusting scene with a man at the restroom.In the end, everything gross ruins the film. Maybe you'll like the bad kids or not, I know crudeness can be expected from kids, but this is overdoing it. It would have been so much better without the crudeness!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler alert: This film is awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goonies is a headscratcher to me. It was created by some of the best filmmakers in Hollywood, Directed by Richard Donner, Produced by Steven Spielberg, and written by Christopher Columbus. I love much of the work of all listed, but I find The Goonies is one of the worst studio movies ever made. It is the ultimate in Hollywood schlock. Some will likely accuse me of not liking it because I do not have a good imagination. I can only say I disagree. I would argue those who like it do not have a good sense of things that suck.Goonies is a never ending series of very loud, annoying and preposterous situations that will have you rolling your eyes more than a Felix the Cat clock. First and foremost, the continuous dialog and general noise in this movie is enough to make it a form of torture. The audio is pegged at 10 from the opening and never once lets up. Secondly, the gaps in reality: it's just a kids film you say? Movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars intelligently made a kids genre entertaining. Ditto to The Bad News Bears, Home Alone or anything Walt Disney Produced. This film bashes you over the head with every clich and impossible situation imaginable. The characters are all one dimensional and unimaginative, most all of them have an adult wit and a snappy response for every thing posed to them like a kid from a bad sitcom, and I cannot stress this enough, all of them talk nonstop, mostly simultaneously, for the entire film.I am puzzled that Goonies is in the IMDb Top 500. I honestly believe it deserves to be on the IMDb bottom 100. My guess is people who like it saw the film when they were young and relate it to happy, nostalgic times in their childhood. If that be the case, be prepared for a shocker when you discover how poorly it aged. In regards to its genre, it may be found inappropriate by some parents, though maybe not by today's standards. There is a lot of dirty language and disrespect to authority in general. I suppose some people think it's cute when kids cuss, are disrespectful to their parents and do what ever the they feel. I think it ruins the fun of a kid's movie. On a side note; The Goonies also teaches kids that crappy film making is expectable behavior. It is not.The tech specs are fine, even very good at times, and the locations dramatic, but the story is absolutely preposterous. Kids alternately acting like stupid kids and then like genius adults, inventing and executing ridiculously impossible solutions to their problems, which frequently make no sense at all, (down this hole must be the only way out of this basement - but then why did one kid just climb out a window?). And what was with director Richard Donner's perspective of reality? Kids are yelling when they need to whisper, yet still not being heard. A teen age jock is bound by a single rap around his arms with one of those stretchy chest exercise springs? That same jock is unwillingly dragged by a car because the driver is pushing down on his hand as he holds onto the car door? There are a bevy of Batman the TV series escape opportunities - if you are going to kill a kid, just push him into a pool of water and walk away, assuming he's dead for sure. In one scene a kid is paralyzed with horror as he awaits the reveal of a monster, then suddenly, for no apparent reason, forsakes said viewing and starts making out with his girl friend. I will give you that certain liberties can be taken both in film making, and especially with this genre, but surely SOMETHING has to make sense or you lose your audience. Right? Hmm, a famous saying of P.T. Barnum comes to mind. On second thought, forget everything I just said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic kids film that all also brings out the youngster in adults. You can't help but will them on, laugh at their banter and split your sides at the now legendary hufle-shuffle by the chubby kid in the film.A bunch of kids going off to search for lost treasure to help save their parents house which is being demolished for a corporate golf course is an ideal set up for childhood heroism and adventure. Spooky in parts it was said to be based on a real happening of the writer/director Steven Spielberg.  From start to finish it's an enjoyable ride with certain moral tendencies in parts and a bit of brotherly sentimentality that does it no harm. a true classic film of the eighties, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Astin is aimless as Michael in this sensitive adventure movie. The remaining cast is energetic. The costumes are trashy. One of the fair films in the genre, The Goonies introduces raw adventures. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow - pretty darn awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was about 15 when this thing came out. I never saw it, but over the years have heard good things and fond memories related to it. I decided to give it a shot - I tend to like these kid-venture movies from the 80s.Right away the red flags started popping up. Music by Danny Elfman. Oh no. That annoying staccato-strings and the cello trills splashed all over the place when something's supposed to be cutesy-funny. Oh the cringing right from the get go.That unbelievably annoying Asian kid from Indiana Jones (Mr Jones! Mr. Jones!). Oh no. Oh no.Back to the cutesy-funny. That's all this movie is - attempts at this type of entertainment that just fall flat.I could go on, but man I just hated this film. It was the Spielberg cutesy era that started with E.T., although E.T. was WAY better than this Goonies garbage. And why are they called The Goonies, anyway??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pirate ship sails away at the end."See this movie? This is my wish, my dream, and it didn't come true, so I'm taking it back! I'm taking it all back!!!" Corey Feldman's acting in this movie is so horrendous that he was never seen or heard from again. Last heard from in the Surreal Life (w/ MC Hammer). Hammer Time.This movie makes me sick and want to never live again. Steven Spielberg should have went bankrupt, and fat people around the world should unite against this hateful movie which makes everyone do the truffle shuffle for years to come. Every fat kid knows the shame and pain of the truffle shuffle!Die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still find it impossible to believe that some people consider this to be "the movie of their childhood". I saw it as totally mean-spirited (especially with the Spanish-only speaking au pair: NO kids movie should allow kids to get away with tricking someone into thinking a house is loaded with sundry drugs/sexual torture devices that do not exist).Whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unspeakably vile-everything that's nauseating about Spielberg films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like hackneyed,inspiration-free plots straight out of best-forgotten children's fiction featuring a gaggle of unlovely,shrieking,white-bread American Kids boasting all the charm of a waterspout at a sewage farm, this is surely the film for you. Me,I'd rather watch somebody else watch paint dry. Everything that repels me about Spielberg is in this repugnant waste of celluloid - the cutesy sentimentalised, middle-American vision of childhood, the corny "humour", the utter predictability, but more than anything the incessant screaming and shrieking by the fat-faced,horrid,horrid little kids,who,in a more enlightened age would've been slaughtered at birth. Anyone who really appreciates cinema - both populist AND serious should rightly reject cynical junk like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst I've ever watched! About every other sentence had either swearing, using God's name in vain, jokes insinuating something bad, or disrespect to each other. The basic plot by itself was not bad; the underground treasure-hunt was an interesting idea, but I advise everyone that it is not worth watching, and it should definitely not be rated PG or labeled a "Family" movie! I didn't feel like smiling at all throughout the whole thing, and I'm ashamed to say that I watched it all!</fullReview>
