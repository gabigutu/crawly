		<shortDescription>Cult Classic Tribute to Western Clichés...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1985, the movie 'western' was a genre long dormant, with film critics quick to point out that audiences had become far too 'sophisticated' for old-fashioned "shoot-'em-ups". Two film makers decided to test the waters, however; Clint Eastwood, reviving an older version of his "Man with No Name", directed and starred in his SHANE homage, PALE RIDER; and Lawrence Kasdan, fresh from the huge success of THE BIG CHILL, fulfilled his life-long dream to make a western, with SILVERADO. Neither film was successful at the box office, and pundits predicted they would soon be forgotten...but a new force in the movie industry was emerging, video rentals, and SILVERADO, with it's spectacular action sequences, charismatic heroes, and sweeping, unforgettable music score (by Bruce Broughton), was an unexpected and overwhelming hit, drawing Hollywood's attention to the new market, and lifting the film to the near-classic cult status it enjoys today.While PALE RIDER would focus on Clint Eastwood's continuing demythologizing of the West (which would culminate in 1992's UNFORGIVEN), SILVERADO embraces all the 'classic' Western clichés, serving them up with such exuberance that they seem 'fresh'. The story of four likable 'shootists' of nearly superhuman skills, bonding, and ultimately taking on a corrupt sheriff and his brutal gang of deputies in the town of Silverado, trots out one traditional element after another, from the classic 'bushwhack' (with a John Ford 'Doorway Framing' homage shot) to the 'pretty widow' in a wagon train; from the 'saloonkeeper with a heart of gold' to the 'crooked gambler with a concealed weapon'...and even climaxes with that most traditional of finales, as two ex-partners face off on a dusty street in an old-fashioned Western shootout.The four leads couldn't have been cast more perfectly; Scott Glenn channels Gary Cooper as a laconic cowboy fresh from an undeserved 5-year prison stretch; Kevin Kline exudes his signature charm as an ex-gang member whose life changed because of "a dog"; Danny Glover is warm and reassuring as a man moving west from Chicago to help his family, armed with a legendary Henry rifle; and, best of all, young Kevin Costner, in his breakout performance, is irresistible, wild and acrobatic, as Glenn's ever-optimistic, carefree younger brother, a part Kasdan wrote specifically for the actor, after his scenes were cut from THE BIG CHILL.The supporting cast is equally superb, with standout performances by giant Brian Dennehy, John Cleese (as a sheriff who knows 'where' his jurisdiction ends), Jeff Goldblum, Linda Hunt, James Gammon ("You led a posse to my best hide-out??"), Jeff Fahey, and, in a wonderful if brief role, breathtaking Rosanna Arquette, as the widow courted by both Kline and Glenn. With a cast THIS good, it is remarkable that the film had to 'go to video' to achieve success!The final line of SILVERADO, "We'll be back!", shouted by Costner as he and Glenn ride 'into the sunset', has had countless fans wishing that a follow-up movie had been made (a 1999 nationwide video poll chose SILVERADO as the film "Most Deserving of a Sequel"), but time has, sadly, eliminated that possibility. The film that 'failed' when released, in a genre that 'experts' considered passé, is, after nearly 20 years, still winning new fans.As Kevin Kline and Linda Hunt say, as a toast: "Here's to the good stuff...May it last a long time!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silverado is damn good fun. Being a small fan of the Western genre, I felt this was the most refreshing one I've seen in a while. The genre had pretty much died, but came back in Silverado, and it felt so fresh.The plot is simple and cliche, I think it's paying homage to the classics. It sticks within the Western boundary and does its thing.The cast is pretty good, and well known, but in 1985, these actors were just Hollywood virgins. I was surprised by John Cleese, he stuck out like a sore thumb, but I enjoyed his performance. You have Costner hamming it up, and Jeff Goldblum was cool. Scott Glenn was probably the best. Hell, Glover was pretty good, too.The direction is wonderful as is the editing, the film moves along at a decent pace. I wish Lawrence was a more prominent director, he deserves more success.The film score is very nice, fits the film perfectly.Overall, one of the best Westerns in the last 25 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, so much that I finally got tired of renting it and bought a copy. I tell anyone who asks that it's "...the western for 12-year-old boys of all ages." I'd guess that women would enjoy it also, if for no other reason than the superb male cast. I can't think of a film which has a cast with greater depth. I love the humor woven through the episodes of action and buddyhood, and nearly fell out of my seat laughing when John Cleese first appeared on screen. His first line is an all-time great, right up there with Tommy Lee Jones' "My my, what a mess" in The Fugitive (I won't quote it, in case you haven't seen the film). If you want to be thoroughly entertained for a couple of hours, and don't require powerful social import in your viewing choices, I'd recommend Silverado strongly. Actually, the relationship of Danny Glover to the main protagonists IS socially important, so enjoy that too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That one line from Jake (Kevin Costner) as he, Paden (Kevin Kline), Emmett (Scott Glenn), and Mal (Danny Glover) are riding into town for the last battle against a corrupt sheriff (Brian Dennehy) exemplifies everything that is great about 'Silverado'. It's a high-spirited adventure that is fun, does not take itself too seriously (well, maybe a little), and cheerfully reenacts Western clichés. It's the kind of movie where you can tell the actors had fun making it, and you have fun too.The acting is uniformly excellent. Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, and Danny Glover all bring quiet dignity as well as low-key humor to their roles, but it's Kevin Costner who impressed me the most. As Glenn's cocky young brother, Costner doesn't even bother to contain his glee at being in a Western. He gives the most fun performance in the movie, and it's good to see a younger Costner not taking himself nearly as seriously as he does now. The supporting cast has some nice players: John Cleese shows up as a fair-minded sheriff who seems to have walked over from a Monty Python skit; Academy Award-winner Linda Hunt ('The Year Of Living Dangerously') steals scenes as a strong-willed bar owner who Kevin Kline befriends; and Brian Dennehy is thoroughly slimy as the villain.The action is fun, and director Lawrence Kasdan shows a gift for this material (granted, he was the person who wrote 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'), and the screenplay (also by Kasdan) is joyous in the way it resurrects the Western. The movie also has one of the best action scores I've ever heard by Bruce Broughton, and I was humming the title theme as the movie concluded.'Silverado' is a shining example of the Western genre, and it stands as one of the greatest pure entertainment Westerns ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Silverado" carries us out into the overpowering grandeur of the American West...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the cruel twists that sometimes appears in the showdown is the spectacle friend facing friend at opposite ends of a gun? Kline faces his friend and fellow lawman Dennehy? And the two come into direct conflict? They know that the only true test can be when one outdraws and kills the other? The inexorable outcome is a tense showdown? With such equal abilities a split second is the difference between life and death? The two friends square up and draw in the same instant and simultaneously? Kline is surprisingly effective as the cowboy with a troubled past and Dennehy, as Sheriff Cobb, generates a palpable menace? Scott Glenn is a professional gunslinger, not an angel or a traditional 'goodie' by any means but a man with a certain honor and nobility? His life is a series of confrontations? He plans to start life over in California with his brother Jake but, as ever, there are always punks who wants to take him down?Glenn does not have the screen presence of some of the other characters of the film, but the action-oriented films ideally suited him?Kevin Costner is charismatic as the sympathetic young hotshot gunslinger, soft at heart? He measures his self by his fancy double gun belt? Wearing two guns, he kills two armed guys in a couple of seconds with two shots? one bursts from each pearl-handled gun?and he didn't even aim?Danny Glover must overcome the racism of Turley to find the 'baddies' who killed his old father and wounded his sister? No doubt racism is rampant in this part of the country? The film succeeded in introducing a strong black character with a look of high expectation on his face?Villains in Lawrence Kasdan's "Silverado" are all quite good? Ray Baker (Ethan McKendrick) is totally without moral redemption whose job it is to run settlers off their homesteads? John Cleese, is the nasty sheriff (Langston) dressed rather elegantly in suit and bowler... Jeff Goldblum remembers me Lee Van Cleef in a scene from "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral". In this scene, Cleef prepares himself to kill Kirk Douglas by a small gun hidden in his left boot? Goldblum, in "Silverado" lifts his pant leg, at the poker table, and reveals the handle of a long knife secreted in his boot?Rosanna Arquette's short scenes in the movie look to be going to a romantic relationship involving her and the two heroes (Kline and Glenn) but nothing ever occurs? Even Lynn Whitfield as Glover's sister has so little dialogue and screen time that she doesn't emerge well in her true character? Linda Hunt makes her best as Stella, the 'Midnight Star' in a velvet dress, who runs the local saloon? Filmed on ravishing locations around New Mexico, "Silverado" is so good it will appeal to you even if you hate the genre? It is filled with challenge, and excitement? It catches the perfect blue sky above the orange desert and celebrates the beauty of wagon trains moving through pretty, rolling country? splashing noisily across the river? It exhibits expansive saloons busy with gamblers, drinkers, and lovely brightly-dressed girls... It shows fantastic shootouts, ambushes, jail breaks, outlaw hideouts, bar fights, and cattle stampede?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertainng, Underrated Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a very entertaining western, it's hard to top this one. It's fairly long at 134 minutes, but the deep cast and always-interesting story make the time fly by.The first half of the film is about as good as it gets but two climactic scenes at the end get a little too carried away with the "Rambo" mentality of good guys not getting shot when they should have, etc. But, overall, it's so good it is still very highly-recommended. Among the "lists" you see on this website's message boards and elsewhere, you rarely see this movie mentioned among top westerns and that is a huge oversight.There are four main "good guys" that are played by well-known actors: Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover. I especially liked Kline as "Paden" with his gentlemanly manner about him and Glenn's voice always makes him interesting. Costner is so young looking he almost looks like a teenager.Brian Dennehy, as the villainous "Sheriff Cobb," is verbally restrained in here, which was nice to hear, for a change but he's still intense and fascinating. (This movie marked the 10,000th time Hollywood made a lawman the villain since the 1960s).The story is fun, a straight cowboy movie with no romances or gratuitous sex scenes thrown in and has the usual beautiful western scenery and photography. The only problem was the sound. The soundtrack is so loud so have to crank up your center speaker to hear the dialog over the music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all-star cast makes SILVERADO one of the most fun movies I've ever see. Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner, Danny Glover, Patricia Arquette, Brian Dennehy, Jeff Fahey, Jeff Goldblum, John Cleese, and many more populate this well-paced wild west adventure about friendship, loyalty, and justice. With the exception of Indians, this film features just about every western element in existence. Director Lawrence Kasdan gets the most out of everything: the wide open spaces, the sleepy little western towns, and Bruce Broughton's rousing western-flavored score. It sometimes seems like the movie tried to pack too much in, but it's handled quite well by someone who obviously knows how to make an entertaining western. The climax is great, with at least three different showdowns going on at once. It's a shame the rumored (and actually scripted five years later) sequel was never made, and it probably never will be, because I wouldn't mind seeing what these characters are up to years after this fun-filled adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There shoulda been a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two reasons I say there should have been a sequel: One is that, simply, this was so great, so nearly perfect that it deserved and deserves follow-up.From largest role to smallest (and I don't mean Linda Hunt), the acting was superlative ... and here I have to pause to say it took several viewings for me to finally admit that, yes, even Kevin Costner, whom I generally and thoroughly dislike, was darn good as a cowboy.I saw this first in a theater, in Hollywood, with people from the industry, and absolutely LOVED it ... except for Kevin Costner.I was in awe of the script, of the acting, of the photography, of ... well, of everything ... except Kevin Costner.Well, I watched it recently on Turner Classic Movies and, reluctantly, decided it was just prejudice, however deserved, and in truth Costner really made a very good cowboy.There is a little secret here I won't completely divulge: Watch how actors mount their horses, and you'll see if they really know western riding and, for that matter, if the director knows his business.One of the actors deserving special praise is Brian Dennehy. As far as I am concerned, he can do no wrong. He is one of the very best actors in the business during the last 20 or 30 years, just an absolutely fabulous talent.Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised, but even Jeff Goldblum was great in this role. Oh, I know he's good, but I would have thought, and did think, that a western setting would find him out of place. Wrong.Sheb Wooley has a small part and it was great to see him in what turned out to be one of his last roles. He, of course, was right at home.Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, and Danny Glover also looked right at home, as if they had been born making westerns.Linda Hunt, another actor who can seemingly do no wrong, was in another movie this same year, 1985, the terribly unfairly ignored "Eleni," and it and "Silverado" both were much better than the movie that carried nearly all the awards, and which I won't name here.That other film might have deserved the Oscar for its score, but even the score of "Silverado" was first class and would have got my vote if I were allowed to cast a ballot. Bruce Broughton, who has scored mostly for television, looked to be on the way to picking up the mantle of Elmer Bernstein, and I even bought the recorded score -- at retail rates! Which I never do. It is excellent music."Silverado" is an almost perfect movie.Oh, and the second reason there shoulda been a sequel: The last words shouted by the Kevin Costner character. Watch this movie and listen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westerns are hard to come by these days so make the most of this; it's a good one. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a spoof but it certainly doesn't take itself too seriously,best not to worry about trying to follow the plot just go along with the roller coaster ride. There's lots of hard riding, fancy shooting and athleticism by our worthy heroes as they face off with the usually overweight and constantly smiling villains who don't quite twirl their moustaches but come close. The heroine is rather insipid but this is an action picture and the romance doesn't get in the way too much. It all goes on a little too long but there's lots of fun to be had along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not innovative enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the reviews say _Silverado_ broke new ground for the Western genre, but I would argue that while it was undoubtedly good escapist fun, it was more derivative than innovative.Sure, the conversations often seem much more natural than those from other Westerns, and indeed most of the characters are drawn with more dimensions intact, but the entire script could have been pulled together by pulling scenes from a bag full of ideas from other movies. Not to mention the locations, which I could have sworn I recognized from films like _The Big Country_ and anything by John Ford.For example, Brian Dennehy did a fine job, but you could tell who his character was just by the fact that Dennehy was cast in the role. Many of his characters share the traits of Sheriff Cobb (more than this, I won't say here).I have to say that as a firm non-fan of Kevin Costner, even I have to admit he did fine here as well... as did all the lead actors. Their careers since _Silverado_ have demonstrated that this was an unusually gifted ensemble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Compendium of Stock Clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the mid-eighties received opinion in the movie industry was that the Western was dead and buried. Although opinions differed as to the precise cause of death, it was generally agreed that the final nail in the coffin was the failure of Michael Cimino's massive "Heaven's Gate".Two men dared to defy received opinion; Clint Eastwood and Lawrence Kasdan.That Eastwood should stand out against the tide was perhaps unsurprising; he had after all, both starred in and directed some iconic Westerns during the genre's last hurrah in the late sixties and early seventies. That Kasdan should have done so is more of a surprise. In 1985 he was a rising young director who had already made two successful films, the steamy neo-noir thriller "Body Heat" and "The Big Chill", a psychological drama about a group of sixties radicals trying to cope with the more conservative climate of the eighties. It was therefore perhaps a surprise that he should choose a traditional Western as his third film.The film tells the story of four cowboys- Emmett, Paden, Jake (Emmett's brother) and Mal- who travel to the town of Silverado, where they help free the town from the grip of a ruthless rancher and his corrupt sheriff. Anyone familiar with the Western genre will realise that that is not exactly an original plot- it goes back at least as far as something like "Dodge City" from the late thirties, and probably much further- but in fact the storyline is more complex than that brief summary would suggest, with each of the four being given a back-story. All four have good reason to want revenge against the rancher, McKendrick.In the sixties and early seventies there had been a trend towards "revisionist" Westerns, films like Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" or Altman's "McCabe and Mrs Miller", which reacted against traditional portrayals of the Old West and tried to deglamorise it or debunk its mythology. Like all revolutions, however, this one gave rise to a counter-revolution, in this case films which quite defiantly celebrated the heroic Legend of the West. Most of John Wayne's later Westerns, such as "True Grit" or "The Cowboys" can be seen as anti-revisionist in this sense, and "Silverado" is another example. Kasdan was setting out to celebrate, not call into question, traditional ideas of the West; his is a West where the heroes are heroic, the villains villainous and the men in the metaphorical white hats always come out on top.Most of the cast play their parts well, including the two Kevins, Costner and Kline, as the brothers Paden and Jake, Brian Dennehy as the villainous sheriff and Danny Glover as the black cowboy Mal. (The presence of a black cowboy is one of the few things to set the film apart from old-time Westerns, which were normally made on the mistaken assumption that there were no African-Americans living west of the Mississippi). Scott Glenn, however, is rather dull as Emmett, and former Python John Cleese is horribly miscast as another sheriff, whom he plays as an upper-class Englishman. This is not necessarily inaccurate- doubtless there were English immigrants in the West- but Cleese's style of acting has always been more suited to comedy than to serious drama.The main problem with the film is that Kasdan does not really succeed in bringing anything new to the Western genre in the way in which one of his stars, Kevin Costner, was to succeed in doing with "Dances with Wolves" a few years later- or indeed as he himself was to do in his next Western, "Wyatt Earp", which also starred Costner. The other well-known Western from this period, Eastwood's "Pale Rider" is not particularly original either; in many ways it is an unacknowledged remake of "Shane". It is, however, a handsome, well-made film with an iconic performance from Eastwood himself as the mysterious, possibly supernatural, Preacher."Pale Rider" may recycle one or two well-worn situations, but "Silverado" seems to be a compendium of nearly every stock cliché from the previous fifty years of making Westerns- the villainous rancher, the equally villainous lawman, the wagon train, the cattle stampede, the man wrongly accused of murder, the man seeking revenge for the murder of his father, the final climactic shoot-out in the main street of the town. Only the cavalry and the Indians are missing. Twelve years earlier Mel Brooks had done this sort of thing for laughs in "Blazing Saddles"; Kasdan seems to be expecting us to take it seriously. He may have been hoping to reverse the decline of the Western, but unfortunately "Silverado" is a film which unconsciously reveals one of the reasons for that decline, namely that so many Westerns had been made that it became difficult to say anything about the West that had not already been said. Kasdan's next film, "The Accidental Tourist", was to be much better. 5/10</fullReview>

Even the performances, are well-done, that only add to it's booty.'Silverado' depicts a chance encounter between a group of cowboys who travel to the town of Silverado, where they thwart the plans of a rancher and a corrupt sheriff.Though the entire concept of the Good challenging the Evil, has been told on celluloid a dozen of times, 'Silverado', however, manages to convince it's viewer, thanks to it's interesting screenplay. Lawrence &amp; Mark Kasdan's Screenplay is nice, and plays it safe. The Action Sequences are very well shot, while the Cinematography is good. Editing &amp; Art Design deserve a mention.Performance-Wise: Kevin Kline is good. Scott Glenn is efficient. Kevin Costner &amp; Danny Glover are in form. Jeff Goldblum, Linda Hunt, Rosanna Arquette &amp; John Cleese lend very good support. Brian Dennehy is excellent as the corrupt sheriff.On the whole, 'Silverado' succeeds by entertaining it's viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a "classic western" by a long shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a shame that Mr. Kasdan couldn't repeat the excellent writing and story he had with Body Heat. In my opinion, in no was is this even close to "a classic western". This kind of sham is likely what did westerns in after all. John Ford, Howard Hawks, Henry Hathaway and others who really knew how to make westerns must have spun in their graves with this piece of stuff came out. Kasdan manages to lift/copy many classic elements from really great westerns: an over-the drivers shoulder shot from inside a covered wagon, from Hawks Red River, the door frame shot near the beginning from Ford's The Searchers, and the line "Start the ball" near the end from Peckinpah's Ride the High Country, just to name three. The cast, most of whom are quite good, never really gets to shine, having to constantly gun down so many others. The number and consistency of killings is mind-numbing and even boring after two plus hours. It's like a cartoon. Apparently there were an almost endless supply of villains to be killed. And also apparently, said villains couldn't shoot worth a hoot, hardly ever hitting or even coming close to the heroes. If the old west was really like this, no one would have survived. Everyone would have been killed. In summary, Silverado is a weak story, of nearly continuous episodes of killings and violence, too infrequently punctuated with dialog or any meaningful exposition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie scene can become a cliché, but a cliché can't become a good movie scene. Not unless it's "Airplane," and this isn't, it's "Silverado," director Lawrence Kasdan's heartfelt but cluttered Valentine to the Western.Heading west, reformed outlaws Emmett (Scott Glenn) and Paden (Kevin Kline) become a band, first by springing Emmett's wild brother Jake (Kevin Costner), then by getting saved from a posse by Mal (Danny Glover), crack shot with a Henry rifle. Then it's off to the beckoning town of Silverado, where Paden finds the bar of his dreams while the others are reunited with family. All is great - until trouble rides in."There's nothing' wrong with the land," says Emmett's sister Kate (Patricia Gaul), "it's just some of the people." That goes for Silverado the movie, too. Kasdan was coming off a bumper crop of hits as screenwriter and director, and thus had the ability to do whatever he wanted and work with whoever he wanted in 1985. He had some trouble cutting down on the scope of his ambition. "Silverado" is a big sprawling epic of a western with one of the most eclectic casts ever brought together. Kasdan and his co-writer, brother Mark, didn't know what to do with what they had, and it shows.Rosanna Arquette is the most obvious casualty, playing a homesteader who floats around the edges of the story. Kasdan admits much of the point of her character was lost on the cutting-room floor. But even parts that made the final cut seem uneven and sketchy. Linda Hunt won an Oscar just before this was made, but she doesn't seem to have any purpose in the story except to trade rueful japes with Kline playing a bar matron with a good heart. Jeff Goldblum drifts in as a gambler, like Kline and Gaul a member of the cast of Kasdan's last hit "The Big Chill." When he played a cowboy in "Buckaroo Banzai," it was supposed to be a joke, but here it's for real, only it isn't as Goldblum never finds a character who serves no point anyway. Glover just glowers lifelessly about "what ain't right." Even Kline, a favorite of mine, feels shallow and flat here. Wearing a beard and duster don't make you a cowboy.The bad guys come off even worse. Brian Dennehy is their leader, Cobb, who smiles wryly in that Dennehy way and never kicks it into the next gear. He's still got that wry smile on when he faces down old friend Paden at the end. His gang lacks any sense of motivation or personality. "Why are they doing this?" someone asks, only to be answered: "Because they enjoy it." That's not enough to go on here.The editing is atrocious. Action scenes lack spatial reality. Less than a minute after some bad guys appear out of nowhere to ambush Emmett, Mal pops out of nowhere to ambush them. A few seconds after we see Jake riding out after some villains, he's in a bar getting into a fight over a girl. Kasdan shot too much footage, and without any organic flow to begin with, the result is a hazy mess.So what did I like? Costner surprisingly plays a goofball to good effect, and Glenn does nice work in the lead Cooper-Wayne role. The opening scenes, of him and Paden finding each other and springing Jake, have a nice flow to them. John Cleese is another example of stunt casting here, only it pays off as Cleese finds a nice blend of humor and menace playing a lawman who's not a bad guy, just narrow and selfish.But then "Silverado" descends into cliché, bouncing from rustlers' hideout to stampede to showdown in mechanical fashion. It never bores you completely; its desire to entertain is palpable throughout, but it never rises above predictability."What a waste," Dennehy says at the end. I couldn't agree more.</fullReview>

Furthermore , this magnificent Western pits stubborn gunslinger and a corrupt sheriff , as ongoing adversaries , both of whom carry out an exciting final duel and bringing peace to fateful town.Impressive , sprawling and big-budgeted Western with action , adventure , cattle stampede , thrills , energetic drama , spectacular scenarios and interesting message about peace and friendship . All of them abound in this interesting action Western . Spectacular images as when the four friends ride side by side to clean up the town of Silverado . Outstanding acting from Kevin Kline as ex-gunfighter forced to take sides in battle , Kevin Costner also stands out as quick-tempered cowboy and Jeff Goldblum as a slick gambler. Special mention to Linda Hunt as the saloon-bar queen and Danny Glover as a upright black-cowboy who seeks vengeance . Brief appearances from John Cleese as Sheriff , James Gammon as bandit and Jeff Fahey as gunslinger . Wonderful camera work in Super Techniscope by John Bailey who photographs marvelously the colorful outdoors and interior . Classic and rousing musical score by Bruce Broughton , one of the best from Western's history and deservedly nominated Academy Award , though wrongly didn't won . This marvelous Western , as long as epic , has become a classic , being stunningly and finely crafted directed by Lawrence Kasdan who also directed another awesome Western as ¨Wyatt Earp¨ . Furthermore , he made other good movies as ¨Body heat¨, ¨The big chill¨ , ¨Grand Canyon¨ and ¨Dream catcher¨ . Rating Silverado : Excellent but overlong as the runtime is approx two hours and some . This famous Western will appeal to Kevin Costner and Kevin Kline fans . Even those who don't usually like westerns are sure to enjoy it . If you never bother with Westerns , this has several reasons why you should . Worthwhile watching and above average .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Best" Western.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite western...or favorite of the westerns made after 1980..hahah. One thing other reviewers seem to forget is how good Jeff Fahey was. He is always SO good at the nutty, cruel crazy type of character. Must be the contrast of his blue eyes with his dark hair. Did a great job. And, even if you don't like Kevin Costner, as some don't, he did a fantastic job as the cocky, young, afraid of nothing brother of Emmet. And, he looked like he had a blast playing the part. And he sure could ride. I remember that Scott Glen had a harder time adjusting to being a cowboy during the training for the film.. and got hurt I think. He sure overcame that..looked like a natural too. Yes, they should have made a sequel, the group of actors were too good together to not see again. Other favorite westerns? Tombstone.....Val Kilmer as Doc was SUPERB. Probably the best character in a western EVER. boy that was a good one!!!!Favorite old western? The Cowboys with John Wayne.Enjoy Siverado!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have nothing but compliments for this gun- and trail-blazing Western opus; a symbol of the genre's unwillingness to die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the financial disaster of Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" in 1980, the Western movie genre had appeared to slip away into an unexpected demise after so many decades of enormous popularity. Then in 1985, two filmmakers, who owed their inspiration and in one case, their career to the old Westerns, brought it back from the cinematic grave of the cutting room. The first one was a revolutionary Western by Clint Eastwood. "Pale Rider" (1985) brought back the dark, cynical life of the gloomy but powerfully allegoric Westerns like "Shane" (1953). And then there was "Silverado", which instilled new life into our perception of the old classic gun and trail-blazing Westerns like "The Magnificent Seven" (1960). As an avid fan of the Westerns, both old and new, I have nothing but compliments for "Silverado" and even now, almost a quarter of a century since its theatrical debut, it still holds up as a terrifically entertaining good-hearted Western action film and fills the souls of its viewers with the same wild love and thrill that the classics and the men who made them have.While "Pale Rider" and later, "Unforgiven" (1992) brought us a gritty, cynical view of the 19th century world, "Silverado" brings us one full of glory and spectacle from its magnificent scenery to its pulse-raising downtown shootouts and standoffs. Back with a new look, but the same charm, are the tough laconic heroes riding on elegant steeds and hauling flashy bullet-spitting hardware on their legs. Back are the sneering, equally laconic villains who spit before they draw their guns. Back are the classic shootouts where the good guys score a direct hit with every shot?no matter the distance or the situation?and the bad guys miss with every shot and yet somehow, this improbable and certainly unrealistic formula still works. "Silverado" is basically the same kind of film as "The Magnificent Seven" (1960) and the other gun-blazing Westerns from the golden age revamped and upgraded for a more contemporary audience, but still working more or less in the same way."Silverado" is full of old-fashioned, but terrifically entertaining action scenes ranging from fistfights to classic one-on-one showdowns in the middle of a deserted dusty street, but part of what also keep it standing on its own feet are the background stories of the colorful characters, many of whom are played by actors quite unfamiliar to the Western genre. Again, some of the subplots are old-fashioned and familiar, such as the commonly used bout between homesteaders and range men, but because its freshened up and ramped up, it works. Director, producer, and writer Lawrence Kasdan is to be congratulated enormously on this thundering, exciting Western opus. Full of witty dialogue, beautiful backgrounds, colorful things in the foreground, a wonderful Academy Award-nominated music score by Bruce Broughton, and again, that same old-fashioned, but never dying charm of the old 50s and 60s Westerns, "Silverado" is the kind of film that the whole family can sit down and enjoy. The Western genre may have slowed down and may be a little more obscure today than it was forty years ago, but it will never die completely. A flower may wilt, but its elegance is forever remembered. "Silverado" is, just like its tagline claims, the ride of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Homage that works on it's own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many other people here have commented on how formulaic this movie is. Sure it is- it's Kasdan's tribute to the Westerns he loves. One doesn't write a tribute to the Beatles without some kind of imitation. Take it for what it is, on that level.But it's also a great movie on it's own. The acting is terrific, the plot is pretty much what the plot of a Western is supposed to be, and we all agree on the scenery and music.I have trouble with some of the other (negative) reviews. Several state that the characters are too black and white. I didn't see it. Look at the 4 main characters. Emmet is just out of prison, for murder. Justified? Sure, but still "murder". Paden is a reformed crook, seemingly trying to go straight. Mal is a "black sheep" whose family thinks he abandoned them. And Jake-well he's immature, and thinks with his guns. (All three of them.) How are they too good and pure? The movie is about writing wrongs, and redeeming oneself, so there have to be some skeletons buried.The actors portraying the main 4 do a great job. Scott Glenn makes Emmet a man of iron will. Kevin Kline's Paden is a fatalist, just trying to keep alive. Danny Glover plays Mal as a man that wants to be treated as a man, with dignity and the desire for what's right. And Kevin Costner is just having a rollicking good time.The bad guys are somewhat formulaic I agree, though I think Brian Dennehy as Cobb comes across as a crook who is trying to (sorta) go straight. Sure he'll do what he has to, but he's found a place where he thinks he can fit in, and he'll do what has to be done to keep it. Jeff Fahey as Tyree is terrific- there's not enough of him. He's a complete psychopath, but Fahey does a great job- he's got the whole "Helter Skelter" eyes thing going on.Other roles are less interesting. I agree that Jeff Goldblum's "Slick" is not much, nor well-played. I think the idea of the crooked gambler was good, but the part didn't work out well. Too bad. John Cleese worked as a sheriff. Sure, he added a light touch, and I think the role was written specifically for him (just a hunch), but he's also a realist. He wants to keep the peace in his town, and that's it. If the Bad Guys get away, well good riddance. Just don't come back.I did like Rosanna Arquette. She played a hard-working woman with some "funny" ideas. Understated, and true. It's impossible to make her look anything less than breath-taking, but they dressed her in a matronly fashion, and avoided the temptation to have her bathe in a convenient body of water, which broke my heart then and now.As for the story, well so what if the climax was predictable. This is a movie- it's not a documentary. The good guys win, and the bad guys die for their sins. Duh. Was it surprising that Cobb and Paden faced off in the street? No, but that's what one expects in a Western. And it was done well. Both men knew it was coming, and both faced Fate, knowing that their friendship (if that's the right word) means nothing. Lots of bad guys got killed, but that's what happens when you back the wrong horse. They made their choices, and it ended badly.I think that the biggest problem here is the lack of background. As mentioned above, the characters have histories that bring them all together here, but we don't know any more. Why did Mal leave his family? What is the background of Paden, and so on. Given the length of the movie, none of this could be covered, which is why a prequel would be a great idea. Perhaps LK could do one now, with different actors portraying the younger men and women....? So overall, it's a great movie, and a great western. It pays tribute to the great ones that went before, even requiring the same suspension of disbelief as some of them. But it's a good vs. evil story, and succeeds well. Was it as "real" as Eastwood's "Unforgiven" (which I found boring)? Probably not, but Clint was going for the Anti-western. Kasdan went for the real thing. What he achieved is a classic movie of it's genre. Watch it, know it, love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have got to be kidding?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silverado arrives as a typical Western, with your standard good guys, villains, intruding and ill-prepared settlers, all of their women, a town in corruptive turmoil, personal vendettas, a ranch, and the obligatory stampede. Spice it up with the centralized saloon-gambling hall with a guy named "Slick", gunslingers, ladies of the evening, and a vertically challenged version of Gunsmoke's Miss Kitty. Then you epically conclude it all with showdown gunfights, including one in front of a church no less.Yes, Silverado covers all the bases and zealously steals every Western cliché' ever conceived. However, with its abundance of cliché' Silverado misses the opportunity to be daringly different. In comparison to Eastwood's 'Unforgiven', Silverado's message of good eventually triumphs over evil (only if evil gets careless) is sadly mundane and it begs the question, why did they even bother to make this film?The answer lies somewhere in the conceptual thinking of the producers, writers, and director, who tragically missed an opportunity to take a talented ensemble and make a poignant and meaningful film that actually had the potential to send a distinctive message.Ironically, the last line in the movie, "We'll be back!" is telling and I sincerely hope it never comes to fruition. So far, so good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expansive western updated somewhat to modern sensibilities. Kasdan obviously has great affection for the westerns of old and never strays too far from the traditions of the genre while still making them seem fresh. He's aided by a great production team who make sure everything feels lived in and the cinematographer takes full advantage of the sweeping vistas to give a feel of the old west. Another advantage the film has is the great cast the director has assembled. The four leads, Kline, Glenn, Glover and Costner, make a terrific team with Kevin Costner especially standing out. He's never been this lively and likable on screen since unfortunately. There really is no weak link in the entire film but some of the others who stand out are Linda Hunt, tough but gentle as saloon keeper Stella and Brian Dennehy whose character could have been just a great hulking bear of a villain but because of the magnetism he brings and the way he plays the part with a twinkle in his eye makes him far more interesting. This is something that is talked down nowadays, a rollicking good time at the movies. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a cross between High Noon and Blazing Saddles. There is a lot of comedy to the movie, and much seriousness. It is a cast of greats. Many of these actors have gone on to be huge stars. The movie never was boring, despite having all the clichés of any other western movie. John Cleese actually had a serious role as a mayor of a small town. There were some good lines. I liked when Danny Glover's character said "you really don't know much about 'being human'"? That's true. You can spend your whole life not knowing about people and how to deal with people. Kevin Kline was great as a very cool, intelligent gunfighter. He wanted to keep his friendship with his old friend played by Brian Dennehy. It took him a little time to look into things and find out that his buddy had become a really bad guy. QUESTION: Why did the gambler (Jeff Goldblum) try to kill Danny Glover's character? He never appeared to be in with the sheriff. My guess is that the gambler was doing it for publicity. He thought he could take the guy on and live to brag about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SILVERADO is one of exasperatingly entertaining movies that leaves you frustrated that you are not more disappointed.A "killer" (pardon) the pun, opening sequence, a terrific gunfights in the claustrophobic confines of a mountain cabin introduces us to Emmet (Scott Glenn). As Emmet opens the cabin door to spectacular western mountain scenery, Bruce Broughton's majestic opening title music creates the perfect atmosphere for excitement. By the end of title credits, we are introduced to Payden (Kevin Kline), an incredibly low-keyed but ironic gunfighter. Soon we met Mel (Danny Glover) and Emmet's brother (Kevin Costner, in a terrific, funny performance). Throw John Cleese, Roseanna Arquette, Jeff Fahey, Linda Hunt, Jeff Goldblum Lynn Whitfield and, especially Brian Dennehy into the mix, and you have one terrific cast. That's just the problem: There are so many top notch actors to watch, by the time the action reaches SILVERADO, your not sure who to watch anymore.With all that terrific talent on hand, it's also amazing to me that Producer-Director-Writer Lawrence Kasdan (THE BIG CHILL) would cast such a weak head villain, particularly with such strong ones (Fahey and Dennehy) to compete for attention.Still this is the most "ridingist, fightingist, shootingist" western of the 80s, and one of the five best of the last three decades.

		<fullReview>Kinda dull plot, poor direction &amp; editing, clichés left and right, and it really isn't the epic western it aspires to be. The performances are pretty good, although Glenn has some trouble acting hurt. Costner does his usual devil-may-care Jeff Bridges impersonation, Dennehy is over-the-top, Danny Glover does what he can in a tired role, Linda Hunt is always fun to watch, and Jeff Goldblum, as was his mien for the 1980s, totally steals the show as Slick. Most of the characters remain fairly thin, with the ones in black hats relying entirely on comic-book personas. Costumes are kinda lame, with the hats seeming to rely on what was available in department stores of the 80s. Rifles shoot tiny holes in people, the good guys never miss, and the music is far too ambitious. Once Upon a Time in the West this is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst western ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "The Wild Bunch" and "Once Upon a Time in the West", one wonders if anyone ever need make a western again. Like other directors who failed to watch the above films and note that the genre is complete, Lawrence Kasdan took his shot at it with "Silverado" and the result is a train wreck. The plot is either incomprehensible or simply missing; it's really hard to tell. It seems as if the director shot two or three full-length movies and then edited the thing, in random order, into a single product. What happened to Rosanna Arquette? She disappears about a third of the way in and them magically reappears at the end as if she'd been there all along.The actors, as others here have noted, are pretty much phoning in their performances. John Cleese and Kevin Kline seem to be in the wrong movie, Danny Glover seems to be in the wrong century, and Jeff Goldblum seems to be in the wrong universe.The script, which many mistake for homage, is simply a tired retread of every single cliché ever used in a western. The only thing missing was someone saying, "This town ain't big enough for the both of us." I suppose there may be a clever way of rehashing tired movie clichés in a new script, but you won't find it here. The actors deliver these dusty old lines half-heartedly, as though even they couldn't believe the unimaginative script.If you like good westerns, there's nothing to see here. Move along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silverado 1985 spoilersAs far as westerns go there're two big names Clint Eastwood and John Wayne. I would like to submit another name for the famous western actors Kevin Costner. Kevin Costner has been in Wyatt Earp, dances with wolves, open range, etc. My favorite Western to feature Kevin Costner is Silverado. As a whole I feel Silverado is under appreciate. The story is unique featuring a group of heroes who are less then honorable. We first me Emmitt (Scott Glenn) in a lonely dusty cabin in the middle of nowhere. The silence is broken by the sounds of gunfire and a battle rages. Next we meet Paden (Kevin Kline) a man left stranded in the desert by his friends. Paden and Emmitt head out to find Emmitt's younger brother Jake (Kevin Costner). Jakes being held in prison for murder. The trio ends up staging a jailbreak and head off toward Silverado. Along the journey, they Mal( Danny Glover) a man headed home to help his Paw. The group of four men end up taking up a common cause and ending the reign of tyranny in Silverado. As far as westerns go Silverado has a lot of heart and Kevin Costner's character Jake made a large impact on me growing u.

		<shortDescription>A robust, large scale, and diverting Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-writer, producer and director Lawrence Kasdan did his part in keeping the Western genre alive with "Silverado". It may not be innovative, but that may well have been the point, as Kasdan aims to pay tribute to a beloved movie genre that dated all the way back to the silent era. Admittedly, this one came along when the Western was going through a bit of a dry spell, which made it all the more welcome.Four very engaging stars - Kevin Kline as Paden, Scott Glenn as Emmett, Danny Glover as Mal, Kevin Costner as Jake - are an interesting combo, as these characters, united by circumstance, eventually band together to fight against the injustices occurring in the town of Silverado. More than once, they prove their worth, in a story (written by Kasdan and his brother Mark) that is fairly episodic."Silverado" is extremely well shot, by John Bailey, in widescreen. It gets the look of a classic Western just right. It hooks you right away with an opening moment of quiet suddenly interrupted by a gunfight, and promises a substantial amount of entertainment to come when we're introduced to the tough and resilient Emmett and get a load of the majestic New Mexico locations. Admittedly, this doesn't work quite as well when you start to think about it too much, so it's better to just go with the flow and appreciate all that Kasdan and his cast &amp; crew have packed into this presentation. Certainly, it would be hard not to get roused by that stirring and wonderful music score composed by Bruce Broughton.There's a lot of acting talent to go around here, but giving things a curious quality is some unexpected casting. Linda Hunt? Jeff Goldblum? JOHN CLEESE? Rosanna Arquette is fairly appealing if somewhat aloof as the gal who catches both Klines' and Glenns' eyes. Jeff Fahey makes his film debut as scruffy psycho Tyree. Lovely ladies Amanda Wyss and Lynn Whitfield play local girl Phoebe and Mals' sister respectively. Recognizable character players in the cast include Marvin J. McIntyre, Sheb Wooley, James Gammon, Ray Baker, Joe Seneca, Earl Hindman, Jim Haynie, Richard Jenkins (also making his film debut), Pepe Serna, Ted White, and an uncredited Brion James as Hobart, the wagon master. The real standout for this viewer is Brian Dennehy, who never overplays his role as villainous sheriff Cobb, instead suffusing the character with a good deal of charm.The pacing rarely slows down, and the action scenes are first rate. Especially good is a scene involving a stampede.While lacking the overall impact for this viewer to consider it great, it's still pretty fun while it lasts.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silverado has long been one of my favorite Westerns. But it had been so long that I had forgotten why. Having just re-watched it - I remember - Kevin Kline's smart mouth - sarcastic lines. Many very funny quips in the first half of the movie.Unfortunately, it seems the writers ran out of steam about 1/2 way &amp; relied on traditional shoot em up to carry the story - not as good as the first half. But there are some classic scenes such as when K Costner, S Glenn, D Glover and K Kline are riding abreast as they fearlessly travel into Dodge (or actually Silverado).Kevin Costner's exuberant, yet pretty skillful young cowboy is endearing. He is young enough to pull it off. And Danny Glover is pretty convincing as the black man who has had enough (Racism. intolerance, bad guys, etc.) Pretty good commentary on the post Civil War years - the black man was free - officially, but not actually. Good sub theme there.Even though I enjoyed it, I would rank the following Westerns ahead of this one: Lonesome Dove (of course); Appaloosa; True Grit (remake); Unforgiven and THe Good, The Bad, and the Ugly and Tombstone. In fact maybe I should change my rating - nah. DonB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest western of the 1980's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Western, the genre that cannot be killed almost died in the 1980's after the financial mega disaster of the epic "Heaven's Gate" (good film prejudiced by the ego of its tyrannic director), studios were reluctant in investing on projects like that, but the few ones made in that decade were incredibly well made yet criminally underrated (okay, the golden era of western was between the 1930's and 1960's but even today we have great pictures that will become western classics in the years to come). To me, Lawrence Kasdan's "Silverado" and Christopher Cain's "Young Guns" (1988) are the greatest westerns from the 1980's, films that brought some positive innovations to the genre; the most memorable sighs the genre had in that period before its ultimate resurrection in the following decade with the acclaim of titles like "Dances with Wolves" and "Unforgiven".Hardly original but always effective, this homage made by Kasdan (who also paid a tribute to the noir with "Body Heat") presents four good guys (Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner) dealing with a great load of trouble and danger while trying to make their way to the city of Silverado (and there's trouble in there as well), and there they're gonna fight with the corrupt authorities of the place. They might not be the most respectable guys to trust, they all have their share of arrests and wrongdoings but they stand for the right causes, battling against injustices and helping the honest workers to get a decent and peaceful life where they live.As for its theme and story there's no much novelty of what we're used to find in westerns; the presentation of its content and the precise use of humor are excellent though and all that are some of the qualities of "Silverado". Kasdan succeeds with inspiration in scenes like the final shootout; Costner and Kline escaping from prison; Kline trying to get his stolen horse back, dealing with a gun salesman for the "rent" of a gun since he can't afford to buy one. Kudos to the magnificent cinematography of John Bailey and the respectable music of Bruce Broughton, all greatly integrated with the movie.The structures are classic but the faces in it are not, so it's really cool to see big names of the 1980's starring on a genre that was more popular years earlier. Besides the mentioned main stars, there's room for veteran heavyweights like Brian Dennehy, Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Fahey, Jeff Goldblum, John Cleese, Lynn Whitfield, Joe Seneca, Richard Jenkins and the memorable performance of Linda Hunt, playing the helpful saloon owner.It shows that the Old West wasn't just a place for bad guys and hard faces, but also a place for guys that weren't so good in their behavior but always tried to do the right thing for the right people and for themselves too. It's all great! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silverado Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a screenwriter, I can see how this movie was made and I'm taking notes NOT to do this in my own work. With four characters, none are developed enough to create strong empathy for anyone. In fact, perhaps the strongest empathy created is to Mal, who loses a father and witnesses the shooting of his sister - yet Mal isn't perceived as the main 'hero'. Of the other main characters, Jake (Costner) simply tags along acting goofy, yet he has one of the better performances of the bunch. Emmett has no clear motivation in the story until the last 40minutes. Paden's development is weak and he finally befriends the bartender over an hour into the movie. Knowing her for only a 24hr period (and not in a romantic way), he's willing to step aside and watch his friends get shot up so that she won't get fired? It's not believable. In my opinion, the story doesn't work and surprisingly some of the acting looked like... acting. It didn't seem natural. At the 1hr 45min mark I was hoping the movie would end and 30minutes later I was granted satisfaction. If this film can be considered one of the better westerns, it's no wonder the western has disappeared over the past twenty years.</fullReview>

Boasting a stellar cast, particularly Kevin Kline, Brian Dennehy and Linda Hunt (who steals every scene she's in), it's a well-written, acted, directed and features some gorgeous scenery. Kasdan's expansive story not only weaves together seemingly unrelated threads into one overall destiny, but it imbues its four heroes with a righteous sense of friendship and justice.

		<fullReview>The highly improbable logistics of the opening scene with the exploding stove top sets the viewer up for a fun ride, one in which you don't know what to expect as the opening credits roll. Kevin Kline and John Cleese - is it a Monty Python Western? Scott Glenn looking like a misplaced Carradine brother. Kevin Costner way back in 1985 - with not a thought of "Dances With Wolves" or "Open Range" in sight. Brian Dennehy, Danny Glover, Rosanna Arquette, you have to pinch yourself over the names that back then weren't household words, but combined here make up one of the more eclectic casts in the genre.It's too bad actually that Cleese didn't have more to do here. His first appearance on screen as Sheriff Langston is so out of place that it adds another layer of ambiguity to the film. I couldn't restrain myself from cracking up over his line after Mal (Glover) breaks up the barroom - "I don't tolerate this kind of thing, it's hard on the peace and hard on the furniture".The on again, off again relationship of the four companion protagonists is nicely balanced with focus on the characters as individuals as well. Kline's character Paden is probably the most rounded, particularly in his relationship with Stella the Midnight Star (Linda Hunt). His final showdown with Cobb (Dennehy) relives the classic falling out of partners seeking vengeance and justice in a gunfight with only one outcome possible.Still, the film winds up confusing at times, like in the treatment of Rosanna Arquette's character. She starts out married, feigns a flirtation with Paden, is eyed by Emmett (Glenn), and then winds up without a partner by the time it's all over. There's also the separate rivalries between the good guys and Cobb's men, as well as the good guys and the McKendrick bunch. I kept wondering how all the elements would eventually tie together, but they don't. It seems to me the story's flow would have been better served by a buildup to a single confrontation in the tradition of your standard Western. However I don't think director Lawrene Kasdan was going for standard in his homage to the genre. If you go with the flow of the story, you're better served by the action scenes, gorgeous cinematography, and exciting music score when each take their turn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a somewhat strangely conceived movie with unusual casting. Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline, and Danny Glover seem terribly miscast in this picture, as do many of the other big name stars. The picture is obviously a western genre metaphor, but really does NOT try to be a comedy. It seems quite strange in this way and incongruous. I appreciated some of the complexities in making it, though I did notice a few gaffes in the old time sets and characterizations. To me, only Brian Dennehy as the evil sheriff/Saloon owner is well cast. The rest of the cast all seem to KNOW they really don't belong in this western. 5 stars out of 10 tops. I enjoyed some of the action sequences and the sound score was excellent, but. . . Much of the dialogue is far too modern to pass the muster. The final climax scenes in the town are stagey and simply lurid metaphors of old western themes. I suppose the film-makers were making some kind of statement about the western genre to get some audience guffaws, but. . . .and anyway, westerns stopped being made for a few years after this picture came out. After watching Silverado, I really don't wonder why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the breathtaking wide-open spaces of a John Ford classic Western, "Silverado" (this time from Lawrence Kasden), takes us into the high desert country of New Mexico in brilliant Technicolor. A basic good versus evil story is brought to life with terrific characters portrayed by some of the best actors the movie industry has to offer.I recommend that you add "Silverado" to the Westerns section of your "Top Ten Desert Island" collection. But you must see "Silverado" in the letterbox format. The "edited to fit your TV screen" version will only leave you disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched the later part of this movie and was startled at the mediocrity, given all the big names. Most of the stars seemed miscast, no one seemed to draw acting talent out of the stars. Must have been done at studio behest only. Phoned in, if you know what I mean, but an expensive phone call. Somehow Costner didn't even look appealing, Klein looked out of time, Dennehy looked like a canned sheriff, Goldblum also seemed like he was dressed up for the wrong century. Wonder why they bothered unless someone up high had a thing about doing a Western movie like the other studios were doing. Oh well, everyone went on to better work. Compare to Costner in Open Range and you will see a man working off a passion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kasden is an interesting writer. He is completely without imagination. No crime there. He is instead a craftsman, an engineer. If all you want to do is take up space pleasantly, that's good enoughThis is fun, but the reason it is fun is because is because it is all borrowed from pictures we like: the 'High Noon's and 'Seven Samuri's of our collective film memories. The question is not whether this film entertains (it does), but whether it entertains in a way that reduces or enhances our ability to be entertained next time. It think, like most other formula projects, it reduces it. That's because the mind seems to have only two modes: recognition and learning.In a formula picture, you see familiar icons behaving in expected ways. You are pleased because you are assured. The more assured and comfortable those images, the happier you are in your conceptual cocoon. So these film experiences actually suck the life out of our imagination. They are, in fact, the equivalent of the oppressors that figure in so many of them.The only thing that saves these in the modern era are actors that overlay irony. Someone like Kline who looks at you as if to say: 'look, I'm playing this stupid, one-dimensional cartoon, but both you and I know what it is, wink wink nudge nudge.' Kasden provides this opening by allowing Kline to fall in love with a plain-looking dwarf. It is only slightly against the template: she is a saloon owner with a heart of gold, but enough to allow a silver, sliver of self deprecation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes jokingly tell people this is the greatest Western I have ever watched. Then I wonder if I really am joking.From the opening scene where the buddies meet up to the introduction of the baddies and their actions. All seems plausible due to very good direction and writing. Yes there are clichés, but in a good way.If you like Westerns of any sort you will enjoy this movie.And now, a word about review length requirements. I added that longer middle section to fulfill the length requirement. I don't really think it adds to the review and I think shorter reviews should be allowed.

		<fullReview>It had been a while since I first saw this movie and I just refreshed my memory the other day. And while it remains likable with some fine actors in it, it didn't age well at all. Other reviewers have written about the clichés along the way. But you can't fault a movie for things that are now a given, when they might not have been at the time of the production of said movie.The movie is still good though, but some character choices seem odd to say the least. Kevin Costner is a great actor, but while he seemingly has fun with his free spirited character, you don't really buy it as a viewer. Kevin Kline makes the best impression of all, which all boils down to the fact, that they tried too much. Too many characters, too many things going on, none of which stay long enough to keep the viewer hooked all the way through. This may be nit-picking, but it's what is missing from making this a really superb western</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is like a culmination of the classic western film genre. It's got it all: great memorable characters, great cinematography, great music soundtrack, and a compelling classic story line. Is it innovative? Not really. But neither was J.S. Bach in music. He culminated the Baroque era that had preceded him. In doing so, he happened to bring baroque music to its highest zenith. This film does much the same for western films. It's chock full of all the most endearing clichés with a little modern flavor added here and there. Most people are unable to get the fact that originality in art is vastly overrated. It's much better to do something really well than to sell out everything to merely do something new. There's a lot of really crappy art out there that has little besides originality going for it! I'd rather admire a story that's been retold with passion and a high level of craftsmanship, and that's what Silverado does!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawrence Kasdan directs this return to Old West adventure for a new generation of fans. Four unwitting heroes cross paths on their way to a small town called Silverado. They have no idea that their friends and family in the tiny town are controlled by a corrupt sheriff that can command a murderous posse at the snap of a finger. Emmett(Scott Glenn), Paden(Kevin Kline), Jake(Kevin Costner) and Mal(Danny Glover)meet trouble before even getting to Silverado, but the whiskey drinkin', hard fightin' quartet are hard to take advantage of. After getting to Silverado, they end up breaking each other out of jail and methodically try to figure out the bad guys from the good guys; and then go about cleaning up and restoring law to the sleepy little town. Very authentic look and fun watching tricks of the trade to restore the peace. Costner actually proves to have a comedic streak; and I found a new respect for Kline's talents. This outstanding cast also features:John Cleese, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Jeff Fahey, Rosanna Arquette and Sheb Wooley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rip-Roaring Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Silverado" is a 1985 Western about two brothers (Scott Glenn &amp; Kevin Costner) and two other gents (Kevin Kline &amp; Danny Glover) who become friends and ultimately team-up to take on the corrupt sheriff of the New Mexican town Silverado.The first time I tried to watch "Silverado" was in the mid-90s and something turned me off. I now know what that was: "Silverado" doesn't have the downbeat, ultra-realistic, amoral vibe of most post-50s Westerns. This is a rip-roaring Western in the truest sense of the word. There are a few moral ambiguities (e.g. Jeff Goldblum's character and Kline's conundrum in the story) but, for the most part, the heroes are heroes and the villains drip with evil.My main problem was that certain situations or events struck me as a bit unrealistic, almost verging on Indiana Jones territory, which is easy to explain since writer/director Lawrence Kasdan also wrote "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Upon seeing it again recently I decided to accept the few implausible heroics to glean from (and enjoy) the meat of the picture, which is essentially a serious story running the gamut of the human condition (e.g. injustice, action, drama, comedy, etc.). I only bring this up so that viewers who insist on realism in their Westerns like, say, "Open Range" or "The Wild Bunch" will make the necessary mental adjustments before attempting to digest the film.One aspect of "Silverado" I like, which most post-50s Westerns lack, is the palpable spirit of life, freedom and joy that the heroes (and their friends) possess. Despite the various evils they experience (which we can all relate to in one way or another) they maintain a certain joy of living, the jubilance of life and freedom itself. Hence, the film isn't a downer. It's somehow uplifting.Stories like this need a good villain and Brian Dennehy more than fills the bill. In fact, he's horrifying as the corrupt sheriff of Silverado. Remember Dennehy as the sheriff in "First Blood"? This is essentially the same role multiplied by ten, as in ten-times WORSE.The main hero is Kevin Kline. The only other film I've seen him in is "Grand Canyon." I liked him in that film and feel the same here. I don't know, he's just good at playing the perfect, likable everyman.Scott Glenn is a quintessential Westerner and Kevin Costner plays his younger gung-ho brother. Costner is quite different here than in other Western roles like "Dances with Wolves," "Wyatt Earp" and "Open Range." In "Silverado" he's young and spunky, an expert and deadly gunslinger, but full of mirth at the same time.Another item that turned me off when I first saw "Silverado" was that the story is convoluted. There are numerous characters and each has his/her own sub-story (think of Kasdan's "Grand Canyon"). Heck, we don't even see the town Silverado until a full 45 minutes into the film. But the good thing about a story like this is that it's not superficial; hence, it's worthy of numerous repeat viewings (because you're not likely gonna digest it all in just one or two viewings).I enjoyed certain subplots like Kline's love for the midget saloon bartender (Linda Hunt), love in a son/mother manner, that is. As well as the love and loyalty of the four heroes; the fact that Glover is a black man is of no issue. Love in its purest sense is spiritual in nature and transcends blood, skin color or raw lust. You never know who you'll meet in life and form a strong love-bond with. It's amazing.Unfortunately some subplots obviously got left on the cutting room floor. For instance, Rosanna Arquette and Jeff Goldblum.So why not a higher rating? I didn't find the story ultra-captivating like, say, Kasdan's "Grand Canyon." I had to struggle a bit to keep attentive here and there. Other than that "Silverado" has everything you'd ever want in a Western (in fact, maybe overkill): gunfights, quick-draw showdowns, smoke-filled saloons, saloon girls, homesteaders, wagon trains, outlaws, posses, jailbreaks, stampedes, box canyons, glorious Western locations, and more.GRADE: B</fullReview>

When Emmett and Paden break Jake out of jail, Mal helps to keep the posse from catching them. The four horsemen find a wagon train that's been robbed, and they set out to retrieve the money.This is a rip roaring old fashion shoot em up western. Kevin Kline has some fun playing around.

		<fullReview>In the mid-eighties Westerns were quite a dying breed, but then "Silverado" came riding along with it's sprawling old-west backdrops, spirited old-fashion heroism and a star-studded cast from its leads to minor support. In all honesty the main pulling power for me was that it featured Scott Glenn and everything else was an added bonus. Kevin Kline (never seen him this charismatic before), Scott Glenn (starch as ever), Kevin Costner and Danny Glover play four unwitting heroes who cross paths on their journey to the town Silverado. But the town is run by a greedy landowner and a corrupt sheriff, where our four heroes all seem to have some sort past to overcome when reaching there. "Silverado" doesn't go that far beyond its common ground, but its compelling enough as it makes up for it with its authentic look and enthusiastic direction in installing the western myths. In support you got the likes of Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Ray Baker, Jeff Fahey, Rosanna Arquette, John Cleese, Jeff Goldblum, Lynn Whitfield, Amanda Wyss and James Gammon. The chemistry between everyone simply clicked. Dennehy, Baker and Fahey were great in their villain roles. Even Cleese in a rather deadpan turn was a hoot. Hunt stood out too. Sadly Arquette was under-used with most of her story hitting the cutting room floor. It's a rollicking adventure, done in a traditional style harking back to those westerns of the 40s and 50s era. Our four protagonists have their own responsibilities, dynamics and the story gives them equal weight to express them as the multiple stories come together in one epic standoff. Gunslingers Kline and Dennehy final showdown goes on to cement the competent, if stagy style that's cemented through out, especially the use of the camera in its scenic positioning. Plus the opening sequences with Glenn impresses too. One thing that did feature heavily in the script was that it didn't take itself too seriously by taking time out for some self-knowing quips. It could have come across as an uneasy mix, but it did seem to pay off more so than not. The music had that grand feel. Well-worn clichés can't harm a flamboyant western with a stellar cast.

		<fullReview>It's so nice to see a good Western like Silverado after a long time. The last time I enjoyed one was The Quick and the Dead some years back, in DVD.And everyone here looks so young :) Kevin Costner especially, looked really hot and Jeff Goldblum too. Danny Glover gives a physically strong &amp; energetic performance. Of course, the rugged looking Scott Glenn also makes a cool impact. And nice to see Kevin Kline(famous for comedy roles) in a serious, tough character. But the best of all was Brian Dennehy as the crooked Sheriff Cobb.He was mind blowing in the negative role.The wild yet breathtaking landscape also added perfectly to the feel of this Western.Most importantly, the action was very well done, and quick-paced too. Some of the shootouts didn't look convincing but nevertheless it's fun to watch because all the lead actors here make the scenes believable.Verdict: Good action, good acting, good suspense - there's never a dull moment in this howdy cowboy flick. Entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When talking great westerns, 'Silverado' doesn't exactly leap into mind. Yet I have to say that there are at least some great moments here that lift this movie above the ordinary.Firstly, there's an amazingly solid A/B-list cast. A lot of money must have been spent recruiting this ensemble. And they're well chosen, too, offering clearly-defined and contrasting characters to the various sub-plots. I'm biased here, perhaps, because they're some of my favourites. These people really do ACT as well as any top-dollar star. Each brings an entirely believable conviction to their roles.There's a decent script, too. Not over smart, but still convincing with one or two shrewd little one-liners.Technical issues such as camera-work and lighting are all up to snuff. I just think that the editing is a bit choppy at times. Some scene changes come and go too suddenly. A decent soundtrack moves the whole thing along.If anything, this movie has an identity crisis. I recollect that it was billed as a comedy. And with John Cleese popping-up you would hardly expect otherwise. Yet when he plays it straight he is a surprisingly convincing hardcase, he just lapses into Basil Fawlty from time to time and the volte-face is a little jarring. At the same time, there is some pretty unpleasant roughstuff, evident examples of suffering, and one or two brutal killings. Overall, it doesn't come over as comical most of the time.With a straight actor instead of Cleese, to minimise the silliness, I think this would be a serious and seriously good western, almost a classic of the genre. In a way, it reminds me of 'Fistful Of Dynamite', which also suffers from a comedy/tragedy identity issue.Still; I think it's well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Memorable Frontier Shoot'em Up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bill Chill" writer &amp; director Lawrence Kasdan made the perfect western "Silverado" with Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner, and Danny Glover. This four-fisted horse opera finds an oddball assortment of individuals thrown together into an alliance when they encounter common foes. Clocking in at 133 minutes, "Silverado" boasts a number of rambunctious gunfights, with Costner imitating Steve McQueen, right down to riding his horse side saddle. This atmospheric western is reminiscent of those oaters from the 1950s rather than Spaghetti westerns. Kasdan has assembled an impressive supporting cast that includes John Cleese, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Jeff Goldblum, James Gammon, Rosana Arquette, and Lyn Whitfield. The production values are stupendous, and "Silverado" looks thoroughly genuine. Kasdan's dialogue is memorable, too. The opening scene with Scott Glenn cornered in a shack while several gunmen try to kill him is interesting because we in the audience are trapped alongside Glenn. Relying on his wits, Glenn's cowboy hero never sees any of his assailants but he makes mincemeat of them with his fancy shooting. He is riding to a town called Turley to rendezvous with his impulsive younger brother Jake (Kevin Costner) and runs across Paden (Kevin Kline) left to die in the desert. Emmett nurses Paden back to health and Paden sets out to find the dastards that left him for dead. Meantime, Malachi (Danny Glover of the "Lethal Weapon" franchise) is going home to see his parents. Kasdan doesn't waste a second in this heavy duty sagebrusher that doesn't rub your nose in gore. Composer Bruce Broughton has created an Elmer Bernstein type orchestral score. Western fans must watch this western!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it runs a mighty 132 minutes and contains loads of percussive action, Lawrence Kasdan's "Silverado" is somewhat hard to take. Unlike "Heaven's Gate" which (at least in its uncut version) goes to great lengths to explain the motives of its principal characters, this movie does the opposite. Maybe I missed something, but by the movie's end, I still didn't know what the friendly sheriff (played with a charismatic affability by the solidly built Brian Dennehy) had against the heroic foursome. After all, he had earlier saved Kline's life at the cavalry outpost. True, Scott Glenn had come to his rescue a little earlier, so what we have here is a hero with divided loyalties. That we can understand. But somewhere along the line, without an apology or a by-your-leave, Kline switches sides and joins up with Glenn and his psycho brother (chillingly played with an appropriately hideous hilarity by Kevin Costner) and the equally fearsome Danny Glover. Still, even though his script is faulty, the movie is directed with considerable style and panache by Lawrence Kasdan who had the acumen to cast the always wonderful, multi-awardwinning Linda Hunt in an important role. The scenery, the art direction, photography and music scoring are superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a entertaining but hardly original and maybe unrealistic modern Western, with a plot filled of traditional Western-elements. It is similar to the most of the famous Westerns of Ford, Hawks and Leone. "Silverado" shows that Scott Glenn could perhaps be a powerful Western-star, but his whole potential is hardly used to it´s best here, and I guess that the direction from Lawrence Kasdan is overall uneven. Kevin Costner makes the very best performance I´ve ever seen from him, Glover and Cline are solid but Goldblum is miscasted. The best part of "Silverado" is the first hour, the second hour is more uneven. At times a very fine movie, but mostly suitable for more unexperienced Western-fans.Rating: 7+ of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similarity to other recent Western Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was reminded of 'Rustler's Rhapsody' and 'Young Guns'. It tells the story of the west, in a comical way at times. Not totally unlike 'Young Guns', there are moments of humor in the film as Kevin Costner's character gets in trouble and weasels out of it, just as Billy does in Young Guns. He is aided by his brother Emmett as Billy was by the Regulators (Billy's family). Linda Hunt, though short, reminds me of Marilou Henner's character in 'Rhapsody', to some extent. And who's to say that short people didn't live in the west of the 1800's and have jobs like running saloons, anyway? Hunt and Kline have a thing going in the film, if only in her mind, just as Henner and Barringer did. Kevin Kline is like the sidekick in 'Rhapsody' (played by G.W. Bailey), with the exception of being just a bit more on the ball - ? but standing in the street with a broken pistol while trying to load it with shots hitting all around (and one shot too close for comfort) is certainly reminiscent of Bailey's character. I feel that the actors did justice to the film, just as much as the Sheen boys did for Young Guns. For some of them it was a short reach across the diversity of acting, for others it was a long stretch, but they all did an adequate job in showing versatility in their careers. And this is one of the rare films that you can see Earl Hindman in full face (Tim 'The Tool Man' Taylor's neighbor, Wilson).Plot wise, It would be a very boring film to see these two brothers connect with each other and just ride off into the sunset with no girls, no gunfights, no nothing in between. Revenge and settling old debts are the premises of this film. I think that Silverado has become an almost cult classic because of those who like it, buy it, and watch it again and again. It didn't do well in the theaters, but it certainly is still selling videos and DVD's even today. I recommend that anyone even thinking about Western movies for the evening, should at least give Silverado a try.All in all, I feel that Silverado rates just a bit under the best of the best at a 7.5 of 10. In all honesty, Tombstone is my favorite (recent) western. But even it has things in it that are not historically correct, just like Young Guns. However, if some things were not changed, the movies of the Old West would merely be documentaries, and would only be seen on the History Channel, not in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner Steals The Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to his second movie of 1985 Silverado. Plot In A Paragraph: A bunch of misfits team up, to right the wrongs in a town called Silverado. Quirky and fun, it's more of a flashier western, in the mould of Young Guns or Tombstone, than Something like The Outlaw Josie Wales or Pale Rider (the latter released the same year) with beautiful location photography, a fantastic score (which was one of the 2 Oscars the movie was nominated for) it's a very fun easy watch.It's a cliché story with stereotypical characters, but each of the four leads (Kevin Klein, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and KC) performances are so good, none more so than KC, it never for one minute bothers you. Here he shows great promise for more important roles in the western genre. His fast- moving performance is a lot of fun, and he makes the most of his role. KC establishes his character as a likable egotist right from the start. Of the four lead actors, he is he is the only one that looks like he belongs in the western genre. I don't think it's bias, if I say KC steals this picture. Watching it now, it's clear the guy has Stardust all over him.It's not without its problems though..... There is enough plot/sub plots and characters for two movies. The movie is saddled (yes pun intended) with an overly complex storyline involving numerous subplots. For example each of the four main Cowboys has their own subplot, as do other characters, and it ends up a bit disjointed, and contains a handful of characters that are just unnecessary to the story. John Cleese seems to think he is in a different movie and Jeff Goldblum (of whom I am a fan) looks totally out of place in a western too. But the faults can't stop the enjoyment of the movie. Grossing $32 million at the domestic box office, Silverado ended the year the 28th highest grossing movie of 1985.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SILVERADO was released in 1985 and brought westerns back to America and the world. SILVERADO was a sleeper that did excellent here in the states and Europe. It has continued to be a popular rental and has actually become a cult classic. Its popularity has continued to appeal to new audiences that were not even born when it was released. Hat's off to Lawrence Kasdan for hiring the best gun coach in the business, Arvo Ojala (1920-2005). Arvo was the father of fast draw, a sport born from the television westerns of the 1950's. Arvo was the fast draw expert who taught all the big name stars their gun handling skills. His job on SILVERADO was to make Kevin Costner proficient with a pair of Colt Single Action Army revolvers and by the way Kevin handled them in the movie, it seems that Arvo taught him well. If you have never seen this movie, go rent it. You will end up buying your own copy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I resisted watching this for a long time, under the impression that anything from the director of The Big Chill and featuring such cosmopolitan actors as Kevin Kline, Rosanna Arquette, Danny Glover, John Cleese, and Jeff Goldblum would be overly pretentious hogwash. I was mostly wrong. It was politically correct but not bad.This story about four fast friends and their adventures in and around the title city, an earnest attempt to recreate the feel of the epic westerns of the fifties, is pleasant entertainment and worth watching, with Kline effectively cast against type.I only have two substantial criticisms. One is that the first half with Kline getting back his hat and horse, his and Kevin Costner's big jailbreak, and Danny Glover's introduction, is so good that the second half pales by comparison.The second is the fact that third-billed Rosanna Arquette's character has nil to do with the story and is pretty much wasted, as if she were (typical of the fifties!) inserted in order to get a female name on the marquee. They should have gave her something to do!Overall, it wasn't the best western ever made, but pretty watchable nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this film on a re run recently and it just reminded me how much I liked it. The story is a bit predictable good guys (in white hats) wanting to make a new life and take things easy, the bad guys (in black hats) won't let them etc, but what saves this is the cast, script and the performances.Made when most of the names were well known but not major stars, if they re made it now with the same cast, one of the names would probably get more than the entire cast of Silverado.The cast list reads like a who's who, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner, Danny Glover, Brain Dennehy, Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline and even John Cleese makes an appearance.But what really keeps this exciting and fresh is the performances.No-one is really the star and the story weaves in and out of short stories of each character which regulary overlap with each other, Costner is a sharp shooting kid full of youth and exurberance, and Scott Glenn his older and wiser brother, they are on their way to California and meet various people on the way. One town they stop in has John Cleese as it's sherif, this is were they also meet Danny Glover. Cleese's performance is a bit short lived but great nonetheless.Jeff Goldblum is good as a card sharp baddy and Brian Dennehy is a menacing sherif, without being too OTT. For me it's not quite up there with Unforgiven, but it's certainly not far behind.This is feel goood film for the whole family, if you like westerns You'll love this one, and if you don't, you'll love it because it's a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, "Silverado" (1985) is a strange beast. On one hand, the film is an obvious homage to roughly 70 years worth of Westerns, particularly those by John Ford, Anthony Mann, Howard Hawks and Sergio Leone. On the other hand, the film is a light-hearted adventure in the vein of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Kasdan, of course, famously worked on Lucas and Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" and "Star Wars" franchises, franchises which were themselves postmodern "updates" of 1930s pulp fantasies.Kasdan's approach should result in something flippant and silly. Tempering this is Kasdan's screenplay, which resembles his scripts for "The Big Chill" and "Grand Canyon", both of which were fairly serious, sprawling melodramas. The result is a film which is constantly pulling in multiple directions. "Silverado" is a highbrow western, but also a lowbrow crowd-pleaser. It's a comedy, but also a drama. It's a film packed with caricatures and cartoonish archetypes, but also one which attempts to sketch a large community of "serious" characters. And so on and so on."Silverado" is at its best during its first act, where Kasdan presents the jaunty adventures of well-meaning rascals. Amongst these are Emmet (Scott Glenn), Paden (Kevin Kline), Jake (Kevin Costner) and Mal (Danny Glover). Today, Mal's tale is the most interesting. An African American cowboy who's tired of being beaten down, Glover's character offers a sanitised version of 1970s blaxploitation heroes (particularly Fred Williamson's "Boss N****r" films) and also serves as the midpoint between John Ford's "Sergeant Rutledge" and Tarantino's "Django Unchained". In 1985, you simply didn't find westerns with black heroes like this.The rest of "Silverado" is less interesting, particularly its last act, which combines typical 1980s blockbuster excess (lots of gunfights), with a familiar plot about a corrupt sheriff (Brian Dennehy). A funny performance by Kevin Costner makes the film's second half tolerable, but it's not enough. "Silverado" becomes too humourless, too loud, too serious, a stance which the film is too dumb to make work. In a way, it's the Hollywood version of Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West", another cut-and-paste movie which, weighed down by pastiche, inexorably gets too big for its boots.7/10 ? For those looking for better westerns, both high-brow and low (in that order), consider: Altman's "Sitting Bull" and "McCabe and Mrs Miller", Martin Ritt's "Hombre" and "Hud", "Ulzana's Raid", "Will Penny", "Ride with the Devil", Cox's "Walker", Benton's "Bad Company", Pontecorvo's "Burn!", "Dead Man", Siegel's "The Beguiled", "Lonely are the Brave", "Red River", "Dances with Wolves", "Viva Zapata", "Two Mules for Sister Sara", "My Darling Clementine", "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance", Corbucci's "The Great Silence", "The Long Riders", "Wild Bill" (1995), "The Ballad of Cable Hogue", "Tombstone", "The Shootist" and Costner's "Open Range".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This large-scale Western has an impressive cast and good acting, with the exception of Costner, who is much too annoying as a punk gunslinger. While it's quite exciting, there is too much plot here. Instead of a sustained central story arc, there are plot threads going every which way, making it difficult to become involved in the story. There are also too many hokey elements (e.g., an injured Glenn suddenly gains strength like Popeye on spinach upon hearing of his nephew's kidnapping). The gunfights are silly, with the good guys essentially supermen who brush off bullets and fight on. However, it is entertaining and the score is rousing though overused.</fullReview>

It is a very well done western, with believable bad guys, and likable heroes. There is gorgeous scenery and a fantastic soundtrack to go with it. The plot moves along at a pleasant pace and never seems hurried or too slow.There is enough action to please most any fan of westerns and most likely enough to please fans of Kevin Kline, Scott Glen, Kevin Costner, and all the others. None of the stunts seemed "over the top", unreal. I found this to be a great movie, one I can fully endorse to anyone over 13 due to the shoot outs and the occasional violence.Grab some popcorn, some soda, and get set for an action packed, enjoyable movie.

		<fullReview>Even the name gives away the genre of this movie, if you swap in your mind Scott Glenn for John Wayne, Kevin Kline for Dean Martin or Bob Mitchum, Costner for James Caan and Danny Glover for any one of the character actors the Duke retained in his entourage and Silverado would sit comfortably in the Rio Lobo, Eldorado and Rio Bravo stable of westerns.Once you do fix those role changes in your head the film becomes unfairly disappointing when you realise how much you miss the Duke and inevitably predictable.That said it was a good western with the old fashioned Black Hat/White Hat virtues of good and evil portrayed in its classic format.No surprises once you realise it is not a comedy and John Clease is really playing a straight role, and a 'feel good' ending as the genre dictates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Latter-Day Western Adventure With Excellent Cast And Great Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Old West, four drifters meet by chance on the trail to the small town of Silverado, where the corrupt sheriff is in league with the local cattle baron to run some new settlers off the land. Can anyone stand up to these bullies and their hired guns ?Written by brothers Lawrence and Mark Kasdan, this is one of my favourite westerns, a fond and lovingly directed tribute to the classic old movies and serials. It's not unfair to say that it borrows heavily from lots of other films - notably Shane and The Searchers, and in a weird way it's Rio Bravo turned inside out, but what it really is is a collection of favourite western scenes; a wagon train fording the river, a jailbreak, a canyon shootout, a town fire, a cattle stampede, a showdown on main street, what have you. It's like an old-time fifties picture, but with sparkling sharp photography (by John Bailey) and a first- rate ensemble cast. Actors like Glenn, Baker, Fahey and James (who appears unbilled) are just the right kind of casting for a western - unlike most movie movie-stars they don't look silly wearing cowboy hats, spurs and gunbelts. Dennehy is especially strong in the Judas role as Cobb the crooked sheriff, and I particularly like Glenn as the quiet, self-effacing Emmett; with his lined features and brooding eyes he embodies the classic mythology of the frontier adventurer. There's also a cracking good score by Bruce Broughton, a traditional mix of brass and strings which romps along, and if you don't feel your heart stirring as the heroes ride through the gorgeous New Mexico locations then you should be starting a lifetime subscription to the novels of Louis L'Amour right now. In the nineteen-eighties nobody had made a good western for ten years (since The Outlaw Josey Wales), and then two came out at once - Pale Rider and Silverado - both of which are terrific. If you like a good cowboy picture - and everybody should - this one is funny, exciting, action-packed and beautifully made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The is the true test of a classic, how many time you can stare at it ... not to mention that even if you're on your 20th time it's difficult to leave the room because that "line" or "that scene" are just about to come up. One of the delights of this movie are the character that pop up in each new town the venture through ... the scene with Paden and his horse, the next town and the characters with his hat ... Oh, my goodness John Cleese's Langston his part is so short yet so sweetly perfect. Then to imagine it's not until they finally arrive in Silverado that we meet the unbeatable embodiment of grace and confidence Miss Stella played by Linda Hunt and if that is enough special surprises along the way you still get to meet "Slick" (Jeff Goldblum) when he comes to town. When I read through the quotes for this movie I realized the best way to support my nine is to say the entire script should be there. My family and many others I met are obsessed with the script ... many of the lines are household phrases we use over and over again ... I think they missed ... "Yer empty Mr.". Watch for the facial expressions between Paden and Stella when they're attempting to "stay of of the middle" of the town trouble. Linda Hunt's one look, when she figures out what "Cobb has on him this time" should win her an academy award. We have a whole room at our cabin devoted to Silverado. I guess someone could watch it and say, yeah, this is kinda dull ... I guess. It's NOT ... it's all about the one liners and amazing acting ... Lawrence's other movies are great but when you see the humor than Mark Kasdan adds to things you'll be pleasantly surprised. Buy it, own it, watch it over and over and over again and we'll play "what line follows" when our paths cross.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow justice but effective and lethal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good western, and yet. For one it is slightly too slow at times. That makes the film a little bit lengthy and that is not good in a western that must have a constant rhythm and when it slows down it is to create suspense in a situation that requires it. Here we have slow scenes that are not in anyway suspenseful. The second reason is that this film has little originality. It is a clear assemblage or patchwork of many references and borrowings from all the previous westerns ever made. And it is very difficult to invent anything in 1985 after also the Morricone and Clint Eastwood films, not to speak of the black and white TV series mile Dead or Alive. It is entertaining because of the way things are assembled and that is nearly all. Two elements create some perspective. First the presence of black settlers that reveal the strong racist trend in the West. Then the character of Stella, a midget saloon manageress. But apart from these two elements the rest is pretty standard. But I must admit the setting, the scenery is particularly beautiful. Some of the mountain and desert scenes are in gorgeous natural surroundings. Then the theme of the rotten sheriff (two in the film mind you, one rotten by authority and the other rotten by the local rancher) and the theme of the rancher who decides to push away, and kill if necessary, the farmers are very ordinary and common place, and once again nothing new is really added to the theme. All these borrowing, even in 1985, make the film systematically anaphoric and that is a shortcoming. Even the street duel is banal: check in Back to the Future III, the "character" of Clint Eastwood makes that anaphoric reference a lot more creative. Not here.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

A small group of heroes take on corruption in a town. The plot has been used over and over and over. But this movie is different in the way that there is not only inner struggles between the characters, but the fact that the main character gets caught up in a bit of corruption himself, brings forth a sense of obscurity to the movie which i enjoyed.

		<fullReview>When it comes to classic westerns, add "Silverado" to the list. The story is a great one, but the movie is made more powerful by the performances of it's cast. The plot, while seemingly simple, is made more intricate as there ae really about 4 lead characters, each with his own "mission." Scott Glenn is superb as the cowboy riding to meet his brother so they can travel to California. Kevin Kline is outstanding as Paden. In a part that could have been overplayed, Kline is brilliant in his portrayal of a man in search of a place to put down roots. Not outdone by either is Danny Glover, as the man seeking to reunite with his family only to find tragedy. And Kevin Costner is hilarious as Glenn's brother, a wild fast-gun shootist. This movie has everything you could ask for; adventure, drama, humor and terrific scenery. I highly recomment this for fans of the western genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Retro Classic Western that deserves to be viewed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For whatever it's worth, I grew up on the backlot of Republic Studios. There were probably more Westerns made there than anywhere else. I knew John "Pappy" Ford and The Duke. In fact, I actually once sat on Trigger. I'd like to feel that I know something of the genre.You really can't compare Silverado to "Red River", "High Noon" or "The Searchers". These films were driven by one character (John Wayne or Gary Cooper) and Silverado is an ensemble piece. Having said that, the pieces fit very nicely.People who reject the work of the young Kevin Kostner or Kevin Kline probably don't know what fine actors they actually are. Scott Glenn gives one of the best performances of his career. Brian Dennehey, the guy you love to hate, Linda Hunt, who is totally believable. You can argue that the extirpating of the love interest harmed the film, but anybody who attempts to make a 2 1/2 hour Western these days, does so at his peril. Studios are unforgiving to those who don't squeeze everything into 120 pages.The music - Bruce Broughton's best soundtrack ever. It's John Williams level quality. The camera work matches the best you'll see in any of the classics. And there are moments. Kevin Costner's two guns shoot out, Scott Glenn's killer horse trick, and of course the final showdown between good and evil. Kasdan brought all his magic to the film. He's a wonderful actor's director and the degree of difficult shooting in New Mexico across a freezing winter is high, but brings forth spectacular landscapes.I'll never be without a copy of this film. The same goes for Red River, Stage Coach, High Noon and The Searchers. Is it as good as those classics. At some point good becomes a relative judgment call.The people who made this movie did a terrific job. If you don't see it, you've missed a great ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feel Good Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's probably the best feeling Western made since the heyday of Roy Rogers. It's specially crafted to make us feel good. There's no disturbing subtext, and it takes a very modern approach to the issue of racism. Yes, there is racism but only the bad guys exhibit it. And there's no injuns, because you can't have injuns in a Western nowadays without it dwelling on the redman's plight and that's just too depressing. That's what this film gives you: the fun myth of Manifest Destiny without the sad reality of the subjugation of the native peoples.Yes, when we were kids we played cowboys and indians, but now we feel guilty about it. Thankfully, when we were kids we also played white hat vs. black hat. Good guys with six shooters versus bad guys with six shooters. That's what Silverado taps into: the cool, still politically correct aspects of the Western. Good fun without the guilt. That's something Kasdan knows how to do. He wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark that conjured up a similar formula for the old pulp serials.That's not to say the characters are simplistic. They compare quite favorably to characters in such classic old Westerns as Stagecoach. They just don't have the kind of depressing depth of character that you see in The Searchers. There are good guys and there are bad guys and there really isn't much doubt which is which. Still, there is really only one unsympathetic character in the whole film and that would Jeff Fahey's Tyree. You've got to have one really dirty dog in the movie, after all. The two main bad guys are Ray Baker's underdeveloped Ethan McKendrick and the charming Cobb played by Brian Dennehy. It's probably Dennehy's best performance. He's Claudius in the old West, "that a man may smile and be a villain!" Yeah, those are the best villains, not the dreary scowling ones.There are four protagonists but the star is Kevin Kline as Paden. He's actually got a complex back story. He used to be a criminal and ran with Cobb! The film's approach to good vs. bad is not deterministic. Kline's performance is cool and collected, but the character really comes to life in the scenes with Linda Hunt's Stella. They have a real chemistry, they are kindred spirits. Danny Glover and Scott Glenn are solid, but it is Kevin Costner who really steals the show. This is the movie that set him on the path to stardom and he's never really given a more charismatic performance as the slightly crazy man-child samurai six shooter master Jake.Fine supporting performances are turned in by John Cleese as a sheriff with the intelligence to know when he's run across the heroes of a Western, Joe Seneca as Danny Glover's father, Lynn Whitfield as Glover's sister, the scrumptious Amanda Wyss as phoebe the barmaid, Jeff Goldblum as the gambler Slick whose alliances are always up in the air, and a curiously uncredited Brion James as the curmudgeonly coot who leads a wagon train.The plot revolves around the old conflict between farmers and ranchers. If you think about it now I'm sure you could successfully guess all the plot points ahead of time, but when you're watching it the movie's energy takes over and you just enjoy the roller coaster ride of fun and excitement!Good, clean fun about a time we know was neither, but in the movies it can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a Western. Open with a guns-blazing scene with genre veteran Scott Glenn, then run the credits through a shot straight out of The Searchers. It sure seems that this film is heading toward the same ground that almost every other Western has covered...but you'll quickly find that this one is on ground all its own.I am admittedly not a fan of Westerns. There are those that I find to be really terrific, but I can live without most of them. Silverado was the first that really showed me something other than the Fords and Hawks (classics to be sure) that I grew up with--the second was Unforgiven.Silverado takes an unlikely cast, most of whom have not seen much time in the old West, outside of Glenn. People like Costner, who for better or worse (better) is in top form. Kevin Kline and Brian Dennehy, who are both at their charming best. All the leads really shine, in what feels like a troupe effort, wherein it seems like they are a tight-knit group of co-artisans.Kasdan's direction is where it pretty much always is, so if you appreciate his work, you certainly won't be let down here. Anyone who can write and direct a great performance from Costner deserves ample praise. And speaking of the script, written by Lawrence and brother Mark Kasdan, it is really one of the best. It manages to weave all the elements of the genre around some of the best dialogue a Western's ever had. Danny Glover may have been thinking of bad Western scripts when he says, "That ain't right. I had enough of what ain't right."Still, there is something beyond all of this, something that I think I'll attribute to the collaborative nature of filmmaking, and that is the soul of the film. It presents itself as something that doesn't take itself too seriously, however it is heavy enough to carry any classic fan of the West. What may be the most amazing thing about the film, is how long it is. I believe the available print comes in right around 2 hours, and the pacing and length feel just right...but there is a longer print that adds nearly *90* minutes! Rumor has it that this print is only in the hands of Kasdan himself, and he has no plans to show it to anyone. I, for one, would nearly die to find out how there could be another hour and a half. Maybe someday...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this when it first came out on Video. I thought it was OK. Recently I got the new remastered wide screen edition and it is a delight. (I knew Costner had shot two guys at once the first time but they were standing behind my speaker system that time and I couldn't see them fall.) The 'making of' segment following the feature is really interesting too. The cast is great, the action is great, the music is great. I rate this as the last great action western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i admire much of the kasdans' work, but this one works only on a very superficial level. another reviewer said that this is a western that is only for those who are not serious western watchers. i agree.many westerns have 'exagerations', or some moments of 'truth stretching', but this movie has 'em all beat for silliness. i mean, j. Wayne shoots 14 times with a 6 shooter in 'sons of Katie', and l. van cleef has a magic gun in 'few dollars more', one whose accuracy wasn't affected by the fact that black powder residue clogged the rifling on pre 1910 weapons after a few shots. but in silverado, this 'truth stretching' goes to the 'Outer Limits'.in one scene, glover is on a roof mowing down bad guys with his rifle, and Kline, on the ground 75 yards away and perceiving an important secondary threat, gets glover's attention by shooting, from 75 yards away, the side plate of glover's rifle with a pistol shot. riiight. but then what does Danny do? he smiles a thank you, receives his instructions from some wig-wag gestures, and then proceeds to mow down more bad guys WITH THE SAME RIFLE!!! this a scene worthy of the 2nd stupidest western ever made.then there is Mr. Kline as Paden. i have enjoyed his work in the past- Fishy Wanda, Big Chill, Soapdish, etc. but his attempts at the spaghetti-western-Eastwood-wallach-type-stare are just plain embarrassing. he doesn't have a clue about the tiny little eye-muscle tics needed for an essential Super-Western eye-to-eye encounter.it's like travolta talking to devito in 'get shorty'. "look at me, martin". "i am looking at you". "are you trying to tell me that you are sleepy??" if the kasdans' had tried to make something original out of this, maybe this would have been as good as their other stuff, but they apparently tried to do a spaghetti western copy, and they did not get The Joke well enough to retell it successfully.this is a movie to own so that we can put something on for the in-laws on thanksgiving. you know, this is a western for those who do not know the western genre very well.the cinematography IS awesome, and that is what will rivet the in-laws and other losers, but true western lovers will not be satisfied by this 'top gun' styled rip-off."it couda ben a contender", but it's a joke, it's a caricature, no more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While, that may not sound like much of an endorsement, you might be surprised by the overall total number of Westerns released during the 80's. There were actually quite a lot of them, but only a few 80's Westerns like Steve McQueen's Tom Horn or Silverado, Pale Rider and Young Guns are really ever mentioned. Sure, I guess you could include The Three Amigo's and Urban Cowboy in with the mix of memorable 80's westerns. But they're not western's in the "traditional" sense of old western shoot'em up movies. The only other western worth mentioning here is 1989's Lonesome Dove. Which is one of the greatest westerns of all time, but that was a small screen 4 part mini-series, while Silverado establishes itself at the beginning credits that it's a big screen epic western. In the John Ford sense of big screen epic westerns.Speaking of that early 80's western, 'Urban Cowboy' which co-starred Scott Glenn as the ex-con antagonist to John Travolta's marriage and mechanical bull riding career. Scott Glenn is at the center of the four protagonist horse riding gun slinging nomadic cowboys in Silverado. Which includes Kevin Kline as the soft spoken mild manner gambler (until you steal his stuff) with a murky past as an ex-member of a gang of outlaws that he's forced to eventually confront.While Kevin Costner plays the brother of Scot Glenn, and 'A Rebel with a Two Gun Rig', who often finds himself in trouble when ever he tries to kiss a girl in a town. The fourth member of the four protagonists is Danny Glover, who is a butcher from Chicago and on his way to Silverado to run his family's cattle ranch, but unexpectedly partners up with the other three after being run out of the small town of Turley with the rest of the boys by Sheriff Langston, played by John Cleese. With the cowboy fab-four now firmly established, it's time for some good ol' friendship bonding stuff while west bound-and-down for Silverado. Fortunately, for the gang they run across a wagon train that was robbed while heading for (guess where?) Silverado as well. So, it's time for the 4 to save the day, and end-up getting involved with the prettiest woman (Rosanna Arquette) of any wagon train in the area, that's headed for Silverado. Which is a total of one, so you don't want to be too choosy here.Kevin Kline immediately takes a liking to the married Rosanna Arquette upon first sight, and volunteers to track down the gang of outlaws that ran off with their stolen loot and return it to the wagon trainers.He is quickly joined by Danny Glover and Scott Glenn, while his brother Kevin Costner stays behind to lead the wagons to safe passage. Rosanna Arquette's husband joins our heroes quest out of distrust that they'll eventually do the right thing, and return the money once they retrieve it from the outlaws who stole it. The decision doesn't turn out well for Rosanna Arquette's husband, and she quickly finds herself a widow who is now available to be pursued by Kevin Kline and Scot Glenn once they reach Silverado. However, the 4 member cowboy dream team each goes their separate ways just before reaching Silverado. Danny Glover being the first to part by heading toward his families cattle ranch a few miles outside the town of Silverado, only to find his father hiding in the hills after Silverado's gang of Sheriff deputies burned down the families ranch. Scott Glenn and Kevin Costner head directly into Silverado for a brief family reunion before moving on to a potential sequel that unfortunately was never made. While Kevin Kline decides to stay with Rosanna Arquette and her fellow wagon trainers, because hangin' out with a bunch of guys and horses just ain't doing it for him anymore. Fortunately, Rosanna Arquette has quickly recovered from the death of her husband, and is curious to see if Kevin Kline can fill the husband vacancy position. The two quickly realize that they don't share the same ambitions for their futures once they stop eyeballing one another and do some actual communicating. So, Kevin Kline decides to move on to the local saloon in Silverado where he ask for a job after befriending the wise old kind female bartender. She informs him that the job of saloon manager is already taken by her skimming thieving co-manager that the saloons owner stuck her with. Disappointed but not completely deterred, Kevin Kline asks to speak with the owner himself just as he enters the saloon behind him. To Kevin Kline's surprise the owner of the saloon turns out to be Brian Dennehey, who was also the leader of Kevin Kline's old outlaw gang, and is now also the Sheriff of Silverado. Unfortunately, it's the late 1800's, so none of Silverado town folk saw the movie 'Rambo: First Blood' and don't realize what a bad deal they got in the sheriff department.After Brianne Dennehey provides old buddy Kevin Kline room and board just before firing his thieving saloon partner the next day, by throwing him out into the street and shooting him, in a questionable act of self-defense. Kevin Kline becomes uneasy about accepting Brianne Dennehy's job offer to help manage his saloon. And no one can blame him.This is when fellow Big Chill alumni' Jeff Goldbloom steps out of a stagecoach and introduces himself as a professional gambler whose mother calls him slick, and would like to run an honest game in town.The stage is now set, and I'm coming to the 1,000 word limit for a IMDb movie review. The final showdown between Kevin Kline and Brianne Dennehey belongs among the all time classics of western showdowns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie brought the fun not only back to westerns but movies in general. With a stellar cast and subtle humor at the film's soul this movie also tackles serious issues such as loyalty, loss, love, and family. Although everything is wrapped up at the end it leaves you wanting more. All of the actors are in their prime and even Kevin Costner gives a great one. And Kevin Kline fit his role like a glove. Scott Glenn plays the gruff but caring older brother. You really could believe that Glenn and Costner were brothers. Danny Glover is fantastic and his character shoots as straight as he does with his acting We can only hope that these characters will be back on the big screen someday. Until then just watch Silverado and I'm sure every time you watch it you'll see something you missed last time. Even if you didn't it's still a fun film. Get it without hesitation.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the best westerns of the 80s and also a good movie that many people could enjoy. The story is solid with many subplots that keep you paying attention. At the same time the movie does a good job of sprinkling action scenes throughout the movie. The only negative of this movie is probably that it tried to do to much there were enough scenes to fill a miniseries but at least they were good.The cinemetograpy is great showing some brilliant landscapes from open desserts, dry highlands and snow covered mountains.The actors were brilliant all the way around. The main characters Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner and Danny Glover. But the Producers and directors did not stop there they hired good actors for the smaller scenes also like Brian Dennehy as the corrupt sheriff, John Cleese as another sheriff, Rosanna Arquette as a newly widowed homesteader, they even gave small parts to Jeff Goldblum, Jeff Fahey and Linda Hunt.This movies action scenes include jail breaks, bar fights, fist fights and of course the showdown.This movie stands the test of time and is good enough to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Westerns are for Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silverado was the perfect culmination of everything we like in a western. So what, if there wasn't much originality to it? So what, if it was more spoof than serious drama? The movie form was executed beautifully. The plot had much going on, but was always honed back to the humor, action, and suspense that doesn't let a moment go by as dull. Perhaps, a few westerns have outclassed it in cinematography, but Silverado has its spectacular moments. The acting, though, propels this movie. The actors in most classic westerns of the 40s, 50s, and early 60s are absurdly flabby. They never get out of their urban physicality. Scott Glenn oozes authenticity. Kevin Kostner is prized colt. Danny Glover is a real person with his own dramatic story as opposed to the "nice token good Indian/black guy sidekick", and Kevin Kline is a far more affable and identifiable hero than the stoic machismo of a John Wayne. Add in a Linda Hunt, Brian Dennehy, and a perfectly reined in John Cleese and you have quite a show!</fullReview>

Too full of mythology and outright lies and/or distortions of factual history.I saw this film the year it was released and was pleasantly surprised. Whatever the intent of the producer or director a lot of it struck me as funny since the movie contained just about every Western cliché that exists. If you didn't watch Saturday afternoon westerns on T.V. in the 1960's, you won't appreciate my sense of humor about this film.Full of archetypes, stereotypes, etc. But amusing. The casting was very good, and the film is still entertaining 20 years later. Which I suppose is why it is CONSTANTLY re-played on satellite T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the DVD documentary talks about a sequel that was written five years later, and Kasdan's heart wasn't in it, I'm sure there is value in getting this ensemble back together again. Maybe the sequel script can be modified for passage of time. But I'm sure there is still interesting stuff to mine. Maybe it would be too expensive to get that same cast together again? Anyway, I think there would be a demand.People say that point of view is the weakness of this film, but after seeing it fresh just recently I think it ends up with an appropriate structure and it keeps the perspective that "there's no telling what Paden will care about." Certainly something for Kasdan to explore in the sequel might be improving the female roles. Deleted scenes involving Patricia Arquette might also be adapted into any follow-up.For those who haven't seen Silverado at all, I think it is an excellent yarn but it could also be argued that it feels like the first half of something. It would even be interesting to see how the Cleese character might have evolved or devolved over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Silverado again this weekend again for the first time in about 15 years. It's not fair; cable stations run the same movies over and over again, and some they should abandon all together. But, this movie got lost in time.It is easy to call this movie derivative, only because Hollywood and Television made hundreds of westerns that everyone and their grandfather must've seen before this was made. That doesn't make it a bad movie--and, at least, Lee Marvin doesn't sing.I saw this movie a few times when I was in junior high, and didn't get much of a chance to see it later. I will admit, I don't think it's easy to follow, but the movie is so well made, that I don't mind watching it again to figure it out. I don't know why I didn't buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers IncludedSilverado is one of the best movies ever made. There is nothing this movie doesn't have. Great drama, comedy, gunfights, a little romance, and four great performances from the lead actors. This was Kevin Costner's breakout performance and deservedly so. I personally believe that he was never better, but I wouldn't argue against Dances with Wolves or JFK.Scott Glenn made a nice career for himself in the 80's and 90's playing supporting roles to big stars. Here, he has a large role, and is very good as the classic cowboy.Danny Glover is solid, as always, as the loner with pinpoint accuracy.Finally, Kevin Kline is absolutely wonderful as Paden. The best way to analyze Kline's performance in this film is to compare it to his other movies. I don't believe another actor has ever played such a powerful dramatic role like Paden, and then go on to win an Oscar for one of the funniest performances ever on film (A Fish Called Wanda).Silverado is one of those movies where the plot doesn't really matter. You're just so captivated by what is going on at any particular moment, that you don't really think how it relates to the rest of the movie.Just for explanation, the four gunfighters get involved with the crooked sheriff of Silverado and try to settle an old school with the McKendrick family, who patriarch was supposedly killed by Emmett, Scott Glenn's character.The reason this movie is so good is because what happens in the movie is just plain cool. Costner provides most of these moments in the film such as the moment he returns from "playing dead." Also, the best moment in the film happens when he cleverly kills two bad guys at once. The film ends with a dramatic one on one showdown that we already know the outcome of, but the suspense still carries us through.I credit Lawrence Kasdan for this masterpiece. He wrote and directed the film thereby creating all of these characters, and all of the classic moments that occur throughout the film. In addition to the leads, Dennehy, Jeff Fahey, Lynne Whitfield, Linda Hunt, and John Cleese all provide excellent performances. Kasdan has said that this movie was under marketed by the studio because the test screenings were so good. They felt the movie was going to carry itself, and backed off on the marketing campaign. That strategy didn't work, and this movie doesn't get the respect it deserves as the best western of the last 30 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Western with a decent cast and plot. Kevin Costner is fun to watch and Linda Hunt is always such fun to watch. Scott Glenn who did the villain role in Urban Cowboy plays a man who has a feud with a family of killers who also kidnaps one of his family. Danny Glover also joins in to avenge his fathers death as does Kevin Kline who has a bone to pick with the corrupt sheriff of the town played by Brian Dennehy. Only things I found annoying were the following two characters who were unnecessary and didnt belong in this movie. John Cleese's role as a Sheriff of a crooked town,he looks more like he's doing a Monty Python spoof ,he simply does not belong in this movie with his British accent nor does Jeff Goldblums lame backstabbing gambler character,main thing is Jeff Goldblum is not a good actor and his character looks more like he belongs in a drag show. Other than that,a very enjoyable flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westerns don't get much better than this. At the risk of insulting a lot of western fans, most westerns are corny and poorly made. Even some of the classics by Randolph Scott, John Wayne, and Clint Eastwood can grow weary with the passage of years and repeated viewings. Silverado is not like this. By the time the credits finish you've already been sucked in the saddle. Boasting a large, big name cast with many accomplished performers. It takes the typical western plot of good guys against bad and makes that an art form. A long film, it can get a bit tedious at times but for the most part it keeps you swept up in this entertaining saga. Bottom Line: Westerns don't get much better than this.

		<fullReview>This is a western in a style that no longer exists. Young Guns came out soon after and we've been stuck with the rock and roll western ever since. There has been a few exceptions since but basically Silverado was a film that knew what is was and tried to be the best it could. Even by the days standards it has a great cast, Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Costner, Linda Hunt, Joe Seneca, Jeff Fahey, Brian Dennehy. Not to mention the listed stars, Danny Glover, Scott Glenn, and Kevin Kline. If you insist on trying to find flaws in films I'm sure you can find some but what I like about this film is the action isn't the showpiece of the film the story is. There is no fastest gun in the west in this film, it's not about kids running amuck, or even about a bunch of hired guns. It's about people trying to get back home to tie up loose ends and go to California to make a new start, the fun of this movie is like life itself. The fun is in the journey...If you like a good western, check out this movie cause it is just plain good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stands the test of time for those of us who love the Western genre and appreciate a group of fine-looking, well-dressed cowboys. Kevin Kline in his adorable coral longjohns and aqua suede coat is worth the price of rental, and well, I'm a huge Brian Dennehy fan: he's in his prime, here. You can also see why Jeff Fahey's eyes made him famous (he also possesses just the right amount of facial hair). After this movie, I became a real Danny Glover fan, too, he is smashing and cuddly in that soft felt hat.IMDB demographics show that this movie plays well with females of a middle-age, and it probably always will. The sets, the landscapes, the costumes have great intrinsic appeal. Scott Glenn's buff-colored wardrobe is peak. There are such a wide variety of hat styles, each of them speaking perfectly to the characters' personalities (which is what cowboy hats are supposed to do: guys in the real world, take note).Since there's only one woman for us to identify with (as usual, in a Western), Rosanna was a good choice. She's cute and pert, but not a glamour queen. She doesn't even seem as anachronistic as you might think.The horses are fine, too. The scene where their breath puffs out in the brisk air and they trot through the snow is a Christmas card. Ah, to be in New Mexico or Montana...And in case you're worried about Kevin Costner, he's kind of okay in this, maybe even cute. Kasdan knows to put him in very specific, constricted set pieces, so that his limited range expands to fill the tiny space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best western's ever made. It covers all aspects of the genre and adds a terrific story, with a little romance, drama, comedy and lots of action! The musical score is superb and is such an enhancement to the film that it causes the viewer to become totally absorbed in the story line. I highly recommend this film for first time western viewers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, maybe there's not a lot of competition in that regard: Westerns have fallen on hard times in the last decade or so, and they tend to be more "revisionist/realist" types of movies (i.e., Unforgiven). Silverado is very much the "traditional" Western updated for the 80's. It has an incredible cast, from the four main leads (Glenn, Costner, Kline, and Glover), down to the secondary types (particular Brian Dennehy, but also Linda Close) down to even minor roles like Jeff Goldblum, Jeff Fahey, Roseanne Arquette and John Cleese). This is a big-budget extravaganza with the money well spent on film (the incredible scenery is filmed in all splendor), script (see quotes), and paying for a good actor for even the most minor roles.</fullReview>

The cast is like a dream, with Kline, Hunt, and Costner turning in some really smashing performances. It takes you along a basic formula Western plot -- evil fat guys doing unjust things while the protagonists decide they're not going to take it anymore -- but is set apart by humor and great characters.

		<shortDescription>I Love a Good Western, but THIS ONE?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know, maybe I'm just getting curmudgeonly in my old age. I love a good western flick as much as the next man, but when Silverado aired this morning, it just went "clunk".Perhaps what got under my skin is that it's just dripping with modern political correctness, a glaring anachronism for the time period portrayed. When John Cleese's character says "I don't much care for that word" in response to someone uttering the "N" word in a bar, I just lost it. (My late great aunt used the "N" word in polite dialog well into the 1970s, to her it was just a descriptive word with no baggage attached. I can't imagine that folks had similar heightened racial sensitivities in the late 1800s!) Of course, all of the real evil villains in Silverado are white males. All the heroes and heroines are persons of color, female, physically handicapped, or if they're cursed with being Anglo and male, they have some endearing internal conflict or past victimhood to excuse their gender and paleness. Yawn. It's really getting trite.How I yearn for the cowboys heroes of the old genre, simple unconflicted stories where good triumphed over evil, the bad guy had a black hat for easy identification, and the hero got the girl in the end and rode happily off into the sunset. John Wayne and John Ford, you are missed terribly these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable but mostly average western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Silverado" is Lawrence Kasdan's rendition of a classic western. The film's scenery and score are excellent. A number of recognizable names appear in the cast. Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Danny Glover are memorable as the defenders of justice. Kevin Costner plays his character with a sort of child-like enthusiasm, an interesting contrast to his later roles. Brian Dennehy is appropriate as the corrupt Sheriff Cobb and Linda Hunt was touching as Stella. Jeff Goldblum and John Cleese have small parts in the film. The scene with John Cleese was top-notch and I only wish he had a larger role in the film.The last half hour "Silverado" was fast-paced and enjoyable, but most of the scenes leading up to it were mostly average. "Silverado" featured a great cast, but its script could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Traditional Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Silverado" is a milestone in cinema. It's the last truly traditional Western made on a big budget. The major Westerns of the '90's have been revisionist to at least some extent. From "Unforgiven" to "Tombstone" and "Open Range," if you went back in time and played them to a 1940's audience they would storm out on the film. However, "Silverado" would have made perfect sense to them.The plot is a distillation of hundreds of classic Westerns. The script is free from profanity and is straight enough to have come out of one of the big studios of old. The film itself is traditional, with no strange angles or excessive hand camera work. Many long shots are taken, breathing air into the film in a way that reminds the viewer of John Ford's Monument Valley westerns. And most remarkably, the film ignores the gritty realism that had already come to characterize modern Westerns by the mid-80's.No big-budget Western since "Silverado" has tackled the genre in such a traditional fashion, and it's doubtful one ever will. Thankfully, it's a fine endcap to any library of traditional Westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an excellent parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a parody this movie has it all. Taciturn cowboy. (Danny Glover, "That ain't right.") Corrupt Sheriff. (Dennehy) Crooked gambler. (Goldblum) Fallen woman with a heart of gold. (Hunt). Saving the ranch. Range bullies. Dishonest wagon master. Super gunfighter. (Costner shooting two guns in two directions at once). Jail break. A Posse. (Led by Cleese) Duel in the street at the end. Hostages. Unbelievable rifle shots by Glover. The only thing missing is the fancy Double Buscadero rig and the Roy Rogers Costume. (Oh yeah. Jake does that on a Pinto horse while doing gymnastics backwards. Never mind.) This movie isn't a Western, it's THE western. There isn't a major cliché left out of it and every cliché in it is well done. To me it appears to be loosely based on John Wayne's 'Tall in the Saddle': (TITS) as we GRITS collectors call it (GRITS being Ghost Riders in the Sky). The title 'Siverado' is a play on the Edgar Allen Poe Poem entitled 'El Dorado' and is as good a tongue in cheek parody of Hollywood film making as we are likely to see any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in it's original release and thought "good flick, but hard to follow". Now I've seen what apparently is the new and improved cut and it contains many more scenes and fleshes the story out into a real western. The story line is actually coherent, the bad guys aren't cartoonish, the good guys aren't lippy, the humor is understated, subtle and hilarious, and the running dog joke goes right up to the end. With apologies to Gary Cooper etc., Scott Glenn as Emit is the Ur cowboy of all times, while Costner, Glover, and the hated Kevin Kline all turn in what may be the performances of their lives. The rest of the cast, especially Brian Denehey, turn in fine roles. Plenty of great lines, the cinematography is breathtaking, along with the stark backdrop of the southwest U.S. in winter. Which is not to say it gets a whole lot less stark in summer. bottom line. Top Western, Top Twenty all time. I'm out.howard</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once I saw the cast of this film, I decided I had to watch it. I thought such good actors could do nothing but an excellent film. Well, they can. "Silverado" is not what you expect. It Is just an ordinary western movie that doesn't give you nothing new. The plot is very old-fashioned and the situations sometimes get close to the ridiculous. Well, funny, as the fans of this movie picture would prefer to say.I won't tell you the end of "Silverado", but it is exactly what you are thinking right now. No different things or some innovations. Just the same old revenge thing. OK, I know "Silverado" is like an ode to those old "bang bang" stories, and that's why I think I can't rate it so bad, but I think Lawrence Kasdan could have make it better. The cast, as I said above, is brilliant. It's nice to see so many good players together. This group is a good reason to check "Silverado" out, so you may want to watch it. My rate 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seventeen years later and we're still waiting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: This contains a slight spoiler.For my 100th comment here, one of my favourite movies.As all fans of this movie know, the last line is an exuberant "We'll be back!" Alas, "Silverado"'s disappointing box office performance meant that 17 years after the movie's release Jake, Emmett, and the rest have yet to deliver on their promise, although Kevin Costner and Lawrence Kasdan did return to the range with "Wyatt Earp" (for my money the better of the two Earp movies that came out in the 90s - apologies to "Tombstone" advocates).Like other Kasdan movies, this has some awkward plotting working against it, but a hell of a lot of stuff working FOR it - it has every ingredient of the traditional Western (right down to the climax of a duel between hero and villain in the main street), but it's pulled off with so much verve and style that you're less interested in how original it isn't than in how exhiliarating it is."Silverado" is filled with moments to remember - John Cleese's sheriff; "Now I don't wanna kill you and you don't wanna be dead!"; Jake taking out two baddies on either side without even looking (a bit later improved upon in "Robocop"); the scenery; the cast; Bruce Broughton's fantastic music; an almost total lack of pretension...I'm getting misty-eyed just thinking about it.Personal notes: 1. The score is one of the main reasons I got into film and TV music; in addition to being one of my favourite composers, I met Broughton a few years ago, and my copy of the "Silverado" soundtrack (the Intrada CD issue, not the Geffen one mentioned in the end credits... which has less music than the CD anyway, so take that vinyl lovers!) is now a personally autographed one.(Spoiler alert. Slight one, but still...)2. If there's one flaw of the movie, it's that most of Rosanna Arquette's scenes ended up on Columbia's cutting-room floor. This is a drawback not only in terms of the plot (how come she's with Kevin Kline in the penultimate scene?) but also because when the movie came out I was a teenager in love with Rosanna, and she was a key reason in my seeing it. And "Desperately Seeking Susan" (who needs Madonna anyway when you've got that beguiling mix of quirky cuteness and unabashed elfin sensuality? And those wide eyes, that adorable voice, those... sorry, where was I?). This also explains why I ultimately didn't like "After Hours" and "The Wall" (the TV movie in Poland, not the Pink Floyd one) - if you've seen either movie, you'll understand. But deleted scenes are a plus for DVDs... and the movie's a keeper anyway.Today my review ends here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie a lot, but I'm not blind to its faults.So let me point the main ones out before singing its praises.One - it rambles, taking far too long to tell far too much story, much of which is of no consequences (there are so many stock western sequences in it that one gets the impression that, if Kasdan had thought he could have got away with it, there would have been a sequence with Indians attacking the circled wagons).Two, Bruce Broughton's main theme is so ubiquitous that it finally becomes intrusive. You don't have to use the main theme for everything, y'know - you are allowed to have other sub-themes.OK, the good stuff is headed up by the cast - this is a pretty stellar movie, and everyone in it is firing on all cylinders (Costner, do more like this, please). Next, even though much of the movie is concerned with recycling stock western situations, they are all done well. Finally, it is a handsome movie. Every frame looks beautiful.So, worth a visit, but you might get irritated with the music, and your bum may get a bit numb towards the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Westerns ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie! I could watch it every night. Favorite scenes: early scene when Emmett kills the guys who try to jump him, steps out of the cabin with the rifle on his shoulder, when Jake steps out of the saloon, says Hey! and kills Tyree and the other deputy, when Mal kills Slick, when Emmett's rifle is damaged, he dropped his pistol, but he knows he has to kill McKendrick, so he steers his horse into a building, turns it around, and wallops McKendrick in the head with the horses' hooves when McKendrick rides by, when Paden shoots Cobb, and when Mal is jumping from rock to rock with his rifle in hand. Each character has a scene which defines their personality, their willingness to do away with the bad guys, and caring about what they thought was right. All of the cast is great. Sure, the story is very simple, and has been used before, but who cares? This movie makes that type of story an epic, and so does Open Range, also starring Kevin Costner, but in a different way, because it is a different movie. Favorite characters: I like all four of the heroes, but for different reasons. I like Emmett because he is not like the other characters. He does not make jokes like they do. He just laughs at them. Of course, he probably thought that it was pretty funny when he pulled that stunt on Sheriff Langston. Emmett is just different, which is a good thing. I like Paden because he is friends with Cobb, but does not know what Cobb is doing behind the scenes until later. But when he does find out, he does not get nervous, or mad, but instead, is calm, cool, (very cool), and collected. That is why I had to watch this movie several times before I realized that Paden knows what's going on much earlier than you would think. That is because he expected that something was fishy way back at the cavalry outpost, when Cobb said he had a legitimate job. But Paden just tried to blow it off by making a joke about it because he was hoping that Cobb was not doing that kind of thing anymore. His suspicions mounted when Tyree came onto the scene, with an evil look, a sneer, and a joke about a dog to go along with his instantly not being liked by the audience. Cobb still was doing that kind of thing. It was not actually affirmed to me that Cobb was the main badguy until the scene where Cobb punches Kelly in the stomach, throws him out the door, is "warned" by Stella, and shoots Kelly. But Stella was not warning Cobb, she was warning Kelly, even though she has a distaste for Kelly, and later, hates Cobb's guts and everything else about him. I like Jake because he does not have any personal enemies, but still just comes in, and starts a ruckus. That is what makes him so funny and energetic. I like Mal because he cares for his sister and his father even when they thought he was not coming back, and Rae does not want to have him in her sight at first. He cares for his sister, that he is even willing to kill Slick, who did not do anything especially bad to Rae personally, but he did to Mal himself. That is why Mal had to kill him- he obviously did not think he deserved to live. And to top it all off, they are all VERY good shots. Favorite lines: Hey!, Where's the dog?, Welcome to Heaven, Looking for this?, Oh, Kate! Sweet Kate!, I don't want to kill you, and you don't want to be dead, and you better start lookin'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd best western of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily the best western made in the 80's after Clint Eastwood's "Pale Rider". The one place that it far outshines Pale Rider is in the large amount of humor. Pale Rider is a fantastic movie, but depressing. Silverado is a fantastic movie that leaves you smiling and wanting more. The cast is great including Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover the always overrated Kevin Costner, Brian Denney full of menace, a very slick Jeff Goldblum ( until recently engaged to a girl from my town of Winnipeg, resulting in regular sightings of him here ), and even an appearance by John Cleese from across the pond. Everybody gives great performances. Even Costner is decent, probably because he only has to play a man-child. If you enjoy a good western then this is for you. The movie starts off strong and keeps up the interest right through till the end. The length of the movie is nice too, it is long enough to develop a serious story, but not of epic lengths such as the Lord of the Ring movies, which were far too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westerns have largely gone out of style and that's a pity. Like good SF, a good western can teach valuable lessons from a perspective that makes us more amenable to accepting them.Silverado has all the trappings of a traditional western while updating it with more contemporary references. While it remains true to the usual mythology of a traditional western (strong, taciturn heroes who are impossibly good with their weapons), it also touches on more mature subjects and relationships between the principle characters.The cast is excellent. Brian Dennehy gives another excellent performance as a 3-dimensional villain. The principle good guys, Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover, and Kevin Costner are all excellent (except for Costner who only rises to the level of "very good" - a real achievement for Costner). The secondary roles, played by Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Goldblum, and especially Linda Hunt are equally well written and played.If you like westerns, and maybe even if you don't, this is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviving the Cowboy Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was one of the greatest cowboy movies made in modern times. It completely revived the cowboy genre of the "old" days - when the bad guys were bad and the good guys were good. That the good guys were slightly bad and could be redeemed. I'm tired of movies that the lines of who is good and who is bad is extremely blurred. I realize this is a black and white attitude; but in today's society, we need to return to that value. I grew up on John Wayne and Gary Cooper and Clint Eastwood movies. They were Westerns you wanted to watch - the good guys fighting for the little people and overcoming the odds (which was really impossible, we knew, but we wanted it to be that way). It harks back to the view that movies should entertain - and Silverado entertains from start to finish. I loved Kevin Kline; and Scott Glenn as the monosyllabic cowboy was fantastic. From the opening scene, reminiscent of all the good ole cowboy flicks, to the closing--maybe we'll make a sequel (extremely too bad that they didn't)--ending, you enjoy and are entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love with Kevin Costner and his character watching this movie!!! I had never seen him before but his character in Silverado is well portrayed as a carefree fun loving young adult. All his mannerisms were very endearing and unique. Scott Glenn is superb as a decent law abiding cowboy just trying to do what's right and Danny Glover's character is wholesome, earthy and strong. Brian Dennehy is great as the older villain you love to hate and Jeff Fahey is super as the younger villain who is equally as evil but a very cute bad boy. Then you have Kevin Kline who does a wonderful job playing the intelligent yet not wanting to be too serious type citizen but who always does what's right, not what's easy. John Cleese and Jeff Goldblum are terrific as well as very colorful western men. The amazing Linda Hunt is even in it as a strong woman standing her ground as is Rosanna Arquette's character. I couldn't believe it when I first saw it because of all the big names and how great all the plots were and how they were all inner twined so beautifully. I couldn't wait to find out how it all came together in the end and when it did I was not disappointed. I bought the movie as soon as I could and I still love watching it. I consider it a classic as a newer Hollywood western. I thought it was very realistic yet entertaining and exciting because of all the big names. The ones who become famous later did a fantastic job because I was immediately curious as to who they were and wondered why they weren't famous already. The action is great, the violence is effective without being too harsh, the sweet and tender moments are just right, the morals represented are wonderful even for today's lessons and I wish everyone could see it and enjoy it. It reminds me of "It's a Mad Mad Mad World" because of all that is going on and of all the stars who keep popping up while you are intensely watching it. A very great and well made movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Warning. The fullscreen version of Silverado is a truly wonderful movie, but it suffers terribly from losing so much of the image. There are many shots (no pun intended) that require widescreen to see and understand the action. The single most important example is the climax of the film - Paden and the Sheriff's old-style fast-draw - wherein the audience cannot see the action until too late. It simply doesn't appear on screen. Many of Kevin Costner's best sequences also occur off-screen or mostly off-screen. Thankfully, there has been enough interest to result in a limited widescreen release on DVD in 1999, but it has been discontinued, and is now only available used from collectors. This comment is to encourage the many fans of this wonderful film to also seek out the widescreen version. Enough interest generated will achieve results, and there are certainly many of us who want to see the version we only remember from the theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better westerns ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all these years, I finally got around to seeing it. It features the following as the four gunmen who end up banding together to fight the bad guys ...Kevin Kline as Paden , Scott Glenn as Emmett, Kevin Costner as Jake, Emmett's younger brother, and Danny Glover as Malachi 'Mal' Johnson. Each of them is an expert gunslinger. I enjoyed this one much better than most of the "pure" westerns, like 'The Unforgiven" and that type. Here we have ample humor built into the seriousness. I've always like Kevin Kline, this is the first time I've seen him as a cowboy, and he did a fine job. Costner was unknown, this may be his best performance. Overall a fine ensemble cast and an interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Westerns ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a great action western. True good vs. evil, and an interesting story. Scott Glenn and Kevin Kline lead a great cast with largely unknown Kevin Costner in arguably his best performance ever ... (sans ego). More and more out of Hollywood comes poor values (if any) and lousy role models for characters they want you to admire. In this film good triumphed over evil, at a cost, as is common in life. The climax is the showdown at the end, with a white church behind the 'good' man, as he confronts the 'evil' man. Because this film was made back when there was still a hint of morality in the country, (long since extinct) you don't have the swearing and filth you see in almost all films today. It just proves that you can have a great story, good acting, and a positive message without all the damaging filthy talk and nudity they put in most films today. California must surely be the ghetto of America with what they promote as 'entertainment'.The sound effects for the gunfire were true to the types, and even today is hard to find in a movie. Loud is not the same as accurate.The music is excellent ... I have played much of Bruce Broughton's music in my banding days. I highly recommend this movie ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The West Is Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this on television, wishing I had gone to see it at the movies. But I didn't know who Kevin Costner was then. I didn't know who Danny Glover, Scott Glenn, or Kevin Kline was, either. But when I first saw this movie, my eye was on just Kevin Costner. I thought he played a goofy roll, but there was just something about it that clicked with me. I am a western movie fan a hundred percent. I love the wild west. Silverado was the perfect example of the west. It has beautiful scenery, a great cast, four men who believe in truth, justice, and the American cowboy way. My favorite part is when Kevin Costner kicks in the saloon doors and comes out to kill two at once. Sensational! The only problem I have with this movie is that there isn't enough of Kevin Costner in it. I was left wanting more, more, and even more. He has an adorable laugh too. linda Hunt as the little saloon keeper was great. John Cleese as the sheriff was humurous. Everybody did their parts to perfection. This is truly a 10 plus movie. We need more westerns made in the movie making business. Silverado proudly can sit amongst Dances With Wolves, Open Range, True Grit, How The West Was Won, Wyatt Earp, Cheyenne Autumn, and the list goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched "Silverado" again after finding the DVD for $9.00. It is still a pretty good movie to watch. I remember when the movie first showed that it revived the western genre. Still a better movie than 2003's "Open Range". I noticed a few similarities between the movies, minor but still similar. Costner(not a big fan) does a much better job in Silverado than in his flat acting style of late. I wonder where his acting got sidetracked? A strange mix of actors but they all did a credible job. Gosh, I wish Duvall would have been in "Silverado". 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SILVERADO (1985) *** Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Danny Glover, Kevin Costner, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, John Cleese, Jeff Goldblum, Rosanna Arquette, Jeff Fahey, Richard Jenkins. Filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan's salute to the American Western sets his oater in the wilds of the grand frontier with a quartet of unlikely friends facing villainy in the form of corrupt self-made man and sheriff of the terrorized eponymous town. The four cowboys make fine compadres a la `The Seven Samurai' and it should be noted that Kasdan wrote Costner's part to be broad and goofy in kind for his omission of the actor from `The Big Chill' ; smart move-it opened the door to stardom wide open. Some fine stunt work and intricate gunplay make it an above average genre flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie for anybody who loves the classic westerns. The plot is your basic western plot, and done well! Scott Glen is Emit, the unwilling hero just released from prison for killing an evil cattle baron, and Kevin Costner is his 'Billy the Kid' brother on the way to Silverado. Along the way, They meet Paden, played by Kevin Kline, the soft spoken gunslinger, and Mal, played by Danny Glover, who fights his own fight on prejudice. The supporting cast is great too!All of the hallmarks of the old westerns are built into the plot as well. You have the wagon train, the bandits hiding in a box canyon, the saloon with gamblers, and the tough as nails bar maid played by Linda Hunt,.......it's all here! (Well, except Indians on the war path)This should rank right up there with the John Wayne, and Clint Eastwood westerns. When it came out, there was a lot of speculation that more westerns to come, and they did! A genre that some people felt that was dead as the do-do.</fullReview>

Maybe too many stars who had to give up screen time to each other, maybe the old fashioned Western theme and plot, maybe a studio that missed the boat on promoting it too weakly.

		<fullReview>I finally was able to see this movie and wow was I in for a treat. I am not a mayor western fan, but I am a great admirerer of that rare thing in Hollywood movies: A Good Script. Great characters with a lot of depth and real lives walk around in Silverado and do stuff. Not because of the story, but because of who they are. Even the women are completly fleshed out and no, I am not talking about the size of their breasts. Kevin Kline is brilliant and after seeing him last week in The Wild Wild West, he completly redeemed himself, even though Silverado was made 25 years before that turkey. Even Kevin Kostner did a great job (and didn't end up on the cutting table like in the other great Kasdan movie, The Big Chill). Only the music is dated in this wonderfull adventure, were you are really scared that one of the main characters may end up dead. Because Kasdan is not playing by the rules, you get something even rarer then a great script; a western without cliches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment has a spoiler, but, as the film is 15 years old, I don't think that's really a concern. I first saw this on opening day and I still enjoy watching it on DVD, just last night, in fact. It certainly ranks in the top five of all time. The best scene in the film is during the shoot out at the ranch. Jake (Kevin Costner) has been declared dead from falling off a horse. When he swung down from the rafters to help Paden (Kevin Kline) in the barn scene shoot out,the audience broke out into cheers an applause. I've never seen another western that brought out such a reaction from the audience before or since. My only disappointment is that there was no sequel. At the end of the movie, when Jake calls out, "We'll be back!" as they ride off, I thought a sequel would soon follow. But, I suppose that Costner's rate probably went too high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern western classic. 10!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll tell you how much I like this movie. I bought the VHS and soundtrack. Six weeks later, I learned of its DVD availability, I immediately bought it.I can't think of another Western in the 15 years since this film was released that I've enjoyed more, not even "Lonesome Dove", and that's saying a lot. I was praying that it would be released on DVD and it's nice to know my prayers were answered.The cast is one of the finest of the mid-Eighties: Danny Glover, Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner, Jeff Goldblum, Linda Hunt, John Cleese, and Brian Dennehy. And these are just the principals.Silverado is a sweeping Western demi-epic that takes some classic genre cliches and weaves them into a modern classic, emboldened by Bruce Boughton's masterful score. The master of this all is co-writer and director Lawrence Kasdan, who has given us some other gems like "Body Heat" and "The Big Chill".The DVD release is great news and I was only disappointed that it didn't include additional scenes featuring Rosanna Arquette, deleted from the theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While riding to Silverado to meet his brother Jake (Kevin Costner), the lonely cowboy Emmett (Scott Glenn) meets Paden (Kevin Kline) and Malachi 'Mal' Johnson (Danny Glover) in peculiar situations and they become friends. Along their journey to Silverado, they join and protect a caravan of new comers. In Silverado, they find a group of bandits frightening the locals under the protection of Sheriff Cobb (Brian Dennehy), and they join forces to fight against them. This western movie is spectacular. Yesterday, I saw it for the first time, and in 2004, it is amazing the cast joined by Lawrence Kasdan and the producers. With lots of funny situations, full of action, politically correct, with the `good guys' winning the `bad guys', it is impossible not to like this film! The role of the agile Kevin Costner, in the beginning of career, is very funny. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Silverado'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four cowboys struggle against bad direction to make a throwback western script come to life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner play four cowboys struggling against bad direction to make a throwback western script by the writer of such classics as The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Some fare better than others. Danny Glover makes a lion sized effort. Scott Glenn is nearly convincing. Kevin Kline and John Cleese seem to have the least respect for the genre and their place in it, and give entirely unconvincing performances. Kasdan, an engineer of the beloved Star Wars saga, made his much-loved directorial debut with The Big Chill, which he also directed, and my theory is that he should stick to scripting. The script of Silverado is great fun, providing plenty of material for a terrific western, but the weaknesses are all in the making of the actual movie. Kasdan clearly was not a source of strength on set, for starters, as no-one exhibits a sense of being comfortable in what they're doing, let alone the sense of bravura we're used to in a good western. If you came here for fun and excitement, can I suggest you try The Quick and the Dead instead, which is a much more unique film, anyway; and if you came here for beauty, likable characters and an epic western, go to Dances with Wolves instead, its terrific! Lastly, if you were after comedy, I'd suggest you go to a comedy. My favourites are Groundhog Day and This Is Spinal Tap. Silverado was not a comedy script to begin with, it was just a rollicking action/adventure western with some solemn extended speeches. However, if you're young or haven't seen many westerns, you just may think this is as good as it gets, so go ahead, make your day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know there might be trouble in Dodge City when Kevin Costner gives the most endearing Performance in an All Star Cast. But that's not the only problem with this Entertaining, but surprisingly flat, supposed Homage to the Classic Western.It sure is a bloated and beautiful Film, full of many things but shallow to the point of distraction. Clichés are here by design and that is acceptable but that's not enough. There has to be something more, something to make this stand out as its Big Budget demands. Actually the horses and cows show as much panache as the Cast.Everyone seems underwritten and unresolved accept at the most superficial levels. There are jarring inconsistencies in the Editing and the Gunplay is so sterile that it hardly penetrates beyond old TV Stuff. There are some things that make this watchable, notably the Scenery and Costner's before Stardom, free-style of a Jitterbug, Pulpy, twirly Hotshot.Overall, it is a mild and Family Friendly Western done in an era of blood filled Screens. A definite throwback but without much Style. It just sort of is there for the Popcorn Crowd and is a somewhat Overrated Oater that has some charm but not enough to make this anything more than slightly above Average.</fullReview>

Amazing that Kevin could learn and grow from this terribly trite and predictable movie. It was your typical, unbelievable good guys versus bad guys film set to a Western theme. There are just enough auxiliary "good people" to get killed by the bad guys and then look out, the good guys are coming to wipe out all the bad guys and not even have their hair come out of place. It is so cliché and pathetic how each good guy killed his appropriate bad guy. Okay, if you have nothing to do some evening watch this movie, listen to the soundtrack (which is actually pretty good, best thing about the movie) and eat some corn. But if you have anything else to do then I suggest you skip this movie and go do it. Maybe a 4.5 out of 10 is the rating for this movie.</fullReview>

Kasdan has scooped up all the big names from the mid-eighties (that's 1980's, you dolt!) and plunked them down in a bland blob of movie-western goo that will appeal to women in their early 30's, children of all ages, and anyone who has never seen a western before.For myself, the only part of this nonsense worth watching was John Cleese, a very British gentleman sort of sheriff, whose best line, when confronted with trouble in the local saloon, asked, "What's all this then?" Do yourself a favor and skip the movie. It's going to take you two hours just to diagram Cleese's question (and your time will be better spent).</fullReview>

Kevin Costner started earning his "wooden" reputation on this one, and Berenger is relentless. The plotline is internally inconsistent.
