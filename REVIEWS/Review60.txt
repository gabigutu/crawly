		<shortDescription>Beautifully done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a great time with this one! It really succeeded where few monster movies manage to. It provided tension, scary moments and it did made me hold my breath!Beside this year's The Shallows, we got In The Deep, which is a beautifully shot movie, good acting, nice reactions, pretty much the whole nine yards here. It was a great little movie, I'm just sad it didn't get the attention it should have. People need to know that this is not another low budget shark movie, but a damn good one!Watch it and you will not regret. It provides a great, great atmosphere and surely enough, most of you will enjoy it.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent underwater great white shark survival tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two women become trapped in a cage 47 meters below the Mexican waters.It's been a long time since there have been modest budget serious well produced shark films, then in 2016 two come along at once. Thankfully, In the Deep's set up is quite different to The Shallows, but it shares the same high production values and execution. Director Johannes Roberts offers a novel, tense, at times claustrophobic great white film that will leave you gasping for air. Sisters, one in the mist of a breakup Kate (Claire Holt) and wilder worldly travelled Lisa (Mandy Moore) are restless in the safety of a hotel pool and room in Mexico. Coincidently, Roberts like in The Shallows adopts the film technique of texts, in this case Lisa's ex, popping up on screen, breaking the fourth wall. With Kate being upset the sisters go on a night out and meet two locals, who they later hook up with for a meal and kiss. The next day after a motorboat ride they all go on a $100 each cage dive on a rickety boat, the Sea Esta. Matthew Modine is the captain of the unofficial excursion and his extended cameo, which is mostly a soothing voice on a radio advising the inexperienced divers on what and what not to do. Modine offers some weight and star power to the film as a everyday sailor Taylor. Like the aforementioned film, it's also different to Jaws, The Reef and the like and stands on its own. Although, writers Ernest Riera and Roberts sacrifice developing Modine's functional character in place of getting the sharks on screen quicker, they put enough into brunette Moore's self-conscious Lisa and carefree blonde Holt's characters for you to invest their fate. They have an arc from the nightclub holidaymakers to strong women striving to survive.When the sea-hand Javier (worthy of note Chris J. Johnson) starts chumming - a shark, approximately 25 foot shows up, bigger than those on the Discovery Channel or in the National Geographic. After the two locals try the first cage as the huge shark circles, the two nervous but excited sisters have their turn with their diving masks and tanks checked. Suffice to say, it all goes wrong when the rusty winch breaks and the the girls descend 47 meters. What follows is a survival test, trapped in the cage at first, then running out of air as they make attempts to move the winch, swim from the bottom ocean floor in the aggressive shark infested waters, to get more air in various ways etc. Only to be thwarted by the finely realised, terrify sharks. With sharks attacking from nowhere there are some genuine jump scares which are heightened by the sound design and tomanddandy's music. Mark Silk's cinematography really shines, not just on the surface but below water. It's not just the confines of the cage that add chills, it's the vast ocean open space, the silence of being submerged and void beyond the sea cliff's edge. Notable there's a scene with their radio's out of range, Lisa tries to communicate with the surface leaving herself venerable in the endless salt water. Going beyond the sea floor cliffs edge later underwater Kate swims, stopping on top of a protruding rock deep below the blue sea. The unseen giants overshadow each move the women make with the threat of an attack at any moment. Every time the sisters leave the cage you feel the edgy chill of the imposing sharks.Anyone scared of the water will no doubt get glass-boat diving chills out of In the Deep. And those who love shark films will not be disappointed with the whites on display as they attack, from below and on the sea floor with only cave recesses and the eroding cage to protect the sisters. Roberts keeps the pressure on as things get worse when a diver is killed and the second attempt to save them goes awry. There's also a fearful doubt throughout that those topside have left them. We get plenty of blood-filled wince moments with the cage crushing Kate, spear gun cuts, shark bites and flares. As they fend off the predators when trying to get air tanks and get to the top it never slows in pace. In addition, Riera and Roberts add an interesting surprise Gravity, Descent-like twist in the tense final act.Overall, a fine and welcomed addition to the killer Carcharodon carcharias genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty solid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a scary shark movie i found it totally worked. Of course the intro, party scene &amp; the boys are what you'd expect for this genre, and had me wondering if I'd make it to the end due to all the cliché.But it did take of from there nicely, had some genuine holy f*ck moments, a pretty good pacing and had me wondering all the way if the girls would make it to the end...The camera work was great and the sharks well done (a bit too aggressive for total realism, but hey). The ending was also original, for once!Compared to The Shallows, I'd say it's equally solid in terms of entertainment value and getting you hooked until the end.Overall I don't regret having watched it for a minute, a solid 7 in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blows The Shallows out of the water !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you consider the amount of crap shark films that keep popping up it's pretty wise to be cautious about watching any........this one however is more than worth a watch........and considering ide never even heard of it until I stumbled on it filled me with dread as I pressed the 'play' button. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised.....for me it knocked socks off that tripe The Shallows........there is plenty of shark action and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat with the sheer terror and suspension involved. I never go into story telling in my reviews as that's what trailers are for etc, but far as im concerned it's a solid and believable tale that in all fairness could have been done way before now with a bigger budget and better actors. If you can grit your teeth for the first 15 mins and ignore the ott and annoying acting of one of the girls then you should enjoy this film........don't want to spill anymore........enjoy......and I really don't care if you find this review useful.......just saying my piece ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted ending that will leave you saying WTF!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love shark movies, lately all the shark movies coming out have been lacking intensity, entertainment &amp; a realistic feeling. And then there is IN THE DEEP, I saw The Shallows and I liked it don't get me wrong. In the deep made me more than like it, it left me dazed. Don't worry I won't spoil the movie for those that haven't seen it. All I can say is this movie is defiantly worth a watch. Kudos to the director for making the scenes so intense and edge of your seat. Also the tones of the movie were perfectly set and gave you chills. The ending was crazy!Two sisters on Mexican vacation are trapped in a shark observation cage at the bottom of the ocean, with oxygen running low and great whites circling nearby, they have less than an hour of air left to figure out how to get to the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying Shark movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Deep" is just simply a terrifying shark movie. It spends very little time on character development early on, and gets to its point quickly. This is a shark attack movie that really delivers. Not so much in terms of gore or violence, but at the level of stark fear and dread.Actors all do fine jobs, with no real standouts, and the main players convey a very believable feeling of terror. We feel we are underwater, very deep underwater, in a terrifying world where sharks rule the day. Among recent serious shark shockers, I'd rate "In the Deep" just below "The Reef" (simply horrifying) for sheer shark terror, and a little above "The Shallows" (a good film, but this one out-scares it)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last! A shark movie without a "RoadRunner/Coyote"-ish end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ITD is actually a very good surprise! It has nothing to do with the other shark movie SHALLOWS which actually has an end easily borrowed from the world of the cartoon "RoadRunner/Coyote". Here the things seem to be more real and more serious; there are a couple of plot questions/issues but they will not bother you. To my opinion, they are minor and can be without doubt excused for the shake of the whole plot. The movie is for people who like agony, suspense, tension and of course water and sharks. Except sharks, antagonist is also Time (equally important), and that combination makes a very stressful and explosive situation. I also think that you have the best/top reactions during your first watch since you do not know what will happen the next moment. Watching it for a second time will not be the same; most of the magic has gone. But after all, this applies to every thriller, and ITD is a damn good shark thriller... and it has also a damn good twist-plot at the end, unusual and unexpected for a shark movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Shark movie, but a little different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now let me say I enjoy a good shark movie. I had just seen the movie 'The Shallows' a couple weeks before this movie. There is a similarity between these two movies. Trapped in the ocean, shark/sharks after you. The big difference is in this movie they are trapped underwater. The people in this movie are going on a shark cage dive. Basically that's when they drop a cage in the water and put out bait for sharks so you can go in the cage and observe them up close, yes people actually pay to do this. But something goes wrong here and the cage snaps from its crane and they fall to the ocean floor trapped in the cage with just the air tanks they had to take a quick dip in the cage to observe. Now this movie has a lot of sharks after them. The bait they put in the water attracted a lot of white sharks. This is another movie built on tension. Now in this movie a lot of the tension is eye rolling self imposed. Needless risks a person would never take to try to survive. (My eyes rolled more than once) There really was some nail biting scenes where you would have bet everything the shark was coming to get one of the people...and it didn't. The element of surprise was on their side in this movie as far as the effectiveness to the viewer. Multiple times you think its over and they are going to make it and they get setback. It works for the movie. The ending was somewhat satisfying but a little optimistic. Overall, with all the garbage shark movies out in past, this one was alright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than the movie I expected to watch!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I haven't watched the Shallows yet, so can't compare the two, but as a stand alone movie, I enjoyed it and it had an awesome little twist at the end that I didn't see coming even though I watch easily 60+ movies a month, It's not the greatest of acting at the beginning, but it's all believable and they did a great job making this film, easily the best Shark movie I have seen in years and would be happy to recommend it to any one who enjoys a good shark movie, honestly first time since I watched Jaws that I was actually jumpy of getting back in the water, on a serious note though there are a lot of movies out there with much bigger budgets that don't deliver any where close to a movie this good, granted, no one will win any Oscars, but the acting is believable even if it's a little over the top at the start, the directing was spot on and considering they wear masks for large portions of the movie, I felt invested in the characters. more than I could say for many of this years block busters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A for Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im currently watching this movie again. Yes, that's how much this movie rocks for me! I am a shark movie fanatic and every time there's a shark movies coming out I always anticipate it to be a good one. Probably one that really left a mark was Hally Berry's Dark Tide ages ago. After watching In The Deep I was completely blown away and was left with such great satisfaction. I love Mandy Moore and this movie is a perfect way of getting back since we haven't really heard from her for a long time. This movie is just a breath of fresh air. Not too commercial with overrated publicity. Just yesterday I recommended this to a friend and she absolutely loved it! Definitely this is way better than The Shallows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Deep (2016) is a low-budget horror that centres around two sisters trapped in a cage at the bottom of shark-infested waters. However, these aren't any regular sharks, they're dipsh*t great whites that love to play hide n'seek with they're prey. That shouldn't bother you too much though as the director also enjoys playing hide n'seek with the plot. It's hard not to mention The Shallows (2016) when reviewing ITD. Aside from the obvious play on titles, ITD has been riding on the coat- tails of it's highly advertised competition, and I imagine that many of it's viewers (myself included) watched this film to avoid paying the price of a cinema ticket for The Shallows and chose to simply wait until it's DVD release instead.This film is a perfect example of the 'you get what you pay for' cliché, aiming and achieving mediocrity in all the different categories; directing, writing, acting etc.I didn't dislike this film and, as I have yet to watch The Shallows, this film served as completely sufficient appetiser. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but it was pretty inoffensive schlock and successfully achieved it's goal; which was to leech off The Shallows fan-base and appeal to the lowest common denominator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A troubled girl on vacation with her sister in Mexico confronts her inadequacies by diving with sharks, but the sharks don't co-operate and the oxygen starts to run out ...The first thing I spotted was gorgeous colour scheme, which sets up a nice exotic feel to the story. We get to the underwater stuff at a decent pace, and some of the photography is good but overall it's too vague and murky. The use of the spotlight is clever.Sadly the characters are a bit bland, not enough opposition in the dialogue, and as the plot progresses the squealy girly incompetence causes low-level irritation. The guys are incompetent too, and none of the characterisation established early on has a bearing on the outcome - although there is the element of overcoming fear. The performances were good, but the actors didn't have enough to work with.Plenty of shark action, but they don't have much presence - I'd expect them to be a character like a haunted house, with its creaking beams and shadowy depths. So the writing was just above competent. But there is a decent twist, that could have turned the underwater experience into a weird hell-hole. Not so much.Sound-wise, I didn't notice much. Nothing special.Overall: Well paced, a bit shallow. 6/10.</fullReview>
