		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 is Totally Worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason this movie had not been getting the greatest critic reviews. I do not understand that at all. I thought the movie was very enjoyable and a successful sequel in the series.For anyone who has seen the first Iron Man you can expect much of the same in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark like he is meant for the part. He has the same sarcastic wit and self-confidence that is evident in his other movie roles. Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. I also personally love that Jon Favreau is the driver for Stark/Potts, and that he gets into the action a little bit. You have to respect the director for that, even though Jon has done plenty of acting himself.Normally in when they replace someone in a sequel with a different actor/actress I am very upset. However, Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy. This is similar to what happened with Maggie Gylenhal in the Dark Night.Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks.All in all it was a well done sequel. The plot is not too convoluted to follow. The new villain, played by Mickey Rourke, is very impressive and fun to watch. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. The only thing that I wished for leaving the theater was a longer final fight scene.Also, make sure to watch after the credits!! It is short, but worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile action-packed sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr was the best reason to watch the first Iron Man film since he seemed to slide into the role of Tony Stark so flawlessly and effortlessly. RDJ is just as amusing and fun to watch in Iron Man 2. If there were any doubts left over from RDJ's portrayal of Tony Stark from the first film, they're inevitably washed away with his convincing performance in the sequel. Newcomers Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, and Scarlett Johansson are just as impressive. Rourke has been on an incredible streak since The Wrestler and puts in another solid performance here. His Russian accent is pretty spot on and he shows a wider range of emotion than you may not be expecting. Rockwell has been on my "actors to keep an eye on" radar since Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. I thoroughly enjoyed his smarmy performance as Hammer, who has all of the tools at his disposal to make as big of an impact on the world as Tony Stark has only to wind up falling short in the long run. The flirting between Tony and Johansson's Natalie Rushman is pretty captivating, but her crowning achievement is her fight scene in the latter half of the film that practically steals the show. Don Cheadle does have a few humorous one-liners and is great as War Machine, but doesn't really add anything that Terrence Howard already established with the role in the first film. It's slightly disappointing since Cheadle is known for his strong acting roles, but may be a result of the way the Capt. James Rhodes character was written for both films.While the film is a worthy sequel, it does contain a few small flaws. What is it with Hollywood films lately having the climactic battle during the finale last five minutes or less? Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Clash of the Titans, and Iron Man 2 all share this trait. It doesn't take away from the fact that the conclusion to Iron Man 2 is still pretty satisfying, but my mindset seems dead set on thinking it's more satisfying when the antagonist has the advantage. He or she gains the upper hand and there's that moment where you think they may bring their evil plan to fruition before the protagonist outsmarts the antagonist for the win. When that last battle seems short, it makes it seem like the villain was all talk. Speaking of the action sequences though, they're spectacular and twice as big as the action in the original film. The problem is that the action seemed to get blurry during several of the more hefty action scenes. I'm not sure if it's because it's the way it was shot or what, but it made it seem like there was too much going on in the film to fully process in post-production or something.Iron Man 2 is an extremely satisfying sequel on all accounts. While the original film is probably slightly better, the sequel does everything right and doubles up on everything in comparison; action, strong characters, teases for upcoming Marvel films, etc. Despite some of its early negative criticism, Iron Man 2 delivers a worthwhile sequel with a fantastic cast and spectacular action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another magnificent superhero sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading Iron Man 2's plot summary, things sound bleak for our characters. But not at all. This is a breezy, light-hearted, inoffensive affair that saunters at a magnetic pace, with emotional discomfiting a far thought. Which is pretty refreshing, to say the least. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the complete of antithesis of recent comic book movies. For one, it certainly isn't darker than its predecessor, absent its slow-burning first half and latched-on social commentary. It also gives itself the poetic license to stretch credulity. This is a movie about a man who flies around in metal suit, blasting away multicolored-haired Russians with electric whips. Realism simply doesn't apply, and thankfully director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux take affectionate liberty with the bonds of belief. Yes, Ivan Vanko can secretly build super technology unbeknownst to his suppliers. And yes, the only way to incapacitate a drunken Tony is to beat the crap out of him in a Iron Man suit. No complaints here! Iron Man 2 is also very much Iron Man's superior, although partly by default. The first movie was stuck with a pedantic origin story. However, the sequel had no shortage of possible paths to take. Which did it choose? The way you should always go; the road of characterization. Rather than tediously expand upon its universe, Iron Man 2 simply reprises its dramatis personae and sticks them into situations graver than before, upping the ante but reiterating the overall heart and spirit of its predecessor. The characters are well-etched, each snappy exchange rendered with a mature pathos that contrasts with the spurious scenarios that they feature in between of. Iron Man 2 could easily be called a comedy, but the naturalism of the comedy is seamless; you get the sense that it would be impossible to write this movie without having these vibrant characters joke and jeer.To bring the clever screenplay to life is the phenomenal cast. Robert Downey, Jr., as always, is effortlessly captivating. Charisma defined and an scandalously unsung master of versatility (he's not just playing himself, people!), it's no breaking news that he's still one of the most watchable actors ever. He is the perfect Tony Stark, and a more-than-worthy representative of the thinking man's action star. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow as the pragmatic Pepper Pots is electric, and she too turns in a fine performance. Wistful, but by no means a damsel in distress, she is probably the realest character.The baddies, just as essential as the hero, don't disappoint either. Another wrong from last time round successfully remedied is the lack of genuinely menacing villains. Jeff Bridges honored us with his always-welcome presence in Iron Man, but his warm affability was anything but menacing. This time, however, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (oddly, both novices to blockbuster attention) are on duty, offering more than enough bang for your villainy buck. Rourke as Anton Vanko/"Whiplash", supplements a composite of the unintentionally hokey showman, supercilious mastermind, and the seemingly unstoppable behemoth. This effectively fends off one-noteness, and Rourke perfectly embodies the duality of Vanko's deceptively boorish visage and surprisingly vast intellect, while still indulging in the welcome irreverence that comes with the comic book villain (his Russian drawl is humorous but gives him an otherworldly conviction).Rockwell, on the other hand, is flat-out comic relief as Stark's weaselly rival ? though not necessarily a threatening one ? Justin Hammer. He is excellent in the part; an absolute delight to watch, whether irascibly mugging in a loss for words with his insubordinate partner Vanko or, in one of the movie's best moments, shamelessly accolading his own (faulty) inventions with juvenile zeal.Unfortunately, with all these characters butting heads for screen time, co-stars Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson as Tony's pal Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes and eventual partner War Machine and alluring temptress of a new assistant Natalie Rushman, respectively, are given the short straw. Both are more than able of carrying a scene, but while the script lavishes Tony with many moments in which to brood his way into some fine character development, and to convey Pepper's many grievances, neither supporting character is as lucky. Cheadle's moments of potential are all obstructed by the War Machine suit, and everything otherwise requires him to lucidly voice reason as a foil to the devil may care Tony. Johansson is a non-event, her Natalie Rushman an amoral nothing role, and her Black Widow guise is not so much daring femme fatale as listless sex symbol. She acts as merely a vessel for fan service, be it in her skintight suit for the general audience or that she represents another stepping stone to an Avengers movie for esoteric comic book fans.The movie is inter cut between the scenes of terse characterization and octane action. The latter is a dizzying combination of rapid vicissitudes and toe-to-toe skirmishes, high on CGI, low on genuine peril. In fact, Iron Man 2 could quite possibly have been a masterpiece of the genre had it lived up to its first forty minutes of exuberance and intrigue. But once the clumsy pugilism of Iron Man and Whiplash takes place, the movie falls flat. The power play is nonexistent, because it's hard to believe anyone could stand a chance against ol' Shellhead. And if no sense of alarm can be conveyed when Iron Man is caught in an unusually melee showdown, the flight sequences leave no impression. Yes, the special effects are astounding, but it's all for nothing if there's no dramatic undercurrent.Otherwise, please, don't mistake my raving for fanboy hyperbole; Iron Man 2 is great. It's well-written, well-acted, and simultaneously a loving throwback to comic book norm and a break from recent tradition. It's a rare occurrence to be thankful for, because God knows if this follows the superhero trilogy formula, the third one will suck. Which would tragically make this movie's thrilling departure from cliché null and void.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time for an Upgrade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to Marvel studio's surprise hit of 2008 is here, bigger than ever. But is it better? After the surprise success of Iron Man, expectations for the sequel, from both movie viewers and long time comic books fans, were no doubt high.Picking off where the first film ended, billionaire genius Tony Stark has just revealed to the world his identity as the armor clad superhero, Iron Man. Now he reaps the whirlwind consequences of his actions as both the military and unscrupulous competitor Justin Hammer vie to obtain the secrets of Stark's Iron Man technology for their own gain. Too add to the flames, Stark soon discovers that the very technology that is keeping his heart alive is also poisoning him. As he tries to salvage a life that is slowly falling to pieces and his growing feelings for his long time assistant Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow), Starks has to contend to with a foreign weapons genius named Ivan Vanko who seems to bear a deep seated grudge against the ailing billionaire; a grudge that stemmed from the legacy of Tony's father, Howard Stark.Whatever was good in the first movie is carried on in true sequel fashion. The acting and chemistry among the cast is definitely the highlight of the whole film. Robert Downey Jr IS Tony Stark, though less of a playboy following his "change of heart"(figuratively and literally) in the first movie, but still the same wisecracking, smirky eccentric. Everyone is just so natural in their roles including the villains, especially The character of Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Hammer had all the makings of a silly one dimensional villainous caricature, but manages to be a well rounded scumbag of a corporate competitor, providing some excellent comic relief while still presenting a credible threat to the hero.That being said, the script is just littered with witty banter, intelligent jokes and a good number of "Easter eggs" for the long time comic book fans. Writer Justin Theroux had a good number of interesting themes going for this movie, most notable of which is the theme of "legacy", of what people leave behind when they are gone; their impressions on their successors and how the effects of their past actions would echo down the years long after one has passed. Stark himself, faced with his inevitable demise, does not want to leave a legacy of death as a weapons designer. Aside from that, we see how the legacies of both Stark's and Ivan Vanko's fathers have affected their present lives.Now, Vanko's (played by Sin City's Mickey Rourke) is a truly tragic tale. It is easy to pass him off as a "darth maul" type character with no other purpose than to provide the hero with a powerful opponent for the mandatory climax. But to the more attentive viewers, one can see how Vanko is basically the dark opposite reflection of Tony Stark. Both are geniuses, both are where they are because of their respective fathers yet different circumstances in life brought them down entirely different paths. The parallels between his origin story of creating the "whiplash" powered armor from scrap, getting captured(in a similarly explosive manner) in order to develop weapons for one man to bring down his competitor all the way to his cunning escape plan and his mistaken impression about his dearly departed father are all uncannily similar to Tony Stark's experiences in the first movie that led up to his debut as the hero Iron Man and his mistaken impression about his own father.The one thing viewers might not appreciate is that this sequel seems to lack that sense of "fun" that the first film had, taking on a more serious tone at times to dish out the more complex themes and even a romantic sub-plot. It really is too bad that the more complex themes are there but not really expanded upon. This leaves a lot of "could have been more" moments hanging by the time the show ends. At least the action is satisfying high octane eye candy as Jon Favreau's steady directing hand brings out the intensity of every battle scene. Special effects are top notch as usual except for a couple of cartoony looking moments that do require some suspension of disbelief, for example the briefcase that transforms into an iron man armor with armor parts seemingly appearing from out of nowhere.By the time the all too familiar final battle is over and the credits start rolling, one gets the impression that Iron Man 2 could have been a lot more than the sum of its parts. A little longer running time would have fixed most of the story kinks but perhaps Marvel is merely using this movie as a money generator and spring board to something greater.(Blatant teasers are thrown into the narrative itself almost like a running catalog of future Marvel film projects).Topping the first film is no easy feat and of course Iron Man 2 would disappoint a few here and there. But it is nonetheless one of the most entertaining comic book movies that mixes action, wit, drama and cast chemistry so well. If widespread appeal is its purpose, then Iron Man 2 has fulfilled that function magnificently in that even a newcomer to the franchise can kick back and enjoy the show. Marvel studios has started a new legacy beyond great comics. Here is a legacy of comic book movies, true to the spirit of its source material yet tailored nicely to the tastes of the modern movie audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid action-packed funny sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it a lot better than the mixed reviews I was reading would have led me to believe. It's not as fresh as the original, but the charisma and humor were there, and so were some great surprises. RDJ was amazing as always - it's hilarious that Iron Man is a funnier superhero than Spiderman, but the improv makes it work. Thumbs up! I think that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will like this as well, and enjoy a great thrill ride! And don't forget to stay after the credits for yet another Marvel movie tie-in that leads towards the inevitable Avengers movie in 2012! Don Cheadle did a good job - ScarJo was good, but not what I imagined the Black Widow to be like, but she *was* hot... And Gwyneth did her usual impeccable job. Mickey Rourke added weight to what could have been a cardboard cutout stereotype, and Sam Rockwell's character, though annoying, was well played.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Action-Packed Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Iron Man sequel has attracted quite a bit of hype. Most of us were surprised back in 2008 that the first film had turned out not only bearable but pretty solid. The first film had walked the line between serious origin story and self-spoofing comic book comedy. The new film does the same and walks the delicate line between tension and comedic relief just as well as its predecessor.Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark one of the first super-heroes to forgo a secret identity. This eliminates what I feel is one of the weakest gimmicks of the superhero genre, the secret identity to "protect your loved ones". Ever notice how Peter Parker doesn't want to tell MJ who he is because she'd be in danger BUT she ends up in danger anyway? Same for Lois Lane or Rachel Dawes in Nolan's batman films. Iron Man doesn't bother with the secret identity and the story is better off for it. Instead the film focuses on the actual character of Tony Stark, including the character flaws he is known for and his relationship with his Father.The plot is really about the "Sins of the Father" passing on to the son. The Father of the film's villain has been wronged by Stark's Father and this leads to a high-tech revenge story. The acting is okay although I felt the script, at times, gave the actors little to work with. Even in the scenes that were fizzling out into boredom a joke or two would be thrown in to spice things up and reengage the audience. Whoever they had treat the script did a bang up job with quips, innuendos, gags and one-liners a plenty. These corny quips would be out of place in most movies but in a summer comic book blockbuster they are a MUST.Cheadle takes over from Terrence Howard as Colonel James Rhodes and while I feel he lacks the charisma Howard exuded in the first film he still does a solid job as Tony's new sidekick. The film also goes deeper into Tony's involvement with SHIELD, the legendary organization that will eventually set up the AVENGERS. Scarlett Johansson also does well in her role though honestly her beauty leaped off the IMAX screen so much I could barely concentrate on her dialogue when she was on screen.All in all the plot clips along nicely, never dwelling on the boring for too long but not letting the fast pace of the film take away from telling a good story. The Special Effects are incredible of course and some of the action scenes had the audience I saw the film with applauding. I feel the film lives up to its predecessor in almost every way and is easily worth an 8 out of 10. A solid superhero movie. I hope to see more of Iron Man on the big screen.Also, stay after the credits for a mini-sneak peak of one of the next super-heroes to get his own movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel rises to expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment of this Marvel series does not disappoint. Downey Jr. is once again a hit with a stunning performance as the narcissistic Tony Stark. This time around Tony is dealing with a health problem; the same miniature Arc-reactor that is keeping him alive, is also killing him. The metal needed to run the device is poisoning him. Stark starts down a destructive path until helped out by Sam Fury, who surfaced in the after-the-credits spoiler of the first movie, and the drop-dead gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. Don Cheadle enters as the replacement for Terrence Howard as Stark's best bud Jim Rhodes. Mikey Rourke continues his action-movie prowess as the villain and Rhodes and Stark team up as Iron man and War Machine to bring him down. An action-packed thriller, Iron Man 2 keeps all on the edge of their seats.Also of note, fans of the upcoming Avengers movie, based off the Stan Lee superhero team, will enjoy the not-so-subtle look at Captain America's shield and of the after-the-credits allusion to a Thor movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Of The Year !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is everything a summer movie should be, and much, much more. There's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The playboy, hard-drinking, fast-talking, now public superhero (and all the pitfalls of such fame) thrills from opening scene until the last.The movie gets everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting. Downey again brings a winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Don Cheadle certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey as does Mickey Rourke. Rourke's Whiplash is the perfect foil and perfect villain because he's no one dimensional character. His Whiplash is on a par with Heath Ledger's Joker (but with less screen time). Sam Rockwell is also perfect in his role. Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson add more sex appeal than any summer film in memory (what outfits for Scarlett) but they also deliver real performances. Pepper Potts is every bit the wise yet sexy match for Stark. The interaction and the relationships all work well and is one of the highlights of the entire movie. All the dialogue is superb. You would expect nothing less from a Jon Favreau film. (Who's also great as Happy Hogan, that fight scene raiding Hammer HQ is priceless!) A lot of superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. IM2 is darker than the first but keeps in line with the wonderful tone it already established for this character and universe. Again, Iron Man's creators mix everything so well. It leans towards dark but touches on every other tone and emotion. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely fun dialogue than most other movies have ever delivered, regardless of genre. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib and even obnoxious at times but he never loses his likability and grows in to something more, drinking problems, fear of dying and all. That's true character establishment and development in a summer film!!!! What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that most every plot turn carries some emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. Oh yeah and Iron Man kicks butt again both with and against War Machine! The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker. What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man 2 is now officially in the running for best movie of the year, again regardless of genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man says - "all-your-base-are-belong-to-us"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing with Iron Man 2 is that people inevitably tend to compare it to the first movie. And there's a minor problem with that. Iron Man - in most regions - released at just the right time. People were downright disappointed with the superhero genre and it appeared to be on the brink of demise after Spider-Man 3 and the X-Men films. Batman Begins seemed to have made a mark, but it was too fleeting and insignificant to be etched in people's memories. Then came Iron Man - it was the first decent superhero movie in ages. People loved it, it spread to engulf the Box Office earnings and bingo - there was a new, awesome superhero in town. Of course, after Iron Man, there was this little film you may have heard of - it was titled "The Dark Knight." THAT took the box office by storm. Iron Man, fortunately enough for the franchise, got bunched together with the Dark Knight and came to be fondly remembered as an audience favourite. Unfortunately, the audience has a very short memory span and tends to prize fond memories on some untouchable pedestal in their minds - high above the rest of the ordinary movies that plague our cinemas today. Even if the details of the memory itself are scrubbed out. We still prize that blurred memory and cherish it.Iron Man was not a masterpiece. It was the first brilliant superhero movie in ages, but it was by no means a masterpiece a la The Dark Knight. It built up Tony Stark's character arc brilliantly but it got fairly anemic towards the middle and the action was all limited to the last ten minutes of the movie. Also, apart from Robert Downey Jr, little else stood out in the background. However, comparisons with the Dark Knight are not quite fair. The Dark Knight was a dark, brooding work of art that plants itself firmly in the noir superhero genre. Iron Man, however, is a light- hearted fun superhero movie - literally at the opposite end of the comic-book spectrum. So I shall compare it against the masterpiece (IMO) from the lighter side of the superhero niche - Spider-Man 2.Iron Man 2, ultimately, shares the same fate as its predecessor. It's a solid movie, surpassing the original movie and at times has flashes of greatness, but falls short of the spark that made Spider-Man 2 so great - conflict. Be it Peter Parker's frustration with having to maintain the secrecy of his superhero identity or his sorrow at the loss of Mary Jane Watson, the conflict was what made the story interesting. On the other hand, in Iron Man 2, Tony Stark seems to breeze through his problems by virtue of his sheer awesomeness. Best friend stole my armour? No problem. I'm still awesome enough. I can beat him... eventually. Some maniac managed to recreate my armour, re-programmed all of the US Army's Droid Army? Oh well, looks like I'll have to destroy them with my awesome, awesome armour-driving skills.Don't get me wrong here. Robert Downey Jr is still the most... well... awesome pick to play Iron Man. The fact is Robert Downey Jr IS the main strength of the entire film - his interaction with other characters is what lifts the film and gives it wings. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic. His kinsmanship with Don Cheadle is sufficient enough to pass muster - they look like two friends who've recently exchanged some harsh words, which is as it should be. In short, Robert Downey Jr seems to have made the role his own. He is Iron Man. The suit and him are truly one.The supporting cast is top-notch as well. Samuel L Jackson just raised Nick Fury's bar on my Marvel meter of awesomeness. Scarlett Johanssen seems to have fit into the Black Widow role like a glove. She looks quite fetching in latex and her stunt scenes are very well choreographed. Her physicality is realistic, especially where she punches through an entire goon squad in a corridoor in front of Tony Stark's flustered bodyguard. Comic book fans might be a bit disappointed with her American accent, but then again, Natasha Romanov IS a super-spy fluent in several different languages - it makes sense that she's a bit more discreet in the movie. Mickey Rourke is believable as Ivan Vanko (Whiplash) and seems menacing at the best of times. Jon Favreau is delightful as Happy, Tony Stark's happy-go-lucky bodyguard.But the actor who truly challenged Iron Man in his own movie was unquestionably Sam Rockwell. He was a revelation in Moon, and is a delight to watch here too - his flustered evil corporate honcho act is a stellar performance and seems to be more of a villain than Whiplash himself.The Iron Man armour(s) look amazing and the CGI is brilliant too. In short, the second movie delivers as much as the first... and more.PS: Watch out for the Easter Egg at the end of the movie credits. There's only one word that can describe the awesomeness of that scene, at least for a Marvel comics fan - Mjolnir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 hits all the sweet spots, and it is GODLY.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Iron Man was being made into a movie, I didn't care much, but I still wanted to see it because of the action. I also chose to see it because Robert Downey Jr. was playing the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark. I've been a fan of Rob since Chaplin, that was truly a masterpiece, he can work the English accent perfectly. I always thought he was English because the first movie I saw with him was Natural Born Killers, but he was obviously Australian in that.Anyways, I finished watching the movie and I was blown away by the sheer awesomeness of it. So, I chose to go back on my comic book hobby that I used to have 8 years ago. I first picked up on the World's Most Wanted storyline that is part of the Dark Reign event. I was hooked, so I decided that Iron Man is my new favourite Marvel hero, next to Blade, they're on the same level of epic. I read a famous story arc called "Extremis". I LOVED IT! I loved the dark tone to it, the virus created by Pharmlabs in Austin, Texas somehow slipped into some criminal's hands and he went haywire. Iron Man saved the day by taking the same dose of Extremis, he and the suit TRULY BECAME ONE, just like he says at the Senate conference in this movie. I won't say much because you'll love reading it, and it's really fun acting out the captions.Anyways, the next storyline I'm reading is Civil War, it's interesting to see his position in all of it. I still have 74 issues to go. My point is, if you're an Iron Man fan like me, and if you read the comics (which REALLY helped) then you will consider this the best movie in move-making history. I certainly do, we will see how the Avengers can top this, but I know Iron Man 3 will top Iron Man 2.Now, onto the movie. The intro starts off really well, with recordings from the ending of the first film where he announces that he is indeed Iron Man. It then cuts to Moscow, Russia where we get to see Whiplash's character intro. Truly sad to see the hand dealt to his father, Anton, apparently his father worked with Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father, and somewhere along the line, Howard took Anton's ideas and kicked him to the curb, in the Russian ghetto. Whiplash swore revenge on this, and let me just say the way the Monaco scene was setup was just AMAZING.On top of the movie being awesome, it even added humour to it, just like in the last one. Happy Hogan gets more screen time and lines. We get to see more of Nick Fury and the sexy, and seductive, Black Widow just to put the cherry on top. Justin Hammer, rival competitor to Tony Stark and Stark Industries wants to conquer over Stark Industries with H.A.M.M.E.R. advanced weapons systems. But he knows that he can never get the praise and approval of the public like Tony gets. It triggers his ego to go haywire, he truly needs Tony to succeed with his company.Moving on to the plot which is very well done and fantastic. This is a Marvel fan's wet dream come true. It combines the story lines of Armor Wars and Demon in a Bottle. Tony Stark's arc reactor is keeping him alive and killing him now, at the same time. He needs to come up with a solution and a new suit, which he does later in the course of the plot. This film is truly a masterpiece directed by none other than the prestigious Jon Favreau. Him and Robert are the DREAM TEAM as I like to call it.The audience was cheering was laughter, enjoyment and praise. They gave it a standing ovation after the movie was over, a theatre full of joy. I must admit, I really do envy Robert Downey Jr. for the kind of man he is. He has been dealt with the hand of jail and he has had his own little demon in a bottle experience,but the got back up on top, along with Mickey Rourke and has been given a second chance, and he took it.The acting was superb by all the cast members. The special effects and action had fans like myself drooling for more of it, just to appreciate the sheer beauty of it. I can guarantee you that this movie will make A LOT of money, maybe even over 1 billion and I hope it does because of the incredible hype it has received and well deserved too.The movie has a special Captain America easter egg and a secret ending after the credits. So stay in your seats. The music was very well done and in the right moments.Iron Man 2 gets my envy and full respect. This is truly the movie of the year, and possibly the decade until Iron Man 3 can top it off. People asked has the Dark Knight set standards too high for comic book movies? I'd say it didn't set them high enough, Iron Man 2 SURPASSES TDK in every way possible. This movie is godly. Rob and Jon are the dream team, never forget that people and Hollywood. They are the future of the movie industry. LONG LIVE IRON MAN!P.S. Oh and as of this year from May 6th to May 10th, you should all celebrate IRON MAN DAYS. On those four days, celebrate the great achievement Stan Lee and Jack Kirby has created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What are these naysayers talking about. This is a great sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If just for the comedy in this film it rates an 8 IMO. This has a new twist story line; great action; new science; and more laughs than I could count. The humor is fast and always coming until the very end. It's also intelligent because it makes you think about the science and the possibility of peace. In fact, the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it seems that all movies today need to blast your eardrums out to get people into the theaters. Hopefully, they'll learn that when you get these movies to your standard home theaters, there's a problem balancing volume for dialog and action. I thought it was a great sequel and can't imagine what the people who have been cutting it down here on IMDb were talking about. Thank goodness I didn't just read these but listened to people that saw it here. Go see it - if you liked the first you won't be disappointed. I promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a comic book fan, it is hard for me to admit if a certain movie has not met the huge expectations that a comic book fan may hold...Batman Begins, Dark Knight held there own, the X-Men movies not so much, Fantastic Four movies were satisfactory....Daredevil was a travesty...Iron-Man was brilliant.....This sequel, is a 50/50 for me... The beginning was brilliant, the middle was slow and random...and the end was satisfactory.The world now knows Tony Stark is Iron-Man and he lives the high life and battles injustice, but the rest of the world wants Tony's suit. Especially the American government.Robert Downey Jr is funny, charming and a little eccentric, which works with the Stark character. Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful then ever before, she plays the caring, at times bossy secretary who is the only reason as to why Stark is still running a multi-billion dollar business. Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell is funny, annoying; which does wonders for our ever growing love for Stark...Mickey Rourke is satisfactory as the villain who wants to destroy Tony Stark, we don't really feel scared. And it seems that Rourke is a combination of 'Whiplash' and 'Crimson Dynamo'...But for me...Don Cheadle seemed to be out of place, I preferred Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Don Cheadle did not deliver lines very well, he did not have that 'No Nonsense' attitude that Rhodey has....Or it did not come across very well. Lastly, Samuel L.Jackson actually played Nick Fury pretty well, while I would have preferred to see Olga Kruylenko as Natalie Romanov, Scarlett Johanson was fine.The middle for me seemed to be a bit slow with random seems, yes we needed to witness the trials Tony faced but it was not dark enough for me. I would have liked to see Tony battle alcoholism, and then hand over his mantle to Rhodes, who would eventually become 'War-Machine' towards the end of the film.....Make it a little closer to the comics.But, the one thing that sold it to me, actually two things...The suit and the epic battle between Iron-Man, War Machine and the Drones.The special effects were simply dazzling and definitely a must see for all comic book fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Currently waiting for Iron Man 3.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the surprisingly fantastic Iron Man, old and new faces join forces for Iron Man 2, an equally fantastic sequel. After long months of waiting for this film, it exceeded my expectations and made me want the Iron Man series to be never ending. There's something about Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic tone and out there charisma that suits this character (no pun intended). Mickey Rourke &amp; Sam Rockwell are now villains Ivan &amp; Justin, two competitors of Tony Stark (Downey, JR). Don Cheadle plays James Rhodes, AKA Warhead, Scarlett Johansson plays Natalie, Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, Jon Favreau plays Happy, Paul Bettany plays Jarvis, Leslie Bibb plays Christine, and Garry Shandling plays Senator Stern. Guess what? They're all excellent. Shandling, especially, who has some of the funniest lines I have seen thus far this year. Rockwell has one of the funniest opening scenes in the film. There's so much to like about Iron Man 2, that, although not flawless, you forget its flaws, and just enjoy the spectacular ride you are to have. I can't decide what I want first, for Iron Man 3 to come out or for this to be in my DVD collection. Either way, see this film right away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprised again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the first Iron Man movie, I was surprised at just how competently filmed and well acted that movie was. When compared to all "Super Hero" movies before it, Iron Man was easily at the top. Then the Dark Knight came out and sent everyone else packing. Then Watchmen came out and everyone put their stuff away and went back to work.In short, Iron Man is the story of a very intelligent, highly flawed man who can barely keep his life together while facing super-human threats. In other words, every other Marvel character out there. But The movie is so well acted, and the dialog so perfectly askew that you really feel drawn in. It's not over-dramatic (well, a few scenes) but overall it's a solid story. When I heard the sequel would feature A. Whiplash, B. Black Widow, C. War Machine, and D. An army of Iron Man knockoff robots, I was honestly skeptical as to how the movie could possibly not be stupid.The movie was not stupid. A few parts where Tony is ruining his life because he thinks he's dying are, to be honest, a little irritating to watch. But by the end of the movie we really are on his side because he is such a likable character.A lot of people complained about replacing Rhody. In the first movie he was played by Terrance Howard, and in the second by Don Cheadle. People were angry and wanted to know why. I will tell you why. Don Cheadle can act. Terrence Howard can't. Watch his scenes in the first movie, he's blowing his lines everywhere. He's wooden, and uninteresting. Now watch Don Cheadle in the second, he's intense, he's genuine, and he's grammatically correct. "An unfortunate training exercise occurred yesterday," is a line that logically makes no sense. The line is "An unfortunate INCIDENT occurred DURING a training exercise yesterday." If that's the take they kept, imagine what's on the cutting room floor, or more likely, ashes in Terrence Howard's agents office.Now while the whole 'secret your father left you' angle is pretty cliché and ham-handed, we quickly forget this as Stark goes back to what he does best, which is wreck his house and build a thing. He's great at building things, and watching him build things makes every nerd giddy. It's like Mythbusters but with CGI effects.Also, Jon Favreau is a very clever devil. Knowing that every fan-boy is looking for signs of the eventual Avengers movie, he coyly inserted a half-formed Captain America Shield into the 'building the thing' scene. Agent Colson picks it up, Tony Stark looks at it in wonder and says "Yes, that's exactly what I need!" and then uses it to prop up part of the thing he's built. Yes, friends, it's a meta-fan-boy joke.Oh, and if you DON'T want to sit through the credits to see the secret scene at the end (and trust me, it's not worth it) I will SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT! Tell you what it is. It's a crater in the middle of the desert with Thor's Hammer sticking out of it. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!! So, ultimately, is this movie worth seeing? Yes. It's probably one of the better movies to come out this summer, but then I don't get out much, so I could be wrong, but it cleaned Robin Hood's clock. Say, didn't we HAVE a gritty Robin Hood movie come out already? Prince of something something? Not of Persia? Before I ramble on any more: Surprisingly solid story, well acted, gorgeous special effects, decent action scenes, and Scarlet Johanssen is so hot even my Girlfriend's jaw dropped. It surprised the HELL out of me, I thought she was more into Gweneth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex but FUN..... Believe The Hype, GREAT film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining humor, a complex plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Iron Man 2 is such a movie. Much like the first film, it's truly deep and complex but sacrifices none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Mark my words; Iron Man 2 is a movie people will be talking about all year if not for years to come. Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Does It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The anticipation to see the follow-up to 2008's Iron Man was quite high and it was hard to expect anything less than sheer awesomeness. Fortunately the movie delivered in spades and did not fail to impress on most accounts. The Cast: For starters, Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark, the billionaire, egocentric, narcissist CEO of Stark Industries. While initially skeptical before the first movie I could not think of anyone better suited for this roll now and RD Jr. is easily one of the most watchable actors in film today. Gwenyth Paltro is back as Pepper Potts and while her role seems slightly subdued in this film it certainly isn't due to her lack of acting skill which is, as always quite in tact. Seeing Scarlett Johanssen as the striking Natalie Romanoff however was an incredibly welcome treat. I can't help but fall in love with Scarlett nearly every time I see her on the big screen and she performed admirably in the film with a few outright stunning karate style ass-kicking stunts. Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Rhodey and when the change was first revealed I wasn't happy, but if there is any ONE good replacement it would have to be Cheadle. Rhodey's character is a bit cold and calculated even though he is supposed to be close friends with Stark. Sam Rockwell appears in Iron Man 2 as Justin Hammer. A nemesis to Tony Stark on the business front and Sam is always great to watch although somewhat annoying which is what the film was gunning for in his character. I've been a fan ever since I saw him in McG's Charlie's Angels as the evil Sam Knox. I could go on with the cast of characters like Mickey Rourke playing the evil Ivan Vanko, Samuel L. Jackson as Shield's Nick Furty, Gary Shandling as the annoying Senator Stern and even some great cameo's by DJ AM (rest his soul), CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Bill O'Reilly as the Fox no-spin master himself and even G4's super sexy Oliva Munn who were all an absolute pleasure to watch and even more so if you keep your thumb on current pop culture. But I digress.The Story: This time we see Tony Stark suffering from his chest mounted power source that is literally poisoning him from the inside and there is seemingly no cure. A great plot thickener to be sure but not before Tony and Iron Man have a chance to discover there is also another bad boy of technology on the block in the name of Ivan Venko. Apparently the son of an inventor that Tony Stark's father worked with briefly before getting into a nasty bit of business and ending badly many years ago which brings Ivan back for furious vengeance against Stark and team and eventually going to work for Hammer who is trying to secure a contract with the US government for futuristic arms development. All the while the US government is trying to "acquire" Iron Man technology for "safe keeping" should the nation need to use it while Mr. Stark is off on one of his wild weekend long parties. The part where congress calls in Tony Stark to testify on why he should give up Iron Man technology to the government is particularly entertaining. Issues: While the movie was great in my opinion it was not without a few issues of note. I found it interesting that Ivan Venko arrived at the race in Monaco in order to confront Iron Man yet it was a last minute change that even brought Tony out onto the track. Quite a large oversight for such a high profile movie. Also with regards to Tony Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts. Throughout the movie there was little to no sexual tension or overt attractions between the two. However at the very end they seemed to unnaturally pin the two together for something more serious. It seemed rushed and out of place in my opinion. Closing: With that said I'll leave the rest to imagination and you to see the movie to discover the great storyline, incredible action sequences and entertaining one-liners throughout and let's not forget about the ass kicking sound track officially consisting of all classic AC/DC but with snippets of other great tunes such as Daft Punk's Robot Rock played during an appropriate fight scene between Iron Man and?.Oh well lets just save that for the movie shall we? If you enjoyed the first Iron Man I'm fairly certain Iron Man 2 will not disappoint you in the least. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's a challenge to build the second piece of the puzzle, but by Jove, director Jon Favreau and his cast and crew have done it with flying colors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was quite a challenge to top such an exhilarating, original (at least by today's storytelling standards) summer extravaganza like 2008's big hit "Iron Man." That film was well done on a technical level, but the reason why it is so good and why it is twice the movie that "Transformers" (2007) was because it used its special effects as a service to its story instead of simply relying on them to save the day. So it's a real challenge to not only build on that, but improve upon that. But by Jove, director Jon Favreau and his cast and crew have done that with flying colors with "Iron Man 2" which to my mind is not only better than the original, but the best film that I've seen so far this year.The movie picks up where the first one left with Robert Downey Jr.'s alcoholic, eccentric character of Tony Stark revealing his alter-ego identity as Iron Man. While he combats a power-greedy senator's strive to strip him of his technological triumph and to maintain a somewhat stable employer-employee (and sometimes romantic) relationship to his assistant Pepper Potts, again played with grace and conviction by Gwyneth Paltrow, a new villain with his own technological tools and dazzling wit (Mickey Rourke) arrives, seeking revenge not only on Stark as a person, but his legacy.It seems to be a trend these days for the second installment in superhero movie franchises to be better than the first. That was the case with Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" saga, with Christopher Nolan's marvelous reinvention of the Batman character, and now with Jon Favreau's Iron Man pictures. In my original review, I stated that I really enjoyed the first "Iron Man" picture but felt that its climax was a little lacking and that there were some weak zones in its plot. However, all of that is built up and enhanced with the sequel and if there is one word I can use to describe it, it is: exhilarating. Even as it builds up new story lines with new characters, some of which may be ostensibly unnecessary, it never bogs down.Like "Spider-Man 2", "Iron Man 2" brings up the plot element of the main character's alter-ego taking over his life to the point where his normal life starts to fall apart, causing him to shun his responsibilities and obligations. Although this is a sort of familiar story, the filmmakers do a great job at keeping things on the move. What's also great, and carrying down from the first picture is how it's not all grim and tough, but has effective moments of comedy such as a scene where Scarlett Johanssen reveals to a cocky boxing manager that she knows a little more about the sport than she led him to believe. And of course the highlights are conversations between Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow and these melodramatic moments are blended with the more traditional tones seamlessly so that it does not feel like the movie is phasing in and out of one personality, heck, like its central character.You want special effects? You got 'em. Just like in the first picture, "Iron Man 2" is packed with lots of explosives, bursts of action, ear-jarring sound effects, and marvelous camera tricks and cinematography to lock the audience's attention in place. But once again, these special effects, unlike the effects in "Transformers" and its sequel, are used as a service to the story and that is why they do not overstay their welcome. The movie saves its drawn-out climax to the end and this climax is twice as exciting as the somewhat shallow final battle of the first movie.Robert Downey Jr. is still most effective as the troubled character of Tony Stark. He's charming, witty, humorous, and believable not as a caricature, but as a human being. Gwyneth Paltrow is equally effective as Pepper Potts; Scarlett Johansson is both seductive and convincing as the new assistant who has her own way of backing herself up; Sam Rockwell does a fantastic job playing the techno-dweeb big on money but short on brawn; Mickey Rourke is sinister and cold-blooded as the villain; and Don Cheadle does a surprisingly good job taking over for Terence Howard as Tony Stark's military pal.I can't think of one person I know whom I won't recommend seeing "Iron Man 2." From start to finish, this is one exhilarating piece of film-making. It excels, I say, over its already exhilarating predecessor and many of its companion superhero sagas, and proves itself to be one truly enjoyable time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but also Smart! It has the right amount of humor, angst and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 sure delivers the fun but it's such intelligent fun. Honestly, its Stan Lee meets Shakespeare. The Hammer/Stark rivalry is more like Hamlet and Claudius then Superman to Lex Luthor. Iron Man is simply more complex as a character then anything else you'll see in a summer film but it loses none of the spark or none of the pure popcorn fun. How many other films can you say that about? Stark's vulnerability is very much on display here as his personal life crumbles through various unique conflicts. He has to struggle with the government for control of his armor and deal with his growing celebrity. At the same time his personal life takes a turn as a love triangle emerges. He (like soon all of America) becomes attracted to his new aide (the lovely Scarlett Johansson), causing tension with his former assistant but now new Stark Industries CEO Pepper Potts (the also lovely Gwyneth Paltrow). They manage to pull all this off remarkably well and still leave character time for Rhodey and the villains. It's a believable sci-fi story featuring an intellect story that's wild but has the right amount of humor, angst and drama. Like I remember about Iron Man 1, I can't think of a weak moment in the film. The visual effects are incredible. They did the memory of their boss, the great Stan Winston, proud. They set the bar high again. Now the only question is whether they have anything left in the tank for Iron Man 3? I'm betting that they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exhilarating and funny superhero sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.The film's special effects are excellent. Some of the time, however, they're used on shootouts and explosions that don't produce much excitement. There's a lot more humour this time around. I was smiling or laughing during most of the film. Scarlett Johansson as the beautiful Natasha Romanoff gets to show off some impressive martial arts moves. It's rather funny afterwards because no one else can fight like her. Overall, the film is not as good as Iron Man. Still, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster and the performances are solid. I wasn't expecting much from the film but was pleasantly surprised. I recommend Iron Man 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as the first but is bashed on far too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often considered to be a critical disappointment that cannot match the same brilliance as the original, I was sceptical about watching this film. As one of the people who liked the original but didn't love it, I thought that maybe I wouldn't be as sorely disappointed by this film as die hard Iron Man fans were. The thing with this film is that most viewers either love it or hate it so it is truly difficult to take a side in it.Iron Man 2 tells the story of Tony Stark who has now revealed that he is indeed Iron Man and continues to enforce peace across the world until he meets a new enemy who has his plans to get revenge on Stark, whilst at the same time discovering that he is dying. Will Stark be able to keep his legacy and ensure that the people believe in Iron Man or will he fail? To be fair, I didn't hate this movie. I actually really liked it. Surely not as great as the original but this film sure nears it in my opinion. With dazzling visual effects, a mostly outstanding script that makes way for many laughs throughout the film, Iron Man 2 is a mostly engaging film with a great story and extremely special action sequences. I love in this film how Stark is once more put to test and how the original ended with Stark revealing that he is Iron Man. That allows the film to be free of any restrictions and give more fun to the film. Some of the stuff that Stark does throughout the film are truly idiotic and hilarious, and can only be thought of as hilarious due to the performance that Robert Downrey Jr gives.Robert Downrey Jr is truly the scene stealer and he just completely steals the film in every way. He is energetic, he is charming, he is funny yet he can also be a more dramatic person. Everyone else does a great job in the film, mainly Samuel L Jackson playing S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury. His performance isn't anything special from Jackson like Pulp Fiction but his presence is always welcome throughout the film. Scarlett Johannsson is great in the role of Natasha and the final action sequences in the film with her were truly great.Iron Man 2 is not nearly as great as its predecessor but is nevertheless, a fun and entertaining film with plenty of laughs and plenty of amazing visual effects and some absolutely fantastic action sequence. In terms of its action, it is possibly better than the original and also has a greater villain. The acting is fantastic by Robert Downrey Jr and everyone else does their part well. Iron Man 2 is nevertheless an engaging film and is honestly, either a guilty pleasure for myself or an underrated and overly criticized film.</fullReview>

It is hard to top the first two. Now they are going to make Iron Man 3. I have seen the cast list on IMDb and I'n eager to see the movie. Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, William Sadler.

And Rob Downey's metaphorically waiting at his doorstep for you to come back so he can give you some more (movies, I mean). Maybe I should stop with the metaphors. All I'm trying to get at is this movie totally dominates over the first one.Having one villain was cool. But how about fighting a whole army of robots programmed to kill you? WIth Tony Stark, saddle up. This is gonna be a crazy ride.My legs hurt by the end because I had been leaning on my seat the entire time! The action is more intense, the comedy really sticks out and everything really seems to bunker down and get into serious comic book entertainment mode. And the looming question of will Pepper and Tony kiss or not still bites at you. Are they going to make us wait until 2013 to see them kiss? Hmm.DEFINITELY if you saw the first one YOU MUST SEE THIS! And after speaking to some people, even if you haven't seen the first one you still catch on. You won't be sitting there going "Huh?" for 2 hours.There's more of everything from the first movie (in a good way) in this, and yes, Robert Downey Jr. is unquestionably HOT in this! ^.^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Comics' "Man of Steel," um, "Iron," is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the many great pleasures of watching 2008's "Iron Man" was that it allowed to some degree for star Robert Downey, Jr., playing billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who moonlighted and eventually revealed to the world his secret identity as the armored superhero Iron Man, to exorcise the many demons from his lonely, drug-fueled days in the annals of Hollywood Hell. Stark, of course, has in the past dealt with debilitating bouts of alcoholism, so this role would have allowed Robert Downey, Jr. to face any remaining demons from his past. It is this deep personal struggle that has made Tony Stark/Iron Man one of the more fascinatingly introspective characters in the Marvel Comics Universe of superheroes.But whatever meditations these movies could have had in dealing with the harrowing perils of drug addiction gets lost in the bang-bang pacing, action and special effects of the latest Hollywood superhero blockbuster to boast spectacular visuals and top-notch performances but lacking any real depth or content. Actor/director Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a favorite in Hollywood, especially with the way he's handling his work on the "Iron Man" movies, and he proves his mettle, regardless of the lack of thematic complexity or depth that they could have had, with this sequel "Iron Man 2." And while I would have personally much more enjoyed the subject of Stark's internal struggles with alcoholism rather than his external struggles with the U.S. government, I guess what we get here will have to do for now.While less skillful and entertaining than its 2008 predecessor, I personally feel that I somehow enjoyed this one a lot more, perhaps because it features a more-fleshed-out supporting role from Stark's best friend Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, having fully replaced Terrence Howard from the previous film), who of course later dawns a powered armor suit of his own to become the awesomely bad-ass War Machine. And the movie has a killer soundtrack by those Aussie bad boys AC/DC.This time out, Stark has really let his arrogance get to his head, and this is something that Downey, Jr. really pushes past its limits to become cinematic gold. He has effectively saved the world from certain doom so many times in the past that he has also effectively "privatized world peace," and the government wants a piece of his technology because he has so quickly and so suddenly made them look incompetent.All that's about to change when the villainous Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) shows up on Tony's home turf one day and challenges him to a duel. Vanko is especially miffed at Stark because he believes that Stark's father stole the technology that he developed with Vanko's father and had him deported back to Russia to cover his tracks. So Ivan, possessing blueprints for Stark's technology to exact his revenge, develops some nifty little weapons of his own to become the whip-wielding super-villain Whiplash.On the home front, meanwhile, Stark's ticker is deathly ill and feels that his time is running out, and he hands over control of Stark Industries to his would-be love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). And just as he does this, another character is introduced, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannson), who also hides a few secrets of her own since she is also the lethal spy/secret agent Black Widow.A lot of stuff goes on in "Iron Man 2" and there's the main problem (other than that other issue I mentioned earlier about Stark's battles with alcoholism getting the shaft here): a lot goes on and the movie kind of feels crammed as a result. Rourke is a fascinating presence whenever he's on the screen, which unfortunately is not very much, but I enjoyed his scenes the most, especially since he comes under the yoke of Stark's rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Johannson's Black Widow also gets shafted as well, since she doesn't really become a big player in all this superhero stuff until the film's action-packed, 20-minute climax. And at least Cheadle's War Machine is made useful in the film before (note that I said "before") he and Iron Man have to go to work as a team to defeat a newly powered-up Whiplash (which is a little anti-climatic and a bit short, to say the least).Am I nit-picking some things? Probably. But the reason we keep coming back is because of the action, special effects, and Robert Downey, Jr. as Marvel Comics' Man of Steel... Iron. He's utterly perfect for this role: he's arrogant, greedy, narcissistic, and drops more biting one-liners here than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever did in his prime (not knocking the great Schwarzenegger here, but you get my point). But he's a hero, and that all that matters in "Iron Man 2."9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel that doesn't bet on "twice the action" formula.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the very few blockbuster franchises that I have followed so far. I usually see them fast, or I don't see them at all. And following the Iron Man franchise has "payed off", so far. But this part is different and does feel different than the first, and for some reason it's not so easy to immediately answer why exactly.The first thing that came to mind is that despite the bigger budget of the second part, the "level" and the time of action is the same if not shorter than in "Iron Man 1". I never thought that I will ever caught myself thinking that there should be more action and less talking in a so-called "summer film".The real substitute for all the chasing, shooting and blowing up that is a bit missing in this film, is an array of new characters. The constant talking of everyone, especially Tony Stark of course, gives the film a dynamic pace and probably makes those 2 hours go by much quicker. But from my view, the most silent character of all, Vanko, was the most interesting one.What is also specific for the Iron Man franchise and many of this kind of big films of the new millennium, is the skillful adding of "counter-culture" elements in a very mainstream product. This part left me down here quite a bit. The first trailer for the film had me thinking and hoping that we'll see some kind of a critique of war-profiteering and that it will all lead us to a path of at least some moral dilemmas. But sadly, all of Vanko's motives for vengeance are reduced to some old family rivalry. I guess it is (still?) too much to ask for more from a king-size summer opening film like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the usual kind of sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Iron Man 2, Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire Tony Stark, this time facing pressures from the government to share his armor technology with the military. At the same time, he discovers the technology which keeps him alive is also slowly killing him. He appoints Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries, while her old job goes to Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson). Meanwhile, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of his father's enemy, joins forces with Stark's rival competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell).First off, I enjoyed the first Iron Man, but I wasn't a huge fan. I felt Jon Favreau's direction and Robert Downey Jr. made the film better than what it could've been. Tony Stark was fun, story was okay, and the villain was a bit disappointing. The idea of the villain being just another version of the protagonist never appealed to me. I felt the same way about the wannabe-Hulk villain in Incredible Hulk. Now, if the villain is very different from the hero (Joker vs. Batman / Superman vs. Lex Luthor / Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock), the hero has to apply different strategies, which makes for more entertaining battles. Well, in the Iron Man sequel, that idea hasn't changed too much?Iron Man still battles a similar foe, although there are now more of them. Thankfully, the shootouts, the flights, the computerized special effects, and the mass destruction are a lot of fun to watch, but it is not the central focus.This film's focus is all about the characters, an unusual direction for a sequel. It's no Transformers 2, that's for sure. Majority of the time, you won't see Tony Stark in armor. You do, however, get to see a bit of a darker and a vulnerable side to Tony, which happens to make him more complex, engaging, and sometimes, dangerous. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony flawlessly, and he's just as much fun, if not more, than before. Some may be put off by the dialogue-driven first half of the film. The film isn't all about "let's hurry up and get him to fight somebody." In fact, it takes its time, and there's not a whole lot of action in the beginning, but there's a certain build-up that leads to the eventual confrontation with the baddies. The film isn't so much about a specific villain or a goal, but it is mainly about Tony, his psychology, and his reactions to life. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts?she is as we remember her from the last film?charming and continuously getting Stark out of trouble.Many interesting side characters make an appearance this time around. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) plays more of a prominent role as the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Scarlett Johansson has great screen presence as Natalie Rushman (aka. Black Widow)?she holds herself pretty well in a great martial arts scene. Don Cheadle has replaced Terrance Howard as Lt. Col. "Rhodey" and gets to play a more prominent role as an Iron Man suit-armored partner to Tony. This film, unlike the first film, tends to lean towards the idea of teamwork more. (Perhaps they're just prepping us for an Avenger film?) Mickie Rourke is engaging on screen as the Russian physicist villain Ivan, which he plays with dark relish. Although his technology?glowing, electrically charged whips?isn't anything new, he is always fun to watch. Likewise, Sam Rockwell is great as usual as a villain, the wisecracking Justin Hammer.The plot simply continues on from the last film, after people have found out the true identity of Iron Man. While it's nothing too complex, the progression of the story is logical--it would surely bring some enemies out of the woodwork if they knew who he was. The film's pacing isn't as zippy as the first film, where something always seems to be happening, and some audiences may be disappointed as a result.Overall, I found Iron Man 2 to be entertaining and a worthy sequel, and just different enough not to feel tacked on like an add-on to the previous film. Many sequels can get lazy?they just throw in everything and make it bigger and louder. Some sequels simply let the story progress. This is that kind of sequel. I give Iron Man 2 *** out of **** stars.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking place six months after the first Iron Man, Iron Man 2 finds a world where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has successfully "privatized world peace," but fearing other countries getting their hands on Stark's Iron Man technology the Senate seeks to have Tony hand over the technology to the government. Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be cliché.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible sequel and good set-up for "Demon in a Bottle"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't understand what people were expecting, looking at some of the negative reviews. This sequel gives you everything that was great about the first film and then some. Better action, more humor, more characters, and more Easter eggs leading into the Avengers movie. It delves further into Tony Stark's character, showing that his arrogant public persona is a ruse...behind the scenes, he's scared to death because the artificial heart he created is slowly poisoning him to death. He begins drinking heavily, which is leading up to a "Demon in a Bottle" sequel; comic book fans know that I'm talking about a key Iron Man story line that helped define the character. I loved Scarlett Johansen as the Black Widow...her one action scene was awesome. The two major Iron Man/War Machine fight scenes beat the action sequences in the first film. The final scene was much better the first movie's finale. I can't wait to see Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my view, this movie is better than the first installment. There are several reasons for me so naturally I want to list them. I was surprised that all the outrageous trailers for the film turned out to be in the film. Yet they made too much sense &amp; didn't seem quite as outrageous.Robert Downey Jr. is excellent again. He is perfectly in character as Tony Stark. There is an explanation for the outrageous behavior which makes total sense. Clue- if you had all the power on Earth &amp; thought you were going to die, what would you do?There are some nice location shots in this, particularly Monte Carlo.All the supporting cast is back from Iron Man with some excellent additions. Lucas Film effects &amp; Skaywalker sound are much in evidence. To me this film has a more traditional film Hollywood pace. It has perfect spacing between the action sequences &amp; the story sequences. No sequence is too long to get boring. The last half of the first film had a battle sequence that was much too long. People fall in love with computer effects too often.There is a new arch nemesis for Iron Man. See the film &amp; stay all the way until after the credits. There is an additional scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with this, thinking that it's probably another sequel that doesn't match up to the original. I was wrong; I thought this was better, a more likable and entertaining film than the first! Of course, it helps to know in advance that the "hero" ("Ton Stark," played by Robert Downey) is even more obnoxious in this film. Knowing that, I didn't let that bother me and just enjoyed the good acting in here and the excellent special-effects. Mickey Rourke ("Ivan Vanko") is almost always interesting to watch so I enjoyed his role, too, even if I had a hard time understanding his Russian accent.The story is, yes, sophomoric but most action films today are. Just enjoy the funny lines, CGI, the pretty women (Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannson) and wild heroes and villains and you should get your money's worth out of the viewing. See it on Blu-Ray and you'll enjoy it that much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK....so let me just start by saying, Iron Man 2 is AMAZING!! It's so good, it made me go unconscious for a little while....well almost. I read so many terrible reviews, so I walked in the theater a little skeptical. What I got was incredible though! It was everything I hoped for and nothing I was worried about it. "Too many AC/DC songs" and "too much Burger King" were 2 things I kept reading about, so I was kept thinking that it was going to be like a cheesy 2 hour music video/Super Bowl commercial. There were 2 AC/DC songs, which were only 30 second clips and fit the scenes they were in, plus I mean, directors like certain bands; just like Scorsese loves the Rolling Stones and puts tons of their tracks in his stuff, apparently Favreau likes AC/DC. Honestly, I didn't see Burger King anywhere in this movie and I can usually spot product placement instantly because it drives me crazy. It was great though is the bottom line. Even the change to Don Cheadle was fine and I loved first line of, "I'm here, it's me, get over it," which obviously had a double-meaning. I loved all of it. Even Scarlett Johansson was good in it. She didn't have very many lines, so her inability to act well wasn't even noticeable, and she was a bad ass with bad ass fight scenes.I dug it, you'll dig it, go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dimension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Common sense hits the front office at Marvel's adventure in movie-making. Until now, they've just made bad films. Bad.The basic problem, I believe, is that the rest of the world is out exploiting the third dimension and Marvel insists on making flat movies. Even Spidermen, where the character lives and fights in space was flat. All of a sudden, Marvel and ILM wise up. This not only matches but excels what we have at this time in terms of complex three dimensional motion. The camera flies. Objects fly and the two weave in ways new to us. The camera is usually placed in some relatively stationary place to allow you to see what is going on. That place is removed from the action. Sometimes the camera becomes or emulates a POV of a flying or moving object as if it is in the action ? or perhaps a character. The game in this new future is a matter of combining the two so that it has the properties of both, but is neither. Done well, it generates pure cinematic excitement. Done well, it overwhelms everything else and thrills because it is so otherworldly. It is done well here. Done well. And it doesn't have to be used to cloud deficiencies elsewhere. All is at least competent and some things: Downey, Rockwell and the production design are excellent.This dimensional thing is done so well that it is mirrored elsewhere. Stark's computers have a hand and voice manipulatable three dimensional, haptic, multiaffordance holographic interface. The motion is less important here than the notion of projected dimensionality. His nemesis? Well, he manages an entire army of drones by a single QWERTY keyboard and a DOS-like display. The contrast is, I think a deliberate thing. They would have pimped up Stark's machine anyway, but having the contrast is a subtle narrative reminder of the difference in dimensionality of the thing.Oh, it is also mirrored in the two women. One is a lighthaired, ponytailed redhead who never leaves the plane. The other is a fiery darker redhead with wild hair (in her real persona) who in a remarkable fight scene is profoundly three-dimensional. Samuel Jackson has decided to do anything, work anywhere, take any pay cut to be the face of the master organization that watches us. I think he knows that this legacy will live for generations, planted in juvenile minds eager for explanatory conspiracies. These theories for some reason rarely are discarded as kids age. It is his face now that is often associated with the leader of the new demigods the genre is creating. Smart building of intellectual property for someone with limited range.Downey. What a guy. Let's hope he takes some of his power to create projects that matter in some way beyond merely thrilling by advancing the craft of seeing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Action-Comedy from Robert Downey Jr.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inimitable Iron Man returns in an exciting sequel and fans are going to roar with excitement There's a whole lot more to Iron Man 2 than meets the eye. Purists of the Iron Man Marvel Comics genre will no doubt find many elements of the film to their liking. Such was the mastery of combining humour, action and digital effects that the film was an unqualified success.Tony Stark returns to the fold in his typical narcissistic style. In fact if egos the size of his were commonplace, the world would need several iron men. Robert Downey Jr reprises the role that he so perfectly portrayed since the first installment of the multimillion dollar series. He's witty, intelligent and noticeably a few years older! But weapons expert Tony Stark is also Iron Man and this alter-ego has a life-force all his own.The presence of Iron Man in the early parts of the stellar film is rather limited, but he soon rocks back into action and brings a roar of approval from the audience. There are scenes where the anticipation of Iron Man's arrival are like literal live-wires and it's great to see him restoring order.Mickey Rourke expertly portrays Ivan - a physicist with a bent for Stark's destruction. He's heavily muscled, wicked beyond compare and his plan to destroy Iron Man is not without its merits. But can he team up with Hammer Industries to create an army of cyborgs to destroy the Iron Man? The film has many side plots such as the budding romance between Stark and his beautiful CEO - Pepper (Paltrow). Moviegoers will love Don Cheadle's side-kick role as an apt Iron Man tag-team star. And a cameo by several heavyweight Hollywood A-listers will do more than tickle a few taste buds.The film has been accused of being unoriginal and while there are obvious overlaps with the first installment, the action is all-new and the humour is incisive. It's witty from beginning to end and it gives new meaning to the words 'tin grin.' The verdict: Do not miss the awesome action-packed superhero flick - Iron Man 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2, another fun and great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fun and fast-paced. Robert Downey Jr. delivers again, with all the cast doing great jobs. Contrary to popular (critic) belief, Iron Man 2 brings another enjoyable superhero film to watch. The storyline continues to unfold, the action and effects are nice, and the actors all did well.Whatever complaints other people might have on the story, the events, the lack of or excess of - it may be true, but that doesn't make it less of a great movie. Iron Man 2 was more character driven, and you truly do see many of the past characters and new ones develop. Thanks to the well-picked cast, all of the characters were fun to watch. They gave emotion and humor together, and I'm too lazy to talk about each of them individually, but Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was definitely the savior of the whatever flaws the movie has. As he said himself, he is Iron Man, and his personality made the movie very lively.As expected, you got to see awesome Iron Man action with lots of explosions and whatnot. Some might say that there was too much mindless blasting, like Transformers, but that's what made it fun. It mixed in with the characters evenly I think, and it's an overall great and fun movie throughout.Not saying it didn't disappoint in some parts (which it did), but you can't please everyone. I find the first Iron Man to be better, but that was because it was a new, cool idea that just bursted out. However, Iron Man 2 continues as a worthy sequel. People just need to sit back and appreciate what's there.The "ending" is cool, too. Make sure to watch past the credits.</fullReview>

I liked how they spiced it up with all the giggles, but some of it was just too much, and it retracted from the seriousness that Iron Man is supposed to be. I also heard that black widow was useless, and her character was necessary. I was at first upset that she didn't have the accent, but it would probably conflict with Rourke's character, so its acceptable. But overall the acting was great, especially on Rourke's part, and the FX were great.

		<fullReview>So I'm the type of person who rates movies based on their enjoyability and how much I personally enjoyed them. Like, I would give Sherlock Holmes a 9.5/10 while I'd give Avatar a 8/10 just due to expectations and enjoyability.Anyway, Iron Man 2 was A LOT OF FUN. I loved it. I went to the midnight premiere and was laughing during the entire movie. Of course, I had read the reviews anticipating a kick-butt beginning and ending with a slow middle, but that's not how the movie was for me. IM2 was one fun ride that rarely let up on its humor. Compared to IM, I don't know. I think it's just as good--if not better (WHAT?! Yes, I don't agree with the majority of IMDBers)--but it's different so I don't know how to compare.The cast did a spectacular job. RDJ was top-notch, him and Gwyneth had delightful chemistry, Rourke was crazy intimidating, Rockwell was good over-the-top funny, Scarlett was kick-butt, and special shout-out to Favreau who was funny. Cheadle was fine...I wasn't particularly amazed by his performance, but then again, I wasn't by Howard's either.One slight blip in the movie was that there were a lot of characters added so the movie had a bunch of plot lines. I didn't notice while watching the movie, but after watching it, I wish they had just stuck to one or two characters and elaborated on their story lines.Anyway, IM2 was a great movie. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Rust on this "Iron"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that I was a tad worried about Iron Man 2, because, well let's face it, the first movie was so fantastic that it was almost untouchable. I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think "Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again." Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital! Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable dick-head that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson? whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just? mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain, Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of asskickery and unadulterated awesomeness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that the first movie was better but let's not compare. In all fairness, though the ratio of dialogue to action is 3:1 (more or less), I was still caught in awe the whole time. I am deeply amazed by the power of technology that was being depicted in the movie and how Tony Stark made use of such immensely spectacular hi-tech things combined with his wit and intelligence. It was literally all in the palm of his hands.The storyline is great. It has shown another side of the Stark Industries' success and legacy which gives rise to the vendetta perpetrated by the infuriated and angst-y villain which was played really effectively by Mickey Rourke.Robert Downey Jr again affirms his compelling appeal, charm and skill on-screen. He's a really cool superhero with a mix of humor, narcissism (in a cute way), and fiercely gallant persona, not to mention HOT as hell! Scarlett Johansson is amazingly badass!! Gwyneth Paltrow is still beautiful.The movie maintained its humor which could irreproachably burst the cinema into laughter. I was expecting more funny scenes though. I guess I was expecting too much. But the serious side of storyline didn't fail me.The effects were really cool and great. This movie makes Transformers look bad. The robots here are BADDER! really badass. Pay attention to the dialogues, they are really penetrating.Watch this movie. It would live you wanting more. Truly mindblowing and kickass! P.S Stay until after the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched IM2 twice so far, and am eagerly looking forward to the 3rd this Wed with a special friend. I'm also planning&nbsp;a possible trip to London to see it in Imax in the near future when I save enough money.I'm sharing some radom thoughts about IM2:What holds the story is a more in depth exploration of Tony and his relationship with his father, Pepper Potts and Rhodey. The spirit of the movie is fun and the subject matter is interestingly human and the actions are a blast. Robert Downey Jr is again breath-taking as Tony Stark. The romance between Tony and Pepper is a breath of fresh air and very endearing.The visual effect is spectacular, especially when Tony is making a breakthrough in his lab ? it's like he's one with the whole universe! I enjoy Black Widow single-handedly handling all the security guards at Hammer industry with crisp karate moves mixed with high tech devices. However, I find it hard to relate&nbsp;to her emotionally as she's often expressionless and humourless. She's like a highly intelligent and sexy robot, or alien ? effective, but lack of more fleshed-out human dimensions.I like Don Cheadle in the War Machine suit, but not when he's out of it. I feel he lacked the upright posture as a Lt. Col. His body language does not fully embody the spirit of James Rhodes.In my first viewing, I think Tony's out of his mind, down right miserable and ridiculous, and frankly I missed his boyish good look, and resented his sickly haggard look. But the movie took me to another place, and suddenly I can relate to what it's&nbsp;like for a genius billionaire to face premature mortality and have no one to share his fear and regret, not even his love interest or best friend. I can relate to the desperate sense of isolation, powerlessness in reaching out for help, helplessness in simply getting some understanding from the one he cares most, and the need to escape into a donut.I like the more in depth exploration of Tony's relationship with his father, Howard Stark through the contrast of his nemesis, Ivan and his father Anton. Even though Tony's born with the privilege, wealth, and talent, he grew up feeling unloved by a cold, distant father and then orphaned at a young age. Ivan, on the other hand, grew up in poverty, lack of recognition and imprisonment, but shared a deep love with his father.I think Ivan Vanko is a well-developed character, and Micky Rourke very much nailed it. He has a strong and intimidating screen presence yet can still connect with the audience through deep emotions and humour.I love it when Tony finally discovers his father's love for him in an old tape in which his father told him that Tony was his greatest creation. For me, that's the equivalent to the "Proof that Tony Stark has a heart" Pepper gives Tony in IM.It's interesting that Robert further explored the father issue in his next movie, Due Date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! The director has crafted a super sequel that both dazzles the eyes and touches the heart. Much like Spider-Man 2, the truly remarkable special-effects of the new movie make it virtually impossible not to suspend one's disbelief. The effects actually beat Spider-Man 2. A lesser filmmaker would have been content to let the effects be the whole show, but Favreau gives us a movie populated by genuine characters and situations that make the film just as compelling in its quieter moments as it is during the big action scenes. IM2 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn. That's the kind of movie that I love to see? one that isn't just dark to be dark or isn't just self-indulgent or overly serious for the sake of having some sort of false sense of gravitas. These Iron Man films are sweeping and even epic but, at the same time, they're tremendous popcorn entertainment. How many films can you say that about? Truly Superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need very little persuasion to fall into this movie's utterly entertaining world. I really can't imagine anyone not liking it. Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Sam Rockwell in particular all put in near perfect, memorable performances. But it's the very well written story that carried the day, for me. It's not real deep but it's not mere window dressing either. What would Ironman do if requested to give his technology to the military? And how would he handle toe to toe competition? And there's more, but it's better you see it rather than hear about it.John Favreau is clearly gaining in skill and ambition as director while still being willing to feed our male fantasies. Scarlett is a great example as the lithesome Natasha Romanoff. No graphic novel could ever match her role for visual female sumptuousness and sheer beauty. You'll wish there was more of her though wisely Favreau leaves you slightly frustrated. All in all a fun movie way beyond my expectations. But I'm glad I'm not Favreau. What could he do to top these two movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a summer blockbuster sequel should be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big expectations from the original are hard to live up to, which just seems unfair to this reasonably enjoyable and exciting sequel. Going over that age-old Hollywood mantra that "bigger is better", this sequel throws in bigger set-pieces, better special effects and a superb cast. But unlike most sequels to successful hits, IRON MAN 2 is not only big in terms of special effects and action set-pieces, it also has stronger characters (perhaps the only real problem with that is that they're too many of them) and an even stronger plot.As with the other people who enjoyed the first IRON MAN movie, my hopes were high for the sequel. As in other superb comic-book movie sequels like SPIDER-MAN 2 and THE DARK KNIGHT, the storyline frees itself from the exposition settled in the first movie and are now able to take the story into a different direction for the sequel. Following the end of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has already admitted his identity as Iron Man and, as he puts it, "successfully privatized world peace". Arrogant as he is, he gets the job done, but saving the world is only half the battle. Stark also has a demanding Senator Stern (Gary Shandling) on his back who wants his Iron Man technology surrendered to the military, a similarly egotistic rival (Sam Rockwell) who wants Stark and his crowning achievement be reduced to yesterday's news, and of course there's vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) bent on killing Stark to avenge his father. Only to make matters worse, the arc reactor that's keeping Stark alive is slowly poisoning his blood, and would kill him if he doesn't find a substitute to the reactor's Palladium content.There are enough characters here that could have made this as an early reunion for The Avengers, with a powerhouse of a cast to boot. In addition to the return of Downey's egotistic Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow's delightful portrayal as long-suffering assistant-turned-CEO Pepper Potts, there's also Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johnasson in a black leather suit and sporting red hair! 'Nuff said), Samuel L. Jackson's return as Nick Fury (after a very brief cameo in the first), Don Cheadle replacing Terence Howard as Lt. Col. "Rhodey" Rhodes (who finally gets his "next time" opportunity as he dons the suit as the battle-ready War Machine), and even Favreau's Happy Hogan (nothing more than an extended cameo in the first film) gets more screen time. On the bag guy side is Rourke's disgruntled Vanko, Rockwell playing another character we would love to hate, and Shandling's hilarious portrayal of a greedy politician. Too many of these characters could have repeated the misstep that SPIDER-MAN 3 had done; too many characters with too many subplots that ruin the flow of the story. But director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux avoid this pitfall by just giving our characters enough screen time that they deserve and only throwing in subplots that actually move the story along.IRON MAN 2 is what a summer blockbuster sequel should be; it throws in everything we expect from its superb predecessor and giving is a little more without being something akin to an overstuffed, overcooked turkey. The action sequences are great in the first movie, and they're even bigger here. It even has a better, more thrilling climax than the one in he first, and more interesting and even outrageous villains than in the original. As usual, Downey Jr. is still one of the chief delights with his portrayal of a different kind of comic-book hero. Throw in a cast that looks absolutely perfect and every thrilling action set-piece in place and you have a sequel that's actually worth the wait.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

Robert Downy Jr. is Iron Man know one can pull off Iron Man like him. Mikey Rourke is a great villin he puts the whip in whiplash. I was a little disappointed that terrince howerd wasn't gonna be war machine but Don Cheadle pulled it off wonderfuly, he was the best choice for the role sine it wasn't howerd. Gwyneth Paltrow played a great role as pepper. Scarlett Johansson was hot, slick, and sexy, she was great for the guys to watch, and did a great role of black widow. Samule L. Jackson wasn't in Iron Man that much but he did to good as a nick fury character and think he can pull it off in the new nick fury movie thats supposed to be coming out in 2011. sam rockwell was a great actor in this movie he can really make you hate him, he can play a real ass whole. And the return of leslie bibb the sexy, hot, and slutty reporter from the first Iron man, shes only in it for about 10 to 20 min. but she was hot in that amount of time. This wa a great fun filled action triller great for the fans, go watch it and make sure to stay after the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta say, Robert Downey Jr. is the best actor I've ever seen! He beats out greats like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt. He never ceases to impress and woo. Every movie he is in, he always steals the spotlight. Robert is perfect in any role he plays. He has got to be the most charismatic guy on the planet. AND the best looking! Yes, his handsomeness is on great display in this amazing film! Now, getting to Iron Man 2, it triples the magic of the first one! The script (and some hilarious obvious ad-libs by Robert Downey Jr.), the plot, the acting, the casting, the chemistry amongst the actors, the directing, the effects, the sets, the messages- PERFECT. PLUPERFECT.The comedy, the drama, the action, the themes, the FUN! My oh my, this movie was something a sequel never is- better than the first! First off, I LOVED the first Iron Man- absolutely adored the film. I had high expectations for Iron Man 2, but I thought it would be impossible to make the sequel any better than the fantastic start to a franchise was. But, I was wrong! Iron Man 2 is 10 times better than the first, if that's even possible! Honestly, I think everyone in the world should see this movie. I'm a big movie buff, and I say this only about the films I truly love. The plot was more complex this time with more subplots to add to the fantastic story. This is nothing like your regular superhero movie. This isn't Batman, Spiderman, or Superman. This is as realistic as it gets. This is something that could truly happen in real life, especially nowadays. It very much applies to modern times and modern problems. This is a very realistic man dealing with very realistic problems. By the way, Tony Stark wasn't that narcissistic at all, even though many people seem to say he was. RDJ portrayed him as truly likable with real emotion, charm, and on-the-dot comic timing. A real-world hero. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark will go down in history as one of the big screen's most memorable characters. This movie kept the audience laughing throughout with the superb witty dialogue and many intentionally hilarious scenes laced with intelligent humor. The movie had some truly emotional and serious scenes, courtesy of the great talent of Robert Downey Jr. It is art. It is pure charm on display for all to see. It is a gift. It is true talent and ability to sway the emotions of the viewers. Robert is my hero- in more ways than one. As a woman, I am so happy a man so ideal actually exists! Is he peerless? Quite possibly!The serious undertones of this action-packed intelligent comedy give the movie its edge. The fact that this movie very much applies to the real world is very appealing. The Avengers is next, but that will contain the unrealistic superheroes like Thor and Hulk, which belong with Spiderman and Superman...that won't be the same...the Iron Man franchise is the real superhero franchise- not a kids' make-believe one. Iron Man 1 and 2 have such great charm and that real-world quality that are not present in the Batman franchises, the Spiderman franchise, the Superman franchise, the Hulk movies, and all the other superhero films. Iron Man 2 is unmatched in its strength as true coolness and top-notch entertainment. It is so smartly written and performed that it makes me truly proud of Hollywood. Thanks to RDJ and Jon Favreau! I am more than pleased with Iron Man 2. I am beyond blown away. It's worth every penny to go and see it! I'm going to see it for a third time next weekend!This film is eye-candy, brain-candy, and heart-candy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I.privatize.world peace" sums it all.The novelty of "Iron Man" hasn't worn off on me. While it would never be the same as witnessing the first scene of Iron Man soaring into space and the joy of the trial and error, Iron Man is still the only one of its kind that is as grounded in future reality as it could be.Tony Stark is one of the rare exceptions of being a publicly known superhero. And possessing the traits of a superhero, he does not. Robert Downey Jr. doesn't disappoint in the sequel wherein the world knows him not only as the billionaire weapon manufacturer extraordinaire, but more pivotally as The Man in armored suit.RDJ is the brain, heart and soul of Iron Man. It makes me wonder whether the script was written to be specifically tailored to him. Bold and brash, he's got that smug and swagger that commands the world over. Naturally narcissistic and sarcastic, over-sized just doesn't cover it as far as his ego goes. Never known for subtleties, his flashy style and fast-paced lifestyle suits him just fine - even in his quest to discover the new energy source since the arc-core machine that keeps his heart beating is also slowly poisoning his blood.RDJ's personality carries every single scene that he's in. Numerous outrageously riotous one-liners bring on continuous giggles and laugh out-louds. Be it frivolous or witty or sarcastic, Stark goes toe-to-toe with the newly minted CEO of Stark Industries aka love-interest Pepper Pots, newly appointed eye-candy secretary with an ulterior motive aka Black Widow, Hammer the competitor with an ambitiously ambiguous agenda, or Nick Fury from yes, the upcoming Avengers team (sidenote: the geeks in us would notice Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer). Everyone seems to have so much fun and it shows. I don't recall ever laughing so hard for so long in a non-comedic movie! And Whiplash... what an entrance! I totally didn't expect the Monaco mayhem to happen early. With connected past through their fathers, he's a worthy adversary. The Grand Prix thrill of the peril where Whiplash faces off with Stark sans suit is the stealer of the movie (and the manner in which he ends up donning the suit is a real treat), even more so than the last sequence of dash, smash and blast of the battle of the war machines in the end. Although the mass zig-zag laser cut or the armed superobots is the incredible icing on the metal. If there's a "flaw" in all these, Don Cheadle as war machine is too flawless to be believable. Not anyone clad in the suit is "Iron Man." One might argue that this "Iron Man" lacks heart, but I tend to think that it's just as it's supposed to be. "Iron Man" doesn't take itself seriously; it's a nonstop joyride starring a wisecracked eccentric atypical superhero, and it deftly delivers.The MovieMaven http://themoviemaven.posterous.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And indeed it is. The first Iron Man came like lighting from a clear blue sky, a movie that started Robert Downey Jr's career, movie loved by audience and critics. Now there is a sequel and people are asking if it's worth it. And I say Hell Yeah.Now when the whole world knows who Iron Man is, Tony is having a hard time staying alive. There are two men coming after him, a Russian Ivan Vanko who has an unfinished business with Tony. He claims that he stole the idea for the arc reactor from his father (which of course isn't entirely true, he is a Russian, you can't believe those.) The second guy after him is actually a competitor in business, Justin Hammer, who, for years is trying to build a suit like Iron Man's but with horrible results. Now with the government wanting Tony's Iron Man suit and Stark Industries closed for business, he has a chance to become the leading weapons industry. The acting and the cast here are truly remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. is, well he is Robert Downey Jr. He is perfect as usual, you can't miss with him being cast in your movie. Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job being the love interest. Mickey Rourke doesn't have much time on screen but when he is you can see he enjoys the role and still tries to establish the character even with such limited screen time. Sam Rockwell is the comical villain and he is great at it. Samuel L. Jackson is a synonym of the word cool and he proves it once again as Nick Fury. He briefly appears but when he does he's got one of the best lines in the movie such as "Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut." or " I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet". The weakest link in the chain is Don Cheadle. He horribly doesn't fit as James Rhodes. He is uninteresting, and he acts too serious for this role. This is supposed to be entertaining, fun movie. And when he has no idea what to do, he copies Terrence Howard's take on this character. His character changed from the best friend ever to the worst friend. He became arrogant too. He actually thinks he is better than Iron Man!! But that of course isn't true. As always there is a great little cameo by Stan Lee. I can't forget all the rush on the internet Olivia Munn being a superhero and then she had just a tiny cameo as a news reporter. I was chuckling in the theater and no one had idea why.Casting Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was the smartest idea anyone ever had. She is the sexiest woman on Earth and seeing her in a tight leather suit is worth all the money on Earth. Her only fight scene in the hallway with like a dozen guards is amazing. It is one of the best choreographed fights of this year. It is just purely awesome, sexy, full of adrenaline and even funny.I just feel like all those composers started to try again after last year's (almost) fiasco. OK, there were few exceptions, the Star Trek soundtrack, Up soundtrack and the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack. In this year there is more than just three great soundtracks and Iron Man 2 is one of them. The score is darker and more bad-ass. Three tracks that really stand out: the first track (Ivan's Metamorphosis), Monaco Drive with this heavy James Bond feel and the track titled Black Widow Kicks Ass. Soundtrack as such features songs from AC/DC, Queen and even Daft Punk.There are more action scenes in this one than in the first movie. The action scenes are much better, they are fast paced, bad ass, simply better. There is even one car chase scene.In summary, if you liked the first then I guarantee you that you will enjoy this one too, it's a must-see for any fan of Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man or a comic-books. (There are tons of comic-book references including the Avengers, Hulk and it's just great fun looking for them.) This is a great, entertaining summer movie so go and watch it.Definitely wait until the end of the credits there is a great extra scene and you find out what agent Coulson was doing in New Mexico.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in the theaters with an open mind ready to expect the best and that is what I got. Iron Man 2 is just as good maybe even better than the first one. Robert Downey Jr is superb as Tony Stark once again. I also loved the performance by Mickey Rourke as Whiplash. I didn't expect much out of him. And of course we all know why Scarlett Johansson is here.This movie takes place right after Stark becomes public. He has to deal with the government who wants to take his suit and Whiplash who wants to kill him because of his father, Howard.I loved everything here. I enjoyed the action, the chicks, the cars, the special effects, and much more. The only thing I really hated was that Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard. I love Cheadle's acting but Howard was perfect in the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic sequel. I hope they make Iron man 3 and I can't wait until the Avengers in two years. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable banter-filled character driven super-hero film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful banter heavy super-hero film in which the emphasis of the film is clearly put on the character of the film and less so on the super-heroic exploits and trials that comic-based films generally focus upon. The diminished focus on action pieces might threaten to bog the picture down but the character interactions and their barbed-filled vocal exchanges keep the film moving along at a clean pace until the inevitable CG heavy battle scenes.Not that there is a lack of money spent in terms of CG wizardry on the screen. But instead of merely focusing their efforts on the suit battles, the film is littered with highly detailed sets and the constant use of extremely high-tech holographic touch sensitive technology is all pervasive. Not to diminish the skirmishes involving the Iron Man suit though as they are fun to watch, very smoothly executed and very aesthetically pleasing especially Micky Rourke's frankensteined creation clashing with Tony Stark's ultra-slick technology.The plot itself treads no particular new ground although it does attempt to through in a great many sub-plots and personal dilemmas for the ample cast of characters to deal with. The problem with most of these dilemmas is that they generate very little serious drama as they are mainly dealt with in either a succinct manner or are treated in a rather glib fashion and things just sort of seem to work themselves out almost accidentally due to the increased amount of events and characters involved basically just diluting the situation to the point that it almost seems an afterthought when it is reconciled. This casual dismissive tone carries over to the antagonists as the film spreads itself out a little too thin to the point that what should have been powerful character conflicts involving the major characters just seem like minor scuffles.There is also the odd sort of underlying theme of a stereo-typical conservative American approach to the way in which the film idolizes weaponry and pushes the agenda that America possessing the most powerful weapon in the world would undoubtedly result in an increase in world peace. Then there's also the extra step the film takes that Americans apparently feel more comfortable in having a shallow, fun-loving, but seemingly trust worthy private individual in possession of the most powerful weapon in the world but not their own government.Is the writer trying to make a statement about the current mental state of American with the increase in paranoia and private militias or is it just more poorly thought out Hollywood worship of the Dirty Harry one man army character doing things we are afraid to take responsibility for? The film makes an attempt to explore the folly of this approach by the sudden attack of Ivan Vanko utilizing similar technology that supposedly was beyond the reach of the rest of the world as promised by Stark. This is then further compounded by a frustrated military friend being able to utilize one of the suits which seems improbable considering the vast amount of hack proof machinery that Stark regularly employs. But like with most issues in Iron Man these are just brushed aside or ignored in the face of an impending threat and we are left wondering what became of all that anyways? But despite all these faults I found the film infectiously enjoyable. Despite the fact that many characters aren't utilized to their fullest, they are immediately compelling and a joy to watch when they are on the screen. Micky Roarke is incredibly fun to watch as he is both a brutal thug and a introverted technology wizard who is only truly friendly to his father and his bird. Tony's relationship with his ambiguously defined girlfriend Pepper Potts is very engaging and their constant over-lapping dialogue exchanges were genuinely funny and wholly natural. Of course most of this has to do with Robert Downey Jr.'s great acting abilities and he really elevates the quality of the movie with his level of skill.Despite the intensely glib tone of the movie I found the whole thing very enjoyable. There's nothing new here to be sure, but the abilities of everyone involved elevate the movie as a whole into a very satisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at a free preview in Singapore, so reviewing it seems like the least I can do. More importantly, not only was it great value for a free viewing, but I plan to pay to see it again later this week.Sequels almost always suck, so I was expecting to be disappointed, especially as I loved the first movie (and I'm not a comic book movie fan, generally).Robert Downey Jr is just great, again! Iron Man, and now IronMan 2, is warm, and funny, and entertaining... because Downey is.Supporting characters from last time (Paltrow, Cheadle, Favreau) were fine, and provided continuity. Cheadle had a bit more this time, so we got the bromance thang going.This time Stark's joined by a bunch of new characters. Sam Rockwell was thoroughly entertaining as his arch-rival Justin Hammer, very funny. Scarlett Johansson got to wear some skin-tight outfit as an ass-kicking Russian spy, nice. Samuel L. Jackson, shows up briefly (but very coolly) as a one-eyed spy boss. And the resurrected Mickey Rourke shows off his Russian accent as the vengeful genius with a grudge, and a neat turn in remote controlled drone (very topical) Iron Men.And let's not forget the Ironettes! Even the AC/DC soundtrack was OK (and I loathe AC/DC, they're so last century).If you liked Iron Man, you'll like Iron Man 2. What more do you want, buddy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'IRON MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five) Like many second films in popular fantasy / action franchises (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER-MAN 2', 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'X-MEN 2', etc.)'IRON MAN 2' takes what worked about the first film and totally ups the ante and creatively expands on the characters and drama of the first film to probably it's emotional and entertaining peak! It in many ways blows the first film out of the water. Although the action is a lot less frequent than you might expect, from a big superhero blockbuster extravaganza like this, when it does happen it's breathtaking; the race-car fight scene, which happens about a third of the way into the movie, is so cool it's mind-blowing and it's also emotionally intense (It's one of the raddest scenes I've ever seen in a movie and the rest of the movie never quite tops it; so the climax does happen pretty early on but that's OK, there's still plenty of quality movie left even so).What's best about the movie is not the action though it's the character drama and dialog; it would be a crime if this thing doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for best screenplay, although I'm sure that's a crime that will most likely be committed (Robert Downey Jr. also unarguably deserves a nomination for his acting performance as well though). The movie is jam packed with some of the most witty clever dialog and interesting character development I've ever seen in a blockbuster like this! The whole thing is a very complicated psychological character exploration, all revolving around the most fascinating superhero character to ever hit the big screen; the eccentric somewhat mad genius that is Tony Stark (once again insanely but amazingly portrayed by Downey Jr.).The film centers around Stark's battles (not with bad guys and world threats, but) with health issues (he's being poisoned to death by the machine he created, in his chest, that initially saved him), alcoholism, a Government that wants to take control of his technology for what they say is the good of the country and his overall fight to keep his sanity dealing with all this stress. Throw in Sam Rockwell as an impressively portrayed billionaire tech rival and Mickey Rourke as a soft spoken madman bent on revenge against the Stark family, who he blames for stealing his father's ideas, and you've got a complete circus act of oddly interesting characters. There's also Don Cheadle cleverly taking over the role of Stark's best friend James Rhodes (although Terrence Howard in the first film was better), there's a little Samuel L. Jackson being cool like always and there's some more Jon Favreau (more than the first film) that adds some nice comedic touches. There is a very sexy Scarlett Johansson playing another super hero named 'Black Widow' but the female characters are a little underdeveloped compared to the men.You can tell it was written by a man (actor Justin Theroux who's only other writing credit is co-writing 'TROPIC THUNDER', another Downey Jr. scene stealer); the women dialog is mostly important plot advancement stuff but with the guys 80 percent of it could have been tossed and the plot would have been intact but it's just so natural and entertaining; like real people shooting the breeze! That's the brilliance of the film! Favreau has also come pretty far as a director; he's much more polished now and knows what's most important to the film. The whole movie just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words. It's an astonishing film going experience if you really like film!Watch our review show, 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxp3NkMebd8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this second part of the Iron Man live story better is that it sticks to the genuine comic books characters. Tony Stark is way more narcissist and infatuate than in the previous movie, which is, in my opinion, much more accurate and enjoyable, at least for the Iron Man fans. Also, great secondary characters: well-playing Sam Rockwell and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. Enjoyable action and promising after-credits ending. Heck, AC/DC music, too! I gave this movie 8 out of 10, for being a comic books and IM fan, but any SF, Action and why not Drama consumer would surely enjoy it. Don't trust me, though, go see for yourselves, it's worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2010, quite possibly the number one film. I really can't see anything that could possibly top this film. One of my favorite movie going experiences EVER. I was thrilled with Iron Man back in 2008 but this takes that experience and adds to it. I'm so happy to report that unlike other sequels made only for a cash grab, Iron Man 2 delivers on every front possible. There is no doubt why IM2 will be the box office smash of 2010. With good reason, the film is well worth the price of admission, more so then any movie I've seen in years. Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair. The new actors are injected perfectly. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and even good old Garry Shandling are exceptional. We all knew Scarlett Johansson could handle the sex appeal but she's especially good as Tony's new assistant/SHIELD operative. Don Cheadle trumps Terrance Howard's Rhodey in every way. I'm also relieved to report that Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow are even more amazing in their lead roles. They've really grown in to embodying these wonderful characters. What many don't realize but soon will is that this film has tremendous depth. The lead characters all respond to turmoil and are fleshed out beautifully. Judging by the commercials, people may expect wild action but they are going to be pleasantly surprised at the complexity and depth of the film itself. What only adds to the experience is the fact that they managed to deliver fun in to the equation. This masterpiece is one of those rare summer event movies that really does deliver something for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great superhero movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...Paltrow as Virginia "Pepper" Potts, the director as "Happy" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool! There's a reason I didn't mention Don Cheadle as Rhodey. His wooden performance was the weak spot of the whole film. I don't get it because he is such a great actor. But his presence was toxic and it looked like he threw off the other actors (noticeably Downey Jr).This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's "Ex-wife" missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And that's coming from a neutral viewer:Iron Man's astonishing return!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It was pretty good in this movie-making aspect, although it is an action movie, there is some quite exciting development, especially the leads.Don Cheadle made a perfect substitute of Terrence Howard, and looked pretty good in the movie.So did the Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlet Johansson's heroines.For me, Scarlet is one of the most gifted and talented and in the same time, the most beautiful actresses in the last decade and even more.And last, but not least, of course, the Iron Robert Downey Jr., making one of his unique, specifically for him, roles.He is smart, funny and in the same time, well, action hero type of guy-he adds so much to this otherwise, stereotyped role.Sam Rockwell was a little irritating, but that's what his role is supposed to be, and to those who have doubts, yes, Mickey Rourke made a decent and interesting role again.TIMING:Almost perfect, except, maybe, the opening credits and a few over timed scenes afterwards, everything was alright and on the perfect spot.PLOT/STORY:I finally can say it-YES, the day has come.A day, where superhero movies haven't got just CGI, put a pretty decent story, attached to the normal amount of CGI.Well, hard to say normal, a little bit over-the-top, but nonetheless fun, when you get use to the headache.The humor was perfect, brilliantly touched to the smallest line.And most importantly-it's not that predictable-i don't mean the ending, but the development, leading to it.Excecutet skilfully, when looked from this point of view.CGI:10/10, nothing else to add.Believable Flawless.Perfect.With no big flaws or plot holes, very funny dialogue, skillful acting and good directing, Iron Man is definitely the best movie of the year so far.The perfect blockbuster as well.I'm glad a saw it, and if the first one didn't made me a fan, this one did.I can't wait to see it again.Cheers to Iron Man Amazing! I would've given this a ten, but with some very few weaknesses, i'll lower this a little, although it did make me a bigger fan than before...My rate: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 = Double Awesomeness!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Iron Man was made John Favreau said he can never imagine anyone except Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and as we know RDJ's career went to a totally different level after that movie... Iron Man 2 promises the same.. Not many think that this movie could achieve the status the previous one achieved but mark my words, it will provide double entertainment as the previous one.. Sure its ending is also not up to the mark as the previous one but Robert Downey is the star his action sequences, his comic timing and his one liners are so brilliant that u might tempt to give an Oscar to him right away! Mickey Rourke as Whiplash is superb as ever! He is mean, he is strong, he is dangerous.. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is sexy and perfect, although many may complaint about not being given the full description about her character when she is introduced in the film.. Don Cheadle beats Terence Howard as John Rhodes in this movie.. But the real surprise came in the form of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer.. His performance was a delight! Gwyneth Paltrow was same as the previous one..To conclude this movie promises to deliver double awesomeness in form of action, humor, special effects and everything.. Don't Miss this one!!My Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first but still entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was nowhere near as good as the first one. First of all, I hate when they replace main characters in movies. I understand that it's not necessarily the fault of the film but replacing Terrance Howard with Don Cheadle affects the feel of the movie; similar to when they replaced Katie Holmes with Maggie Gylenhaul in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Also, a technology that was pushed to be so incredible and impossible to replicate in the first installment is thrown around in this movie like if it's no more rare than an std. Lastly, similar to the first film, there were some huge plot holes. If a villain's weapons are a sort of lasso, wouldn't common sense tell you to just fire on him from outside of the lasso range? I would certainly think a genius like Tony Stark would be able to figure that out. Also, if you access the main computer and can reset the War Machine, why couldn't you also reset the others? Nonetheless, Robert Downey Jr. once again proves to be a top notch actor in Hollywood and the movie's transition to the "Avengers" adds some excitement to an otherwise quick and overrated ending. Still, I was a little disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted this movie has some flaws (but what movie doesn't?) and not as thrilling as the first Iron Man movie but it's still very enjoyable and has some very good points. Pretty much all the actors do very well and are well-cast. Like we're introduced to new characters like Justin Hammer, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. We see more of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. We see Rhodey (now portrayed by Don Cheadle) become War Machine and battles along with Iron Man at the end. When I saw Cheadle as Rhodey, at first I didn't like how they changed the actor, but surprisingly he fit the role better than Terrence Howard. Robert Downey Jr. of course is spot on with his performance as Tony Stark being both arrogant and full of himself but also likable and charismatic at the same time. However, Gwyneth Paltrow was good as Pepper Potts and I liked how they showed more romance between her and Tony Stark but her nagging got kind of annoying. There's also a lot more lovely ladies in this one than the first one like Scarlett Johansson and the Ironettes. The action sequences and visual effects are very impressive too. However, the plot seems to be pretty slow in the middle but it gets better in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed this film...slows down a tad in the middle as far as pacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love people who admit to never having read one issue of Iron Man trying to review this movie. What the hell? How can you accurately review something when you haven't the slightest inkling of the source material its based on? That's like me trying to give medical advice and I'm not a doctor.I think RDJ's portrayal as Tony Stark is spot on, I've read here people talking about how he is an arrogant, sometimes unlikeable hero. These are obviously more people who have never even picked up an Iron Man comic. Tony Stark is arrogant and can be very self-absorbed until he has his eyes opened. I could have done without some of Paltrow's nagging as Pepper Potts, but again that's how it is in the comics.Potts and Stark have this really inhibited interest in each other that they tried to keep under wraps because they work together but you know they want each other. My only real complaint is the character Rourke Portrayed is kind of a mix in the comics Ivan Vanko and Whiplash are not the same guy in the comics. But I loved Rourke's portrayal overall. I did like Rockwell's Hammer as it only made us forget how arrogant and likable Stark actually was. I know that we cant have things blowing up for a full two hours, so it slows down in the middle to give Stark some time to contemplate what's slowly happening to him. He decides that 'hey if I'm gonna die I got nothing to lose' so he begins behaving very irresponsibly (even for his normal character).I admit being drunk off his butt at his party in full Iron Man gear is a bit much, but they needed to set up him behaving so carelessly that Rhodey had to step in. Seeing Johannson in tights is always good, and by the way non comic readers her real name is NATASHA ROMANOV not Natalie (that was just an alias)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is not The Dark Knight. And it shouldn't be.For my money, I can't think of a movie that better embodies the term "popcorn flick." Like its predecessor, this one is all about fun. There are rock 'em sock 'em explosions aplenty, as well as some slickly filmed fight sequences that are quite memorable (but, honestly, aren't earth-shattering when compared to any number of other uber-energetic comic book films of the last decade). Don't be fooled, though; this sequel to the 2008 hit actually builds on the mythos of Tony Stark in some welcome ways.Front and center in this particular feature is "the past"?that is, it's very much focused on Howard Stark (Tony's father) and his vision of a futuristic society that thrives on the energy derived from his Arc Reactor. There are also some other juicy tidbits we learn about Stark Sr., not the smallest of which has a little something to do with rewriting the periodic table. Also thrown into the mix is a physicist who worked with Howard back in the day. He's a disgruntled Russian who feels he's been slighted because?among other things?of Tony's success. He's got a son of his own named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), and he's determined to avenge his father's legacy at all costs. Yes, the plot is driven by a stereotypical variation on the revenge story we're all familiar with, but, given the already superficial nature of the film (which, let's be honest, we all expected), it works well.Iron Man 2, quite simply, does everything a competent sequel should. In this case, it further highlights the flaws of its protagonist, and it builds on the comedy/action pairing that made the original film so successful. It even ties in new characters?such as Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff?who are fairly interesting in their own right while settting itself up for a third film that will (hopefully) continue the trend.Despite all its upward momentum, Iron Man 2 does falter from time to time. As is the case with many-a-movie, our hero solves seemingly impossible "puzzles" in record time (here, we're talking about scientific enigmas that can only be deciphered with the use of improvised proton accelerators). This directly correlates with a looming sense of danger?developed by a specific plot element that I won't ruin here?that's established early in the film, and, because of this ridiculously absurd "quick fix," said surprisingly tangible sense of dread is undercut in an extraordinarily premature manner.But, again, what did you expect? This is Iron Man 2, not the philosophical diatribe of a makeup wearing psychopath. As tired as I am of this clichéd phrase, it still applies: "It is what it is." Because of that, there should be zero complaints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More mega-budget metallic mayhem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the excellent Marvel adaptation Iron Man isn't as strong as the original in the story department, being a fairly routine 'villains vs good guy' tale that does little to develop the central character; it also suffers from some interminably inane dialogue (people are talking, but they don't really seem to be saying much). Thankfully, the film compensates somewhat in terms of sheer spectacle and excitement (and I'm not just talking about Scarlett Johansson in a figure-hugging leather catsuit!).The first of Iron Man 2's incredible action set-pieces introduces Mickey Rourke's Russian villain Ivan Vanko, who causes mayhem during the Monaco Grand Prix in an effort to kill Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and thus avenge his scientist father, who he believes was cheated outed of fame and fortune by Tony's father Howard. He fails of course, but not until he's trashed several F1 cars mid-race, slicing them in half with his 'power-whips'. Great stuff!Vanko is given another chance at killing the playboy billionaire turned superhero when unscrupulous weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) busts him out of jail and gives him the means necessary to develop an army of drones. The film culminates with the inevitable smack-down between Iron Man and Vanko's obedient robot warriors, a satisfyingly chaotic battle full of big guns, grinding metal, and destruction on a massive scale.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating: *** out of 4.If the first IRON MAN was the origin story, than naturally its sequel would throw in the consequences. That doesn't make it a better film; in fact it's too much of it actually. But with the right balance of humor, thrills, special effects gimmicks, and more of Robert Downey Jr. as the narcissistic Stark, IRON MAN 2 is an adequate follow-up, even if it goes wildly out of control as it makes like SPIDER-MAN 3 and throws in as many subplots than it can handle.But unlike the latter, director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux (TROPIC THUNDER) keeps things better in balance and some of the sub-stories don't come quite as pointless as the one's in SPIDER-MAN 3. Still, if your gonna put Mickey Rourke as a cool bad guy named Ivan Vanko, you might as well give him better use than a filler for the grand finale. Vanko is the son of a disgraced Russian physicist who once collaborated with Tony Stark's father. Now, Vank demands revenge to lift his father's legacy. But the movie seems more interested in Stark's own problems with his life as mankind savior. A US senator (played hilariously by Garry Shandling) argues that Stark should hand over his technology to the US Military. Stark declines, taking him one step further to competitor Justin Hammer, who has tried endlessly to apply his own technological breakthroughs akin to Stark's and failing miserably. He now recruited Vanko, who failed in his first attempt to assassinate Stark, to build him a new breakthrough that would rival Stark and shame him in his own "Stark Expo" - Stark's annual unfoldment of his latest inventions. This gives more time for Rourke to play Ivan, not as a kick-ass bad guy, but as a comic relief spending time conversing with his pet Cockatoo. There's yet more plot: Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets a promotion as new CEO of Stark Industries, she gets a new assistant named Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) who's really more than who she is. Plus Stark is being considered to be a part of the Avengers Initiative by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, who extends his after-credit cameo in the first as a full-time role), and Stark's buddy Lt. Col. "Rhodey" Rhodes (now played by Don Cheadle) gets his hands on one Stark's earlier Iron Man suit that gets a few modifications. Did I miss anything? Is IRON MAN 2 a crowded movie? Yes. It's not only over-plotted, it's cast reads like a who's who of who would people want to see in the latest Hollywood blockbuster (You want Scarlett Johannson in a tight rubber suit kicking butt? You got it!). But hey! In the heat of summer time, boredom can easily be cured by some explosive blockbuster fun, and IRON MAN 2 works fine. It's not as great as the first (which I never thought of as great as others think), and too much of it is a bid distracting (Stark is still front-and-center, but sometimes they tend to put him aside, then bring him back, and set him aside again), but it's a certified fun movie on a boring day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Robert Downey Jr. is, in my mind, the second best actor at portraying a certain superhero, #1 being Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. RDJr is Tony Stark and knocks it out of the park with his performance. You can't help but love the guy. He's funny, narcissistic, caring, and honest. He was absolutely fantastic in the senate hearing scene.Gwyneth Paltrow is starting to grow on me. I didn't care for her in "Iron Man" but she seemed to do a pretty decent job in this. I hope they turn her into Rescue in "Iron Man 3".Don Cheadle also impressed me as Rhodey/War Machine. He's a much better actor than Terrence Howard, who is now stuck doing "Law and Order: L.A.". Seeing Rhodey return as an Avenger would be sweet.Rourke was great as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. I just wish he'd gotten more screen time. I also didn't care for his battle armor at the end of the movie. It looked kind of stupid.Scarlett Johansson (mm, mm) was mostly there to draw in the other males who were hesitant about seeing this. It probably worked. I'm especially glad we'll see her again in "The Avengers". Also, to any Marvel execs who might happen upon this: PLEASE MAKE A BLACK WIDOW MOVIE!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!! Sam Rockwell was also good, though a tad annoying, as Justin Hammer (with his Hammeroids. great line from RDJ). He seemed liked he really had fun with the role.Samuel L. Jackson. Enough said. He was in 2 scenes as Nick Fury and he was great. Samuel L. Jackson is a real crowd pleaser and never ceases to entertain us.The action was pretty good, except for the final battle (Iron Man and War Machine vs. Whiplash). It seemed too short and not much happened.This movie is also very funny. When Natalie is introduced is a great scene (for several reasons) and, as I wrote earlier, the senate scene was my favorite scene.Jon Favreau, the director, really seems to know what he's doing. I hope is somehow involved with "The Avengers".All in all, this is a good action packed superhero adventure that will make you laugh and want to watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been a lot written about this movie - about why it works, or doesn't work, about whether it was effective or just felt added-on to the first one, about whether Don Cheadle was preferable to Terrence Howard, whether there was too much action, not enough action... you get the idea.As a major fan of the first film, I'll admit that it took multiple viewings before I found a way to approach this movie that made me want to give it more than a 5 / 10 rating (good for aficionados, but few others). Yes, I would have appreciated some more character development. I don't think Don Cheadle was BETTER than Terrence Howard, but he did just fine. The action sequences are amazing. Scarlet Johansen actually did quite well as Agent Romanoff (I was skeptical). As in the first one, the comedic element is always just around the corner; maybe that tactic works less well here, but it can be a great tension-reliever.On to the point of view. My first impression (SPOILERS) was that the final physical fight (not the chase, which was great) should have lasted longer. I felt the terseness gave a "chopped" feeling, and made the final scenes anti-climatic. Then I realized that this second Iron Man film is a battle of minds: Stark's and Vanko's. The final confrontation should be viewed as a battle of intelligence, not necessarily equipment. Seen this way, the "final confrontation" actually begins long before Iron Man and Whiplash actually face-off. Every twist and aerial turn of the final chase is an inter-play of Stark's intelligence versus Vanko's. Viewed in this manner, now the film makes compelling viewing every time I see it. Not only that, but I've noticed little combative elements of their minds throughout the film.I should add that I have not read the Iron Man comics, so I cannot speak about "accuracy" or "faithfulness" to the original. The first Iron Man film should be seen before viewing this one; but Iron Man 2 is definitely fun, exciting, and actually a deeper film than I thought. Props to Jon Favreau for not bogging the movie down in minutiae.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Iron Man! No, it's Tony Stark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot: There are 2 story threads here that merge. 1. The government and military are putting pressure on Tony Stark to turn over the Iron Man Technology to them. 2. Some Russian guy blames Tony's dad for the persecution and death of his own father and seeks revenge. How he goes about it ties into the government's claims that the Iron man technology is better served by giving it to them. Analysis: Enjoyable action-filled movie; well acted and written. Worth your time. If you're not a comic book buff or nut you don't need to read further. You have all you need.Some entertainers (actors, musicians, athletes, IMDb reviewers,etc.) use a "stage" name and the public is generally unaware of their real name or private identity. But if some find out what their real name is (as sometimes happens) it might not matter because they're more familiar with the stage name and persona and prefer it. In this instance the private identity is eclipsed or overshadowed by the familiar and public persona. However, because Tony Stark is well known in his own right as a famous inventor and head of a well known company (Stark Industries, Inc.) this would not happen. Not to mention the fact that he enjoys attention; seems to need it; thrives on it; is a bit of a ham.So I gotta ask: when people see Iron Man flying across the sky, do they say, "There goes Iron Man", --or do they say, "There goes Tony Stark"? There are practical reasons why super heroes (and people involved in important and dangerous operations) need a secret identity; need to maintain a separation; and I'm sure you can guess them. So while I enjoyed the movie, and while I know it's just fantasy, I cannot help but wonder at the unnecessary and foolish recklessness and vanity of Tony Stark that makes him put so much at risk in order to share the limelight with his alter ego Iron Man. And this is beside the point: What is it about good-looking women in form-fitting outfits that beat people up that turns me on? Love, Boloxxxi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>waiting for IRONMAN 3,4,5 =D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched IRONMAN2 about two days ago, and I kind of loved it =D, better than the first one, because here Tony Stark went crazier and more unstoppable hahah. Well,, I think here, Robert Downey Jr. didn't act at all, I meant he's definitely Tony Stark, Tony Stark is him! so, no wonder if his performance is really that cool =P, CZ its not about plays somebody Else's character but your own character, just as easy as you to be yourself, although I know that sometimes its kinda difficult to be yourself. But here I am saying that Tony Stark or Ironman is definitely Downey Jr., the genius and crazy, sexy guy hahahah. OK, its enough time to screw around, actually for me, they brought us a new, different paradigm, both Favreau and Downey, different one of a superhero in a witty way of funny and sometimes unpredictable story, and it'll makes you just like "oh my, cant wait for the next sequel" or "damn, he's cool as hell, I love Ironman, I love Tony Stark!".hmhh..., I liked the Tony's experiment room mostly, man, I absolutely down on my jaws about three meters to the edge of the white screen on the theater 3, when I was watching this movie. often enough I, imagining myself doing something on that room, designing, filming...(if only the room exist) lol. Not just it, I was like WOW by Scarlett, the melodramatic actress acted surprisingly awesome as a secret agent, she even did some action maneuvers, hahaha, pretty magnificent, good job scar-jo! and the Ironman's enemy, Ivan vanko, has a good acting as a god damn terrible freaky smart and ambitious, Russian ...umh,well, can I say "scientist!?" and guys, I love his Russian accent, simply stunning =)the one really makes this movie lame, is the kissing scene (tony and pepper) ugh, they should throw away that scene, moreover it was in the almost ending of this movie, oh my..., it was almost destroy the whole this beautifully funny movie, I hate pepper, Paltrow kinda overacting I think..., just easy mom -__-", she should be replaced by Cate Winslett or Julia Roberts, I think they would be more suit with Stark hehehehe...But overall, I love and enjoy this movie, the actor (Downey), the actress (scar-jo) and the music, especially when tony and Rhodes changed the party hall on Tony's house into a battlefield! will be good to see this even as trilogy or tetra-logy, penta-logy maybe *grin*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah,there were some plot holes, but who cares... you don't go to this movie to critique the plot.Anywho, the only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was the scene at the end when they didn't OK Tony Stark for the Avengers. Are they covering their bases in case they can't afford to pay Downey for the Avengers or what? Iron Man and/or The Avengers will NOT work without Stark/ Downey! His charisma is what made these movies the best Marvel movies ever made. You can't have the Avengers without Iron Man... you can't have Iron Man without Tony Stark... you can't have Tony Stark without Robert Downey!I sincerely hope Downey signs on for a prominent role in the Avengers, otherwise it will be severely diminished. Casting makes a movie. Downey was perfectly cast and adds as much to his character as Halle Berry took away from Storm, Affleck took away from Daredevil, and Ioan Gruffudd took away from Mr. Fantastic.Not as good as the first, but still the second best Marvel film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, just some things need more explanation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I went to see the movie, I looked online to see what people thought of it, and there was a lot of mixed reviews, so I didn't know what to think.At the end of the movie, I was very impressed by the movie. It added a lot to the first one, while still moving on with its' own story. It had a good mix between comedy, dialog, and action, though I think it could have taken a small bit from the dialog and add it to the other two parts.Something I have noticed about Iron Man 1 and 2 is that both movies were setting up something. During most of Iron Man 1, they were setting up the Iron Man story; they were giving Iron Man's back story. That makes sense, to explain where the hero came from. So when I went to see Iron Man 2, I expected it to jump right into things, but by the end of the movie, I realized it was setting up some more. (1st of two spoilers) At the end of the first movie, after the credits their was Nick Fury, from SHIELD, wanting to talk about the Avengers. Okay reference to the avengers, that is cool and all. Then when the second movie came, Nick Fury played a bigger part, and you slowly realize that Iron Man 2 is slowly setting it's way up to the Avengers movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not trying to drown us in Avengers references and scenes. There really are only two or three scenes talking about the Avengers, and a few clever references (a certain shield belonging to a certain super hero) and that is about it. The thing is that all of Tony Stark's progression as a character in this movie, is to guide him to being a part of the Avengers. (2nd of two spoilers) And the end of the second movie, after the credits, you see a guy from SHIELD in New Mexico, and they find "something" and you see Thor's hammer, which is going to be the next movie in the series.So though it is a good movie, and made my inner nerd freak when I saw Thor's hammer, I am starting to feel iffy about the Avengers Movie, whenever it comes out in a few years. They still need to do Thor, Captain America, and Ant Man, and then the Avengers. Will the last three movies just be set ups as well? And when we do finally reach the Avengers movie, will it be as amazing as all the sets up make it seem?That is a question that only time will answer. I still recommend seeing this movie, if you are a comic book fan, or even just an average movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I like this movie as much as the first one, it's not better, it's not worse. It's a pretty entertaining movie and I really enjoy it.Now that the world knows the identity of Tony Stark and that he's really Iron Man, people have constantly been trying to recreate the Iron Man suit for their own personal gain. And the government tries to get Tony to hand over his, like that would ever happen. Tony continues to save the day until a man comes out of nowhere, with a similar suit and wreaks havoc. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the first Iron Man and enjoying it, I thought that the second would be mediocre at best. Well, I can honestly say that didn't happen because I found Iron Man 2 be just as fun and action-packed as the first one.The film starts off very nicely, with recordings from the end of the first film where Tony Stark tells the media that he is the man in the iron suit. The scene then cuts to Russia where we're introduced to our villain, Ivan Vanko watching his father dying. It appears that his father, Anton used to work with Tony's father, Howard, and somewhere down the road, Howard seized Anton's ideas and booted him to the curb and for this, Ivan swears revenge on Stark. Meanwhile, the palladium core of Tony's arc reactor that keeps him alive is slowly killing him and he can't find an alternate. He begins to become increasingly irresponsible and downhearted about his looming demise, and decides not to tell anyone about his ailment and appoints Pepper Pots as the CEO of Stark Industries and employs Natalie Rushman as his personal assistant. While racing in the Monaco Grand Prix, Tony is attacked by Vanko, but is able to fight him off. Now, Stark must get his life back together, build a new reactor and stop Vanko.While most sequels try to up the ante, Iron Man 2 comes across as a brisk and harmless film that meanders along at an attractive clip, with emotional discomfort a distant thought which is very refreshing. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the total opposite of some other comic book films. For example, it's definitely not darker than the first Iron Man and also gives itself artistic freedom to extend on the impossible. Common sense simply does not work here and Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux have a lot of freedom with the chines of reality. While the first Iron Man was an origins story, the sequel had no lack of possible roads to take, so it decided to go with the characterization road and instead of developing its universe, the movie merely takes it's cast of characters and tosses them into circumstances grimmer than before, upping the stakes but at the same time echoing the spirit of the first one. The characters are well written, each quick conversation decided with a mature bleakness that differentiates from the illegitimate situations that the film features and while the movie could be labeled as a comedy, but the humor flows so perfectly that you get the sense that it would be out of the question to write this film and not have these characters joke with one another. There are a number of themes in this movie, the most notable one being one's legacy, of what we pass on when we pass away; the impact on those who follow us and how the consequences of past actions can ricochet down the line long after someone passes on.The visual effects in this film are fantastic with lots of explosions, ear-jolting sound effects, stunning camera techniques and cinematography to keep the audience focused. As for the action, there's only a few scenes, but they all bring a lot to the movie by bringing the viewer a ton of excitement and delight, especially the finale, a 30 minute visual feast for the eyes and senses of Iron Man and War Machine battling Whiplash and his drones, which left me hungry for more. The soundtrack is darker than the first film and has some outstanding tracks along with a great soundtrack with songs by Daft Punk, Queen, and AC/DC.The acting is incredible just as it was in the first film: Gwyneth Paltrow once again proves herself as Pepper Potts, bringing a lot of sadness to the role, but is by no means a damsel in distress, not to mention she and Downey have wonderful chemistry, Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan and gets to have more fun in the movie rather than just staying behind the camera, Sam Jackson pops up again as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury sowing the seeds for later MCU films. Don Cheadle picks up right where Terrance Howard left off in the first Iron Man as Rhodey/ War Machine, stepping into the role with certainty and proves himself to be superior to Howard. Scarlett Johansson is awesome as Black Widow, proving she is more than capable of being in an action film and while she isn't on screen for much of the movie, her flight scene in the hall does leave an impact. The villains of the film as just as important as our heroes and they don't disappoint with Mickey Rourke adding a combination of a contrived show person, arrogant mastermind and an overpowering monster, while perfectly personifying Vanko's rude visage while Sam Rockwell is complete comic fodder as Tony's business rival, Justin Hammer. Rockwell kills it in this role and is a joy to watch, either when he's losing his temper with Vanko or awarding his own creations with childish enthusiasm. But the true heart and soul of Iron Man 2 comes from Robert Downey Jr. He is the mind, heart and spirit of the man in the iron suit which makes me think if the film was written especially for him. When it comes to Stark's vain personality and sarcasm, he also shines there too, providing us with a ton of great quips and laugh-out-lord moments and while Downey does portray a selfish, egotistical playboy; he is still a likable character. Much like the first one, RDJ is and will always be Iron Man.All and all, Iron Man 2 is a worthy successor to the first film, proving us with more of what we loved with more action, humor, a killer soundtrack, stellar performances and a great story. Definitely give this film a watch, you'll have a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel that surpasses expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr., I naturally want to see everything that he is in. When I found out that he was Iron Man, I was intrigued and excited. I loved the first movie and eagerly anticipated the second one. When it came out, I was worried it would not live up to my expectations.I needn't have worried; the movie surpassed my expectation. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect. I just wanted the relationship between Stark and Potts to develop more. I liked that there were links to other Avenger characters, such as the mention of New Mexico and a drawing of the Tesseract. At the time, of course, I didn't make the connection because I hadn't seen any of the other Avenger movies. Now that I have, I look for the hints that are cleverly placed in all films.Robert Downey Jr. once again shines as Tony Stark. You see his vulnerability in this one when he realizes that the palladium heart he uses to stay alive is also what is killing him. Downey, of course, makes Tony real. He makes mistakes and then tries to recover from them. He is arrogant and egotistical, humble and scared. Downey allows Tony to show all of these emotions without making him a caricature. He really is one of the greatest actors of his generation.Returning as Pepper Potts is Gwyneth Paltrow. As in the first film, Potts does not have a lot to do but still needs to be rescued. Paltrow plays Potts well; at one point I wanted to throw something at her for the way she treats Tony. I get that she's irritated by his behavior, but the fact that he's trying to make amends should count for something yet she doesn't think so. Paltrow is perfect.Don Cheadle takes over the role of Colonel James Rhodes from Terrance Howard. I really wanted to hate Cheadle; Howard was so perfect as Rhodey. However, Cheadle did a great job and at times, I forgot that Howard didn't return to the sequel. We get to see Cheadle suit up in this one as War Machine and I loved when both he and Stark teamed up for battle.Academy Award winner Mickey Rourke is Ivan Vankov, a Russian determined to get revenge on Tony for what Howard Stark did to his father. Rourke is convincing as Vankov, carrying the Russian accent perfectly and makes you believe that he really is Vankov. One interesting thing to note is that the beautiful bird that was in the film was at the request of Rourke. He wanted Vankov to have a human side and have love for something, and so the bird was added into the film. This was a risky move that works. Although you know that he's up to no good, you can't help but like him when he requests that his bird is with him when he works.The rest of the cast is rounded out with Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, Clark Gregg and Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, each is wonderful in their roles. It was nice to see Jackson and Gregg return as their characters from S.H.I.E.L.D. and introduce us to Johansson as well. There's a bit of a hint as to who she really is early in the film when she takes Happy down in a boxing move, but you have a tendency to forget that until her alter ego of Natasha Romanov is revealed.Graphics play a huge part in this movie and rightfully so. Tony is an innovator and a step ahead of modern technology. It makes me hope that everything he uses will eventually be in every household in the world. Audi also makes a guest appearance when Tony drives a few of his cars in the film.Many people were worried that Iron Man 2 wouldn't be as good as the first one, but those worries were quickly put to rest. For a sequel, it is everything it should be. Here's hoping the bar is raised even higher in Iron Man 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic movie which defies the preconception of the sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever a stand-alone movie becomes a sequel, frequent moviegoers cannot help but cringe at the idea of having their favorite films ruined by the mere greed of movie studios. Thankfully, fans of Iron Man were able to have greater hopes than those of other movies turned sequel due to the abundance of material available via the original Marvel comics, thus giving birth to the illustrious sequel that is Iron Man 2. This superhero flick opens up as a Russian television set portrays Tony Stark(brilliantly portrayed by Robert Downey Jr.) revealing himself as Iron Man during a press conference. Moments later, the setting contrasts itself dramatically as the film captures the final words of an elderly Russian man towards his son, Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke). With the assistance of his father's blueprints, Ivan creates his own version of Stark's Arc Reactor with the intent of weaponizing it for his own purposes.Anybody who has seen the film can more than happily realize the fact that Robert Downey Jr. was a phenomenal choice for the portrayal of Tony Stark. While watching the movie, it appears as if he has completely become Tony Stark, possessing every single quirk that the billionaire playboy shows. His lines move naturally with a tone of voice one would expect from the overly arrogant Stark. However, what truly stood out to me in Downey's acting style is his portrayal of Stark's descent into a state of weakness. Without revealing further pieces of the plot, I can assure any moviegoer that Downey allows you to feel a conflict between laughing at Stark's actions and feeling absolute sympathy. I can firmly state that, without Downey, the character of Tony Stark would not have captivated me nearly as much as it does now.When it comes to costumes, anybody can agree that we would all pay an extremely large amount of money to obtain one of Stark's suits. They are simply some of the most interesting pieces of technology we can even imagine, while also looking simply fantastic. In Iron Man 2, we are introduced to Stark's different models for his Iron Man suit, each showing a different taste which I greatly enjoy. Also, we are introduced to the creation of Ivan's 'suit', which consists mainly of two electrified whips with an amazing capacity for destruction. All in all, the ability for the costume designer to transform the original drawings of these suits from the comics into these realistic suits of metal interests me to no end. If there is anything to take from the movie, it is the ingenuity that is put behind every small detail.In its entirety, Iron Man 2 was an amazing movie which defied the preconception of the typical sequel. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first movie, and especially to those who recently saw the amazing movie, The Avengers. As my favorite Avenger, I could not possibly see myself enjoying the movie itself without first both experiencing and loving both movies of the Iron Man series. In my opinion, Iron Man 2 deserves an 8.5/10 as it may not be perfect, but it is truly an amazing film.I shall be anxiously waiting for the release of Iron Man 3 in 2013.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Personally, I thought it was better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I will get a lot of hate for this, but I actually liked this movie more than the first. Now I'm not saying that this film is better than the first, I guess in terms of writing, this is the worst film. However, I had more fun watching this movie. To me, this was the more fun of the two.Now it isn't a perfect film by any means. Pepper Potts wasn't great in the first film, but in this film she seems to have two modes. She's either annoying, or she is a complete idiot. I'm sorry, but if a droid ten feet away from me begins beeping and blinking red, I won't just stand there and look at it, I'm running away as fast as I can. Also, like the first film, there is way more talking then action, in fact there's even less action in this film.However that brings me into the good stuff. While this film has more talking than action, I actually liked the talking. Robert Downey Jr. was hilarious, he always had me smiling. And because of this, despite Stark still being a douche, I liked him a lot more. The film is just full of witty banter. So I liked when there was action and when there wasn't action. And once again my favorite character was Rhodey, once again reminding me of myself. Scarlett Johansen was hot. The two villains made the perfect antagonist. Ivan was intimidating, and Hammer was funny. And I liked the story. It's basically part Iron Man movie, part trailer for the Avengers, and for me it worked.I can't really see why this film was hated by so many people. Sure it has good reviews, and most people seem to like it. But of all the Avengers movies, this one seems to get the most hate. I really enjoyed this movie, it isn't perfect, and the first film is probably a better film, but I enjoyed this movie more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, 3.5 out of 5 translates into 7 out of 10, and no, I can't agree with that ? I'd have to give this beast a 5 out of 5. Actually, a 9 out of 10, losing 1 point because it was only incredibly entertaining and had a plot line that held together. But, getting that 10, is hard.THERE WILL BE SPOILERS but I want to say this first! The acting was picture-perfect. This reminds me of Richard Donner's post-production remark, in gist: "I guess Marlon Brando was worth the money." Perhaps I shouldn't put quotes around that, but that is what he meant. It pays to have talent and these people so earned. I agree, a half-naked Whiplash didn't seem believable ? Favreau and Rourke MADE it believable. The burning underneath relationship between fickle Tony and over-burdened Potts was believable. I really didn't believe Scarlet could pull off Black Widow.. but, boy, oh boy, did she pull off Black Widow, leaving me wanting more. I so wish I could say that about the former Spider-Man series! And, then there is Sam Rockwell's smarmy Stark competition, Justin Hammer.. very well played, sir. Sam is going places. We first saw him as the sneak in Charlie's Angels playing the victim to be revealed as the espionage snake, I saw him help beat a drug-wasted art celebrity to near unconsciousness in Basquiat. He's clearly doing things, be it Moon or otherwise. Very nice interplay within the cast. And Cheadle came through for us as the seamless replacement. Lessening my concern over the Edward Norton / Mark Ruffalo affair. Director Favreau, Happy, Foggy Nelson, +1, when are you going to return to your role in Dare Devil, I miss you (and that cast)! IT'S COMING and then there is the tiny role of Nick Fury.. actually, I am disappointed with the one-eyed Jackson in this. Maybe he isn't being given enough room to role but Marvel should have went with the original image.. no sense of Nick's toughness here.. I really hope he changes this in the Nick Fury Movie, if that ever happens.THE SPOILERS but blink and that is really a very small part. I loved the timing and the story here. IM2 supersedes 1!! And as I say this I know there are other opinions: the hard-ass action all the way folks won't agree. Fine. Look at the story: Iron Man's dad has a greater vision but his creative partner in the formulation of the ark reactor did too. In a sense, Iron Man is Howard Stark's creation but Whiplash was his partner's. There is the idea of connectivity and karma here: what goes around, comes around.. sins of the fathers kind of thing.. not developed enough to bring that solid 10 out of 10 but close. And Whiplash is brilliant and not dead at the end of the flick either. Captain America's unexplained shield. And, Thor's hammer. All on a time-line preceding The Incredible Hulk.I also loved the idea that Tony was dying from essentially metal poisoning via the battery implant (the alcoholic gig just wasn't palatable), that SHIELD is aware of it, and that Tony has issues with his past relationship with his father. Nice writing there! Frankly, Batman TDK does not hold up to this cinema. The writing, the acting, the film-making is better here. I really hope this is not Marvel's highest peak but just the start of a sustained plateau. Film-making is getting smarter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" If I knew I could trust the military, I would gladly give them the weapon "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the incredible, innovative and often futurist mind of comic book artist, Stand Lee, comes this sequel to his hero. The Film is called " Iron Man II. " Director Jon Theroux, follows the basic character Iron Man, and challenges him with several new problems at once. First the alter ego of the Iron Man, Mr. Tony Stark, (Robert Downey) learns, the atomic power pack in his chest is not only saving his life, but is killing him at the same time. Secondly, his best friend, Lt. Col James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is covering for his friend but is also trying to secure one of the top secret iron man suits for the military and with the help of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) may well succeed. Lastly, there is the main frame heavy, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke, excellent acting), who vows to destroy Stark for betraying his father. Samuel L. Jackson, John Slattery, Garry Shandling and even Stan Lee all make cameo roles. The film is action packed, exciting, and promotes audiences to expect more in the following sequel. If that isn't enough, there is Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow who provide eye-candy with a attitude and a powerful executive allure for Stark. The movie is a worthy addition to the original and if you over-look a few minor flaws, such as none of the military figures, nor the police or the security guards are female, then the movie is well done and audiences look forward to the next. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 WAS great, not the better than Dark Knight, but Great. It was just like its last predecessor "IRON MAN I" But IRON MAN II Was a little bit better. The only thing that certain people criticize is the each individual plot, each individual had their own Story elements, But in My opinion it was Better like that. You need a film with great Character development, not just ACTION ACTION ACTION. The Action needs to Blend in with the story, it's like a song same beat, but Just snaps &amp; wakes you up. ROBERT DOWNERY JR. IS the BEST Tony Stark In Marvel universal, The IRON MAN is so BAD-A**, And the race track OMG it's so SEXY. Don Cheadle: WAR MACHINE/RHODES Was used great in my opinion, I sort of Miss Terrance Howard, cause he carried that swag, but other wise WAR MACHINE Suit looks BAD-A** Etc, don't want spoil. MICKEY: WHIPLASH, I Thought was a smooth Criminal. In the Movie they used him as a smooth guy who wants vengeance on the STARK family, Mickey did a well done expression with him, but he was still a bad a** too. THE BLACK WIDOW chick, All I have to say is WOW. Samuel L. JACKSON: As NICK FURY, I Liked how they used him in a way and Black widow to assemble the AVENGERS ( The superhero teams, THOR, CAPTAIN America, HULK &amp; IRON MAN &amp; MORE) Justin HAMMER Was like an opposite side of TONY STARK, his acting was spot on to. IT Just had a great cast. including Pepperpotts. The thing I Wish was a little longer was the end battle between The 3. (Don't want spoil) Make No mistake, IRON MAN 2 Is Excellent 4 outta 4 stars for me. It's just like it's comics. If you read them more, then you'll understand what the movie is coming from, I CAN'T WAIT FOR IRON MAN III &amp; THE AVENGERS. NICE JOB, IRON MAN 2 IS THE WAY TO GO, FOR FAMILY &amp; GEEKY FRIENDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark discovering his life threatening illness from palladium poisoning, must develop a technology to sustain his artificial heart, the arc reactor power source.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An action packed depiction of the popular Marvel comic book character, Iron Man. In this film the main character, Tony Stark and the infamous Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) attempts to protect his Iron Man technology from the government and villain, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke). Discovering his life threatening illness from palladium poisoning, Tony Stark must develop a technology to sustain his artificial heart, the arc reactor power source. After many failed attempts to discover a new life sustaining element fails, Tony Starks accepts his doom and appoints Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) to assume Stark Industries as CEO. While Tony Stark falls into depression realizing his life will soon come to an end, he begins to behave erratically and irresponsibly. In the meantime, a Russian, Ivan Vanko has developed an arc reactor of his own that he will use in an attempt to take out Iron Man in revenge for his father's death. One of the main action scenes in the film occurs during a car race, when Ivan Vanko appears with is new found technology. Ivan has modified the arc reactor technology to create hand held whips that hold powerful destructive results. Despite Ivan Vanko's attempt to destroy him, Tony Starks used quick thinking and ingenuity to defeat the attempt. Ivan Vanko doesn't take the defeat lightly and joins Stark Industry's rival, Justin Hammer who has been contracted by the government to develop a war fight technology similar to Iron Man. The next action scene takes place at Tony Stark's Birthday Party, which he believes will be his last due to his illness. Intoxicated, Tony arrives in his Iron Man suit and the situation soon gets of control. Tony Stark's long time friend, Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) must bring Tony to his senses, leading to a battle between the two. Reaching a truce, the two soon find themselves in a battle with the newest army of drone technology unveiled at the Stark Expo by Justin Hammer. Ivan Vanko had a plan of his own for the introduction of his creation and configured the drone army for his full control to bring down Stark Industries and anyone who stood in his way. Iron Man, Tony Starks, and Lt. Colonel James Rhodes wearing Iron Man prototype, together, take down Ivan Vanko and the army of drones. Lt. Colonel James Rhodes takes down the last drone, while Iron Man save the girl (Pepper Potts) from self destructing drone. Landing on a city building roof top with his rescued Pepper Potts, Tony and Pepper share a kiss when Lt. Colonel James Rhodes says, "Get your own roof".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I'll admit I'm not a big fan of either the comics or the first film. However, director John Faverau really did make this enjoyable for us "non-geeks" as well as the "geeks". Decent story and interactions with Tony and Pepper were enjoyable. I think the weakest writing was for the Scarlett Johnannsen character, but her acting was good in spite of that. The main attraction for me, even though I'm a fan of Robert Downey Jr., was Mickey Rourke and he did not disappoint. He's the best thing about this film when he's in a scene. Not the anyone else is a slouch, but I'm glad Mickey is back in films. I will add that I can't picture anyone else playing Tony Stark, though. Very impressed with the CGI and other special effects. I don't recall as much humor or banter between the characters in the first, but thought it was appropriate (in IM2)and kept the film's tone lighter. Best summer film so far.

		<shortDescription>A great blockbuster action movie to kick off the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel in the Iron Man series is one that is very welcoming, original for a second movie and a great blast of a movie to kick off the summer right. It was a lot of fun, there WAS a great villain, awesome action scenes with likable characters. The movie was a perfect length at about 2 hours but some scenes I felt could have been left out and even a character as well. As Scarlett Johanson is very attractive her character could have easily been never put in because there is no real importance even though it was refreshing and she brings the sex appeal to the movie goers. I really enjoyed the movie and it is actually a worth while sequel to an eventually long and spread out series in the future. This second film was an exiting experience that had comic relief in certain parts of the movie. It is not full of action but when there is, it is very cool as the special effects are awesome. Overall, i recommend all movie fans to see this movie. It is a great time, not really any swearing and suitable for the kids of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought the sequel to Iron Man was a blast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie a bit more than I was expecting after reading the many so so reviews of this film. However, while I still say the first film was better, this one was not to far behind. The plot has Iron Man/Stark going through a bit of a crisis. Seems the reactor in his chest is killing him. So he is getting a bit reckless and doing more crazy things. Meanwhile, in Russia a man is bent on getting Stark, a man whose father had close ties with Stark's dad. This man is a genius as well and ends up making his own tiny reactor and devising whip like weapons, hence why this super villain is known as Whiplash. They have a rather cool encounter in Monaco on a race course then this villain is seemingly defeated and sent to jail. Also in the mix in this film is another rival industrialist named Hammer who wants to make a weapon suit for the military and a mysterious new assistant for Stark who has some rather nice moves in a fight. It all culminates in a rather grand battle near the end. The acting is rather good as Robert Downey Jr. is once again superb as Stark. Cheadle does a good job of being Rhodes in this film and Mickey Rourke is deadly good as the villain Whiplash. With all that was good in the movie, it still could have used some work here and there. After the Monaco scene there really is not all that much Iron Man action with the exception of a somewhat cool fight between Stark and Rhodes in opposing Iron Men suits. Nearly all the action in the film is at the race track and the end of the film. Once again it seems filmmakers have something against a lot of action scenes in a comic book movie. Also, the fight at the end between Iron Man and War Machine versus Whiplash could have lasted longer too. It was not as bad a fight as I have heard, but it was to short. Add five minutes to that fight and I would have given this movie another point and said that it was as good or even slightly better than the first film. Still, overall it was good and had its humorous moments as one would expect after watching the first film. So with a bit of tweaking, I say this Iron Man could have been super great, as is it is an entertaining summer movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven first half is made up for with a rousing second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have given Iron Man 2 the same 8 rating I gave the original. Mainly because both are flawed films, but in the end, are rousing, fun summer movies that do not cater to the lowest common mind level, yet don't take themselves too seriously.Iron Man 2 starts out, much like Spiderman 3, with Tony Stark seemingly basking in the glow of Iron Man's accomplishments (it is set 6 months after the first film). However we learn quickly that Tony is hiding a pain within; the reactor is slowly killing him. A long with that, we learn Tony and his father were not very close, more angst to throw into the pot. Thus we have Tony Stark slowly going out of control and his friends; Pepper, Happy and Rhodie must pull him in.The first half comes off a bit uneven to me, not sure why, it just never seemed to find a steady groove. It is not the pace, as with the first, there is never any moments of watch checking, it just had an uneven flow of one scene to the next for me, like they were trying to find the groove but not quite getting it. It isn't until an hour into the film that it finally found a rhythm for me. Once it did find that rhythm it brought the film home, with an excellent 3rd act.Performances across the board are excellent. I have to say I missed Howard as Rhodie. Cheadle is by no means a slouch actor, but he doesn't have the same presence in uniform that Howard had. Johanson brings everything you would expert to the siren role she is cast in. Definitely look forward to seeing more of her in further adventures. Rourke is his usual method self, totally absorbed in the role of Whiplash and eating up every scene he is in.One of the things I enjoyed most about the film is the continual interweaving of the whole Marvel universe, especially the hints of other characters involved with the Avengers. We are actually introduced to the Avenger concept in the film, which, for the comic geeks out there, will be a glorious thing to witness. Another is the expanded role of Tony's father, which is done through old news and company reel, but helps to give us more of a full view of the Stark patriarch and more importantly, his feelings toward his song Tony, who has felt he never quite measured up to his father's expectations.My two main complaints with the film are minor ones, but still kept it from being a 9. The first I have already mentioned, the first hour was herky jerky, never seeming to find a steady groove. This was resolved by the last hour and it gave us a much improved upon 3rd act, one of the flaws that the first film had in that the 3rd act was entertaining, but lacked a grand finale feel. My other complaint is the score. I absolutely loved the score for the first film. The mix of guitar and drum interwoven with string and horns made for a score that felt at home with a move titled Iron Man. This go around, no such guitar or drum woven score. The "theme" from the first film isn't even used again, a minor complaint, but one that took me out of the film a little as the first score really worked well and is sorely missed here. Composer Ryeland Allison and original music by Ramin Djawadi gave us an excellent score in the first. This go around they are replaced by John Debney who gives us a lackluster score.Lastly on the music front, don't believe the hype about the Iron Man 2 soundtrack, which purports to be nothing but AC/DC. There are only 2 songs by AC/DC in the entire film. So not sure why the soundtrack CD, which has 15 songs by AC/DC, is being purported as being the soundtrack, which it is not. Again, a slight critique, but something fans should know going in.My complaints are minimal, the film delivers on exactly what it should and it brings forth a start, of what looks to be a very fun and exciting summer full of theater entertainment. Oh yeah, one final thing, DO NOT GET UP AND LEAVE BEFORE THE END CREDITS. Wait them out, you will be pleasantly surprised, especially if you are a Marvel/Avengers fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Convincing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that is so hard to do in films is to make your content convincing. This is why so many other films fail. Favreau does not fail. I was worried going into Iron Man 2 that it wasn't going to live up to its hype and its prequel. But it did. The only criticism I have is that it is a bit slow for its type of movie. However, the content within the slower scenes is often filled with witty dialogue, low-key visual spectacles, and some confusing concepts. What I'm trying to get at is that Iron Man's audience is typically smaller children, and for them, I would say this movie is going to be a bit boring, for it lacks in the action department for the most part. But what may be its downfall box-office-wise is also its greatest accomplishment. Much like the Dark Knight, Iron Man 2 takes the superhero world and not-cheesily but convincingly conveys what it would be like in today's world. Not to mention we actually see Tony Stark go through a hero cycle in this one, without taking away his compulsive and loud personality. All in all, Iron MAn's long awaited release was worth it in my eyes. It was a perfect movie to kick off the Summer hype films and it makes me eager to watch what else Favreau has planned for the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts with a bang from the great moves by Robert Downey Jr. and the witty one liners. Followed by the crazy iron man tricks. Slightly better than the first movie in terms of action. What it really lacks is a true storyline. While some may say it definitely is better than the first I beg to differ. Robert Downey Jr. simply manages to play a drunk crazy old rich fool who thinks he knows it all. The villain is smart and sometimes more appealing that Mr. Stark. Scarlett Johansson is as gorgeous as ever. She didn't look this good even in Lost in Translation. The action is great, the story decent the movie above average. If you love comics you'll love this one. It got me back to reading comic books and I hope it has the same domino effect on you as well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How super is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie with friends and in doing so became probably one of only a very few people to see it without having watched the first "Iron Man" movie. Knowing the basic premise behind the original comic book, though, I found that "Iron Man 2" holds up very well entirely on its own, and as a piece of entertainment is a thorough success with nary a dull moment. Like any good action movie, I think, "Iron Man 2" realizes it can't consist entirely of action, and this one at times feels just as much like a comedy or political thriller as it does a superhero-based special effects spectacular. That comedy is rooted in and succeeds because of really good character work, particularly with the lead Tony Stark. The script by Justin Theroux (who is, I found to my pleasure, related to the other writers Paul, Louis, Marcel, and Alexander Theroux) shows a facility with pointed, revealing dialogue and a whole lot of wit. This script also seems preoccupied with getting characters to declare -- if not in so many words "Oh, yeah? Well just try and make me!" which is deeply satisfying to empathize with even if it does eventually become a little repetitive as a theme. Robert Downey Jr gives another simply brilliant performance, and his character seems fully alive as a self-absorbed, witty, arrogant, and super-intelligent jerk of a superhero who knows his own life is about to end. This character is as much of a reason to watch the movie as anything. There is no attempt to hide the fact that much of the plot and its developments are based on pure technobabble -- a new element is discovered with suspicious ease, computer systems can be commandeered with only a few taps, &amp;c. -- but these are not terribly insulting when left out in the open, and they do not interfere with the political caste that keeps the action story moving. Towards the end things become a little less thoughtful and it becomes harder to invest without a grounding in how the rules work for the new technologies that have been introduced, but it never descends to dullness. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson do well in their roles but those roles, while significant, are never explained or fleshed out much, and they sometimes seem to be there largely to look impressive each in their own way. Gwyneth Paltrow extends the cast of all-stars with a good performance as Pepper Pots, though she seems a little stuck on the note of "beleaguered." It's a nice surprise to see Garry Shandling show up as a fun comic-relief senator. This was great entertainment and well ahead of a standard issue genre action or superhero adaptation picture, served effective and real wit, good dramatic sub-plotting, and an extremely memorable lead performance from Downey that does a huge amount to make some scenes that would otherwise be laughably absurd very believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Upped to the 10th Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of things we knew we were going to see - hinted at in the 1st Film - Rhodey as War Machine, the Suitcase-Suit, the dying Stark who has to drink 80 glasses of Green Machine a day, Pepper Potts as the head of Stark Industries - S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury and The Avengers - Black Widow! We get to see all of it in some form or other in this excellent Sequel. Adding to my belief that Robert Downey Jr was practically born to play Tony Stark, he builds on the first performance and reveals even more about who Iron Man is.Nothing really can be said about this that otherwise cannot be seen by simply watching the film. In Blu-Ray if Possible, on DVD if not... Looks good both ways.My only beef is that Terence Howard did not reprise the role of Rhodey/War Machine - But the addition of Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke as Vanko, and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury - Ease my initial disappointment at seeing Don Cheadle take up the mantle of War Machine - But the fact that Cheadle plays it JUST like Howard did - Even the Mannerisms, so it really IS the same Character, Cheadle does the best he can, not being Physically matched to Howard but personality-wise captured it. Also, the repeat performance of Leslie Bibb as the Vanity Fair Reporter Christine Everhart was well used- Even hinting that she was a fair Reporter, so maybe if there are any more of these, we'll get to see her come back, probably one of my favourite characters from this franchise. Finally, director Jon Favreau gets to be Happy Hogan a Lot MORE in this film much to my relief (Why recreate a great Iron Man character and only show them twice? Much better to have them in the film as much as the story can benefit by it?) The choice of Justin Theroux/Screenwriter made this a much darker story than the initial Iron Man story - As Tony builds Iron Man in the first film, this film mirrors that by having Vanko building his Arc-Reactor weApon. I thought they were bringing In Omega Red (X-Men Villain) into the story with the addition of Vanko, but apparently this is a combination of a couple of Iron Man Villains.This film is just another link in the upcoming promise of an Avengers film, and Marvel is gathering all of its forces for this effort. One thing we do know is that Iron Man WILL be a major part of The Avengers - And I ain't talking about Emma Peel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 is Totally Worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 left me a very pleasant taste. Maybe it doesn't have the same amount of action than the first one but it is compensated with better CGI, a better developed plot and a more interesting story. Billionaire Tony Stark must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies due to his superhero alter ego Iron Man. As I say before, this sequel isn't full of action like the first one but in my opinion it has enough to leave you satisfied and entertained. It also has good moments of humor specially from Robert Downey Jr. The cast is excellent, and practically the same of the first one with the addition of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Black Widow and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vankov/Whiplash and the substitution of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle as Rhodey, in fact I think that with Cheadle the movie gains in acting . Downey is again perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man, it is a role made for him. Gwyneth Paltrow is good enough as Pepper Potts and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Nick Fury. In conclusion, Iron Man isn't as exciting as the first one but it has everything to be a total summer blockbuster and pleased the viewer. Oh and one more thing be sure to stay at the end of the final credits to watch a very good surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Combine lighthearted humor and wit against a somewhat darker backdrop, add in great visual effects and actions scenes, the end result is a big summer film in Iron Man 2.The dialogue and the way the whole cast interacted throughout was superb, beginning with the ever charismatic Robert Downey Jr who played the flawed but capable superhero in the lead role. A super villain is very important in these types of films, this was obviously not lost as evident and cleverly done by the exceptional Mickey Rourke. The always wonderful Gwyneth Paltrow, the amazing Scarlett Johansson, and the talented Don Cheadle round out the fine supporting cast.One outstanding feature of Iron Man 2 was the awesome action sequences, I found the Monaco car race scene to be quite impressive. On another note, there was some subtexting going on at certain moments with this film, which will explain some minor roles, particularly that of Samuel L. Jackson. I understand there are supposedly tie-ins to the upcoming Avengers movie, it should be quite interesting to see how that pans out.In any case, it was hard not to be blown away by this blockbuster. Directing a huge summer action movie of this caliber is no small feat, but it manages to get done with aplomb, kudos to Jon Favreau and team on this awesome film, sequel or not.</fullReview>

Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do ? here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second.

		<shortDescription>Finally an Iron Man film - not a film about a guy in an Iron Man suit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Iron Man film seemed more like an action film with a guy in an Iron Man suit than anything else. This film actually felt more like an Iron Man movie and it was a more enjoyable experience. All the usual, excellent cast members, made their appearances. Robert Downey JR. and Gwyneth Paltrow are the returning champs while Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke and Garry Shandling come along for this one. Finally, Scarlett Johansson finds an action role fit for her and it should carry her into Marvel History as the Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in future film endeavors ? I hope. After seeing her in "The Spirit" (2008), I was a little worried. Samuel L. Jackson continues his outstanding portrayal of Nick Fury. However, there is a casualty. They still haven't found the right guy for Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. In the last film it was Terrence Howard, who looked the part, but I thought wasn't able to sell it well enough. In fact I laughed at him way too much. This time it hurts, because I like Don Cheadle, but not here. The search continues. The SPFX totally do the job right. There is an excellent introduction in the beginning of the film of our hero to the blaring tunes of AC/DC, that is totally believable and quite exciting. Many of the fight scenes truly give us the feeling that we are seeing a comic-book come to life. What is good about this film is, if you do not know much about Iron Man that does not matter. Anybody will enjoy this one and can follow along with the story. Mickey Rourke adds a nicely acted dimension as the bad guy that Tony Stark's Iron Man has to face. I rather enjoyed this film after having a bad taste in my mouth after watching the first one.</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr is an on screen delight...his method of acting is so much fun to watch. He has a charisma that many actors of today seriously lack. He took on the role of Tony Stark as if he was truly that man. He had perfect chemistry with everyone, and I was sorry to see the movie end.

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 starts off where the first one left off and hits the ground running from there. Tony Stark is a national icon Iron Man is seen by a grateful American public as a protector. The government sees the armour as a weapon of mass power that should not be in the hands of just one man. Then there is Justin Hammer a Business rival of Tony Stark's who is obsessed with creating his own Iron Man armour and mass producing it. the Trouble is this the tech used for Iron Man is so superior to anything out there that Stark figures it will take at least twenty years to create an armour like his. Tony is living large and hiding a tragic secret but on top of all of that comes Ivan Vanko or Whiplash armed with tech. Dangerously close to Starks Vanko wants revenge . plus there is betrayal spy work and of course the Black widow wonderfully played by Scarlett Johansson and the ever gruff super spy tough guy legend Nick Fury played by the one and only Sam.L.Jackson. The movie moves at a rocket pace and delivers the acting is solid the story is strong and the story ties up all the loose ends plus gives us more Iron Man and the introduction of War Machine Tony's best friend and fellow crime fighter. Mickey Rouke carries his part with cold sinister menace he and RDJ are the movie and you won't take your eyes off of them. Worth seeing ? YES!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few sequels that certainly meets up with if not surpasses the original...Iron Man was the origin story. Now that that is out of the way the story focuses more on Tony facing the consequences of being Iron Man which is great. Robert Downey Jr. is great at delivering those sarcastic lines while remaining completely stone faced. Mickey Rourke as Ivon Vanko/Whiplash is one of the high points of the movie. His Russian accent at times is hard to understand but let's face it he himself is at times hard to understand...There is a great scene in which he ends up being held by two guards. Later he talks on the phone and all we see is blood on his hands and the two guards hanging from the ceiling....Even his death scene was great The visual effects are some of the best. During the flying sequences you feel like you are flying as well...The CGI characters have weight which is so often the downfall of CGI..This sequel comes in a close second to The Dark KnightI highly recommend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chasing Fires of Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time is the definition of heroism, but even Time can't defeat all odds. The trials that we must face, we take on alone, but never do we see our enemies until they stand before us, bent on our destruction. And we find ourselves pressed between the darkest moments that trickle through our hands like hourglass sand and those that would take all that we have become, but what if there is no fight left? What legacy would remain, and if we look to the past, would we find the answers that we so desperately seek? Would Time heal all wounds, fueling our heart to overcome the encroaching darkness, or was all hope lost to the thirst of revenge? The trials that we face pave the road of destiny, and the darkest hours left are engulfed by the chasing fires of legend. And once again are we swept away in a fury of heart and soul flashing across the red and gold of a hero that rises again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man isn't rusty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know summer has begun when studios release the first summer blockbuster of the year. Iron Man 2 is off to a great start with starting summer. The film is deeper in the story, the characters are as funny and charming as ever with the edition of some new characters, and action to keep you happy and satisfied through-out the entire film.In this film we see how Tony Stark is now a big celebrity and has helped bring what seems to be world peace. However, he has enemies on the move and are going to try and show the world that even Iron Man can bleed. So now with time running out and new mysteries about his own past to solve, Tony has a lot to do for this exciting follow-up to the 2008 blockbuster.The film has everything the average summer movie-goer wants to see in a film, great action, beautiful special effects, well-written script, and characters that you just have to love. Iron Man 2 in my opinion is better than the first and is probably one of the best superhero films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, just 2 things bothered me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say i liked this one better than the first Iron Man, just because I felt this one was even more character driven and more cool characters than the first one. Also the build-up to The Avengers is really cool in this part with Samuel L. Jackson have a much bigger role than just a cameo. I especially liked the after-credits scene for Thor where they show people digging up Mjolnir in the middle of a desert.The Characters are much better presented in this one, both the old ones and the new ones. Especially Tony gets a much more emotional background concerning his history with his father and so forth. I absolutely loved Mickey Rourke as Whiplash/Ivan Vank, but the 1st flaw of the movie also concerns him. He is totally UNDERUSED, he's there for the beginning and the end, and in the middle part of the movie: he's barely in it. Gwyneth Paltrow was as charming and beautiful as she was in the first. Also Don Cheadle was a very good recast for Terrence Howard, maybe even better than him. Samuel L. Jackson looked cool and bad-ass at the same time as Nick Fury. The sexy Scarlett Johansson was also good as Natasha Romanoff. She was dangerous and very beautiful at the same time. She's got some pretty cool fighting moves up her sleeve. Sam Rockwell did a very good job portraying Justin Hammer. He was funny, nerdy and yet very evil.The Story is also very good with some pretty complex parts in it, like the part where Tony needs to re-invent the unknown element. That went a bit over my head. But every part of the story just felt right.The CGI is even better than in the first one, especially in the final aerial/ground battle between the Hammeroids and Tony.The Soundtrack was nothing special, just your typical summer-movie music. Nothing special, so nothing to complain. :PSo, the only 2 negative things for me where: 1. The under use of Mickey Rourke. I mean they said he was going to be the main villain in this one. And if he was he had way too little screen time. 2. The action scenes are too short. I would have liked in particular that the fight on the racetrack was longer. Don't get me wrong it was very good, just too short.Iron Man 2, a worthy sequel that surpasses its predecessor -----&gt; 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passed the sequel challenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first how did this sequel one up itself from it's predecessor? Continuity: The film takes place 6 months after Stark reveals his identity in the first film and the entire plot is driven because of that.Characters: Downey Jr. is back and his freestyle acting yet again is what brightens his screen time. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes, which really didn't bother me that much because personally I think both Cheadle and Howard are brilliant actors. War Machine will not disappoint. Mickey Rourke plays Ivan Vanko who is a hybrid of the Crimson Dynamo and Backlash and this character should have been given more screen time. Paltrow comes back as Pepper and her ability to keep up with Downey has improved. If there is no Mandarin for this film at least they got Justin Hammer another well known foe who I think should have been the villain of the first film. Scarlett Johansson plays the Black Widow, pretty much that is a character for the male audience. And Sam Jackson plays Nick Fury.Action: It had a lot more bad-assery (hope that's a word) than the first film, a lot more. However it wasn't presented like that in the trailer, which therefore I was sort of hesitant to expect greatness. If the trailer was presented like the A-Team thats coming out this year or the first Spider-Man film eight years ago then I would have bought my ticket way in advance. But don't be mislead, there is a lot of action sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why would you listen to someone who posted a review 2-3 months before the movie was released?. They were all wrong in my opinion. A previous reviewer noted a couple of instances where the critics were way off, and there were a lot more including the hanger scene with glasses moving around and having different levels in them. Guess he never saw the waiter filling the glasses, let alone the movie. Just my 2 cents. The movie was outstanding and action packed plus a good story line. Maybe better than the first. It's been awhile since I've seen it. So Judge for yourself, and don't listen to critics, they will only steer you wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The First Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm sure some opinions will differ from mine, but I thought Iron Man 2 was even better than the first one, and I consider that to be, if not the best, one of the best movies ever made in the super-hero genre.Good acting (OK, nobody expects any Academy Awards here), decent plot/story line, and GREAT action sequences and special effects.When I first learned that Robert Downey Jr. had been cast for the role of Tony Stark in the original movie I thought...what? He, of course, proved me very wrong in both that movie and this one. And, while the abrupt shift from Terrence Howard to Don Cheadle for the Rhodey character was a little disconcerting, I got over it pretty quickly.Bring on the Thor, Avengers, and Captain America movies...do those folks at Marvel know how to turn a buck or what!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously! How the heck did this movie get 7.1 of 10? To be honest this sequel sucked!!! Believe me! If you're an action movie lover and have seen the first Iron man movie you're not gonna love this one! This may contain spoiler! But you wanna know the reason why I Hated this then read it! OK first of all: Weeks before I saw this at cinema I have seen the trailers and I was very very exited to see this! I was hoping that there was gonna be double more action than the first movie! And when I saw the whole thing...ALMOST NO ACTION!!!!!! There were just a lot of talking and talking like 1 and a half hour and 30 minutes of action!! No dude seriously this dosen't even feel like action it feels more like: Stupid comedy, drama, thriller and almost no action. If you loved Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen that had a lot action you will not love this one!! Don't waste your time watching this movie! Believe me! I'm very disappointed at Jon Favreau because of this and I will never admire him! He tricked us all to watch his epic fail action movie!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one fun feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has let the world know he is Iron Man. While this hasn't affected him, Tony has "other" matters getting his attention. The substance in the device that keeps him alive is slowly killing him, so he needs to find a new substance. Then the government/military wants to get their hands on the Iron Man technology, which Tony won't give up. Next Tony has to decide who will be the new CEO of Stark Industries if he dies.If this isn't enough to deal with, Russian criminal/inventor Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is out for revenge on Tony because of something Tony's father Howard did to the Vanko family years ago, so Vanko becomes Whiplash and then teams up with fast talking, slick weapons designer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who is also after any way to ruin Tony. So can life get any better than this!!!!So while we see Tony's life becoming a self-destructive mess, several people come into play to help him get back together if he wants help or not. They include Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Lt. Col James "Rhodey" Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) who is in Stark's legal department, but has her own secret, and Col. Nick Fury (Sameuel L. Jackson) head of S.H.I.E.L.D.Overall I found "Iron Man 2" a very enjoyable escape from worrying about things. After most of the credits of rolled on the screen, we have "one more scene" before the Paramout logo appears. We are in New Mexico and the camera goes to a dig site where we see Thor's hammer. Stay tune for more fun folks!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is based upon the comic book series created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film is also a sequel to the 2008 film Iron Man. Basically, I figure that if you are reading this review and you are interested in seeing Iron Man 2, then you are probably a fan of the original film two years ago, the comic book series, or perhaps both. For that reason I am not going into a lengthy synopsis of the plot because the fans know what they are in for and they are the ones who are going to go and see this movie. The 2008 Iron Man film, I found to just be okay. I think the thing I really liked about it was Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He was narcissistic and arrogant and the performance was pulled off perfectly. However there was little else for me to be impressed upon in the first film because I found most of the other performances to be lacking character and emotion, the story really did not do anything for me and the action and special effects sequences went on too long and became a big part of the story, whereas I prefer more background on the characters, the hero and the villains. It was an okay film, but not great. I wasn't sure how I would like Iron Man 2 after my disappointment with the first outing of what is sure to become a series, but I actually liked Iron Man 2 better than the first film, a lot better. First of all, I found the acting a lot better in this one from everybody and the newcomers were really good also. Secondly the film gave us more of a back story to the characters and villain and I found it got more personal this second time around. Instead of just non stop action and explosions there were more scenes letting us know these characters better and I found that to be far superior and more interesting than non stop excitement from the special effects department. I also found this version to have more humour in it and there are certainly some smiles and chuckles coming your way and it made the film a lot more fun and entertaining for me than the first one. I think fans of the first one will likely be a bit disappointed with this version and the reviews tend to reflect this because it is not as action packed as the first film and I have also read complaints that people had of the writer and director trying to put too much into one two hour film. There is quite a bit going on this time around, but I did not find that the film suffered because of it. Instead, I found it gave us more to look at and think about and was a pleasant alternative to the non stop action scenes I mentioned above. The writing I also liked a lot better because it gave us more time with the characters, had a more interesting story and because some of the one liners and humour that I mentioned were in the film earlier. These last few years it seems that most superhero films have been compared to 2008's The Dark Knight because of what a great film it was and I would have to agree. I don't think you will get too many that will get the genre right and give us as interesting a look at it as in The Dark Knight, but we may yet still be surprised. Iron Man 2 while I am giving it the same rating as The Dark Knight, is not as good as The Dark Knight, but as a film in this genre, I do think it is one of the better ones. The Dark Knight was more gruesome, dark and disturbing while Iron Man 2 is definitely lighter and more kid friendly than The Dark Knight and is not as much into the development or psyches of the characters. Iron Man 2 knows this and more, or less just wants you to have a good time watching it and leave feeling entertained. For those goals Iron Man 2 succeeded and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarlet Johansson is fantastic in this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best science fiction movies Hollywood has made in many years. The middle of the movie drags a little, but it finishes strong. Robert Downey is great but the real star is Scarlet Johansson. She is beautiful; she is fantastic; she is wonderful. Her fight scenes are incredible; her overall performance is magnificent. Also she definitely has a flair for comedy. In short, Ms. Johansson is a great performer and proves it in this movie. Ten stars for Scarlet Johansson. Mickey Rourke is also excellent as the bad guy. The cgi's add to the story. This movie is actually better than the original. The Tony Stark character is further developed and the audience learns Pepper Potts' first name. This movie is a welcome addition to the science fiction genre. The movie tells a story; has interesting characters; and except for the middle part, the story moves along quickly and ends with the audience having been entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Superhero Film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was awesome and just as good as the original. It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>unbelievable sequel that, in the eyes of this viewer, far exceeds the original. Though I don't dare compare the film to "The Dark Knight", in comparison, "Batman Begins" focused too much on telling us who Batman IS and less on an action adventure we can sit back and enjoy, much like the 2008 Iron Man. With the DK and Iron Man 2, we have passed all the introductions and we can really enjoy many more characters and action sequences (not to mention all the special effects!). Mickey Rourke was phenomenal and the only regret there was that his character did not appear in the movie MORE! Midnight showing was totally worth it, especially with all the little HINTS you can pick up if you know enough about other superhero characters that may be involved with upcoming story lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear. The inclusion of all the elements is here - RDJ is great, Scarlet Johannsen is lovely, fast cars, it's there, just that there's nothing to tie it all together.The right things in awful proportions makes this a very disappointing film. The cast is great, don't get me wrong, but they need to just *do* more.I wanted to watch an Iron Man film. I don't want to hear about Stark's daddy issues, or go into great detail about his health problems. I wanted an Iron Man film - a cool suit of powered armour against powerful enemies with loads of action, adventure and fun. It's telling the suit doesn't make a decent appearance until right near the very end for the short, confused and anticlimactic fight we were sitting through we were waiting for. We spend most of the film moping about Stark's personal issues and the action is almost entirely forgotten about until someone clearly realized it was *supposed* to be an action film and tacked something on the end.Any time an action film turns to "resolving daddy issues" as a plot device (I'm looking at you, "The Mummy 3: Curse of the Dragon Emperor"), it's fallen far far from the place it was meant to be.By the time the big finale did come about it was way too short, but by that time I was bored as hell and didn't really care any more. Boring. Just boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. returns in the sequel to the film that boosted his career back up. Iron man 2. Iron man 2 has everything you want: The spectacular action, the witty dialogue of Downey, the good performances, and the babes(Scarlett Johanson we're talking to you).I knew what was expected. I was anticipating a lot. And yes it's hard making a sequel to a movie that everybody loved. So if it doesn't quite add up to the original, you have to cut them some slack. And some people have been disappointed. Me, I wasn't. I'm a little mixed as to if it was better than the original. But for a sequel, this is the best. Well, not compared to The Dark knight or Spider-man 2, but this is a worthy sequel with still a lot of greatness.Now that everybody knows that Tony Stark is Iron man,the government wants his suit. So do people like his competitor Justin Hammer(played by a funny Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko(played by Mickey Rourke), a Russian scientist trying to get revenge on Tony because he believes that Tony's dad stole his dad's idea. Meanwhile, Tony promotes Pepper(played again by Gweneth Paltrow) to C.E.O. of Stark industries. He is a love triangle(sort of)between his new assistant(played by Scarlett Johanson) and Pepper. and lots of other things happen also.I know that I spoil a lot when I talk about a movie. But there is a lot to the plot here.Iron man 2 is hilarious and rather awesome at times. If it's as good as the first one is a little up in the air for me. Can't quite decide.But just know that this is the best film of Summer 2010 so far.Iron man 2: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Legacy, Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the noisy gaudy opening of "Iron Man 2" billionaire bad boy Tony Stark arrives at his Stark Expo in the Iron Man suit. Once removed from his body armor, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony admits, "It's all about legacy." Amidst the fun, high energy and stupid plot line, legacy does resonate as a poignant theme. I agree with A.O. Scott, that casting overcomes a lot in "Iron Man 2"?I think I liked the movie more than he did. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. And Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko provides what every hero story requires: a formidable villain. Director Jon Favreau is smart in never taking the movie too seriously, letting his actors morph and evolve. Favreau provides some spectacular action and visuals. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark is stunning and heroic high drama.Downey is amazing in carrying off such a wide-band character in Tony. His Tony even cops to being a text book narcissist. Downey is one of the gifted actors, whom we can discern what is going on in his mind?through his eyes. He brings a crisp intelligence, brashness, and sobering humanity here. We learn that the palladium core that keeps Tony alive is rapidly poisoning his blood and killing him. At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (cool Samuel L. Jackson) wants Tony to uncover his father Howard's legacy, and solve the mysteries of his heart?on also a more profound level. Tony confesses his estranged relationship with his Father?"He never told me that he loved me." But in his research Tony watches a message from his Dad. He says proudly, "You are going to change the world? what has always been and always will be my greatest creation is you, Tony?" From then on I was into the movie."Iron Man 2" may not be a good as the first, although it has a huge upside. Scarlett Johansson is hot as S.H.I.E.L.D. "triple agent" Natasha Romanoff. She looks stunning in tight leather and performing Jeff Imada designed fight choreography. Beautiful and sprite Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Tony's worried assistant Pepper Potts?who Tony appoints as new CEO of Stark Industries. Tony and Pepper are so in love with each other. Will they ever figure this out by the end of the movie? You have powerful actors Downey and Rourke squaring off. Rourke is menacing and dangerous?he plays it dead on. In a subdued interrogation scene Vanko tells Tony, "If you make God bleed, people will cease to believe in him." Vanko is out to avenge his own father?defending his own legacy. Sam Rockwell nails the pompous and annoying Justin Hammer, Tony's industrial competitor. Gary Shandling is dead pan genius as the Senator, who demands Tony turnover Iron Man. To which Tony reminds, "I have successfully privatized world peace." "Iron Man 2" is visually stunning with the spectacular battle with the Vanko built drones at the story arc. It is also a lot of fun as self destructive Tony in Iron Man suit dances to the late Adam Goldstein's mixes. "Iron Man 2" is an action packed, fun, and funny mixed bag. It's not all that coherent. It's engrossing mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke, and its surprising story of legacy in spite of itself. And that works as well.</fullReview>

Yet it still manages not to alienate the people who might not no who they are etc. 2) It is the perfect popcorn movie, the special effects are awesome and the Tony starks comic timing is superb.OK there may not be the action most of you would have expected but come on make up your minds, you slag transformers 2 off for having too much action, yet when there is a perfect balance of action and drama your still not happy! So in my opinion this stands of one of the best comic book movies ever, up there with Xmen 2, Spiderman, The crow and sin city. Peace out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Way To Kickoff The Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark, is back in this high-octane, high action summer blockbuster. The film picks up right where the first one left off, where Stark reveals that he is Iron Man. We are introduced to a new villain named Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke. We soon find out that he and Mr. Stark have much in common with their past. Meanwhile Jimmy Rhodes, played wonderfully by Don Cheadle, must deal with the government and Stark's crazy antics. This is just a reader's digest version of the story, I want to talk about the film itself. This film is the first of this summer's blockbusters. This film is bigger, louder and more action packed than it's predecessor, which not necessarily a bad thing. With the addition of Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson really brings a "freshness" to the story. Director Jon Favreau has done another fantastic job, proving that he is a first rate action director. The characters are great, Paltrow gives a great supporting performance, Downey is funny and series as ever, and Rourke is a force to be reckoned with. The visual affects are very good along with solid sound editing, however, I do feel that Johansson and Sam L. Jackson, where a but underutilized. I really enjoyed this film, but I was hoping to see more from these characters. That's what sequels are for. I do like this film, but it did lack in some parts where the first one succeeded. I do love the special affects, but they could have been better. Unfortunately with the passing of special affects wizard, Stan Winston, who worked on the first film, it did loose a little luster but not much. Overall I was a satisfied as a moviegoer and a future film maker, I would definitely go see this film again. It is worth your money, but unfortunately, it will probably be overshadowed by the mind-numbing, horribly acted, D rated special affects, crapfest known as "Twilight". But hey, that is my opinion, and I'm sure people have other opinions, and that's OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doubled its predecessor. Bigger and better, this sequel is getting close to somewhere. Mickey Rourke was perfect in his terrifying villain, Don Cheadle earned War Machine's suit, Scarlett Johansson looks so hot in her acrobatic scenes, and Jon Favreau (the director) enjoyed his part in the movie, he gave his character (Happy Hogan) a bigger role than his previous cameo in Iron Man. I watched the first installment and the sequel both in the theater, and I must admit that I enjoyed this one much more than the first. It fills every gap in the first movie, a more startling opponent matched by upgraded weapons, the action takes us to a new level. This one is thicker than the first. I'm getting excited for Avengers, scheduled to be release on 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pulp Fiction of Comic Book Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Film from start to finish is genre perfection, the script the acting the cinematography the little bits of detail that makes a great film, the effects are out of this world, so good you don't even think about them. Overall this tops Spiderman 2 and by some distance i might add as the greatest comic book film to date. To start script is sharp witty, off the cuff, it quite often even verges into the Tarantino realm of dialog, so good are Downey JNR, Rockwell and Paltrow, that even the most menial of scenes become enjoyable, Rourke who was a worry for me was great not over the top and camp right on the money and also brought a great physical presence to his role. Johansson while looking the part, is the only weak point of the film for me, but even this is a minor note. But Rockwell, and Downey are close to perfection. With Rockwell having one of the better monologues in recent memory. Plot, pacing and coherence are perfect the movie just flew by didn't want it to end. There are no wasted scenes each is a treat onto itself no over indulgence or hammy dialog.Cinematography, mise'en scene, action, effects are all top notch. Sat in awe of how Iron man looks about four thousand times more realistic than spider-man, action has a really visceral impact without ever being choppy or shaky cam. Again cinematography is the major stand out and to quote R Lee Emmy film looked any better "it would be a modern art masterpiece" Directing is great i am now a devoted follower of Faverau he has taken all the annoying clichés and boring formulas that we keep seeing in these movies, and given us an action movie with brains brawn and the patience and execution to back it all up. There are no cop outs or annoying walls of writing where you can tell script is out of ideas and they just plonk something on the page, this is thought to the T, there is so much detail here its hard to take it all in, this one of those films you can go back and watch fifty times. From Bill O'Reilly to Amanpour from CNN, to Larry Ellison. There is something in every frame.So summing up don't listen to the pandering,sycophantic reviewers all agreeing with each other this movie is a real treat, weather your ten twenty or even fifty years old there's enough here for everyone it doesn't treat you like a 2 year nor does it go all star trek with the tech speak. This is the Comic book film we have all been waiting for go so fourth and enjoy. And Remember to stay till the end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Iron Man" is not my favorite superhero(that place goes to Batman)nor does he rank ahead of Wonder Women still Tony Stark is an interesting cocky sucker of enough character to watch. As "Iron Man 2" for a sequel really delivered. As director Jon Favreau once again kept the action rolling with special effects and kick ass action sequences. Once again Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark former weapons mogul turned special agent Iron Man. This time his challenge is a Russian villain named Ivan(Mickey Rourke fresh off his classic performance in "The Wrestler") who wants to destroy the world with his new chemical and high tech weapons. And Sam Rockwell struts as a money hungry arms dealer.Returning is Gwyneth Paltrow as Tony's girlfriend now company CEO. And to spice up the picture a real treat of eye candy is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha who's sexy as hell! She becomes a new superhero! Really this film is a showcase for cutting edge technology that shows human inventions. And it was nice to see a cameo by Bill O' Reilly too. Overall this picture is a good treat of action and explosive technology. Probably a watch for any comic book fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makers of this film held nothing back. When it works, as it does here, it rekindles even a cynic's movie love. So kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Scar-Jo, Rockwell, Rourke and especially Favreau. What a film! It is a sight to behold. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic "down time" delivered by the best cast possible. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about? It's good to see the response to the movie has been, for the most part, positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. (X-Men and Wolverine fans I'm looking right at you!) Iron Man 2 stayed close enough to its roots and I hope most judge it as a film first. If you do, I'm almost certain that everyone will enjoy it as much as I did. It easily fulfilled and then exceeded all of my expectations. The only thing I worry about is that they may be setting expectations for that Avengers movie too high. How can it possibly live up to the standard these movies are setting and setting up????? Iron Man 2 is EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more! It is a special treat when a sequel reaches up and delivers an excellent film that you thoroughly enjoy as much if not more than a beloved first installment. It truly feels like they just paused and kept telling the same story but with more of an edge. Hopefully, they can do it again and skip that third movie curse. Think of it as another installment and they'll be fine. Fitting Avengers in to the mix is even more fun to think about but I heard that Favreau will be involved with that as an executive producer. So, I'm not worried. In the meanwhile, we can all enjoy this film because it stands on its own but as a great part of a running saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's worth watching to see what happens to Stark and everyone else that was in the first film. One can watch this movie at any time of the day. It would be best to watch the first film to know what happened. There are some things that just wont make sense if you haven't seen the first film yet. Children can watch this movie pretty much at any age. But please parents make sure that your children can watch this type of action pack movie. This movie is at least 8 out of 10 stars. There is a lot of action within the movie. To me this movie is on that list of movies that can be watched multiple times within the year or even years. I'm going to be watching this movie plus all the other Marvel movies in a marathon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the original 'Iron Man' movie was Marvel's 'surprise hit.' They were probably going to do a sequel anyway, but I'll bet they never thought they'd be pushing so heavily towards this side of the franchise. Anyway, it's fair to say that a sequel needs to give 'the same and more' and, to be fair, 'Iron Man 2' achieves this.It's bigger, louder, more special effects and more heroes/villains added into the mix. Personally, as a casual comic book-movie fan, I quite enjoyed it. I always thought most people did, until I read the online message boards, where it turned out that opinions were pretty divided on its merits.So, just to let you know that there's a sizable proportion of people out there who will disagree with me when I say that it's a pretty fun romp. No, it's not Shakespeare and it doesn't really try to be. I guess it's supposed to appeal to young fans (dare I say male fans?) who will buy the obligatory Iron Man T-shirts, Iron Man lunchboxes and Iron Man pyjamas. No, I didn't buy any of those, but I still enjoyed the film.Unlike other superheroes (think Batman, Superman and Spiderman), the 'secret' identify of our Iron Man isn't that secret, for at the end of the original film billionaire playboy Tony Stark decided to reveal to the world that he was the man in the iron mask ? so to speak. Therefore, in Iron Man 2, he's an even bigger celebrity than he was simply for being the owner of a multinational arms manufacturing firm. It's actually quite nice to see an 'alter-ego' who's actually more 'ego' than anything else. Yes, he's a bit of an idiot. You probably wouldn't see Bruce Wayne getting drunk wearing the Batsuit at a party and using his Baterang to slice watermelons thrown from an adoring crowd. You see that here.Perhaps that's Iron Man's appeal ? he's a bit of a plank and we can relate to his love of adoration? He is definitely a flawed ? if very lucky ? individual and he makes a change from the usual brooding hermit that most superheroes are portrayed as.Naturally, it's Robert Downey Jr's charm that carries the film through, but it's fair to give his supporting cast a mention. Naturally, seeing as the film's not called 'Iron Man and Friends' they have a lot less to do and a lot less material to work with. But they do okay to play off the star. If it's not a bit odd to say that Sam Rockwell's villain came across as a bit too 'comic-booky' for my liking (yes, I know it's a movie based on a comic book) ? it just felt like he was trying a bit too hard.I know 'Iron Man 2' has its critics and I guess it's not perfect, but it is fun. It's nearly two hours and I always think one of the true tests of a movie is whether if feels like its runtime. And, in my opinion, Iron Man 2 flies by like a man in a yellow and red metal suit.Bust out the popcorn and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first Iron Man film, we saw an arms manufacturer develop a conscience and become a hero trying to clean up the mess his company left behind. A follow-up was inevitable, and Iron Man 2 would continue to track Tony Stark's moral journey through even more highs and lows.Among the high points of the film, Iron Man confronts a new villain that pops up out of the blue, who trashes some race cars and sends them flying down the track. The film's climax pits Iron Man against a whole contingent of drones, before Iron Man and War Machine team up in an explosive all-out fighting sequence. All this action is really cool, but the film still dishes out plenty of amusing banter and interesting thematic material to keep everything even.Unfortunately, the film suffers a few low points. In spite of the dramatic issues the film tackles, the pacing is not always perfect; scenes in-between the action can be a hit-or-a-miss. This is because the film juggles a lot of different things in its plot. It is notable how the film continues to track Tony Stark's growth, for even though he embraced a new identity as a hero, he still has his ego to contend with, and it gets him into all kinds of trouble in this film. These scenes do dig up significant levels of conflict, and ultimately, it presents a compelling account of how Tony's obsession with technology and fame gradually erodes his soul and isolates him from the people around him. However, the film also tosses in other random elements - including a Russian bad guy who has no real relevance to the story's main conflicts, and some random scenes with Black Widow and Nick Fury that only serve to whet audiences' appetites for 2012's Avengers. In spite of these haphazard plot points, the film doesn't necessarily congeal well, making for a rather uneven story.Fortunately, the film looks good, with decent photography and editing. Robert Downey Jr. continues to excel as the main character, while Gweneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson are all fun to watch. Mickey Rourke has some cheesy parts (especially with his "I vant my boid" line), but I think he's good most of the time. Writing is okay, but probably could have used more refinement. This production features good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. John Debney's music score is pretty awesome.Iron Man 2 is decently-entertaining and its story has a few significant points to make, but it is rather mixed, and it has led many viewers to regard it as an inferior sequel. Regardless of its issues, I find the film perfectly enjoyable.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Mixed | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Score for Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man 2" is the third chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the third Marvel Comics movie produced in-house at Marvel Studios. This second episode of "Iron Man" sees Robert Downey, Jr. turn out a strong performance as Tony Stark, and the cast of the film does a similarly grand job as that of the original.One notable change in the movie is that Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes is now played by Don Cheadle, as opposed to Terrence Howard who filled the role in the first "Iron Man" film. Both Howard and Cheadle turn out strong performances in this role, and it's hard to say which does a better job, but it is a bit of a glaring change, with Cheadle looking so dissimilar from Howard.The rest of the cast all do quite well in this movie, including Gwyneth Paltrow, reprising her role as Pepper Potts, and Mickey Rourke who plays the film's villain, Ivan Vanko (a character who features characteristics of both the Crimson Dynamo and Whiplash, villains from the Iron Man comic books).All in all this film is a strong chapter in the MCU's ongoing Iron Man storyline. The film develops the Tony Stark character, matching it with the classic comic book Tony Stark by introducing us to not just the billionaire playboy, but also to the Stark that struggles with alcoholism and whose own contraption that saved his life is now endangering him with radiation poisoning. Both of those plot features are drawn straight from the 1980's mythology of Iron Man. Likewise, the film goes a step further by introducing us to a larger piece of the MCU puzzle by giving us more information on SHIELD and Howard Stark. Black Widow (aka Natasha Romanov, played by Scarlett Johansson) is also introduced in this movie, and is featured prominently.While it's probably fair to say that this movie falls just short of being as good as its predecessor, again, it's certainly a great, fun movie from Marvel. I rate it at 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like the 2nd Iron Man. It doesn't have the captivation of the first entry, or the polarization of the third, or even the camaraderie of The Avengers, but it's easily the funniest of the bunch. It's more lighthearted than any of the other ones. Really, it's just Tony having fun while dealing with some minor personal demons.Robert Downey Jr. is as charismatic as always. We get to see more of the playboy in him and his character this time around. With the fortunate casting of Jon Cheadle (but unfortunate loss of Terrence Howard, thanks a lot Paramount!), Tony's kept in check and assisted by his supporting cast in a perfect choice. Jon Cheadle has come a long way from the accent façade of Ocean's Eleven. His resume just keeps growing and it's no surprise why. Gwenyth Paltrow, Clark Gregg and Jon Favreau are of course the returning cast and nail every line in every scene perfectly, deflecting Tony Stark's tendencies to hedonism in his self-inflicted tumultuous tantrums. Newcomers to the series, Scarlett Johanson and Mickey Rourke, are pure BAMF material; Mickey's character Whiplash (an otherwise little known anomaly in the comic book series) is especially well developed and superbly brought out in yet another shining example of Rourke's acting ability through nuance. I don't know if Rourke actually knows Russian, but you wouldn't be any wiser. But who really stands out in this film is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. Quite possibly the best supporting villain in any Marvel movie yet, Justin Hammer is the Lando Calrissian of Marvel entertainment, attempting to counter Stark Industries' outfitted models with his own inferior "Hammerroids". This is through the assistance of Whiplash in a baddie double team, and I'll stop there to avoid spoilers. What really makes Rockwell's character shine is his pompous na?ve demeanor and aptitude for superiority by being a total mook! He's hysterical and obnoxious at the same time.---Maybe SPOILERS--- It's true that we see way more of Tony Stark than Iron Man, and some things could have been left out. Some things REALLY should have been left out. We don't need to be dumbed down by believing atoms are created by shiny blue laser beam in a basement man cave through the use of AC ducting. And a stable atom isotope previously undiscovered on a fifties' theme park replica? My IQ isn't in the double digits Marvel. But the interactions between the characters made the movie, so I prefer Tony's personal demons over an extra 15 minutes of Uni-Beams and blurry flight sequences.---End maybe SPOILERS--- Give the movie a rent if you haven't seen it already. If you have seen, maybe a repeat viewing. Remember, this is a COMICBOOK movie. No matter how many times that's said, people still don't understand that sentence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, this movie rocked. I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do ? here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Iron Man 3 tried to do, Iron Man 2 already did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, here is another review comparing Iron Man 3 to another movie. For one very simple reason, this time. Iron Man 2 already did what Iron Man 3 tried to do. Iron Man 2 succeeded, while Iron Man 3 failed.In Iron Man 3, the question is said to be raised whether Tony Stark or the suit makes Iron Man. Well, Since we have already seen other people taking on the suit, we know the answer. In IM1 we saw Stane have a stab at it, and in IM2 it was Vanco. Neither of them made a decent Iron Man - so Iron Man IS Tony Stark.In Iron Man 3, we were told to expect some buddy-cop moments between Tony and Rhodey. We just saw the latter wandering around, contributing nothing to the plot. In IM2, Rhodey was the one friend that Tony had. Giving him the occasional butt-kick if needed, but also be the one Tony could share stuff with he couldn't share with Pepper. He event went so far as to let Rhodey inherit an IM suit.In Iron Man 3, we were told to expect the exploration what Tony Stark would do if he hit his all time low. If that is so, then he would treat his all time low as a temporary set-back. Well, his house did get blown up, but it didn't affect his behaviour. And neither did the PTSD, except for walking out of a room once or twice. In IM2, we saw Tony at the brink of dying from his own hands. It affected his behaviour. Made him go a little crazy, made him giving away stuff (like his company and IM suit), turned him into an alcoholic. He got so weird, that even SHIELD director Nick Fury had to intervein at one point. If you want to see Stark at his all time low, IM2 is the movie you want to see.I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but even if you want to see Pepper do some heroics, you can get it in IM2. And yet again, it is handled better than in IM3.To make a long story short. The territory that is explored in IM3 was already explored in IM2 - just better and more profoundly. Making IM3 a redundant movie and all the more disappointing. If you want to see a good Iron Man story, that is not an origin story, Iron Man 2 is the one you should see...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first immensely, it was an entertaining blockbuster, but this is overkill. For starters, Downey's arrogance went beyond my limits. I couldn't stand his Tony Stark portrayal, and the action scenes were overblown. For over two hours, I was bored and annoyed senseless. A sigh of relief came over me when it ended. Also, what happened to the shy, lovable Pepper Pots? This one is whiny, annoying, and constantly bickers with Stark. The Villain Mickey Rourke who is usually a good actor is given a ridiculous Russian accent. Weak script doesn't help matters. Only really cool scene was the race track scene with Downey and Rourke. Downey is OK, but much too annoying here, perhaps he saw dollar signs when he read the script or something, because how he accepted this is beyond me. Mickey Rourke should be ashamed. His Russian accent is entirely unconvincing, and he basically sleep walks through the part in my opinion. As I stated earlier in my review, Gwyneth Paltrow's character heads in a different direction, and not a good one. Don Cheadle is miscast, and is no match for Terrance Howard. Scarlett Johansson is sexy, and charming, but wasn't on nearly enough for my liking. Samuel L. Jackson has a couple of decent scenes. Sam Rockwell is decent in his role.Final Thoughts: I haven't been this disappointed since Transformers 2, a boring; money making machine with no soul \4/10</fullReview>

I guess writers could not come up with anything, so they decided to copy all the old stuff they knew and dump it in one place. Prolonged dialogs about nothing. In the best traditions of Cold War propaganda that apparently is still alive with some oldtimers, Iron man is fighting against some soviet guy who speaks his native Russian with horrible American accent. They used every single stupid cliché possible. Saving poor scared child, strong independent women wiping floor with poor "denutted" men, retarded dialogs , very typical happy end of course. It was like when the character takes one step you already know what the second step will be and how it all will end. When i was watching this movie i thought that the screenplay writer must be or really old and stuck in some time that had long passed or if he is young he is very stupid and out of touch with reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well-intentioned and interesting plot based on the characters created by Stan Lee , following the events developed in ¨Iron Man I ¨ and repeating the main actors . Because of his superhero alter ego, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends and new enemies . With the world now learns of his dual life as Stark is submitted to the armored pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military , being only helped by SHIELD agency formed by colonel Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) . Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and James "Rhodey" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side, must forge new alliances and battle evil enemies as Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and Justin Hammer ( Sam Rockwell).Nice performance by Rober Downey Jr as superhero Iron Man, the billionaire inventor named Tony Stark who faces powerful enemies . This spectacular comic-book movie contains fantasy, noisy action, humor ,romance , thrills and is pretty entertaining. This is a dynamic, fast- paced and entertaining movie . Full of action , it's complemented by exciting images, thrills and breathtaking scenes , including groundbreaking computer generator special effects. The picture relies in terrific flying sequences , rousing fighting, and relentless pursuits. The moving story is made believable and the script has more pace to it than former film titled ¨Iron Man I¨ also directed by Jon Favreau ; both movies result to be an intense variation on Stan Lee's comic book creation. Our superhero, well incarnated by Downey Jr dons splendidly the metallic armor , for that reason he can to be identified with the rest of his life as Iron Man and he deserves credit for remaining true to character. Breathtaking array of technical effects with impressive set pieces illuminate the Iron Man's full-blown adventures. The amazing plot is pure entertainment and with screenplay by the actor Justin Theroux, based on characters created by Stan Lee, as usual appears in a brief cameo . Overwhelming production design , though full of digital effects with impressive scenes and portentous fights . Stirring musical score fitting to action by John Debney and colorful cinematography by Matthew Libatique .The motion picture is professionally directed by Jon Favreau , an ordinary secondary actor who triumphs as director with ¨Zathura¨, ¨Elf¨ and of course in this ¨Iron Man 2¨ . Rating : Interesting and passable sequel .</fullReview>

But I thought, hey, maybe the actions scenes could spice things up a bit. But not even those were really entertaining. The ONLY part, where I thought that it might become interesting, was where all those robots showed up, and they were outnumbered. Cool. What happened? They killed them in like 30 seconds.

		<shortDescription>Has no real focus, apart from setting up the avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike iron man, iron man 2 doesn't really have the same sort of focus as the first, its feels rushed and in some cases makes no sense. The story feels rushed and has a large number of plot holes, i don't want to talk to much about the story as to avoid spoilers, but i will say that several scenes feel rushed and have weird inconsistencies that don't add up. The actors all do fine jobs in their respective roles, with Robert Downey Jr. doing good as ever as tony stark. The action is as fun as ever, especially one scene half way through, but they feel lacking in comparison to the first. There are also some serious problems with the villain, he has clear motivations, but he doesn't seem at all interesting or unique. Its hard to spoil some of the real problems with this movie, but trust me there are serious issues with this film. The original iron man focused on tony stark and only him, this one however focuses on more than just him, and sacrifices screen time that could be dedicated to him on focusing on the other characters. The plot isn't that poor but its not particularly memorable, it has elements that work but overall doesn't feel interesting. The cgi effects with the iron man Armour are still impressive and do hold up even 6 years later, but so is the case with the original as well. When this movie works it works well, but the rushed nature of it holds it down, it feels like it only exists to pass time until the avengers, which came out 2 years after this. I enjoyed parts of this movie, its well acted and has great cgi and action, but in comparison to the original, this is far to forgettable an entry in the marvel cinematic universe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid sequel that's enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is the 3rd film in the MCU and takes place shortly after the first one. Now after seeing Iron Man 1, I was super pumped for this film! After I saw it, I felt the hype didn't live up completely, but I still had fun. Once again, RDJ kills it as Tony Stark. He bumped this film up a star or two. The action sequences are fun and it's cool to see new suits he has, like a suit that is disguised as a briefcase. The recast for War Machine, Don Cheadle, I felt was a lot better than the actor in the first one. He felt more like a friend rather than a father. What holds this film down though is the plots. There are multiple plots going on in this film, some of which could have easily been thrown away and wouldn't have really made a difference and are just really messy, like the whole drunk Tony Stark scene. The whole film is setting up the Avengers film, but is forgetting to be its own film at points. The two villains in this film are also very forgettable. Some of the weakest in the MCU, and I really wanted Whiplash to be good! At the end of the day though, there is enjoyment to be found and I had fun, but the script could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever someone mentions Iron Man 2, they usually call it bad or say something bad about it. But I think it was actually pretty good and I had so much fun. I guarantee, you won't be bored for a second.It wasn't better than the first Iron Man, but it was better than The Incredible Hulk. It's lighter than The Incredible Hulk, but darker than Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. shines again in the leading role and this time we is developed a lot more than in the first one. In the first one, he is shown as this cool, funny scientist who becomes a superhero, but what I liked here the most is that we get to see that he is no more than just another ordinary human with his own personal conflicts. We get to see who Tony Stark really is. This movie also brings us some new faces: Scarlett Johansson as a super-cool female hero Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as one out of the two villains is really annoying but that's probably the way his character is supposed to be so I don't blame him, with the other villain being played by Mickey Rourke. And why Rourke was decent, he was just that typical Russian villain you see in many Hollywood movies. And also, Terrence Howard was recast and Don Cheadle got his role and I can say that Cheadle may even be a bit better. Some people say that a big problem of this movie is that it's setting up MCU too much. But if you ask me, that kinda had to happen eventually and they made it fit with the plot so it isn't all over the place.Overall, this movie was very entertaining and it's also probably the best of the "weaker" MCU movies so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining superhero flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2010, "Iron Man 2" naturally continues where 2008's "Iron Man" left off. With the knowledge that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is also Iron Man being made public, he must contend with serious heart problems, Daddy issues, alcoholism, a competing rat (Sam Rockwell), a mysterious new employee (Scarlett Johansson), a personal assistant who is now CEO and who also loves him (Gwyneth Paltrow), a friend who becomes a War Machine (Don Cheadle), Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) and a vengeful Russian with ties to his father's legacy (Mickey Rourke).I like this sequel better than the popular original because I generally don't like "origin stories," as far as superhero movies go. More than that, "Iron Man 2" brims with confidence and is just full of kinetic entertainment from beginning to end, highlighted by a rockin' soundtrack and some curvy cuties, most notably Scarlett as The Black Widow (the character's film debut). On top of this, the writers add some meatier elements to the table, like Tony's father/son issues and his sad struggle with alcoholism (which comes straight from the 80's comics, the first superhero to be depicted with this problem). The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and New York City.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dip in quality for the MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the third entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel went back to the well with a sequel to its first entry, reuniting most of the creative team in front of and behind the camera. Unfortunately, this time it feels like a lot of wheel-spinning and set-up for future issues ... um, movies ... where most of the excitement is generated by promises of things to come rather than anything that is happening here. Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow is introduced and spends much of the film playing a functionary with nothing particularly interesting to do. Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson wanders in with the sole purpose of previewing MCU #4, "Thor." At least Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has something going that affects this story and helps with the thematic resonance of fathers and sons. "Iron Man 2" might will have been subtitled "The Sins of the Fathers," with its A-story involving Mickey Rourke's bizarre performance as the son of a man who felt he was wronged by Howard Stark, who himself was no peach of a father to our hero Tony. But the movie is less interested in exploring this than in perfunctory world-building and in repeating beats from the first film, right down to a climactic battle that is a retread of "Iron Man"'s climax. The one saving grace of this film is Sam Rockwell as Tony Stark wannabe Justin Hammer. Rockwell, who was a leading contender for Tony Stark before Marvel settled on Robert Downey, Jr., shows what he could have done with the role. It's not that Rockwell would have been better than Downey's by now iconic personification, but it's fun to see a variation on Stark's snarky, egocentric megalomania that can hold his own with the master. And fun is something this film could have used a lot more of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The MCU's Worst Film To Date, Thanks to Bill O'Reilly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau returns to direct Iron Man 2, once again starring Robert Downey Jr., this time as the open superhero Iron Man; open meaning he has no secret identity. When things begin to stop going his way, he becomes very irrational, drinking at parties and ruining his reputation. When an enemy comes around, a Russian named Ivan Vanko, Tony must put aside his immature actions, and once again assume the role of the one and only Iron Man.To begin, I don't know what happened to Jon Favreau's mind in between Iron Man (2008) and this movie. Some movie-hating parasite must've crawled inside of Favreau's ear and influenced him to make a bad movie. This movie isn't, in my opinion at least, absolutely horrible, but no normal human could say this film is good. The cheap plot, bad dialogue, horrible villainization, and the fact that the whole film is a trailer for The Avengers (2012).To start with the pros, Robert Downey Jr. does pretty good as Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is pretty good as well. Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko isn't really an overwhelming performance, and neither was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. The best casting choice, however, was Bill O'Reilly as himself. Yes, Bill O'Reilly is in this movie. And he's the highlight. Just kidding.The special effects aren't the best, and it shows most during the fight scenes. The CG on Whiplash (Ivan Vanko) is really bad, especially during the final fight scene, in which the main villain fights for about two and a half minutes. There is honestly more arguing in this film more than any actual physical fighting.The plot is also very bad. Many plot holes exist throughout this movie. I feel as if Marvel sacrificed this movie so that The Avengers (2012) could be good, which paid off. However, I also feel that Marvel could have made both of the films good, without have making Iron Man 2 bad like it is. There's many ways this movie could have been better, starting with the introduction of our villains. There's an old saying that says "a movie is only as good as its villain." This is true most of the time, including this film as an example. Whiplash, or Ivan Vanko, is a villain that is only introduced by the history between his father (Anton Vanko) and Howard Stark, Tony's father.Overall, Iron Man 2 is a very washed down film, with a poor villain and some bad acting. The plot was cheap, and the exposition was way too heavy. I'm going to give Iron Man 2 a C-, or a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Iron Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the spectacular first one, I was definitely looking forward to Iron Man 2! Robert Downey, Jr. was so good as Tony Stark, he brought Iron Man into my top list of favorite super heroes! I was very glad to hear he was back for the sequel. He doesn't disappoint! Tony is as arrogant and hilarious as ever while still kicking butt as Iron Man. Though, this time around, he's having some issues- the arc reactor in his chest is poisoning him, he's having daddy issues, there's a new villain 'Whiplash' (a great Mickey Rourke), a competitive weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (played wonderfully by Sam Rockwell), the government wants his suit. So much to deal with but I enjoy watching Tony deal with all of it. We also get to learn more about his father, Howard Stark. Legacy is very important in this movie.The acting is great all around, with Robert, Sam, Mickey all having fun. Gwenyth Paltrow is beautiful as ever though her role here mostly consists of being stressed out over running Stark's company. Don Cheadle takes over for Terrence Howard as Rhodes and he does a pretty good job. I only really started to like him towards the end where I felt the most that he was Tony's best friend. Scarlett kicks some serious butt here but I thought her performance was only alright. If only the script gave her more to work with.There are some sweet action sequences like the Monaco race/Whiplash attack and Iron Man vs. War Machine/Drones/Whiplash climax. Watching Scarlett take on all those guards was a treat! So was seeing Sam Jackson as Nick Fury. Iron Man and War Machine fighting side by side? EPIC! Negatives? Maybe too much talking, the middle portion is a bit slow, Rhodes wasn't all that likable until the end, the fight between Iron Man/War Machine and Whiplash was too brief, Whiplash felt a bit too one-dimensional which was sad when you think of how the character could have been without all the editing.Still, Iron Man 2 is a fun sequel with a ton of humor, great lines, interesting story, heart, action, and fun performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man returns to the big screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard they were going to do a sequel to Iron Man, I was just as hyped! However, after walking out of the theater, It wasn't as good the first film but it was still decent to watch if you think about it.The storyline is about an incident that happened in Russia. In Russia, Ivan Vanko's father passed away after Tony Stark reveals his identity as Iron Man. Ivan Vanko built his own arc rector that is similar to Stark's. Six months later, The US Government demands that Tony Stark turns over the Iron Man weapon but he refuses because foreign nations and business competitors are far from his creation of his work. Not only that, they introduced us to our main villain Justin Hammer. Tony Stark is using every possible element like his arc rector to keep himself alive, the platinum (forgive me if I spelled that wrong) core in his arc rector is slowly killing him so he gives the CEO job to Pepper Potts. He gets attacked by Vanko but he gets arrested which leads him to his escape and get captured again by Justin Hammer so Vanko can work with him. At Stark's birthday party, he gets drunk while using his armor forcing his friend Rhodey to intervene in one of his suits, this leads to a fight and Rhodey leaving Stark so he can screw over his property with his superiors. They alter the suit which makes him War Machine. After that, Stark meets Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff, they bought him some time so he can find replacement element for his arc rector. First, I'll start with the flaws. The relationship with Tony Stark and his father Howard Stark is a sub plot that is abandoned before it can even find a conclusion. The only thing that we were told is that Stark Industries is in disarray and it seems to be going on just fine to me. Moreover, Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D, that's just tacked on in the middle and hardly mentioned until the end. They were just there to be references to The Avengers, same thing with Nastasha Romanoff. While were on that subject, Nastasha Romanoff isn't really much of a character in this film, other than being a reference to The Avengers, she is shown in one scene where she fights a bunch of security guards and posing in front of the camera, yes we know she's hot, get on with it! Also, The relationship between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts hardly gets enough screen time and the screen time it does get is completely pointless. Finally, if you didn't know, this movie takes inspiration from the 1979's story "Demon in a Bottle". In that story arc, Tony was in a phase where he attempted to drink himself to death every night and he passed the suit to Rhodey in his drunken stupor. When he later beats his alcoholism, he took the suit back and gave Rhodey the other suit which makes him War Machine. That's what they should've wrote but this was made in just one scene that was too silly for it's own good.OK, now that I finally got the flaws out of the way because I don't want to hate on this movie too much, I'll go on to the things that were good in this film. The action sequences were a ton of fun to watch especially where Iron Man and War Machine team up to battle Ivan Vanko because they that was pretty memorable and the cinematography was great as well. The special effects were amazing especially Stark Expo, Iron Man and the War Machine suits and the gadgets that Tony uses.Robert Downey Jr. again manages to do an outstanding role as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His Iron Man film is kinda like a Tony Stark film because we see him grow more as a character. In one scene where he's looking for his father's footage is really touching to me. Also, I really liked Don Cheadle as James 'Rhodey' Rhodes/War Machine, in the first movie, James Rhodey was played by Terrence Howard but in this film, he was replaced by Don Cheadle and the character was essentially the same from the first movie. Don Cheadle does a good job by getting across the appropriate aspects of the character. Moreover, I really liked Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) in this film, he was just being himself on screen and that is just awesome; Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) was a ton of fun to watch too but like I said, they're just references to The Avengers, nothing more and Nick Fury doesn't show up until the end.Gwyneth Paltrow was still good as Pepper Potts even though she did barely anything other than yell at Tony.Sam Rockwell was decent as Justin Hammer. Yeah, he may get a little annoying at times, but he still has his moments. Mickey Rourke makes a badass performance as Whiplash, even though his fight scenes were short- lived. In my opinion, the villains in Iron Man 2 are the best aspects of this film. There's Ivan Vanko played by Mickey Rourke and Justin Hammer played by Sam Rockwell, when they work off each other, it's just brilliant! Even though it might not be as awesome as the first film was, I do think that you should give this film some credit and watch it. The special effects are amazing, the humor is good and the story is decent, undeniably flawed, but still decent. Suit up and enjoy it! Now let's talk about the hints in this film leading up to The Avengers. Apart from the obvious one where Nick Fury saying that Tony Stark will only be a consultant for the team, there's Captain America's shield again and... Thor's hammer, The Mighty Mjölnir! (HOLY S***) 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the 1st Ironman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the day and age of numerous sequels, they can often feel overdone or the stories can seem to be told too many times, but I thoroughly enjoyed this action-comedy. Robert is so funny all the time (he seems to be the same guy in real life as he is in these movies), and I have no problem with that. Normally, I'm not a fan of comic books or movies made about them, but the writing on this is great. Justin Theroux and Stan Lee did a fantastic job at drawing a non-fan of comics in.I must say, Scarlett is riveting in this movie. I don't know who else could have played her character. Seeing the scenes with her and Samuel Jackson (as Nick Fury) made me realize they must be prepping us for The Avengers. It made me want to watch The Avengers after finishing Ironman 2. Mickey plays an awesome bad guy and he made me laugh. This film earns a 9 simply because of humor. I'm so glad this film was not overly-serious!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first Iron Man. I thought it had a lot of riveting action. Robert Downey Jr. was in top form quipping all about, and the source material seemed to be given a great deal of respect. The sequel is not bad by no means. It has the action, a haggard Robert Downey quipping(but with a lot less zing), beautiful Scarlett Johannson, and a mega-lode of special effects. Perhaps too much in that area for me. What was supposed to be presented on the screen as reality - at least for me - was detracted by the over-use of CGI, explosions, and a throw-it-all-at-you ending. The movie picks up sort of where the first one left off, and, yes, it is laying the groundwork for The Avengers release. Like I said, I didn't dislike the movie but left viewing it somewhat disappointed. Sorry, I cannot help how I feel when watching a film sometimes. Maybe I need to see it again. For now, I liked Johansson(a lot!), Downey at times, and thought Mickey Rourke was okay - liked the Monte Carlo scene best. Kate Mara is aboard and so is Samuel Jackson. Nice to see Gary Shandling has a role. He was humorous - at times.John Slattery does a nice job playing Howard stark in some flashback scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I'm not a fan of Robert Downey, Jnr, credit to his choice of role in reprising the Iron Man character, this is a fantastic sequel to what was already shaping as a fresh and energetic franchise. Here he does battle against an eccentric Russian scientist Mickey Rourke (!), who's developed a competing manned drone with which his financial backer (Rockwell) hopes to overcome the Iron Man brand, flailing amid the deteriorating reputation of its creator whose rock-star lifestyle is waning on the authorities (a case of art imitating life to some extent).Paltrow and Cheadle reprise their roles, Paltrow now firmly in the frame as the brains behind the suit of brawn, whereas Cheadle, now without a suit of his own, is somewhat subdued by comparison. Clark Gregg once again makes for an amusing FBI agent, Scarlett Johanson is there as a double agent, and there are small roles for Garry Shandling, Kate Mara and John Slattery. Samuel L.Jackson pops in again to deliver mystical sermons on saving the world, becoming a better super hero etc.If you enjoy the sarcastic, dry-witted dialogue and the straight delivery combined with explosive special effects then this comic-strip film should appeal. It's just as good as the original (in my opinion) and though starting to become a little self indulgent in parts, isn't yet too self aware. Certainly the best of the current slew of comic book re-imaginings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie Iron Man 2 picks up from the first movie titled Iron man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Iron Man 2 picks up from the first movie titled Iron man, where Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr., reveals to the world at a news conference that he is indeed Iron Man, much to the chagrin of his executive assistant Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. In this second part, Iron man has a nemesis in Ivan Vanko, played by Mickey Rourke, who is back to take his revenge on Tony for what he considers is a betrayal of his father Anton Vanko, played by Evgeniy Lazarev, when they worked together in the past to generate energy sources. In addition to that, Tony also has to contend with government officials, who have concerns about his type of weapons technology used to create his Iron man suit, falling into enemy hands. His friend Lt. Rhodes, played by Don Cheadle is torn as to whether he should turn over the Iron Man suit to the authorities. Mean while, Tony Stark's former business associate, and weapons expert Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell, is actively trying to obtain the secret of his Iron man suit technology. Natalie Rushman, the legal consultant for Stark Industries who is played by Scarlett Johansson reveals herself and her ties to Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Theme The theme of this movie is based on the mostly the Iron man character, Tony stark. The plot is also tied to the theme, which involves wanting to know the secret to the Iron man suit technology, and to take advantage of it to destroy Iron man. Plot Ivan Vanko who seeks to avenge his father, a Soviet physicist; because Tony's father had him deported to Russia, as a result of his greediness, is able to build a weapon similar to the Iron man suit, and confronts and attacks Tony in public in Monaco with his own weapon. This confirms the fears that both the military and government officials have about Tony's technology falling into the wrong hands. Justin Hammer witnesses the confrontation between Ivan and Iron man, and seeks to enlist Ivan's help to imitate the Iron man suit technology for his own line of military grade iron suits. Meanwhile, the military is seeking to confiscate Tony's suits because of its potential danger. Tony has to contend with all this while he is slowly dying. The action is this movie is very fast paced and has excitement. It can be compared to Batman's 'The Dark Knight' in that the theme of that movie also focuses mainly on the plot and also the Batman character as well.Techniques The lighting in the movie in quite varied, in certain scenes, the lighting is muted to reflect the mood and the tone of what is going on in the scene, in this case the lighting is low key. For the most part, a lot of the action scenes have bright lighting, high key lighting, so that the viewer is able to full see and appreciate the action sequences. Since this movie is action packed, the camera angle is very important in terms of capturing the details of the action, and making the view either objective or subjective. The camera makes one feel like they are a part of the action, by zooming in on it, and also panning and tilting the lens. There are scenes in the movie where we are made to focus on just particular subject.In conclusion, after watching the movie, one gets to see how the plot to kill and destroy Iron man comes together; as earlier mentioned the theme is mainly centered on Iron man, Tony Stark himself. Through the action and the dialogue, we come to understand and appreciate this character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovers of Favreau's "ELF", Rejoice!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not so bad if you view it as cheesy fun. I happened to see all of the negative reviews which are saying it is cheesy. So I watched it with no expectations on how the special effects would turn out. Yes, the special effects are sort of not that good. The special effects are okay for a movie coming hot off the heels of Jon Favreau's "ELF", and that is about it. The action scenes are disappointing, they are a bit slow and over-use the slo-mo action. When watching the trailer, I thought I can expect some cool action scenes but in fact, it does not deliver on that. The very few action scenes are marred by just-okay witty bandter from the Tony Stark behaving as if he's hosting SNL. Him in a robot suit is just fake, the CGI is just not convincing.The story: Nothing to say about the story. It is just your average Marvel/SNL hybrid. I actually thought the romance is the one that pulls down an entertaining story. The first half of the movie is not bad, it moves in a 'Elf like' pace. But when it comes to the last half, the talking scenes is more obvious and drags the pace down. I don't understand why Marvel wants a comedy skit in lieu of superhero action with a subplot of romance. Hk did that with Kung Fu Cyborg. I want to see superhero action movies with a cool plot and action not some kind of romance that will put the whole movie down. Kung Fu Cyborg and Future X cop are two examples. Other than that, though the CGI in this movie is not very convincing, you have to give Hollywood/Marvel for having the guts of trying.Overall: If you enjoyed "ELF" with bad special effects, you might enjoy this too. If your expectations for US movies are high, probably you will ditch this. Well, I can't say I enjoy this but it is at least worth a watch, I wanted to see how far the USA is progressing with its special effects. It is improving by a bit...</fullReview>

So me and dad went to the theater and guess what we saw this film.Iron Man 2 as you could say tops it off a lot better then previous superhero films such as Superman Returns, The Empire Strikes Back, X-Men, The Dark Knight, And Transformers, This movie was just awesome and action packed.Now this film is a great film. I would have to say that the characters such as Tony Stark, Nick Fury, Pepper Potts, And Black Widow, Do a great job on their performance here. But also because i like how Robert Downy Jr. Manages to play so well in this film as Tony Stark. His talent and performance can be remembered for a very long time. And that he was a great actor. Plus he was really smart and was a billionaire who was rich and had a lot of money so that he could get things he wanted.The Cgi and Special Effects in this movie are amazing, You get to see how good a blockbuster superhero film looks like with the realistic effects. And also the scenes with the buildings falling and also in the fight scenes was awesome as well. I don't think that this fails to entertain at all and it was good as well.Also the soundtrack is awesome and composed very well. I like how intense the music is and how awesome it sounds. So i would say that the soundtrack is awesome.Also if you want then you must see this in the theater like i did. The acting, Cast, Concept, Story, And the acting and roles here are awesome, The performance is also awesome here too and they do a good job. Go see this film, You will not be disappointed,</fullReview>

Mr Lee shows up as a Larry King knockoff. Nick fury of SHIELD is introduced in this film with some suggestions to the next Marvel comic film, "Thor". The end credits has a 'stinger' scene at the film's very end for "Thor".*Emotion- An enjoyable popcorn and comic book action film, little more. The weak part of the film is the villain involvement against Ironman. The government political overtones makes the plot and theme very relevant to today's news from Washington, DC. Ironman's daddy, a Walt Disney or Howard Hughes 'like' character is well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was everything I hoped it would be. I don't understand why there was so much criticism of this movie. I get that it might not have been as good as the first movie, but this was still a spectacular movie and a great follow-up.It's nice that Favreau listened to fans' reactions from the first movie and gave us more action in this one. One of the biggest complaints I've heard is that the actions scenes were too short. I disagree. They were crisp and real (as real as a sci-fi comic book movie action can be). Think of it this way, if Tony Stark was a real person and Iron Man was real, the fight scene on the race track would have played out exactly as in the movie. There was no time for anything fancy with all the innocent bystanders. Iron Man takes Whiplash down and immediately rips out his weapons power source. In the final fight scene, Stark and Rhodey act exactly as if they are really fighting for their lives. Again nothing fancy or cute - every shot against the drones is a kill shot. I definitely appreciate the nod to the source material in showing War Machine's fighting style as more ruthless than Iron Man's; just as it appears in the comic.Once again we get great performances from Robert Downey Jr, Gweneth Paltrow, Sam Jackson, and newcomers Sam Rockwell and Don Cheadle. Mickey Rourke is as creepy and evil as ever. Favreau also continues his character development and does a great job showcasing Stark's inner demons and Rhodey's conflict over his dedication to his friend and his job. Yes, the fight scene between the two Iron Men was a little hokey and probably the weakest part of the movie, but again, it detracts very little from the overall film.The movie also does a great job weaving aspects of the upcoming Avengers movie into it. Make sure you check out the scene after the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superhero sequel with plenty of laughs and thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the end of the first 'Iron Man' film Tony Stark announced to the world that he was Iron Man; I assumed that this would quickly be explained as a joke and he'd do back to being a standard superhero whose true identity is unknown? I was wrong; this superhero wants the world to know who he is and he wants to enjoy his celebrity status. Not everything is going well for Tony though; the senate wants him to hand over his suit to the military and to make matters worse he is slowly dying. Tony is convinced that nobody else is close to developing a suit like his until one take he is attacked by Ivan Venko; a Russian with a grudge against the Stark family. Venko ends up working for a rival arms manufacturer, Justin Hammer, and Tony is approached by a shadowy individual who claims that there is a cure for Tony's condition but only Tony can find it. While Tony sets about finding that cure Hammer is creating a drone army, which ultimately Tony must confront.This was a fun sequel that sets things up nicely for a future superhero franchise; 'The Avengers'. There was lots of explosive action and some delightfully over the top acting from Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and a far more restrained performance as Pepper Potts, his erstwhile assistant now CEO of Stark Industries. Mickey Rourke was suitably menacing as Venko and Don Cheadle was good as Stark's friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes. Of the new characters the biggest surprise came from Scarlett Johansson who appeared to be a straight-laced lawyer but soon proved to be a martial arts expert who may be a superhero herself! Like the vast majority of modern action films this was full of CGI and special effects; thankfully they were well done and the CGI looked believable even when we were being shown the impossible. Overall this was a lot of fun and it is suitable for adults and older children alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a Skell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. is again brilliant as Tony Stark in Iron Man 2. While not as fresh or interesting as the first Iron Man this movie has much to recommend. The pacing is good and the characters are brought to life with some very good acting.Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role has Pepper Potts and has a love/loathing relationship with Tony. Again there is a list of bad guys Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke)who plays the main antagonist. His main beef with Tony is that his father was cheated by Tonies father. The other bad guy is Tonies industrial rival Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell) who wants to get his hands on either Ivan(who has the knowledge to build an Iron Man suit) or one of Tonies Iron man suits to sell to the military. There is also a secret organization the Avengers headed by Colonel Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson)who sends Natalie Rushman(Scarlett Johansson)to protect him. This is the basic set up of the film.What works well in this movie are good special effects and solid acting on all parts. The fact that Iron Man is vulnerable and actually getting sick from the poisons of being Iron man makes Tony act with abandonment which helps move the film along. Some of the disappointing parts of the film is that transitions seem unnatural and some of the charm that endeared us to Tony in the first film.Overall grade B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this movie just starts out strong it pulls you in and you will enjoy the ride. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal this guy is right for the part. This movie will make you laugh and you will get to see some cool explosions. But then the movie slows down in the middle almost to a stop. It almost makes you mad because you were loving this movie then all a sudden it comes to this screeching halt. The movie will pick up towards the end but if you're like me and like the main hero take on the main villain fights that they have in every other superhero movie then the end fight will make you just be annoyed with this film and leave you with this "wow that was lame" feeling. If you like movies with fights and explosions then sure see it. If you are a comic nerd then at all cost avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time I've ever written a review on a superhero movie. Essentially, it's because I have a hard time regarding movies of this genre to be serious film. However, this is one of the very few times that I can safely say that I've seen a movie that falls under this category that also serves as a genuinely polished work of cinema.Iron Man 2 is well worth seeing. It has replay value, deals with present-day issues, doesn't take itself too seriously, features exceptional performances, and deals with a very realistic lead character. This last point is the one that really makes or breaks this genre of film for me. Traditionally, I've found that Batman has come the closest to being a believable character, due to his flaws. Tony Stark, however, brings the level of realism to a higher level. He IS the contemporary man: conflicted, fallible, sometimes humerus, sometimes heroic, and (despite what he may believe) in need of the help of others from time to time.Kudos to the writers: This is a very smooth screenplay. Kudos to the actors: The performances are often subtle and always a joy to watch. Kudos to the VFX crew: There's nothing distracting about the effects. Good estimates on simulated mass and kinetics. Good light-matching. Oh, and kudos to the sound designers: The gunfire is remarkably well-mixed.If you haven't seen this film, check it out -- even if you don't quite think it's your thing. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's intriguing watching Robert Downey Jr. as millionaire Tony Stark who, with too much fame, money, booze and girls, behaves like Downey did in the nineties (short of waking up in a stranger's living room), this is an action film lacking action.Mickey Rourke makes for a potentially decent villain, but is given two (relatively quick) scenes battling our hero, the metal clad warrior not up for saving the world (but from what, or who?).The lack of a decent heavy is replaced by Sam Rockwell's sleazy arms-dealing senator, given too much dialog in scenes that need more punch.Much like ROCKY IV... a lazy "champion" with too much money verses a killer Russian... but even that had more vapidly entertaining comic book appeal, something this needed more of.</fullReview>

Robert Downey was as good as ever, I couldn't take my eyes off Scarlett Johansson. She is bold and beautiful. I would suggest you all to watch "Iron Man" (part1) before laying your hands on this sequel. These movies will always be loved by engineers. And that's one of the reasons I love them. The technology is not only used but it is also tried to explain the reason behind it. This makes it look less like a fiction.The Iron man movies tells you about how a single man can turn it all around by using his mind. The utmost intelligence is unparalleled and can't be defeated by the highest of all odds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never into Iron Man. X-men I liked, Spider-man was OK, but how can I identify with a rich jerk who just happens to be a self absorbed genius? I mean, I'm not rich!Other people must have felt like me, since I've never heard of Iron Man being of the same caliber as most other comic book heroes. After all, he is a technological Superman who didn't have nice parents. But while Superman battled Lex Luthor or some evil villains from his home planet, Iron Man battles moron competitors, the uselessness of the military and some guy with a grudge. It just doesn't work.Mickey Rourke again takes on his old, fat, long haired persona, only now he is also dirty and speaks mainly Russian. When he does speak English he doesn't make much sense. Iron Man does a little Go-Go-Don-Cheadle-Gadget and wins. Samuel L. Jackson appears in a few scenes as the parental figure that knows all, can do all, yet he needs Iron Man for an abstruse reason while Paul Bettany does... the voice of Jarvis.Bottom line: The only thing that doesn't waste one's time is seeing Scarlett Johansson as a hot redhead again, with Gwyneth Paltrow steaming with cat-envy around her. The rest of the film is consistently average, never once creating a moment of true tension or at least great special effects, while it never goes to a moment of bad quality either. So, yeah... meh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a LOT Going On as Iron Man Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IRON MAN 2 was easily my most anticipated movie of 2010. I was a major fan of the first film and, with all the major players returning for the second (with the exception of Terrence Howard), I was psyched. In a sense, IRON MAN 2 followed the same formula that made the first film great. Unfortunately, they followed it so closely that it felt as if they didn't bring anything new to the mix. The film begins about six months after the first left off, with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) publicly admitting his role as Iron Man. News reaches Russia where Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father originally aided Stark's father in his creation of the arc reactor, becomes enraged as his father dies in poverty. He creates a whip harness powered by an arc reactor and soon joins with Tony Stark's rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) in a plan to create Iron Man drones for the military.Having tried to explain the plot just now, it reinforces just how overly complicated the plot of the film ended up. There are a lot of factors director Jon Favreau ended up cramming into the film: Whiplash's drive for revenge on Iron Man, Tony's illness as a result of the palladium in his arc reactor and the search for a cure, Justin Hammer's catering to the military's desire for Iron Man suits, Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) becoming War Machine, and the further development of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the Marvel film universe. Still, while the film does have some trouble fitting it all in, Favreau manages to keep it interesting throughout thanks to the characters involved.Robert Downey Jr. has already proved in the first IRON MAN that he is the perfect actor for the role of Tony Stark and he doesn't lose any ground here. Gwyneth Paltrow continues doing well enough as Pepper Potts, and Cheadle does a great job stepping in for Howard as Colonel Rhodes. Honestly, I feel Cheadle did a better job in the role, and you know it had to be fun stepping in as War Machine (which I know I'd been waiting for more than anything). As the villain of the film, Rourke was awesome as Vanko/Whiplash, but the real scene-stealer was Sam Rockwell as Hammer. Rockwell is a fantastic actor and was my favorite part of the film, oozing sleaze while trying to emulate Stark's playboy attitude.As I'd mentioned, my real complaint lies in that (with the exception of War Machine) this film didn't bring anything new to the table. When you break it down, it's still Iron Man versus another villain in a power suit (or in this case, many suits). My other problem is that Stark never seemed to be in a real danger and it totally robbed the film of any suspense. In the first film, when Iron Man battles Iron Monger at the film's climax, Iron Man's getting beat down until he has Pepper detonate the arc reactor to finally bring Iron Monger down. In this film, when the final battle against Whiplash arrives, it's done so fast that it feels like it's over before it started. Never at any point does it seem like Iron Man's lost control of the situation and he never feels as if he's in any real danger. That sort of takes some of the fun out of it, in my opinion.When I first saw the film, I thought it could've used more action (there aren't many major action scenes) but in the end I'm glad they focused so much on story. With so much going on, there are no loose ends when the final credits roll and there is some nice character development in the film (at least on Stark's part). I would've liked some more time with Whiplash but overall it's still an incredibly entertaining movie and people who enjoyed the first film are almost guaranteed to enjoy this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly Good Sequel to a better Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple years ago Iron Man was a solid super-hero movie with a better story and dynamics than this film I thought. So, Iron Man 2 comes along and has to try to live up to it's predecessor and mostly does. It has a satisfactory villain and some excellent slick special effects, however I thought some of the dialog and story seemed to be reaching too much. Instead of meaningful clear cut conversations there becomes excessive banter (ok not nearly as bad as the Dark Knight). And the Paltrow/Downey relationship seemed to stale to unbelievability a bit. Lastly, couldn't they have come up with a new concept for villain(?), once again we have Iron Man fighting another pseudo Iron Man. Anyway despite a few of these detractions, Iron Man 2 is watchable, but probably not too re-watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony's back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of expectations, Iron Man 2 started as a quite different beast compared to its predecessor. After all, the first film was "burdened" by a protagonist without the mainstream appeal of, say, Spider-Man, a director better known as a character actor (Jon Favreau) and a leading man whose career has been shaky to say the least (Robert Downey Jr.). As it turned out, Iron Man was just what movie audiences needed, becoming a surprise hit, cementing Downey Jr. and Favreau's reputations as go-to guys in the industry (with the former winning a Golden Globe for Sherlock Holmes and the latter hired to direct another comic-book picture, Cowboys and Aliens) and kick-starting a new on-screen Marvel Universe, no longer limited by the issue of rights belonging to different studios (with the exception of pre-established franchises like X-Men and Spider-Man, characters are now freely allowed to cross over, just like in the comics). How do you follow that? With a sequel that retains the same spirit, but goes further in terms of scope and ambition.Set six months after the conclusion of the first film, Iron Man 2 shows Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) in a tight spot: since he came clean about his double identity, his fame has reached sky-high proportions, but with the consequence that the US government (here embodied by Garry Shandling's annoying Congressman) wants the Iron Man suit for themselves. Additionally, the very thing keeping him alive - the arc reactor that has effectively replaced his biological heart - is slowly killing him (radiation poisoning), and two very different bad guys - business rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and former engineer-turned-supervillain Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) - are planning ways to get rid of him permanently. Lucky for him, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), Rhodey (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard) and new secretary "Natalie" (Scarlett Johansson) are willing to help, assuming Tony doesn't destroy himself in the process...Sequels are tricky by definition, and Iron Man 2 is a particularly tough one to pull off since it not only has to satisfy as a standalone follow-up (however paradoxical that may sound), but also set up events for the other movies that will make up the expanded Marvel movie universe. It all started with Samuel L. Jackson's cameo in the first movie's post-credits scene (followed by Downey Jr. making an appearance in The Incredible Hulk a month later), and this time the actor is allowed more screen-time - heck, he even gets his name in the opening credits - to do his usual stuff and set up The Avengers (plus minor hints at Thor and Captain America) in an intriguing way, without ever giving the impression that he's stealing someone else's movie.And that's the real key behind Iron Man 2's success: it is an Iron Man flick, retaining the original's winning combination of action and humor, thanks to Justin Theroux's witty script and Favreau's effortless direction. Like most sequels, it goes dark in places, but this isn't Nolan's Batman, meaning that a lighter mood generally prevails (see the alcoholism subplot). Like the first film, the follow-up is a bit of a let-down when it comes to the climactic showdown (again, way too long), but otherwise it delivers everything it promised: the special effects are flawless (Exhibit A: the Monte Carlo race track sequence), the laughs and thrills are evenly balanced and everyone in the cast is fully game, from Rockwell and Rourke's riotous double act to Cheadle easily filling Howard's shoes, not to mention some welcome extra material for the director himself, who gets to be as funny as ever in the always entertaining company of Johansson. As usual, though, this is Downey's show from start to finish, and he slips into Stark's skin so perfectly it's damn near impossible not to raise expectations for the next installment.Bottom line: as a piece in Marvel's expanding cinematic world, Iron Man 2 is as satisfying as one could anticipate. As its own thing, it's a fun, energetic follow-up that confirms the charm of comic-book movies and, much like its printed counterpart, leaves the door open for endless new possibilities. In other words: bring on number three...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>skip the reviews; watch the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people didn't like this movie. I basically avoid getting into a fight about it. But I have to be honest that while watching it I was as entertained by it as I was by the first Iron Man. This one may even be a bit more fun without the burden of an origin story. Some fans have been able to catalogue visual continuity flaws, and more power to them. I didn't notice any. I guess my eyes went where the editor expected they would.An ongoing pet peeve of mine is the ease with which critics publish falsehoods. I don't even mean subjective arguments with which I disagree, but unqualified statements contrary to the evidence on screen. Here is an example, having looked at a review of Iron Man 2 before seeing it, since I was thrown by a claim that caught my eye. Ordinarily I avoid reviews of movies I already intend to see.False statement number one is that Mickey Rourke doesn't have enough screen time. Fact: he has exactly the right amount of screen time for a primary movie heavy. Does he have as much as in The Wrestler? No. Does he have as much as Nicholson's Joker in the 1989 Batman? Of course not, because there was no writer's strike during the shooting of Iron Man 2 and Tim Burton doesn't always know when enough Jack is enough. Jack had way too much screen time in that flick, entertaining as he was.False statement number two is that we don't see Iron Man in the suit enough. This might actually be offered as proof the critic didn't even see the movie. We see as much of Iron Man in full costume as the story permits, which is exactly the right amount. Then we also get to see War Machine in his own similar costume, and Mickey again in something still similar. Not to mention the collection of Iron man suits on display in Stark's home. This of course is even clear to people who have seen the trailers. No spoilers here.I could go point for point through the whole "review," but those were the to most laughable that drifted into my thoughts as I was watching them be disproved during the film. Proof once again that a movie should be seen as cold as possible (despite the omni-present trailer) and there is no point having a critic's nonsense rattling around in your head.Let's face it, you are in better hands with the team behind Iron Man 2 than with even a competent critic. The themes are well explored, the character flaws of Stark are exploited for substance, and it is as it should be. I don't think I'll show up for any Stark parties or Expos, but I will keep showing up to his movies. If there's a quibble, it can be for the hurdles placed before the filmmakers by the studio when it announced the release date of this flick before telling its director - who then had to round out whatever draft of a script with an ongoing workshop with his cast. Let's hope they are given more time for part 3, but they managed to maintain the standard of the first one to a large extent.I may never have the time to compile an archive website of disprovable quotes from critics, and there is the danger anyway that it might inadvertently promote their names.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 (2010)*** (out of 4)This sequel seems to have come under quite a bit of heat. I'd say I agree with most people in that this isn't nearly as good as the original but I'll step away from those who called this a bad movie because there's plenty of great action and the terrific cast makes it worth sitting through. This time out Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is coming under fire for not sharing his secrets behind Iron Man. While that political turmoil is going on, the Russian Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), who believes his father had the original ideas for the Iron Man secrets, plans revenge by coming up with his own armor and killing Stark. Countless reviews have discussed how the story here is rather weak and how the majority of the characters lack any real development. I'd agree with both of those points as it seems the screenplay here was pretty choppy in terms of what it was trying to do or what type of story it was trying to tell. A lot of times it seemed like we were watching an incomplete movie that needed stuff taken out while at the same time needed other things put in. The banter between Stark and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) wasn't nearly as charming here as in the first film and a lot of it seemed very ill-timed including during a terrific sequence at a race track. The turmoil between Stark and Rhodes (Don Cheadle) also didn't play as well and most of the time just seemed like half-baked melodrama. There's so much story build-up that never amounts to anything that I really do understand the complaints from people who dislike the movie but even with all the faults I think the good things are just too good to be overlooked. Once again we get Robert Downey, Jr. delivering a very strong performance. The character's ego is much bigger here and Downey is the perfect actor to be able to play cocky without having the viewer turn against him. That comic timing is right on the mark and once again he makes for a great hero. Another major plus is the performance by Rourke who just chews up each scene that he's in. The terrific accent is just the start of things as Rourke takes the character and just makes him an all around fun bad guy. Cheadle and Paltrow are both decent enough in their roles but the screenplay doesn't do them any favors. Scarlette Johansson doesn't get much of a chance to act but she's good eye candy. Sam Rockwell is terrific in the role as the nerdy Justin Hammer. Samuel L. Jackson is his typical self and Gary Shandling appears to be having some fun as well. The action sequences are all quite impressive but the best one happens at the start of the film when Vanko shows up at the Monaco Grand Prix with is new toys. Some of this sequence was shown in the trailer but seeing it play out in the film was certainly the highlight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting follow-up to the Ironman movie, Downey is good in his role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first movie we learn that Tony Stark's company designs and manufactures weapons. But when Tony gets taken prisoner in a foreign land he learns that the enemies are also using his weapons, and that realization gets him to get out of the weapons business. The Ironman suit was developed from the crude version he built while a prisoner to make his escape. He is a very bright and industrious fellow.Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, and as this movie begins we see him called to a federal committee, chaired by Garry Shandling as Senator Stern. They are trying to make the case that the various Ironman suits are in fact weapons, and should be controlled by the US government for homeland security purposes. But Stark insists they are for preventing crime. Don Cheadle is now the good friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his assistant Pepper Potts, who clearly longs for more. Sam Rockwell becomes the first nemesis, as Justin Hammer who competes with Stark, but not very well. His designs just don't work well. But the really bad nemesis is Mickey Rourke as Russian scientist Ivan Vanko, who makes a new kind of suit that threatens Stark. For me the most pleasant surprise was Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman but really Natasha Romanoff. I've seen her in quite a variety of movies, starting with "The Horse Whisperer" when she was a teenager but never in an action role. Here she cuts quite a nice figure in her skin-tight suit and proves to be quite effective as a martial-arts fighter. Who would have thought??So what happens in a movie based on a Stan Lee comic? The hero always finds a way to get the best of the bad guys. There is a lot of action, and some tense moments, but in the end Ironman sets things straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 A Bit Disappointing But Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a bit disappointing yet decent comic book sequel. Don't get me wrong it's okay but there's was too much talking and not enough action. I enjoyed Inception this summer a lot more than this one. Robert Downey is solid as Tony Stark but even he can't save this from being a bit of a disappointment compared to the first one. He's everything Tony Stark should be and is still a perfect choice for the character none the less. Gwyneth Paltrow does what she can as Pepper Popps despite not having a whole lot to do. Don Cheadle is all right as Jim Rhodes and War Machine who's involved in the action more than the previous one. Scarlet Johannson is decent as Natalie Rushman/The Black Widow who like Paltrow doesn't have much to do except for a third act action sequence which is okay while it lasts. Sam Rockwell is a good actor (Moon, and Machstick Men) but I actually found him to be rather annoying as Justin Hammer one of the villains if you want to call the role that. I think it was more the character than him who I thought is annoying. He wasn't menacing or threatening to Tony at all. Rockwell did however a bring some comic relief to the movie. Mickey Rourke's underused as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash who is intimidating even with very little dialog and screen time. They could've done a lot more with his character who after an impressive display of destruction at the race track he takes a back seat for a large part of the movie particularly the second half. He shows up briefly near the end only to be dispatched as quickly as he appears. Whiplash didn't turn to be as much of a threat to Tony as he could've been. Samuel L Jackson does his usual thing as Nick Fury in a small role considering he has only two scenes with Downey Jr. He's in it for five minutes tops to set up the upcoming Avengers movie and Kate Mara is wasted in an early cameo appearance. The story itself was kind of predictable, and the few action sequences were so-so but they missing that wow factor. Most of the action happens in the third act which turns out to be a bit of a letdown because it's over too fast. The only one that had any real intensity to it was at the race track when Rourke's Whiplash confronts Tony for the first time. There's a lot of talking in the second half and almost no action except for a fight between a drunk Tony and Rhodes in Iron Man suits which weighed it down a bit. Not that there has to be constant explosions, fist fights, and violence every 10 minutes but some more spectacle would've made it better. And for a movie called Iron Man I was surprised about how little we actually see Stark in the suit. This movie suffered the same problem that Spider-man 3 had of trying to put too much into one film with mixed results. Actor/Director Jon Favreau is admirable in making this sequel despite it's flaws that further develops Downey's Tony Stark which isn't necessarily a bad thing but certain key characters (Potts, Rhodes, Black Widow, and Whisplash) unfortunately aren't given much development and lack screen time. The fight at the end with Downey's Iron Man and Cheadler's War Machine facing off against Rourke's Wiplash is over in like 30 seconds was a big disappointment because it felt rushed. What was the point of him showing up after the drones were killed if he's just going to get killed off thirty seconds later. There wasn't any danger or suspense to speak of and dispatching the main villain in such a short battle at the end seemed like a wasted opportunity to show how dangerous he could be. Overall this movie really isn't that bad. Iron Man 2 has some action, drama, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast (Robert Downey Jr) for the most part it just could've been better. The part with a drunk Tony in an Iron Man suit wasn't all that funny either. I prefer The Dark Knight over this sequel as far as comic book movies go because it delivered everything you could want or expect from one of those films. Iron Man 2 on the other hand wasn't as good as the original which is shame because I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2: Funnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to write off "Iron Man 2" as easy enjoyment, but let's look at what we have here: Mickey Rourke plays the blandest Russian villain imaginable; Robert Downey Jr. pulls off the role of Tony Stark as well as last time, but the bickering between him and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper gets worn thin pretty quickly; Scarlett Johansson shows up supposedly to introduce romantic strain between Stark and Pepper, but it soon becomes apparent that she is more there for the audience to ogle at (which I did). Saddest of all, the most interesting part of the movie was the Avengers subplot, which in the end really has no influence in the realm of the movie. And the discovery of Thor's Hammer at the end of the closing credits reveals all - "Iron Man 2" really isn't much more than a mediary between the (deserved) hype of the first "Iron Man" and the hype of the upcoming "Thor" movie. And this is why no one likes a critic. But seriously, Scarlett Johansson is hot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Iron Man film was a pleasant surprise. The second instalment therefore carried higher expectations. Although not a disaster the second film doesn't quite live up to the first film.The story revolves around the government wanting to have the technology of the Iron Man from Tony Stark. Stark is holding onto the information and says nobody will be able to mimic this for many years. There's no surprises to find that this doesn't turn out to be true.Downey Jr is again pretty entertaining as Stark and Mickey Rourke is also pretty good as Ivan Vanko. It sounds like Johansson and Paltrow didn't get on that well, but there's not too much evidence of that on screen which is slightly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRON MAN 2 ? CATCH IT ( B ) I am actually stunned to see that How Lame and Cliché Iron Man 2 was? I had really high expectations after watching the promos but sadly Jon chose a very Cliché story "A son looking for revenge plus another cliché plot line was Tony Stark thinking he was never good enough for his father or his father hated him". These two stories, every other revenge movies always have. I am surprised how someone could choose such cliché story for a Comic Book Hero. We knew everything what's going to happened Next. Robert Downey Jr.'s wit and wicked portrayal of Iron man is really enjoyable and this time Don cheadle also rightly stand next to him. Gwyneth Paltrow as usual did a good job. Scarlett Johansson looked Hot as ever and she looked good thin seems like she shed some pounds for this role. Mickey Rourke was a cool villain and Sam Rockwell was truly amazing as devious enemy. Samuel L.Jackson show up to set a plot for The Avengers movie. Anyways it's a time pass good movie from whom I expected some shocking twists and cliff hangers in the end but it never happened and director played really safe by bringing the cliché story. Overall watch it for once that would be enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as good as the first, but here is the problem. Now don't get me wrong. I am a comic nerd. In fact I had a total nerdgasim when watching this. But I will be serious. The story was a little rushed. The ending was resolved too quick at the end. You were kind of hoping for more of an epic battle, but you didn't get it. Now all the characters and the visual effects were amazing. So I give credit for that. But I just don't want them to make the same mistake as the Spider-Man movies; having them go slowly downhill. So the nerds out there, the movie had many references to the Avengers which is very exciting. Robert Downey Jr. was still the same quirky Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow seemed a little off as Pepper though. Don Cheadle was an excellent replacement from Terrance Howard for Rhodey. Not that Howard is a bad actor, it just seems like Cheadle wanted it more. Scarlett Johansson was a great Black Widow. She had the looks and the moves. Of course Samuel L. Jackson was good as Nick Fury. Then the two villains were Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell was pretty good. I really wish there was more of Rourke though. He is just 100% creepy and mean looking. Two side characters that were enjoyable were Jon Favreau, the director, and Clark Gregg who played Agent Coulson. So overall the cast was really good. I just wanted more from the story. But that doesn't mean that the movie was bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very good. Robert Downey Jr. brings a lot of fun and humor to this film as he did previously to the first film. Lots of great action and fun CGI with entertaining performances from Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johanson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Sam Rockwell. Mickey Rourke is perfectly cast as the super villain and looks totally BAD A**. The movie is fun to see with friends with a few thrills and laughs and hot supporting actresses. It is not an epic or a great film but is lots of fun. The first Iron Man is a better movie but this might be a bit more fun. This film introduces SHIELD and a ton more new characters to look forward to in the coming films. I liked the film and I think you will too. This is the second best summer action thriller to come out so far with Inception being by far the best. Cannot wait for the third.

		<shortDescription>While it slips for the original premise Iron Man 2 still flies solid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I could find a lot wrong with Iron Man 2. The first film really surprised me as being an amazing super hero origins film and I knew that a second movie or any future instalments would likely fall short. But for everything I could say I didn't like about Iron Man 2 I also think they did a pretty decent job for a high flying summer action flick. There is plenty of new and original ideas and perhaps the only glaring issue is that they take the amazing performance by a great actor and over do it a little bit making the hero of the story seem weaker in some ways but then that is also the basic premise of this sequel. Certainly every great hero needs a great villain and the villain they bring to the big screen for the sequel is quite simply amazing. I had low expectations of who they might put up against Iron Man for the sequel but I was truly blown away. Despite replacing a main character in the story they still managed to carry on terrific chemistry with the cast. Even though some of the characters are a little overblown this time around and the story doesn't have quite the same strength the action and special effects do bring it altogether nicely.Robert Downey Jr. takes his iconic role as philanthropist Tony Stark and Iron Man to new heights and goes through some real emotional moments. The problem is his breakdown in the film is overdone. You almost feel annoyed with his over the top antics to the point where he seems childish. He is still Tony Stark though and no one else could lead the character the way he does. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts in a more significant role this time around. She was terrific in the first film and is still great this time around. She is the grounding force to Downey's Stark and they still have great chemistry despite the story arc putting a wedge between them. This is a strong character for Paltrow. Don Cheadle takes the role of Stark's closest friend from Terrence Howard. I don't think the character was very well explored in the first film but they certainly give Cheadle more to work with and of course his own Super Hero persona as War Machine. War Machine is cool but is he entirely necessary...not in my opinion although that being said some of the great scenes in the film are featuring Cheadle as War Machine. Him and Downey also have great chemistry. Also new to the cast is Scarlett Johansson in a mostly introductory role to the future Avengers cast. She doesn't get much more than other than to allow Downey's Stark to hit on her mercilessly however she does get one incredible action scene where she stuns and amazes as she kicks her way through a group of baddies. I'm not quite aboard this Mickey Rourke craze train but I must say he is an awesome bad guy in the form of Ivan Vanko. They don't give him a lot of actual lines in the film (which is a bonus) and he looks awesome and kicks some serious ass. He is an awesome head villain for the film. Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell round out a supporting cast in good solid roles.While I don't believe the story is quite as good as the first the action is full throttle. There is some truly some great scenes that will put you on the edge of your seat. Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the directors chair. Iron Man is probably his best project to date. The cast and the over the top characters make this a high flying adventure. Certainly the first film was downright amazing and to follow it up with a solid entertaining second film is worth it. As much as I love a good sequel I think it would be smart to end the Iron Man saga here in favour of The Avengers which I hope they will do a good job with. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Favreau directs this terrific sequel with style and command.Robert Downey Jr. recreates his role of Tony Stark, military industrialist whose identity as Iron Man, invades every aspect of his life.Also returning are Gwennyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Jon Favreau as "Happy" Hairston ,chauffer and bodyguard to Tony Stark.The film centers around Russian Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke) whose father was a scientist that worked with Howard Stark, Tonys father.In order to gain revenge for his fathers alleged betrayal by Stark the elder, he designs his own version of an "Iron Man", and attempts to even the score. He is initially defeated, but subsequently released from jail under the pretense of his death by a bombing, by competitor to Stark Industries, Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell).All of the characters carry their own very well, and the culmination of overlapping sub-plots combine for a terrific showdown.If you like robots, you will love "Iron Man 2."Fantastic special effects, a good script with fine direction, and more than capable actors add up for a great time. Never a dull moment with this grouping.I gave this an 8 out of 10 . Runs about 2 hours and 5 minutes.Looks like the coming of "Thor" is next. Look for the teaser after the closing credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is a great film if you have the mind of a mentally challenged dog though in my opinion feels like the first one all over again. The first film was great though very campy, the second one starts off a little serious. I thought "Oh boy this is really gonna be deeper" but nope!!. Not even 30 minutes into the film and it already goes downhill to the campy roots of the original. Tony must find a way to stay alive so the iron from his suite won't severely poison his bloodstream , then the movie jumps the shark but to be quite honest it is a high budget over the top superhero film so what do you expect. The middle of the film is just constant conversation but the action takes off in the end. So what do I say about this far from great action film, I would rate this a 2 out of 10 because it just lacked way too much quality and the middle was really really boring. Just skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing and uneven follow up to the powerhouse of a few years ago.Jon Favreau proves that his ability to direct a solid movie isn't there. forgive me the only film of his that I think worked start to finish was the first film.The pacing is all off with whole sequences going on too long or not long enough. Honestly most of the first half is numbing with the result that I wanted to curl up and go to sleep.Realism is out the window with several sequences looking more like the sort of things we'd make fun of from 1970's movies (The race sequence prior to Iron man is just silly- though once Iron Man shows up it's note perfect. And bits of the final fight sequence screamed Conquest of the Planet of the Apes) This is a movie of pieces. the script is good, but badly directed. There a moments that are on target with the end of the race sequence excellent, The creation of Bullwhip into a real villain, Black Widow kicking ass, and other small moments that show what the film should have been. Unfortunately Favreau in putting the film together ruined it (Or was it th editor?) The performances are excellent for the most part with the exception of Paltrow who has become shrill and Sam Rockwell who has been given nothing to do so he does shtick.This will play better on DVD where you can zip past the dead spots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mickey Rourke's finest ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most super-hero movies, with all their techno-dazzle, are kind of boring to me. If you don't have a story, with real people who are interesting, then special effects can't save it. What makes this film absolutely worth paying money to see is the performance of Mickey Rourke. Rourke makes Ivan Vanko into one of the screen's most memorable villains ever. Great villains have a back-story that gives you clues as to what is driving them, and we have that in this film, with every bit of the damage of his character's early years visible in Rourke's performance. Clearly, we are seeing also a lot of Rourke's own demons in that face. Rourke brings every ounce of Vanko's hate, pain and thirst for revenge across on the screen. He is as physically menacing as anything I have ever seen in a movie, even when he is just sitting there not talking. It is an amazing performance.Rourke takes the picture away from Robert Downey, Jr., which is no small feat given Downey's great ability to create fascinating characters. More than that, Rourke takes the picture away from IRONMAN, meaning that I found myself wanting to see more of Rourke and less of Ironman. That's how good he is. I saw The Wrestler, and although Rourke was good in it, I didn't think the performance great enough to rate an Oscar. However, no way should Hollywood NOT give Rourke the supporting Oscar for this performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good effort....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new installment of the "Iron Man" movie series works well as a continuation of the story started in the first film. We get to see the consequences of Stark's ego run amok and how the suit, along with it's related gadgets take a physical toll on him. His new-found notoriety as Iron Man has attracted intense competition, attention from outside powerful forces and opened some old family wounds he didn't even know he had.Personal relationships change...and one man hell-bent on taking revenge for his own father's fate coincides with Stark's dealing with his own "father issues"....Good, heady stuff that for the most part, works. It's a handsome, well-produced production with great design, good SFX that don't look overdone or overstay on the screen. The cast is again top-notch, with Mickey Rourke adding considerable weight and intensity to his performance as Valko. Cheadle stepping into the role previously essayed by Terrence Howard, does a good job of giving Rhodes a no-nonsense military edge that's needed and Rockwell achieves a great balance of sleaze and naiveté' with his run as rival weapons creator Hammer. But the show once again belongs to Downey, who, like Christopher Reeve decades before was the perfect Superman, has made the role of Tony Stark totally impossible to imagine without him playing it.As for the two women in the movie...they both come across adequately...Paltrow plays Potts with the right amount of concern and seriousness, while Johanssen gives her mysterious "Natalie" just enough edge to stay interesting but not much more.The only minor missteps may have been forcing the whole "SHIELD/Nick Fury" subplot into this story...it was one thing too many for this already crowded movie. Having "Agent Coulson" dispense with any of that plot would have been enough...it would have been more interesting to see more of the Rourke character in the story. As it was, Rourke was almost like another special effect...shown just enough to intrigue and wow us, but not much more. One really good thing with that though was how much of his character was communicated through design, from his intense body ink to that incredible power harness for his whips, there is a brute strength to him that just screams off the screen...that visually arresting image of the coveralls burning off his body as the whips crackle to life was one of the best moments in the movie.As it stands, this installment really feels like the middle of something...here's hoping Favereau and his cast and crew get the chance to complete the "Iron Man" story they're telling...before he gets lost in all the noise of any "Avengers" group one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings back the fun but lacks the substance of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Iron Man was a great film. The action was exciting, the interaction between the characters was great and Robert Downey Jnr was fantastic as Iron Man. The same can be said here but the film has something that stops it from being as good as the original. Its like they made the perfect sequel but it wasn't long enough so they filled it up with lots of unnecessary scenes that slow the film down and edited out Mickey Rouke's scenes.That said there is a lot to like here. Fans of the original will enjoy this but from what I've heard the producers rushed the director to make this in two years instead of three, which is a shame. Mickey Rouke does a great performance as Whiplash and when he has a chance to show it, he is ruthless. He kills people but we only get to see the blood on his hands from after the fight leaving it for us to imagine the actual fight itself. He is the best thing about this film and its a shame that he has such a limited screen time as he is involved in the best action scene of the film set in Monaco.Other supporting cast members include Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer who is good in places but I felt that they could have given him more to do because it is clear that he is immersed in his role completely. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Rhodes and does a good job as well. Scarlett Johansson has some great fight scenes but again they could have used her more as well. Gwyneth Paltrow gives another good performance but sadly she was in many of the scenes that could have been edited down.Another problem for some people is the advertising of the up-coming Avengers film. This is more time that could have been spent developing the villains of the film. There are also a lot of reference to it such as Captain America's shield. There is also a fight scene in Tony's house that was silly and you were not sure who you were supposed to be supporting and also do we really need to see Tony drunk, shooting empty bottles of champagne at a party? Tony is meant to be different to other superheroes but there are scenes like this make him less likable. However as mentioned earlier there is a lot to like and it comes towards the end of the film. The final action sequence is enjoyable (even though hundreds of people would have died) and had everything you would expect to see in an Iron Man film. There is also a lot of funny dialogue between characters, which keeps this enjoyable. I only hope that the next one fixes the problems from this and features what everyone loved from the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After almost waiting for two years, we finally saw one of the most anticipated movies of 2010.To begin with, this movie fell short to be a masterpiece if compared to its predecessor. Back in 2008 'Iron Man' had amazed the critics as well as the movie buffs across the globe because of its sheer story and superlative action; thus raising the super hero genre movies to monumental heights. It was inherent for us to have high hopes of its next title.For those who are still having doubts on this, I would certainly urge everyone to watch this film in the big screen. 'Iron Man 2' practically starts after the events we saw in the first edition. Tony Stark's revelation of being 'Iron Man' has prompted the United States government for asking him to surrender the technology for better cause. Here Stark meets his new adversary Ivan Vanko a.k.a 'Whiplash' enacted by Mickey Rourke who seems to have a personal motive for seeking vengeance. Apart from this we are also shown some new developments in Stark's life which I wish not to disclose here. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man had been the best choice made by director Jon Favreau; his charisma and acting talent had alone made the first movie such a success. Apart from some of the similar faces we have seen earlier, this time Don Cheadle as Lt. Colonel James Rhodes proved to be a worthy addition to the title. Personally I feel it would have been nice if Rourke's character was given some more attention because being the foremost antagonist of Iron Man his legacy seemed to be too short lived.'Iron Man 2' have concerted more on the drama elements than on the action possibly for making grounds for the future movie on 'The Avengers'. As an advisory note if anyone is planning to watch this movie only for its adrenaline pumped action then it might be little bit disappointing, as the sequel is not having much action so to say like its forerunner; however whatever action was there it was top notch and equally commendable.To finish with, this movie lives up to its expectation as I had said earlier, only I hope in its next title they balance the story with some more action. This is surly not to be missed in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call Him Irony Man?.the Name Fits Downey's Clever Approach to a Tortured Superhero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inevitable sequel to the 2008 smash proves once again the perfect fit between actor and character as Robert Downey Jr. plays the title role with his rakish wit and deep sense of irony fully intact from the first film. Sharply directed once again by actor Jon Favreau and shrewdly written by another actor, Justin Theroux, the 2010 blockbuster is as much an actors' showcase as it is a special effects-saturated comic book adventure. This precarious balance is what made the first film so ideal, and while the surprise element has been replaced in part by a breezy familiarity in the sequel, the result is still far more entertaining than most in its genre. This is despite the fact that the movie is overpopulated with colorful characters, most worthy of a film of their own.Overkill is a common problem in heavily invested Hollywood studio product like this, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As hedonistic billionaire Tony Stark, the actor has to face off with no less than three villains, two figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in distress depending on the plot machinations. The story picks up Stark six months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life.Meanwhile, taciturn, cockatoo-loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is plotting revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit, while U.S. Senator Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes, whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's excessively destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is introduced in an ambivalent manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time. It all comes to a head at the expo where Vanko and Hammer have colluded to produce an aerial battle royale.That's a whole lot of plot to fit into a 124-minute movie, but at least the momentum never flags. The problem for comic fanboys may well be the dearth of action sequences. The showdowns between Stark and Vanko create the necessary tension although the build-ups are rather predictable, and the climactic battle sequence feels more like a swirling meteor shower since it takes place at night. Still, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and art director J. Michael Riva do first-rate work here with the production details. Moreover, the actors do their best even if their characters are given short shrift in the screenplay. Mickey Rourke relies on his own uncomfortably maniacal screen persona and idiosyncratic touches to embody Vanko's two-dimensional motives, while Sam Rockwell is even more cartoonish with a petulant, hammy albeit amusing turn as Hammer.Replacing Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle does what he can as the put-upon best friend and archetypal soldier, but Rhodey has to represent the film's most thankless role. A surprisingly cast Garry Shandling brings a nice edge to the avuncular senator, and Favreau himself repeats his role as Stark's loyal chauffeur Happy Hogan. No fool as a director, he gets to face off to primarily comic effect with Scarlett Johansson, properly feline and physically adroit in her black catsuit, as Natalie. Her ball-breaking "Charlie's Angels"-style fight sequence is entertaining if a bit derivative. As Pepper, Gwyneth Paltrow gets more to do this time around, bantering with Downey with Nick-and-Nora-level élan, but the character is near-impossible to believe. Fans, however, will have no problem loving and believing in the sequel, but the pervasive one-liners and the wild zigzags between hubris and insecurity make a strong case to redub the hero Irony Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IRON MAN 2 The Same Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a spectacular start with Iron Man a couple summers ago, one would have hoped for an even better sequel, considering the fortunes of the Spiderman, X Men, and Batman franchises of late, whose sophomore efforts took their series to dizzying new heights. Not so here, although Iron Man 2 is definitely not a step down either. Consider it on par with the original film and as such, a pretty entertaining, well made Marvel Comics screen entry, and it boasts another strong performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the hero.Picking up where industrialist genius, Tony Stark, reveals himself to be Iron Man, the folks in Washington D.C., namely the military and Congress want the technology. He defies the Senate panel by declaring the armor as private property that has brought world peace. Stark's competitor, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is desperate to claim the military's approval for armored weaponry. Stark's main girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is trying to help him run Stark Enterprises despite Tony's childish antics and thrill seeking. His buddy, Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle taking over for Terrence Howard), is under pressure by the military to get the Iron Man technology. A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson), has a mysterious background. All this as Starks' blood is beginning to get poisoned by his ebbing, artificial heart.Enter the Russian, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father was snubbed by Stark's dad. He has developed a body armor that has electric whips, while Hammer provides him the resources to exact revenge. Stark must come to terms with the distant relationship with his late father as he desperately searches for an answer to his failing heart. As Hammer presents his new military hardware to an audience, Ivan and Tony engage in a battle royal.What the filmmakers needed to do (and could have done a bit more) was to let Downey carry the film on his shoulders; he's certainly earned the right to flex his acting muscles after Iron Man. Here, he shows off his flair for being a bad boy whose arrogance is matched by his tech savvy, and he is a hero confronting his inner demons and pain which are directly related to the fallout with his father. It is interesting how poppa Stark is portrayed in newsreel footage as a kind of Industrial version of Walt Disney complete with a topographic industrial plan instead of a theme park.Downey and Paltrow have good repartee and a smooth chemistry even when they argue. The dialogue is snappy and at times funny courtesy of screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) and director Jon Favreau who still knows how to convey the fantasy world of super heroes, and there are enough twists and surprises to keep things humming along.Rourke is sufficiently menacing as Ivan, spouting Russian and a dark, defiant persona. Samuel Jackson repeats as Nick Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., a secret organization that is attempting to assemble 'The Avengers Initiative'. Johansson is on screen too briefly but there is a nice payoff where she comes through in fine form, or should I say fighting form. As a US Senator, comedian Garry Shandling is stunt casting but proves a bit of a distraction; you just can't take his character seriously. Marvel co-creator Stan Lee makes another brief cameo, and Favreau is amusing in a larger supporting role of Happy Hogan.Special effects are impressive and ably serve the story. That suit of armor still wows and functions in true comic book form. There is a familiar, circular prop that appears in a crucial scene that Marvel fans will want to note! Stunt work and the fight choreography that involves Johansson's character is fun to watch but you wish there were more.Favreau has shown a knack for comic heroes, but he has not made the big step to improve on his franchise. Perhaps in Iron Man 3 he can break the curse that has plagued super hero franchises that fell down in their third films. By the way, do stay after the credits for an interesting clip that hints at the ever growing Marvel Universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the same humor as the first movie! I loved the villain. Mickey plays whiplash so well i believed he was real not fictional! Whiplash is a way better villain than Iron-Monger! Whiplash actually had humor and seriousness at the same time. Warmachine also makes his first appearance and he's a bad-a**! I love the scene when Rhodey fights Stark while in Tony's mark 2 suit.The humor was just as great as the humor in the first one. When Stark finds out what is keeping him alive is also killing he goes crazy at his b-day party, which leads Rhodey to get in the suit!I do feel that there is too much action and fighting scenes in this movie. In the original there wasn't many fight scenes. There is too many explosives and action. After a few fight scenes i get worn-out, but i do love the race scene with Stark and his suit-case suit! Some fight scenes are cool others aren't!All-in-all this is a movie that is worth watching twice in theaters and buying the DVD. If tickets are sold out see Robin Hood, because its just as good as Iron Man 2, if not better! *note* stay after the movie for a look at the next marvel movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally I have seen Iron Man 2, an as I expected I loved it.Now for anyone who has been in an underground bunker for the past couple of years this is the second instalment of one of Marvel Comics biggest franchises. Directly following on from the first film we join Tony Stark with his life filling up with a whole host of new problems.The ever brilliant Sam Rockwell is a rival arms dealer, who is envious of stark and his business. I've always loved Rockwell from when I first saw him in Galaxy Quest and wonder how he is not a bigger star, especially after watching his solo turn in Moon.Mickey Rourke is out for vengeance as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash a genius physicist who believes the Howard Stark, Tony's dad, stole his arc reactor idea, the piece of kit that keeps Tony alive and powers the iron man suit.Don Cheadle steps into Terrance Howards shoes as best friend to Stark, Jim Rhodes. I originally wasn't happy to hear that Howard would not be returning for the second film, but Cheadle is a more than capable replacement and makes the part his own.I was afraid before I saw the film that it was going to suffer from Spiderman 3 syndrome by featuring too many characters to fit into one film, but it really doesn't allowing each their own screen time with solid character development.Director Jon Favreau has beefed up his cameo from the first film into something of a supporting role and you can tell he was having fun during the making , by giving himself some great comedy moments.The star of the show, Robert Downey jr. puts in another charismatic turn in his most natural role to date. It may not be his best but being Tony Stark comes so easily to him.There are a number of geek out moments if you are a comic book fan or used to watch the cartoon, mainly the suitcase suit moment as Stark used to carry his suit around with him so he could become Iron Man at anytime, and they have worked this into the movie. Also there are a few, seven to be exact, obscure hint towards the imminent Avengers movie. As always with Marvel movies stay after the end credits and you shall be rewarded.I knew before seeing this film I would love it and although it may not be a 10/10 film such as The Dark Knight it is a lot more enjoyable and accessible.For more reviews please view my blog at; http://alansmitheejrmovieblog.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a great all round movie, with something for everyone. It has the witty humour portrayed fantastically by great actor Robert Downey Junior and the Action that is expected from any superhero movie.One of the things I like about the film is that it manages to get the story across very well and it still manages to incorporate an different side to the story. I do think that the writers at marvel have tried to bring to many characters into the movie, they have tried to use iron Man 2 as an opening for more sequels and other marvel movies. In doing so they have neglected some of the story that would have made the film better.Overall Iron Man 2 is a good family movie and is worth going to watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rhodey, get down!" And with those words, a one-second effect, a secret Iron Man weapon that was so stunning and so unexpected and so well rendered, forced the audience to make a noise I'd never heard a group make before: A cross between a gasp for air and a Scooby Doo "gewuhhhh???". For a moment, the Chicago reviewers sitting shoulder to shoulder with laymen Q101 contest winners?they (we) were all children again.That moment was enough to make up for the Iron Man bathroom humor scene that?and I'm not making this up?serves as a primary conflict to drive the movie's plot forward.Still, it's basically impossible not to enjoy the film. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Garry Shandling?these are what Iron Man 2 considers bad guys?a group of actors who are so entertaining unto their own right, it takes their unquenchable thirst for the blood of Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson to balance any semblance of screen karma.Once you're aware that's the tone?a shift from the oft-intense Iron Man 1?the little things, like completely disconnected setups for movies to come, glossed pseudo science and the most artificially extended protagonist romance since Dawson's Creek Season 4 won't get to you so much.The visual effects are sequelfied, too. Stark's Jarvis lab interface is celebrated to masturbatory limits (and I mean that in the best, best way), Whiplash's electric attacks are not quite like any other effect I've ever seen, the Iron Man briefcase transformation is still unbelievable after watching it about 20 times (I swear that 1/4 of the movie is dedicated merely to the setup of that moment?which is a completely valid use of screen time) and there are many robots Personally, I'd have preferred less of the fighting to take place from telephoto distances in the cover of night, but such is the case with larger scale fights?it's hard to frame an Iron Man centerfold when the guy is battling a small army rather than merely assembling his suit for the first time, tweaking thrusters while floating around his garage.But I'm using too many words. This is what you need to know: Iron Man 2 is not as good as the original Iron Man, but don't be so worried about some of those early, negative reviews?it's worlds, worlds, worlds better than Transformers 2, Spiderman 3 or some other franchise-devastating catastrophe. You'll still enjoy the movie a ton. Go see it already (opens midnight tonight in NY/LA/CHI, tomorrow everywhere else), just don't deconstruct it afterward.Also, Jon Favreau, I know you've taken some crap for your cameos, especially your personal extended fight scene. Don't listen to the haters. You gave us Iron Man, and if you like getting your ass kicked on camera, who are we to question that you've earned it. Also, the Swingers audio reference?you know the one?that was money</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't it Ironic? I don't think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are plenty of rough spots to iron out in "Iron Man 2". I did not feel the super charismatic powers in this one as I did in the original. Not to say that the sequel was a total disaster, but there were some narrative elements that Director Jon Favreau and especially actor-turned-screenwriter Justin Theroux should have unwrinkled in this mediocre sequel. In this ironic chapter, Tony Stark (of course Iron Man himself) becomes a narcissist iron-tuned man machine in arrogantly telling the world that his iron weaponry is the country's main armed defense and they are helpless without him. Starks then faces new super challenges in being a identity-revealed super hero: competitive corporations try to develop their own ironisque design suits, his mechanical heart is causing his blood toxic level to rise, he faces pressure from a jealous U.S. Senator, is obsessed in pursuing his deceased father's vision to become a reality, and delegates his CEO executive powers of Starks Enterprises to his right-hand woman Pepper Potts. Of course, Iron Man does encounter new enemies. Those would come in the form of an avenging Russian named Ivan Vanco, who has constructed a miniaturized arc reactor of his own including whip-like attachments harnessing the electrical energy. And also the garrulous &amp; obnoxious Justin Hammer, a CEO corporate rival who desperately tries to hammer out a super iron suit of his own to no avail. Starks' BFF Lt. Colonel James Rhodes does return in this installment in taking the high road on becoming an armed super hero of his own, in order to help Iron Man not to dive into a colossal downfall. We also get some spy eye-candy in this one with the gorgeous Natalie Rushman, Starks new assistant who may or may not be the Rush woman she claims to be; and there just might be another limelight to her persona. Robert Downey Jr. was again stellar as Starks/Iron Man, so I am down with him still playing the armed superhero. Gwyneth Paltrow as Potts lost some of that Potts' thespian high that she embodied in the first installment. Mickey Rourke did kind of wrestle with his underdeveloped role as Vanco. The undervalued Sam Rockwell did rock once more in the acting arena with his performance as the determined Hammer. I felt kind of cheated with Don Cheadle's flat work as Rhodes; Terrence Howard was more divine in the Rhodes role in the predecessor. I was elated that there was a casting trip to Johannsonburg by having the stunning Scarlett Johansson portray Natalie Rushman/Black Widow. I do credit Favreau for enterprising some challenging direction to "Iron Man 2", but this "just in", Justin Theroux's immensely chatty screenplay was too much talk and not enough creative bite. There were way too many mumbling elongated conversations in "Iron Man 2" which provided a mechanical restlessness in its viewing audience. So I am bit in the red with "Iron Man 2" but I am still down with Downey. *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action scenes are good, and that is just about it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone likes action in a film, in fact, many people dislike films with no action. Therefore, Iron Man 2 takes full advantage of how much people like action in films (as Transformers 2 did). But, if I am honest, the action was the only good part of the film.For a start, if anything there is too little action, it is almost as if, the film makers were in a rush to get through them, the final action scene for example, did let the film down a bit. Mickey Rourke (who potentially could have been excellent) was not taken to full advantage in the film, in the final scene, he is killed in a matter of seconds, the fight was almost effortless.And this 'effortless' fighting seems to continue throughout the film, the viewer never gets the impression that Iron Man can die, and when he was closest (the power source thing in his chest that was slowly killing him)to death, he quickly finds a solution preventing it.And so, the highlights of the film were the action scenes (even though they were limited), the scenes with Mickey Rourke and the scenes with Scarlet Johansson (come on, we all know why she was given a role).And so, the film was quite disappointing, however, it did have its moments, it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More 'Marvel Universe 0.5' than 'Iron Man 2'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowhere near as good as the first one, but enjoyable nonetheless. It's patchy and talky and Tony Stark spends much more time out of the suit than in it, but I still liked it. I can see why it's getting some poor reviews, it's all over the place with (too?) many characters and slows down in the middle. I think if you're not that familiar with the Marvel Universe you could find it confusing and maybe even boring. The thing I really enjoyed about this movie was that all the disparate events and characters go towards starting to define a cohesive movie version of the Marvel Universe. One of the things that has bugged me about superhero films in the past is that they try to occur in 'the real world'. The Hero is usually the only hero to exist, and only enough super-villains exist for the hero to vanquish in 2 hours. But these stories were never meant to work in the real world, they should be told within the context of a world of Marvels; a world of powers and magic, of super-spies and secret organisations, of advanced technology, miracle elements and mystical weapons. Iron Man 2 attempts this, but arguably at the expense of it's main character and a tight stand-alone script. The fan-boy in me likes the film for trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as "Iron Man", but good enough to satisfy me after a two year wait.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for "Iron Man 2". But as time passed and the film was released a week early in Europe, I forced myself to erase those high hopes to make the movie enjoyable and not painful to watch due to what the early reviews had said. Let's just say it was a good thing my expectations were lowered."Iron Man 2" starts right off the bat in Moscow, Russia with Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) sitting at his father's, Anton Vanko, deathbed. Anton passes and Ivan, in his state of grief, begins constructing an exoskeleton suit using blueprints to the Ark Reactor. Next we see Iron Man, A.K.A. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), jumping off a plane and landing in his expo. It looks like it's all fun and games until we soon discover that the thing in Stark's chest that's keeping him alive is polluting his blood and is slowly killing him. Soon, the government wants Stark to hand over Iron Man to the United States because it's considered a weapon. If you think that that's not a lot on Tony's plate, wait until you hear this: He is attacked and nearly killed by the bloodthirsty Ivan Vanko on the Monaco raceway who was focused on killing him. Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) happens to see the whole event and takes Ivan to help him create an army of drones to beat his business rival, Tony Stark. However, Ivan had other plans in mind. After the Monaco scene (which was quite awesome), the movie starts to hit a rough path and begins to go downhill. But towards the end of the film, it went back up and went smooth sailing. There was a great performance from the cast (especially Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). Don Cheadle, who replaced Terence Howard from the first movie, as James Rhodes/War Machine did a fantastic job; a lot better than Howard. Scarlett Johansson was super sexy as Black Widow ('nuff said). It was also good to see Jon Favreau have more screen time this time around. I also have to give congrats to Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. This movie was better than my low expectations. I hadn't been expecting what this movie brought and I thoroughly enjoyed it. But for me, the best thing about the movie was seeing Ivan change from Whiplash, to bad "A" Crimson Dynamo at the end of the movie for the final fight (who is my favorite Iron Man villain next to Mandarin). My thoughts were raised about this film and it now sits on the throne with all the other greatest comic book movies. "Iron Man 2" did not soar as high as it's predecessor, but it's not low enough to be shot down. 7.5/10P.S. Stay after the credits if you want to see Thor's Mjolnir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man ranks as one of the best movies made about a Marvel superhero to date. It was going to be a difficult task following that up, no matter what, but a great sequel could have been made had they just taken the time to develop it. But no, money talks, so they rushed this sequel into production and what results is probably the worst of the Marvel shared universe films. That isn't to say it's not worth watching. It still has some good points and Robert Downey, Jr. is most of them. But it has more bad ones. It suffers from the same thing so many superhero movie sequels do. It feels like it needs to cram as many characters and subplots as possible into it. While not as bad as, say, Spider-Man 3 or the Schumacher Batman movies, it's still overkill. They should have kept things simple. Building towards future movies is fine but your first goal should always be to create a good movie that stands on its own.Downey is good, although other reviewers pointing out that sometimes he looks bored is a fair assessment. Mickey Rourke hams it up like you might expect him to. The biggest contribution this movie makes is the addition of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow. Unfortunately, those who like her in the later Avengers or Winter Soldier will likely be disappointed at her performance here. The part isn't well-written and Johansson doesn't rise above the material given her. The rest of the cast is unimpressive. Particularly Don Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard as James Rhodes here. Not saying he does a bad job, just nothing that is noteworthy.Iron Man 2 is not a very good movie. It is watchable if you are a fan of the series or comic book movies in general. But it's a bit of a chore to get through for everybody else. Something I can't say for the other Marvel films to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 ÷ Spider Man 3 = 0 !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. It has the longest talking ever spoken in an action. And ? to make it worse ? very few action too ! Review the action with me : the appearance of the evil man, Ivan Vanko, in the stadium, the fight between Iron Man and his friend, and the climactic fight. This is by any mean NOT ENOGUH, especially in the presence of this huge amount of talking, which made me feel that I was watching a boring and dry chick flick ! Originally, it seems stuffed. The title character has many conflicts : 1) Ivan Vanko. 2) Arms dealer Justin Hammer. 3) His sickness. 4) His fight with the government. 5) His fights with his love. And the way these conflicts were treated, required him to spend most of the time talking, not in action, to be more like the first windbag superhero !Furthermore, the script has idiot points. For instances : in the stadium, the evil man was violently hit by a car, twice, and though didn't suffer any injury later ??!!, Iron Man's friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, fights with him while wearing a super suit, then simply "steals" it to the army, just like that (How absurd !), let alone the matter of the father who hided the secret of the metal which his son would need after 30 years through a design of a city?which was so far-fetched and forced ! The action infuriated me. Its choreography was primitive. It begins to end shortly after, with the easiest solutions. There is not even one satisfying action sequence. Regrettably, it leads to believe that Iron Man is such a weak superhero, with no real powers !What saddened me more was the many talents and qualities around. The movie is a very good looking. It's fraught with strong CGI (hyped a bit, but generally strong), cozy and richly elegant cadres, and radiating image; where everything is beautifully glowing, from the Iron suit to the drinking glasses. (Robert Downey Jr.), (Gwyneth Paltrow), (Don Cheadle), (Sam Rockwell) and (Scarlett Johansson) are fine actors. But they were so wasted, without any catchy roles. See (Rockwell)'s character; he wasn't any interesting or funny. Instead, he seemed like somebody who's on massive cocaine, and acts annoyingly due to it. And I hated (Johansson). She was something moves in terribly tight dresses, and that's it ! This is why (Mickey Rourke), with half distinct character, was the one who stole the show, despite looking deformed by many failed plastic surgeries ! For its whole time, Iron Man 2 (2010) made me weary and uneasy. It reminded me with Spider Man 3 (2007), and I kept asking which one is worse ? Actually, both have stuffed script, many conflicts, and boring pace. And while Spider-Man 3 is overlong with much action, Iron Man 2 is shorter yet with less action. So, in the end, they are equally bad ! If I have one thing to say for Iron Man 2's makers, then it'll be : When will you learn that action movies have to be about action ?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a drunked party you don't want to go to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN 2 (2010)It's so disappointing to say that such a smashing film was followed by a sequel that barely knows how to walk let alone run. Every scene is written and cut like the filmmakers said "Good enough." Even the most laid back viewer would be able to pick up on Iron Man 2's lazy writing and sloppy arcs. The poor choreography and occasional plot holes create too silly of an environment at times, which is supported by some nauseating dialogue. The whole picture feels like one of the drunken parties we would see in Iron Man 2, where Tony Stark is making an ass out of himself: we don't want to be there when we know the man has so much more to offer. The film doesn't fail completely, mostly due to the bracing visual effects and the hardworking cast of characters. It's wonderful to see Downey Jr., Paltrow, and Johansson work together and collaborate here. The comedy that the first film skated on is only found in the raillery between Tony and Pepper. Justin Theroux wrote the "screenplay" for this sequel, I think he should stick to acting or learn to pen some narrative flow into his writing.Rating: 4/10Grade: CAnyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. "I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 has a bit of rust in its metal. It's a bit stiff, and unmoving. Still, it's a OK movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by once again Jon Favreau, Iron Man 2 in my opinion fault to live up to the original movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful movie. It was pretty OK for what it is. A popcorn flick. It just wasn't as good as the original, but hey it's still worth noting. Iron Man 2 was more a comedy than an action movie. Iron Man 2 starts out, with after the events of the first movie. Stark has just revealed his identity as Iron Man and is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the technology. Meanwhile, in Russia, scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to seek revenge against Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr.) as he believes that Stark stole his father's technology. Mickey Rouke as Ivan Vanko isn't a bad choice, but his character had little to no development. While the movie would love to point out that he is Whiplash from the comic books, in truth, he was on film a combination between Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo (the original Anton Vanco). Both Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo in the comics wore more body armor than the guy in the movie. Most of the movie, you see him fail into everything he does. In no way, does I see him as a seriously threat to Iron Man. The movie could have made him sinister, but gladly use him as comedy with a running gag about getting a bird. Also in most of the film, we don't even see Iron Man in action. Tony Stark literally spent the last half of the movie in his basement making the ultimate suit to fight a ton of drones that went out like a candle in the wind. The thing that annoyed me about it was how his father's intention for this incredible, impossible to create super-sustainer type thing that will changed the world, is made in like 2 days by Tony Stark and is essentially used to replace a double-A battery in his chest. Trying not to spoil the whole movie, but I found the ending fights really disappointing. 23 minutes of action in 124 min film is too little for a blockbuster film, far less than Iron Man. Even the middle fight in the film is pretty much pointless as it waste time. It's remind me of the fighting scene in 1988's They Live where the two heroes duking it out for little to no reason just for comedy. I think all the comedy, hurt the story ark for Tony Stark's depression, alcoholic, and poisoning arch. It was never taken serious in many scenes. I was really hoping for 'Demon in a Bottle' like story arc. Sadly as long as Disney Marvel control the movies. There will never be a Demon in a Bottle storyline. Plus, I don't even think Monaco Grand Prix would have allow a clearly smashed, poison and untrained driver Tony Stark to drive a racing car in a race with other drivers. We came to see Iron Man, and what did we get 2 short action scenes, a depressing finale, and tons of Avengers references. So there were a lot of Easter Eggs in this movie, but I didn't get a trip on it as much as I hope. I mark a little bit, I have little interest in it. Back to the movie in hand, all actors and actresses did swell jobs, but the one that really broke out of its shell was Sam Rockwell as Rival defense contractor Justin Hammer. So let me see the bad guy in the first Iron Man was a white business tycoon, using an ethic minority as a cover for their own plot, the second was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, and the third was a white business tycoon using an ethnic minority as a cover for their own plot, true inspiration there. Tony Stark's sidekick, Colonel James Rhodes went through a change, too. Terrence Howard got replaced by Don Cheadle. What I believe is the reason why, was because Terrence was overpaid for the first movie, they slashed his pay for the sequel drastically. Once Howard's agents were informed they were taken aback at the huge pay cut. He back down. The studio had always wanted Cheadle for the part, Howard says. It's weird that Colonel James Rhodes can control War Machine armor so quickly in this film, while it took a while for Tony Starks to get uses to being Iron Man in the first movie. Scarlett Johansson is sexy as Black Widow, but her character development wasn't there. She was pretty much in the movie because she's eye candy to the comic book fans. Talking about eye candy, Gwyneth Paltrow is just there to suck up screen time as Tony's love interest, Virginia "Pepper" Potts. Iron Man 2 had some bad dialogue. Characters often talked, but there was never an indication that a character might actually be listening. The conflict was forced and the plot loosely strung together, there was a lot of filler content than actual story. Even Robert Downing Jr. himself, said that this movie turned out not-so-good (paraphrased) mainly because Marvel had way too much control over it and deleted so many scenes which would've done much to. It seemed too bland to me personally, just pointless action, plot holes and dumb plot elements. In the end, this movie is way better than Iron Man 3, and not as good as Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is let down from the first Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are reading this I'm going to assume you know Iron Man and saw the first movie or at least know of the comic from Marvel.Blah blah blah. Iron Man is typical and Downey Jr is his a brilliant actor; though in this movie, he isn't as sharp as the first movie.The action and CG is as to be expected and yes there are some scenes in the movie which I didn't like but that isn't what caused the low rating.The problem is that Rourke's character is a complete travesty. He is awkward, out of place and not suitable to be a villain for Iron Man. What is his super power? Oh yeah, he doesn't have one.Besides the fact that he gets slammed by a car, not once, not twice, but three times in to a concrete railing and he doesn't have internal bleeding, broken pelvis and ruptured organs???? What were the writers thinking?I think Mickey is a brilliant actor. He was amazing in The Wrestler, but this script is bloody awful and as a villain the entire movie is pulled down to a level of unbelievability which it does not recover. None of Downey's off the cuff jokes, the fun action or the CG helps.Casting - 1 Acting - .5 Script (-1) Directing (-1) Special effects - 1 Believability - 0 Continuity - 0 Fun - 22.5 of 8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man caught me by surprise when It hit theatres back in 2008. Heading in I was thinking how the hell are they going to pull this off. Iron Man ended up being one of the best comic book movies ever, and it was only a matter of time for a sequel.Iron Man 2 is not as good as the original, but it is still a great film and should stand on it's own. We get to see a different side of Tony Stark as he spiral's out of control. We also get to see more interaction between himself and Nick Fury who made an appearance after the credits of the original.The action sequences in Iron Man 2 are spectacular and are a work of art. I was really impressed with the special effect's used especially in the final scenes. The camera angles during the flying sequences were handled very well. Robert Downy's portrayal of Tony Stark is one of a kind and awesome. I don't think anyone could've been able to play Tony Stark as well as Robert Downy which is impressive. Mickey Rourke had me convinced he was really Russian. His performance as Ivan Vanko was Great. He had a creepy vibe going for his character which really added to the plot. Scarlett Johansson blended in really well as "the Black Widow". Her fight scenes were pretty damn good. Sam Rockwell in my opinion stole the show. He was hilarious throughout as Tony Stark's rival "Justin Hammer". He had some good one liners and his interaction with Ivan were awkward and funny. I was hoping for Terence Howard to reprise his role as colonel Rhodes but Don Cheadle did a great job as a replacement, so that did not bother me as much.The original Iron Man will be hard to beat as the bar was set so high, however for a sequel, Iron Man 2 is a great follow up. I felt that the action sequences were a lot better compared to the original, It's weakness was the storyline and plot which at times seemed clustered and can confuse you. Still, those little problems did not hinder my enjoyment and I thought Iron Man 2 was solid followup to the original.7.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another flash-bang-wallop of a Marvel feature in the now continuing saga of Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man, this is equally as exhilarating as its predecessor. The suit is still the star for me, my main objection being that old metal-head's screen-time is reduced greatly by the increasing focus on the troubled Tony Stark, who besides a worsening poisoned-blood situation (caused by his palladium-based artificial heart) which threatens to kill him, suffers rock-star excess, over-drinking, the approbation of colleagues and lovers, the chiding of S.H.I.E.L.D recruiting officer Nick Fury, disputes with a confrontational congressman, continuing rivalry with smooth operating megalomaniac Justin Hammer, oh and daddy didn't love him either - all of that before Mickey Rourke's Whiplash enters the scene.So, quite a lot going on then, which with so much character development, gives the likes of Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Sam Rockwell (the latter, the real show-stealer here) the chance to act and interact, although Don Cheadle seems very ill at ease as pressed-into-action hero-or-villain War Machine and Rourke gets to mumble and mutter a lot in a heavy Russian accent. Scarlett Johanssen, provides energy and sexiness as martial arts expert Black Widow, obviously laying down a marker for the Avengers movie to come.The action sequences are a little hit and miss for me, the first fight between Iron Man and Whiplash being the most memorable, but the later flight / fight with Whiplash's drones is all just lights in the sky and the final reckoning with Whiplash over and done with too quickly. Punctuated by a mainly heavy-metal (geddit?) soundtrack, this is one film you won't be easily able to ignore. How long it actually lives in the memory is a different matter entirely, sort of like reading a comic-book I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Iron Man 2" a movie about the same Tony Shark character, a spoiled rich heir of a big corporation developing the weapons of the Future where he is now known as the Iron Man. The actor Robert Downey Jr. is the Iron Man and Mickey Rourke is the villain who is the son of a Russian scientist who worked on the project with Tony Shark's father when they developed the Iron Man, so now he is in states to fight against his father rival and also he is very good. But not good enough, and in the end Iron Man wins and he is proving again that nobody can beat him. I liked the fighting scenes with Scarlett Johansson where she was like a ninja in black and very fast and agile knocking down her many adversaries as a secret agent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 1 was entertaining, with a plot that made sense in it's own terms. IM2 sadly, but unsurprisingly for big studio remakes these days, mostly dispenses with plot, and just goes with the effects. Gwyneth Paltrow tries hard, as does Mickey Rourke. Don Cheadle walks this one, and Robert Downey Junior seems fed up to have to be here, and just goes through the motions in a sulk - I don't blame him given his script. The effects are OK, but not enough to carry this film. Not even worth renting, almost whatever it ends up next to in the budget section of your local store will be far better fare. Sad, given the useful talent. I rarely end a review like this, but you won't regret giving this movie a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 Rating: C+ So I think Iron Man 2 is going to be one of those movies that I need a repeat viewing to really appreciate, but I'll give you what impressions I got from my first viewing. Iron Man 2 felt like the screenwriters couldn't choose between two ideas so, instead, decided to throw them both into one movie. Both ideas had the potential to be really good, but the movie felt a bit disjointed with the two major plot lines feeling underdeveloped and separate rather than feeling unified and working together as a whole. Basically, Iron Man 2 focused on two things: Tony Stark's struggle to get himself out of a self-destructive pattern, and a rival inventor, Justin Hammer, who is trying to steal the spotlight from Tony. There were attempts to tie the two stories together, and they worked to some extent, but in the end it just didn't really cut it. I think that a big part of the problem is that the two plot threads were completely separated out in the context of the movie. Rather than playing the two elements off each other the film was segmented into large blocks of each story. For about 45-minutes you'd see Stark's personal struggles then suddenly we'd jump back to Justin Hammer and Whiplash and you'd go "oh yeah, these guys are in the movie too." Which brings me to another point: Whiplash. Whiplash has to be the most tacked on villain I've ever seen. It seems like the biggest reason for him to be in the film was to provide a super battle for the climax (which ended up being disappointing in and of itself). They set up an interesting premise in the beginning of the film which would have made for a very interesting story and villain, but after the first act of the movie those motives disappeared and Whiplash became a very minor and bland background villain. I might just be talking out of ignorance here since I've never read the comics myself, but to my knowledge it seems that Iron Man in general had pretty bland villains, and this may be a problem with the films. The first Iron Man movie was great but the villain was underdeveloped and extremely two-dimensional. This film had two villains and neither seemed to really cut it. The character of Tony Stark is very interesting, however, the villains in the series so far have been mediocre at best, no Jokers or Dr. Octopuses here. I feel like I'm meandering with this review, but in my defense it's 3 in the morning while I'm writing this. I did enjoy the movie, the stories that were told were told fairly well, especially the parts that focused more on Tony Stark, and the acting was great as it was in the first one, however this film was disappointing due to some sillier plot devices than the first as well as stories that felt disconnected rather than unified. I think the film would have been better served by taking one of those core ideas and expanding on that rather than having the mismatch of plot threads that exist now. Iron Man 2 was by no means a bad movie, just disappointing when compared to the first. Also, stay through the credits when you see the film, this is a Marvel film after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To much isn't always a good thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know from my above comment it sounds like I didn't like the movie, but that isn't true I it's a really good movie. I just had a few problems with elements in it. Mainly with some characters and story. So before you read on there will be a few spoilers, I might give away so don't say I didn't warn you.First Iron Man 2 takes place not long after the first movie. Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr) is dealing with the repercussions of telling the world he's Iron Man. Mainly from the United States government and rival companies like Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell). Of course this gets the attention of Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke) who blames the Stark family for stealing his fathers invention and destroying his family. Things go down hill from there for Tony Stark. That's it for the plot except Iron Man 2 is a much darker film from the first movie. The story is pretty good except they try to do to much in just 2hrs. That's really my biggest complaint with the movie. I'll explain more in the next paragraph.OK the problem I had with the movie was like I said they tried to add to much in just to 2 hrs. The biggest problem is was the force feeding of S.H.E.L.D. and the Avengers down our throats. Don't get me wrong I look forward to the Avengers movie, but what is the title of the movie...yes it's Iron Man 2 not a Avengers prequel. I didn't mind Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) so much simply because I just love Jackson, he brings life to every role he plays. The character I had the biggest problem with was The Black Widow or Natasha Romanoff(Scarlett Johansson). What a pointless character. Sure I know Johansson is hot, but what was her point in the movie. She added nothing to the movie. Oh I know to force feed us the Avengers, and from the rumors I read a Black Widow movie some time down the road. Now I didn't mind all the Avenger references. There's one evolving Captain America which I thought was great and funny.For me what stole the movie was the acting by the main actors and some of the supporting ones. Especially Robert Downey Jr(who again steals the show), Gwyneth Paltrow(Pepper Potts) and Mickey Rourke. The acting and chemistry between Downey Jr. and Paltrow was great. Then there's Rourke who is reviving his film career one film at a time. He was great as Whiplash, one of the best bad guys in superhero films out side of the Joker from The Dark Knight of course. Some of the supporting cast did a good job as well from Sam Rockwell, Don Cheadle(James Rhodes), to Jon Favreau(Hogan).Overall Iron Man 2 suffers from what many super hero sequels suffer from. It tries to do to much and add to much. That being said it's still a really good if not great film with a pretty good story, great acting and actors, and really good effects/visuals. So this movie is definitely worth checking out and I'll see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as fine as the original, but entertaining enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "Iron Man 2" opens, Tony Stark, the wunderkind head of Stark Industries, has just revealed to the world at large that it is indeed he lurking inside the metallic suit of the planet's latest crime-fighting superhero. But such a public admission comes with a steep price. For now the United States government wants him to register himself as a deadly weapon; a rival defense contractor (Sam Rockwell) is determined to beat Stark at his own game by creating his own army of iron-clad warriors; and an arch-nemesis (Mickey Rourke) from the former Soviet Union has suddenly appeared on the scene in his own superhero getup to destroy Stark in a mano-a-mano battle on the streets of Monaco.As a piece of pure Saturday-matinée popcorn entertainment, "Iron Man 2," directed by Jon Favreau, is, perhaps predictably, a notch or two below its dazzling 2008 predecessor. However, the sequel still has enough quality elements ? most of them holdovers from the first film ? to recommend seeing it: namely, Robert Downey Jr. as the wisecracking, hard-living but lovable boy genius, Stark; Gwyneth Paltrow as his endearing personal assistant, now CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts; and enough funny one-liners to take the edge off of some ? though not all - of the script's numerous plot contrivances. As with the previous film, Downey Jr. and Paltrow achieve a wonderful love/hate chemistry between them, and the cast has been expanded to include Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson (who had an uncredited role in the first one), and Kate Mara as well.The screenplay by Justin Theroux makes at least one right choice by having Stark becoming ever more gravely ill as a result of the chemical he has to keep pumping into his chest to survive in his semi-cybernetic condition. This has the effect of humanizing the character, making him destructible and vulnerable and, thus, someone whose fate we can come to care deeply about. And, needless to say, Downey Jr.'s smart, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.The special effects and actions scenes are impressive, of course, but it is Downey Jr. and Paltrow who once again make the movie soar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun but not as much fun as the first film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 follows on from the hugely successful Iron Man with Robert Downey Jr reprising his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man.This time Stark reveals that he is Iron Man and denies access to companies and the military who demand to know the secret behind the suit. Enter Justin Hammer, a weapons manufacturer trying to replicate the suit and Russian Ivan Vanko who wants revenge on Stark and you have the basic set up. Set among an Expo Stark enterprises has set up and continuing the sexual attraction between Stark and Pepper Potts the film is a lot of fun.Some nifty action sequences including one during the Monaco Grand Prix keep the film moving at a good pace and the introduction of Natalie Rushman adds more sexual fun. Stark is a cheeky chap and the film is laced with some nice humour, with his constant jabs during a Senate hearing or his staff being buffeted about during the fight at the Grand Prix. Downey Jr has fun in this role and so too does Sam Rockwell with Hammer and Don Cheadle in the role of Lt.Col. Rhodes, with Scarlet Johannson doing a nice job as Rushman.The first Iron Man was a really enjoyable romp, with much more humour throughout and it's sequel feels a little tired and flat for the most part. It's also it seems more of a set up for future films based around The Shield/Avengers of which a plethora of upcoming films are hinted at including a sequence after the credits obviously highlighted the film Thor. This might excite some who are fans, but I found it a little annoying, but perhaps if you don't really follow these things, you might not pick up on them.It's a fun film, even if it's predecessor is better, but like many of these films is you don't analyze it too much (like how does anyone fly with that suit exactly and where does all the ammunition go?!) you have yourself a perfect DVD for watching on the sofa with chocolates and snacks, which is exactly what I did.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same...but not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People faulted this film for being good, but not great. What the hell, so will I. Iron Man 2 has all the right ingredients to make a great summer blockbuster superhero film, yet the final product is more of what we already saw, minus the heart. Iron Man 2 has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man fighting off Ivan Vanko, a man hellbent on revenge, as well as a new arms dealer Justin Hammer. For the sake of cramming more characters in sequels, like all sequels do, we also have Natasha Romanoff/Natalie Rushman, better known as Black Widow. Black Widow, or the eye candy known as Scar Jo, adds nothing to the film for me. This was one of my worries, too much going on. Iron Man isn't overloaded like X-3 was, but it was getting there. The story is the classic revenge tale, with Mickey Rourke as the villain. A role he was only given because of his recent career revival with The Wrestler. If you watch The Expendables, you'll notice he looks exactly the same as he does here. Almost as if they were shooting next door and he wandered onto the set. Ivan, isn't that memorable as a villain (looks don't count). Rourke tried his best, but there just wasn't much there in the script. The action set pieces are entertaining enough to appeal to a younger audience. The threat level doesn't feel as big, with the addition of War Machine, again more stuff added, it just felt like we were waiting for Iron Man to succeed. The stakes simply weren't high enough for me to really care this time around.The party scene with Tony in the Iron Man suit, drunk and shooting off missiles in his house was laughable and was just added to have the two character fight each other. Superhero sequels tend to be a but better (X2, Spiderman 2) but this one just dropped the ball a bit. I don't know if the first one set the bar too high or if the filmmakers were just a bit lazy. Either way, we lost out a bit on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's to be expected that a movie based on a superhero comic book would have adolescent appeal, but in a period when even animated films have layers of meaning to draw in adult viewers, this sequel comes across as flat and boring for anyone not enamored of Robert Downey Jr.'s childish and self-indulgent portrayal of Tony Stark.I'll admit I couldn't watch it until the end, but the plot is so predictable I guarantee no one could spoil it for me. It's a shame really to see so much talent and money wasted on such thin gruel. The production values are obviously very high (worth four of the five stars in my rating).Downey, I'm coming to believe, has been overrated as an actor (Sherlock Holmes was also dreadful), but it's a shame to see Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson squander their talents on adolescent pablum. I guess everybody has to make a living.Mickey Rourke is the only one who manages to endow his underwritten role with an enigmatic quality that makes him worth watching, but hardly enough to salvage this film. Enjoy it, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loud migraine-inducing sequel which is made kind of like a two hour-plus music video with enough lights, cameras, and action to keep those with short attention spans happy for a few short moments. The movie takes off where its predecessor left off as Robert Downey, Jr. (in the titled role) has become a major international celebrity, but he has issues abound as the U.S. wants his weaponry for the obvious reasons. Meanwhile, arms producer/dealer Sam Rockwell and Russian recluse Mickey Rourke come into play as the antagonists. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances to obviously set up "Iron Man 3" (I feel another major migraine coming on). And of course we have Gwyneth Paltrow (boring as usual as the love interest) and the usually dependable Don Cheadle (taking over for Terrence Howard who clearly knew better than to get caught in this franchise) who round out the main players in the all-star cast. Yes "Iron Man" makes a load of money at the box office, but critically there is not too much to talk about. Downey, Jr. seems content with playing the ham (think "Tropic Thunder" and "Sherlock Holmes") as his better work ("Chaplin" and "Good Night, and Good Luck.") seems a very distant memory. He has fun with the material and runs with it, in spite of the fact the substance is lacking in most cinematic areas. The screenplay is wishy-washy and Jon Favreau's (who also has a substantial acting role) direction does nothing to help in the end. Much like the original, this one is just a loud clunker that makes you root for the bad guys who keep up the intensity with their witty one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humor. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark in Iron Man 2 and brings all his wit and charisma he brought to the first Iron Man. Iron Man 2 has all the exciting battle scenes and clever dialogue Iron Man did and even manages to make it better than the first.In Iron Man 2 Stark has to face off against the government for the rights to his own Iron Man suit while defending his life from new super-villain, Whiplash (Mickey Rourke).This film delves deeper into the character of Stark than the first film did. Stark's hidden alcoholism begins to come into play and Stark's relationship with his assistant, Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), is expanded on.The premise of this movie isn't impressive. Whiplash is the son of a contemporary of Stark's father, Howard. Whiplash feels his father was forced out of business with Howard unfairly which is why he had to die in poverty. Whiplash is just the genius that Stark is and with the funding of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of Stark's rival company, he builds his own suit to rival the Iron Man suit.But Stark doesn't have to fight Whiplash alone. He has his old friend, James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), to help him. Rhodes steals an iron man suit from Stark and makes a few modifications and to the joys of comic fans everywhere enters War Machine. Iron Man 2 is nothing new for super-hero movies but it manages to prove that super-hero movies are not all bad. Iron Man 2 is just plain fun. The dialogue is better than the first Iron Man and same with the action sequences.Downey is perfect as Stark, no other actor could pull of his arrogant humor as well. The studio made a wise decision in replacing Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle as Rhodes. The two actors play the characters a little differently but Cheadle is ultimately better.Scarlet Johansson is also thrown into the mix as a government spy named the Black Widow. It seemed Johansson's sole purpose in the film was to be the 'hot girl fighting crime' that is stereotypical of all comic book movies. Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, a character who will mean a lot more to comic book fans than the average viewer. This movie has a lot of little moments the die-hard fans will love. Also true comic geeks should be sure to stay for the scene at the end of the credits.Iron Man 2 did what The Dark Knight did and proved that super-hero movies can actually be good film. Iron Man 2 is an exciting ride that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRON MAN 2 (2010) *** Robert Downey, Jr., Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany (voice), Leslie Bibb, Garry Shandling. Downey returns in fine form as Tony Stark AKA super hero IRON MAN in this serviceable yet streamlined sequel to the franchise that has more hits-than-misses yet manages to keep its tongue-in-cheek screwball comedy underpinnings intact. This time Stark is facing two significant threats: Russkie sociopathic physicist Ivan Vanko (Rourke in top-notch menacing mode echoing Charles Bronson) whose life-long grudge against the industrialist has reached its head ? and weaselly competition Justin Hammer (bantam Rockwell milking every oily turn he can) ? and a threat to the global peace he has managed to uphold with his alter ego. Adding fuel to the fire are daddy issues, a diminishing heart source and doubling his pleasure with amiable administrative assistant/right-hand-babe/squeeze Pepper Potts (the lush Paltrow) and newcomer to the fold Natalie Rushman (curvaceous-to-a-fault Johansson) AKA Black Widow) while contemplating Nick Fury's (Jackson reprising his bad-ass/eye-patched hero) offer. Favreau's fluid direction (and comic side-kick theatrics) punctuates the familiar tropes yet one feels some punches may have been pulled (i.e. Cheadle is largely wasted in taking over Terrence Howard's "Rhodey"/WarMachine and the final confrontation is frankly too quickly resolved). But fans will be chomping at the bit for the next installment and/or the promising-to-happen AVENGERS flick.</fullReview>

It simply warrants comparison in order to find similarities. "Oh the 'Dark Knight' was better than 'Batman Begins' and so too was 'Spiderman II' than 'Spiderman I' as was 'Incredible Hulk' than 'Hulk' but 'Superman II' was not as good as 'Superman' nor was any of the 'X-Men' better than their original" etc etc.... While 'Spiderman' excelled with Sam Raimi and cute boy Tobey, 'Batman' had the darkness of Christopher Nolan and composure of Bale. But none of the superheroes have one critical factor that IronMan does....... ROBERT F****** DOWNEY JR.!!Jon Favreau has re-written the IronMan that Marvel created and Downey Jr. is solely responsible for the mayhem. This loose cannon character continues to be arrogant and foolhardy but at the same time, ultra cool at what he does. When it is his time to battle, he is an indefatigable Power Suit that can unleash more weapons from his arsenal than perhaps the US Army. With a shrapnel in his heart, Tony Stark is the flirtatious, hard-drinking, often careless billionaire who has no agenda against evil save the anxiety to obliterate them with his machinery. This IronMan needs no introduction and therefore, there isn't any discovery element to the sequel. Rather, there is an omnipresent threat of IronMan's technology coming into wrong hands; which it does. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the Russian physicist son of Anton Vanko (who partnered with Tony Stark's father before they had a fall out over a new technology) seeks revenge for his family's ruin and as Whiplash, he boldly and brutally interrupts the Monaco GP, challenging Stark for an impromptu duel. But Little did he know about that briefcase.... Stark's competitor, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) subsequently plans the escape of Vanko from prison to give him a playground where he could create an army that would overpower IronMan and make billions for Hammer Industries. Lt. Col. Rhodey (Don Cheadle) on the other hand is frustrated with Stark's carelessness but is bound by his friendship with him. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) still tries to balance Tony Stark's life, this time in a professional manner. We are also introduced to Marvel's Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson who plays Natalie Rushman, after looking at whom Stark's reaction is, "I want one!". She is employed by Nick Fury's (Samuel Jackson) S.H.I.E.L.D. that insists on IronMan becoming stronger for his adversaries while they plan an elusive saga of their own. With so much happening, one could get disengaged from the multiple characters and sub-plots but when your seat vibrates with the motion of the incoming IronMan flying into the screen for the climax, all you can do is whistle loud. Hammer's droid army (with a pre-programmed War Machine for Lt. Cl. Rhodey) attack IronMan all throughout the Stark Expo and the final showdown includes the bad-ass Whiplash at his formidable best. With AC/DC rocking in the background, the metal clanging is intense and exhilarating but one does wish for more of Whiplash especially with Rourke's excellent portrayal of the cunning Ivan Vanko. That said, Jon Favreau's sequel to IronMan is by no means a weak film. Performances are excellent, screenplay is absorbing and the action is explosive. It is clear that Favreau and Downey Jr. were simply enjoying themselves filming every scene. Downey's mischief, bravado, recklessness and ineptitude at being composed is altogether great fun to watch. He is as much fun outside his suit as he is inside it and that; is essentially Favreau's strength with this franchise. One cannot watch a full length film on Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker but Tony Stark??! Hell Yeah! While the newer characters and metal clanging may have displeased some fans of the 'Strictly Part 1' superhero movies, it does please comic book fans who get some introduction to the vast world of Marvel Comics with Whiplash, Black Widow, War Machine and.... uhh... never mind the after credits part.... These fans will be mighty pleased with the explosive action and characters while the rest who complaint have surely enjoyed Robert Downey Jr's entertainment. In the end, Stark's courtroom quote sums up the IronMan franchise's core strength and distinction: "I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one". - 8.987 on a scale of 1-10.P.S. - Marvel fans: Stay put till after the credits....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Iron Man 2"Is not that great. But, don't get my wrong. It was good. Just not as good as I thought it would be. The movie has great action. And of course, with that action comes great special effects. The action is not just great. It is excellent eye popping action, leaving you begging for more.The film has excellently delivered performances from Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, Samuel L. Jackson, Mickey Rourke, Gwyneth Paltrow,and Scarlett Johansson giving everyone a run for their money. We also have a large amount of good humor, just as in the first "Iron Man." Although this movie has many great things about it. There are a few things missing. And most likely, the reader of this review, has either seen the movie and already knows what I am talking about. Or You have read other reviews.The movie has a issue with it's script. It's like they had no idea as to what material to use. The film, fail to expand on the previous film before it. And even though Mickey Rourke does a great job, his characters motive is not explained, and you don't really get to see him to much in action as you would expect. With that in mind. Even though this movie is a little flawed, I would still consider adding it to my collection when it comes out on D.V.D. Or if you haven't seem it, to still go out, and see it for yourself.To end this review on a final note. I am just going to simply say that, it was good but, could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Some Flaws, "Iron Man 2" Is A Worthy Sequel and a Fun Summer Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man 2", being a long-awaited sequel, is ready for either great praise or a lot of negative criticism. First, I don't think this was any "Dark Knight", and I don't think it was intending to be another "Dark Knight". I thought "Iron Man 2" was just as good as its predecessor, a fun ride at the movies."Iron Man 2" has a lot of strengths. The plot was consistent, I had no problem with it. I wasn't expecting a big complex plot, so I was fine with it. I liked the subplot concerning Tony's problems with drinking. Ivan Vanko was an awesome villain. I liked Rhodes/War Machine, he made a good sidekick (Even though that only lasts for so long in the movie) and the pacing was very fast. To top it off, awesome action scenes and special effects. The fight scene between Tony and Vanko was probably the best scene in the whole film if you ask me. Also, Robert Downey Jr. was just as good in this movie as he was in the first one.Unfortunately, there were a couple of flaws. The story wasn't as exciting as the original "Iron Man", nor was it as compelling. After the first few scenes, "Iron Man 2" becomes a dialogue- driven film with action scenes inbetween. While the action scenes were awesome, they didn't live up to the very first fight scene between Tony and Ivan Vanko. Also, some of the intelligence in the original was lost. I thought the climax was a bit of letdown. It was a little too short. There was all this build-up to a big showdown between Iron Man, War Machine and Vanko, but I felt the final battle was too short. Otherwise, the climax was still exciting. Also, Nick Fury could've seen a little more character development. Otherwise, well-acted on Samuel L. Jackson's part. There were some other small flaws, but they didn't have much affect on the movie.In short, "Iron Man 2" is a great superhero film with some flaws. It can come off as a big disappointment if one sets their expectations too high. It was no "Dark Knight" in my opinion. "Iron Man 2" lives up to its predecessor, but it feels more like a bridge between the first film and "The Avengers".8.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world is aware that billionaire inventor Tony Stark is the armored super hero, Iron Man. Under pressure from the government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armor because he fears the information will slip into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts and James "Rhodey" Rhodes at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts powerful new forces.It's been about two years since the last IRON MAN film and now, the sequel officially starts off the summer on a disappointing note. Like many sequels, IM2 fails to live up to the original, yet it isn't an entirely bad film. It's just very disheartening to see so many flaws in a film in which the original film was so great.The main flaw of the film is, you guessed it, the story structure. When the film gets to the second act, the film gets into the convoluted territory. There were like five plot lines going all at once, most of which were even unnecessary. It was just a mess and I didn't believe some of the characters' actions. The characters Pepper Potts and Lt. Rhodes seem to be against Tony Stark just for the sake of giving him more problems to resolve.Another problem is the underused actors since there are so many characters, including Mickey Rourke. Rourke could have been a pretty cool interesting villain if he would have more screen time, but he ended up being a generic villain. Sam Rockwell is another new cast member who I didn't seem to care about. Robert Downey Jr. is great in his suitable role as always along with Gwyneth Paltrow. I thought Scarlett Johansson was pretty sexy with her bad ass fighting moves, and Don Cheadle doesn't disappoint.The film also suffers from the role of what SHIELD has over this film. There's just too many references and characters that appear here just to remind the audience that Tony Stark will be in an Avengers movie. However, saying that, the film does have some pretty fantastic action sequences, although there aren't many. One cool scene was in the climax, which was explosive and kinetic.Overall, there isn't much to say about this sequel. The first act and climax are good, but the second act is just a convoluted mess. However, as a summer popcorn flick, it's entertaining while it lasts but is immediately forgettable after the credits roll. But let's be honest. Every one is going to watch this movie regardless of what other people have to say. It's just THE movie to see this summer so I'll just say stay after the credits to see one extra scene. Enjoy it for what it is and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2: Taking place immediately after Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) reveals himself as Iron Man, enigmatic rival Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has some sort of grudge against the Stark family and builds his own unique suit of power armor. Flash forward, and Tony Stark finds not all is roses with his new life. His armor's power source is slowly killing him, and government suits and military forces are demanding the power armor be handed over. I find it funny that when Iron Man first hit the scene in 2008, some people scathingly pointed out the similarities between Iron Man and Batman. Now that enough clear differences have been made between the characters and the original walks on water in many people's eyes, the sequel has been dismantled and hardly given unanimous praise. If you're wondering why I first mentioned Batman, it's because I find many of the complaints critics have made about Iron Man 2 to be the very things they loved about The Dark Knight. Too many supporting characters, too many plots juggling in the air, too dark, the villain isn't shown as much, and the film seems like a set-up for a sequel. Suffice to say that, damn the critics, I had a great time. There is a perceptible change in tone and scale between the first and second movies, but on the whole, I think people want to see the universe a character occupies expand between movies. That child-like glee you felt at Iron Man flying for the first time? Yeah. Look we can't have a second film that just involves Tony tinkering in his workshop again. Sequels are supposed to offer challenges and complexity. Robert is great. He brings believability and gravitas to a larger than life character. He shines particularly in some unexpected scenes such as one where he is trying to win Pepper's favor back (unsuccessfully). Tony really likes his redheads, as he's now juggling Pepper Pots and Natasha (the vivacious Scarlett Johanson). Gweneth Paltrow is sharper as Pepper this time around and seems more comfortable bantering with Tony a la Robert Altman. Am I the only one who notices that her character seems to spend a LOT of time watching shows where talking heads bash the Stark company? Kinda lends a perspective to her typically on-edge persona. Don Cheadle gives more presence to the role of Rhodey than Terrence Howard, and by the end is swingin' one liners with the best of them. It's nice to see the director Jon Favreau on screen more this time as Happy Hogan the driver. Sam Rockwell is over the top and a treat in Stark-less scenes as part-time rival and full-time jackass Justin Hammer. Mickey Rourke disappears into the role of Ivan Vanko, and sans the Batman sequel, there isn't enough of him. He definitely makes his mark in the first third and the conclusion of the film. Iron Man has never been known to have the best villains, but the same could be said for most of the Marvel Universe (About half to two thirds are generic thugs with super-strength) as far as a realistic movie villain goes. I think Jon Favreau did well combining a few choice elements from a few villains and getting a great character actor like Rourke to play Whiplash. I'm extremely interested how he'll pull off the questionably named Mandarin. The story holds interest through what some people might consider quieter moments. Despite many things given away in the trailers the film still has some surprises. There are thrills and laughs a plenty. Some of the action is frankly quite awesome. The film does not close quite as quickly as the first one did, but it still feels wrapped up too soon. There are some cool scenes hinting at the much anticipated Thor and Avengers films, I for one, can't wait. You can't go home again, but you can grow up. Iron Man 2 gets an A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are stupid as hell if they think this is not as good as the first Iron Man or think it is worse... I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in a long time since the first one! I'm 20 years old and I woke up this morning wanting to be Iron man and I wanted to have a black sidekick best friend to be by my side as we kick the s**t out of evil robots that are trying to rule the world.. People say there's too much going on all at once in the movie with it's plot and story but that's not true if they'd read into it a little bit or found what the Avengers and Shield is all about they wouldn't be so confused and they would see how they're trying to setup a awesome movie coming up with all the main marvel characters! Anyways this movie should have a higher rating then 7.7! At least an 8 would be more fair and do not listen to the critics for your newspaper or internet websites unless it's good! The action is great and everyone had great performances including Don Cheadle surprisingly but anyways I recommend it to everyone at all ages.. Go watch this!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glamorizing the concept of 'Privatization of world peace'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 'decent' sequel and enjoyable 'just as a movie' but it lacks the class of Iron man 1. During the opening credits you get all the flashback needed of the previous version which sets a great tone that this will be a grand sequel as the makers have not completely detached the predecessor form sight. Mickey Rourke's character was especially disappointing as it was supposed to be the main 'bad guy; but so much underplayed that it almost seems like the supporting cast. The way his character started, you almost expected 'The Joker' or 'Darth Vader' like feel of a calculated and mean person looking simply for revenge without any materialistic motives but he never lived up to that expectation due to lack of screen time and, mainly a 'Iron man ONLY' centric theme of the movie. There was no meaningful purpose for any characters (apart from Mickey which wasn't screen-played well); especially Scarlet Johnson who was a hot bimbo in the first half and an ass kicker in the 2nd ?. for what she took the assignment.. Couldn't figure that one out. The last undoing was the 'partying scene' of iron man - clothed tony stark who 'entertains' the lady guests with shooting exercise and then suddenly James Rhodes barges in with another iron - man suite to stop him. How the hell did he learn to use it?? In the 1st movie, for the entire 1st half, stark is shown practicing the suite to perfect the usage and flight but this guy learnt it in seconds? duhThere was a point when I thought that this will have an epic feel and a great anti-climax. That was when stark is checking his toxicity which goes on increasing. For a moment I thought the makers want to show the 'vulnerable' side of iron man and he is not a super hero after all; but a great inventor who can have bad days as well. That could have given the movie a new dimension, where the attitude and mental strife of a man triumphs at the end; and not the legacy, where just because the guy is Tony Stark, everything is served on the platter to him (even the secret group of Samuel Jackson to the rescue). In almost all face-offs it's easily predictable that Iron Man will win, so that takes out most of the enjoyment from them. The action sequences are good (only 2 fights ? Monaco and the last one and 1 friendly ruckus though!!) but the detailing of the technological finer details in the workshop of stark is great. But the main part missing in the movie is, well... action. The total amount of action in the movie is probably just about the same as shown in the trailers and you actually are left 'searching' for action between comedies in an action movie. The climax action sequence is over just when you feel its started! This leaves a lot of "could have been more" moments hanging by the time the show endsThe movie is made like a great American bash by Uncle Sam and is sometimes funny (actually it felt more of a comedy ? action movie than a genuine action flick) and (ONLY) when the action happens, it's looking great? 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This wasn't a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was nice look at, the production was smooth and special effects OK. Robert Downey was great but his sarcasm and ego thing got tired after 20 minutes and unfortunately nothing else happened.This movie was way more about watching high profile actors be on screen and underachieve. First Iron Man rocks way better. Scarlett Johansen? Just there to be in black leather and kick legs. The movie got too full of itself, made you not care about anyone and was a detached mess.It seems that nobody is capable of making an action movie these days that even makes an attempt to try to have anything other than special effects or action - All action and no story is old damn news. I thought Tron was great - could've been better but it really held itself together. Iron Man 2, Transformers 2, complete meltdowns.You can say that Inception was an action movie - but I would lean towards "Thriller" with terrific story and action to achieve its goal.Try again Jon Favreau. Give us something better next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumber than Iron Man 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows that Iron Man is Tony Stark (Downey). What everyone doesn't know is that he is dying, but yet he has to find a way to defeat Vankov's (Rourke) Iron Man drones.There is Dumb (Iron Man 1) and there is Dumber, Iron Man 2. This is a CGI show and it's pretty good. But, the story suffered badly from a very bad script especially in the beginning when the audience needs to be grabbed. Much of the dialogues seemed dubbed in, just like in Iron Man 1. Not much had changed. Downey and Rourke come off better than anyone else in the cast. Paltrow seemed lost again like in Iron Man 1. Johansson, while still looking good, was wasted except for some Karate, Kung Fu and JuJitsu stuff if that was really her. Looked good though with those moves, whoever it was. Don Cheadle needs to stop being the second fiddle sidekick, and needs to find his own movie again like Rwanda. He is truly wasted in here. Rockwell seemed tentative in his bad guy role. Jackson seemed disappointed that he couldn't pontificate more. Like I said, this is a CGI show and it was spectacular, but the script really hurt the effort. Again, there is dumb and there is this. Let's all light a candle and hope there is no Iron Man 3. Now, if you are a true Iron Man fan, go read the comic instead. It's far better than anything Hollywood could do.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No hard stuff was heard, but the caption in the beginning saidMild Language, which means you could see the lips form the F-bomb words, but not hear them.</fullReview>

If you'd told me he got the part in the morning and was shooting by midday I'd have no reason to doubt that. His character was stunningly dreadful. As were everyone else of course.Only bright spot in an otherwise abysmal 2 hours of cinematic shite was Sam Rockwell. As ever, he's interesting and fun to watch. The only actor to not utterly shame himself, although, he should still be spanked hard for taking a big fat payday to appear in such a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distracting blockbuster fare but lacks the spark and flow of the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it was of course a summer blockbuster with all the flaws that came with it, I did really enjoy the first Iron Man film for what it did well. It was breezy, light and fun and it made it an easy film to like. I was hoping for more of the same from Iron Man 2 then and it is a little disappointing to find that it cannot quite replicate the same effect. Normally I would not be overly bothered by plotting in a summer action movie but for me this is sort of the problem with IM2. It is not that the plot is bad or complicated, it is just that it seems to lack a flow to it, meaning that it stutters along quite badly, robbing it of the light touch and sense of fun that the first film relied on.We have a Russian scientist out for revenge on the Stark corporation, Stark struggling with blood poisoning from his power source, Pepper Potts taking control of the company, Justin Hammer competing for military contracts, Stark refusing to share his technology with the US military (much to the chagrin of Rhodes) and Nick Fury continuing to try and recruit Stark to his Avengers initiative. In fairness the film is not as "busy" as it could have been with all these characters and aspects bumping around, but it does give it a rather messy feel and the film never feels comfortable until the final action sequence around the Expo. At this point there are goodies and baddies and everyone is pulling together in the same direction and it means nothing distracts and nothing breaks up the motion in the way that happens through most of the film.This is not the same as saying the film is bad, just that it doesn't quite have that fresh feel of the first film. Stark's excesses are overplayed to the point where he is a bit hard to like. The first film balanced this well (thanks to a great turn from Downey Jr) with his wit and character taking the load, but here the first part of the film gets a bit tiresome as Stark is in one glamorous location after another without much for the viewer to "like" about him. This turns around gradually but again never to the point of being as good as the first film. Downey Jr is still good though and he uses his laid-back charm to good effect when he gets the chance ? it is not his fault that this film is "busier" than the first in terms of characters, so he has less time to spread out as he once did. Cheadle is OK but I would have preferred Howard in this role; the former just seems too hard and one-note here. Paltrow is amusing in her minor role while Johansson plays to her strengths by being firey in her hair and eyes while wearing a cat suit ? nothing to say on her performance as an actress but she seems happy being a sexualised action figureen so who am I to question? Rockwell is great fun though. He plays well against Downey and he brings good humour to his parts. Rourke is a nonsense but an enjoyable one, he has a good presence and his character is at least interesting, which goes some way to making up for his rather silly costume. Favreau's appearance in front of costume doesn't do much as his comedy moments aren't that funny, while Jackson is determined to keep showing up in things being "Samuel MF'ing Jackson" over and over again. Shandling and Slattery are nice bits of casting.It isn't an actors' film though and it is mostly about the effects. The main CGI moments are great ? free flowing, well delivered, quite exciting and technically impressive. Ironically some of the "backdrop" effects (like where the cast are clearly getting out of a car somewhere in the world other than where they appear to be) are pretty poor ? not quite 1950's back projection but still they don't look real, although it is just a minor quibble.Overall Iron Man 2 is a reasonably enjoyable summer blockbuster. It has stars, it has noise, it has cheeky humour and all your money is up there on the screen to be enjoyed. Unfortunately for the franchise it has too much clutter in it that breaks up the flow of the film and makes it too heavy to feel as fresh and fun as the first Iron Man film. It will still please the target audience and it will work as a Friday night DVD but the studio's efforts to pull the Avengers together has actually hurt this specific film, making it less enjoyable than the first film by virtue of losing sight of what worked there by piling too much on top of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all cry out for "next episode" films when we've loved the first one; but like naughty children, we shouldn't always be indulged in our desires. Iron Man II's Goliath has made a David out of the funny, quirky first film.Poor old messianic Iron Man. Even Robert Downey Jr's considerable charm couldn't quite overcome the pointlessness of this film, which is a pity: Favreau had a ready-made audience, eager for more; he could have taken chances, had a really punchy script and dealt with something bigger and nastier than Iron Man's glimpse of his own mortality. One newspaper review commented on how "Stark arrogantly states 'I've successfully privatised world peace'", and I agree: it's monstrously arrogant. Whoever wants world peace privatised anyway? Isn't it a civic, national and international duty to help keep the peace? Or is this another illustration of the US's pathological hatred of "central" governance? Yawn. Or perhaps it's just go-it-alone isolationism? Double yawn.Elsewhere the film was teeming with underused but well-played characters: Mickey Rourke's surprisingly effective villain, hamstrung by his crude and ultimately ineffective weapon not once but twice (a scary whip? Again?!); Scarlett Johansson doing a pretty good job considering her "reveal" doesn't really go anywhere (and reviews that say she's just there as eye candy are unfair, she has at least one good fight scene); Gwyneth Paltrow's cute Pepper Potts gone all shrewish ? why?; Don Cheadle and Samuel L, serious acting talent, with nothing much to do - what are Shield doing in this anyway? Much of the story was crowded, boring and inexplicable, and I count it as a bad thing when I find myself actually welcoming another brainless action sequence.I once heard Paul Hogan touting "Crocodile Dundee II", and his use of the expression "it's a good product", was like a death knell. Well, when I heard Jon Favreau talking about this film, although to be fair these press things must be mind-numbingly awful ? he made it sound like just an item on his CV: another death knell. Without passion, "Iron Man II" was always just going to be just a day at the office. Maybe we all expect too much; here's hoping number three just goes back to being good, simple entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Faithful Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thankfully saw this film on opening day, but had to see it two more times before writing this review. Thank the lord, Jon Favreau returns in his rightful place as director. I couldn't imagine what horrors would've taken place otherwise. Then again it is only the first sequel....the trilogy factor still haunts me.The majority of the cast returns, including Gwyneth Paltrow. For a while I feared she'd be replaced, with all the rumors. Robert Downey Jr. is back, and keeps the character consistent with those classic comedic attributes. Well done, but unfortunately Terrance Howard does not return. A downer, but Don Cheadle is up to the task and he does nicely. Also starring is the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, in a role that was all right. After seeing it a few more times, it occurs to me she's almost eye candy, and could've used a lot more developing. As for 'Happy', there wasn't much to him and a rather needless character really. Hammer, however, was very well done and the film couldn't be what is without him. Mickey Rourke is the main antagonist and his performance is all right. Comparing him to Jeff Bridges' villain in the first film would be slander, seeing as he's nowhere near as interesting. The general tone of the film was light-hearted so to speak, really down playing the dark notions of the film concerning Tony's slowly approaching death. It still flows but it's more of a comedy film which is a eh direction for me.The action looks great but these scenes are few-and-far between if you ask me. The Iron Man suit is looking better than ever, my personal favorite being the Mark V. The race track scene was exhilarating although I have yet to understand how Whiplash, an ordinary man, could endure physical blows from that high powered suit. In the first film, a single punch sends a man flying. Well, pushing that aside, the end battle is epic and I really love the drones in action. But no doubt the absolute best-looking in the film is War Machine. An awe-inspiring and over all imposing character, loved his ass. One thing that bugged me was John Debney. His score was all in all decent, but I really preferred the style heard in the first film. Not a major distraction, but one found worthy of noting. In conclusion definitely see it, and I'm sure you'll leave the theater knowing your money was well spent."It's called looking like a bad-ass."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sequel That Did Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two saving graces in "Iron Man 2." The first is Gwyneth Paltrow's wondrous performance as Virginia "Pepper" Potts. Paltrow is literally stunning as Pepper and brings a warmth and depth to this character in a beautiful way.The second is the "Easter egg" scene after the end credits in which we see S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson discover the mighty Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, in a crater in New Mexico.That's pretty much it."Iron Man 2" is boring, trite, and does nothing for the character or this franchise in any meaningful way. Even the battle scenes were not entertaining. Whereas "Iron Man" was fun and exciting and interesting, "2" is the exact opposite and even borders on "Batman &amp; Robin" embarrassing at times, which is pretty terrible.I had low expectations for "Iron Man 2" whenever I saw the first trailer for the film, and it's safe to say that it exceeded (or whatever the opposite of "exceed" is) them in spades.I can only hope that the "Captain America," "Thor," and "The Avengers" films are better. And a word of advice to the filmmakers, reign in Robert Downey, Jr. a little bit next time. Just say what's in the script, Robert...we didn't come to the theater to see a Second City improv performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine comic book movie that relies as much on snappy dialogue and characters as it does fight scenes and CGI. IMO, this is a good idea in that with regard to FX and CGI, we have reached the age of overkill.Another interesting departure from modern superhero films: typically such films increase the number of supervillians with each sequel, i.e., Spidey 3 and Batman Forever having 3 supervillians. But no, Favreau wisely chooses to have 1 supervillian here.Finally, Iron Man diverges from current trends in that he heavily relies, even depends, on his supporting cast. Rhodie, Pepper, and Happy all contribute heavily to Our Hero's eventual triumph. I find this refreshing when I contrast it with the monomania of certain popular heroes. Also, unlike Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, there is no attempt to make Iron Man 2 more overpowering, bombastic, mindnumbing and pretentious than Iron Man 1. No, the attempt is simply to make a movie that is true to the characters and scenario of Iron Man 1, and to make the movie fun, interesting, and exciting. In this way perhaps the Iron Man franchise will be like the James Bond franchise, making each film simply another chapter in the life of our hero, rather than trying to make each film a quantum leap in intensity over the previous.And even though Iron Man 2 does not smack you upside the head every 3 minutes trying to tell you how 'deep' and 'meaningful' it is, there is a genuine socio-political subtext to this film that is plain to see if anyone cares to look. The final message is ambiguous and open-ended, but if one follows the threads regarding the interaction between weapons, money and politics, Iron Man 2 is understatedly subversive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 Rocked the House Down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many things to comment on about this epic movie. Iron Man 2 is sure to be one of the best comic films ever. It definitely was way better than The Dark Knight. The one thing that I especially liked is that they replaced the character Rhodes with Don Ceadle who is a great actor who also acted in Ocean's 11. The fight scenes were great and this wasn't one of those movies where there are way to much special effects that it makes the movie bad like Transformers 2. Mickey Rourke and Robert Downey Jr. both equally give great performances. Jon Faverou makes one of the best sequels ever. I also like that they put War Machine in the movie, which was a original character in Iron Man comic book series. 5 out of 5 for this great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the best thing about IRON MAN TWO is Scarlett Johansson as The Black Widow: her cgi-enhanced fight scenes make this virtual movie virtually worth watching- but it's the lack of any genuine humor (the saving grace of IRON MAN ONE) that makes the running time seem to drag. Downey is capable enough, given what he's given to work with, but watching an addict playing a drunk is hardly my idea of a fun evening. Had the filmmakers opted to say something of substance about substance abuse, one might've been inclined to forgive them the shortcomings of the script (which are legion). Rourke's threadbare role (a reprise, of sorts, of his character in THE WRESTLER) adds not one whit of sheen to his shine: he not only looks like a homeless man, his persona screams it. A true waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man lives again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, summer blockbuster 2010 has started, and what bigger bang than with the sequel to 2008's smash hit, Iron Man? I really did enjoy the first Iron Man, it was exciting, action packed and different from other super hero movies that we see. Most super hero's hide themselves and stay very introverted in their "normal human" disguise, but Tony Stark was something different, he was so alive and colorful and admits pretty much off the bat to the world that he is Iron Man. Naturally he is going to get a lot of challengers in the world and we love to see him take them on as he knows how hot he is and doesn't hide it. So Iron Man 2 is the sequel that everyone who loved the first Iron Man had to see. I admit that I was extremely excited, this looked even better than the first Iron Man. So I got to see it this weekend and I have to say that my friends and I were a little disappointed. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, it's a good one and very much worth the theater experience, but it didn't have the same "pazazz" as the other Iron Man had. Usually most sequels have this part of having to explain the characters, go a little more in depth with them, Iron Man 2 is no stranger to this. Now it can either be good or bad, in this case, Iron Man 2 fell a little short and started to bore me; but it does come back for an awesome ending.Six months after revealing his identity as Iron Man, Tony Stark, has helped maintain world peace. A United States Senate committee, led by Senator Stern, demands Stark release the technology for military application. Stark refuses, declaring that he and the suit are as one while also claiming his competitors are years away from successfully recreating the technology. Afraid of a possible doom he's facing, he appoints his former personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, replacing her with Natalie Rushman. While racing in Monaco, Stark is attacked by Ivan Vanko, who has constructed an arc reactor of his own, along with whip-like energy weapons. Stark defeats Vanko. Afterward, Stark learns that Vanko is the son of his father's old partner. Ivan blames the Starks for his family's poor fate, and seeks revenge. Rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer has Vanko broken out of jail and recruits him to perfect a line of armored combat units he will use to upstage Stark at his own Expo.Mickey Rourke over all does his job well as the main villain of the story, but my only problem is that a lot of his lines I couldn't understand. He has a thick Russian accent that over does it a little too much because I kept leaning over and asking my friends "what did he say" and they would respond with "I have no idea". Trying to be as intimidating as Ivan Drako in Rocky IV(heck, even their last names look alike) it didn't work as well. Scarlett Johansson was a little dull at first but once again comes back with a vengeance in the end as she has possibly the coolest fight scene in the film. Robert Downey, Jr. as usual does a great job, my only problem being once again, in the first Iron Man, he was confident and smooth, this one he was more cocky and a jerk. I couldn't root for him as much with this sequel. But Iron Man 2 still delivers in the action, the effects are just as cool and really keep you on the edge of the seat. There are some good laughs and over all a decent enough story, it just could have used a little more sparkle I think. But I'm satisfied with Iron Man 2, it gives the audience what it wants and doesn't hold back on the action.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the record, I gave Iron Man 1 a solid 8.4, for all the calibers and brilliance it delivered. Now with Iron Man 2 I gave it 7.3. Here are my reasons.1, The comedy still plays out pretty good with Downey's performance well utilized. Though some of the jokes were not as genuine as the original. Jon Favreau's approach of mixing sci-fi action with comedy still works, that's maybe the best news for fans and non-fans alike. Fortunately, they didn't follow Transformers 2's formula "bigger the better" or we will see some serious disasters. We still have these jaws-dropping dynamic action sequences which are well controlled and edited. The F1 track one was definitely one of the best crafted sci-fi fighting scenes, almost with a nostalgic feeling attached to it(light saber becomes light whip?)The climax is as big as one can imagine, but there comes the shortcomings. The first Iron Man was so charming to me mainly because as the movie processes, audiences were sucked into Tony's mind of tech geek and crazy stuffs. The scenes with Tony testing all the parts of his design were pricelessly detailed and looked genuine, like you can touch this technology and really invite it into your kitchen someday. But Iron Man 2 was too busy telling a more complex story, giving up all the opportunities exploring more facets of a crazy inventor. So on so forth.2, Terrence Howard was a better Rhodes, delivering charms by himself or charmed the audiences by being the buddy/nanny for Tony. Don Cheadle feels so serious that he never gave this charming awkwardness as heartfelt as Howard. Beginning with him, I perceived several problems with the supporting characters. Having Scarlett Johnson kicking human asses is a smart move, but she doesn't feel entirely immersed with the Iron Man atmosphere (especially when she fought with security guards while Tony fights robots). The villains, however, are weak. Hammer is supposed to be a genuine idiot, with too much ego and too little brain to be in the pentagon. His ideas are never fit into the Iron Man technology, that's what the movie has successfully illustrated with the climax. With that in mind, one can expect any goofy acts from him. Sadly, he spent too much time on the screen and made him almost like pretending to be an idiot(not mainly due to Sam Rockwell's performance). On the opposite, audiences may find Mickey Rourke much more delicious to watch. He's a total bad-ass with an attitude. Beneath that, he's also a heartless technology maniac(typical villain from Russia). Except the 124 minutes of running time had mostly underused him, portraying him to be someone largely inferior to every aspects of Iron Man(overly obsessed with whip-type of weapons,keep making the same mistake,etc.) Somehow I was expecting him to be the key of saving Tony, but I was wrong because the makers can't wait to get Nick Fury back on screen, and made the story logically plausible but not structurally remarkable.My friend, who also loves movies, remarked that he didn't want to see Iron Man 2 because it's "too predictable as they bring some bad-ass robot toe-to-toe with Tony Stark and Tony wins". I told him that's not the point of any popcorn movies or superhero movies, but I guess he's not totally wrong with this one. Nevertheless, Iron Man 2 still boasts with masterful polishing and will most probably be nominated best special effects by Oscar. Enjoy your party with Tony Stark!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another movie for: the kids, man children, comic book worms, cliché loving public. Everyone else...you're not knowing whats good for ya! This is becoming more and more commercial with each day passing by. How many comic books characters are there? Will everyone get its own movie? I hope not, because Marvel has become stale. It shoves itself on the screen, with the story of some rich guy, army manufacturer, gone berserk and became a guinea pig. In the middle of all that, he crossed a bunch of people including a Russian guy. What? Again with the Russians. Just stop it already. If you can't find a decent villain then maybe you shouldn't make a script. Sure, it was fun like in the comic book during the cold war. I as a viewer don't need to pay to go and see it with my own child and answer him that Russians are bad, because they pointed a nuclear missile in our direction. I don't need to feel bad for my country's politics that led to that, and the picture that stayed in some OLD comic book.RD and Rourke are great actors, but this story could do a makeover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the punch of the first....still a decent watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Iron man 2 with great expectations as i had recently watched the first Iron man on DVD and it had pleasantly surprised me. After watching this one, i felt that this movie too falls in the list of movies following the trend ...see it....enjoy it....forget it. Though it did not turn up as disappointing as some of the recent superhero sequels are but it is not half as good as the earlier Iron man edition. Nevertheless this is a decent watch mainly due to RDJ who portrays the superhero with effortless ease and incredible charm. But the movie as a whole does not offer anything very different from the usual summer blockbuster. The wit and charm of its prequel are clearly missing. Action scenes are relatively less and the characteristic one liners are few and far between. Still it has a lot of "guilty pleasure"....which is a must for any movie of this genre. The Monaco race sequence episode has been done brilliantly and is the highpoint of the movie. Among the star cast Scarlett Johanson is a welcome change and Paltrow too got more screen time than the previous edition. Cheadle and Samuel Jackson haven't got much scope. But as stated earlier the movie belongs to RDJ who should increase his fan base after this movie. RDJ has an great screen presence and had lit up some of scenes by his charisma. The bottom line is that its an average popcorn flick but if you are a RDJ fan then perhaps you shouldn't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Iron Man was a delight to behold. When Tony Stark eventually took to the skies in his fully-operational red Iron Man suit and flew to Afghanistan, the movie took on a giddy, magical feel not seen since "Superman" with Christopher Reeve back in the day. It was so clear what Iron Man could do and who his enemies were.The same cannot be said for "Iron Man 2" which is lumbered with a script that is just dreadful and fails to deliver on every level.Take the first scene between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. The makers must have been trying to do some sort of rapid-fire screwball comedy dialogue but all they succeed in doing is getting the actors to talk over one another so its hard to make out what's being said. What they say isn't funny or interesting either, it's all shallow sound bites.Superhero movies are only as good as their villain, e.g. Doc Ock in "Spiderman 2" or Lex Luthor in Chris Reeves "Superman" movies. The villain in "Iron Man 2" is a Russian called Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke (I hope he was paid well, as it does nothing for him or his career.) Whiplash makes his big arrival in the movie by attacking Tony Stark's racing car with electrified whips. This is a good start but once Whiplash has his whips taken from him, he becomes a very ordinary villain indeed with no other special powers to threaten Iron Man with. He is taken off to jail almost immediately and fades into the background for most of the film. It makes Whiplash look foolish instead of menacing and the character never recovers. His motivation for attacking Tony Stark/Iron Man is also not very clear or convincing, something about his father being betrayed by Stark's father but it's never explained any further(a flashback might have helped).Scarlett Johannson looks gorgeous and tough as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff. She has some killer moves but strangely never gets to use them on the villain Whiplash. That would have made the script more interesting.There is also an appearance by Samuel L. Jackson wearing an eye-patch that seems to set up the long-in-development Avengers movie that teams up the Marvel characters. It's a diversion about money that we don't need, it takes us out of the story when it should be all about getting Whiplash.Then there's the finale. Whiplash attacks Stark again and fails...again (he's clearly incompetent). The resolution is far too easy. There's no twist to make Stark work hard for victory and that's boring.Sam Rockwell, as the other villain, unveils a series of drone-style Iron Men and they gang up to attack Iron Man and his pal (Don Cheadle also in an Iron Man suit) but there are so many flying around at the end and the editing is so rapid that it's hard to tell what's happening. It's muddled, where the original "Iron Man" was crystal clear. That's the problem with this sequel. It feels rushed. The stench of desperation to top the first movie comes off the screen. Better take more care with "Iron Man 3."P.S. Sam Rockwell's dancing is hilarious. It's almost worth another star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a drop-off from the first one!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw IRON MAN 2 over the weekend and thought it was merely okay. Doesn't come close to the original. And I wasn't exactly going crazy about the original one either. The best part was without a doubt the Monaco race track scene where Whiplash makes his entrance. That scene was, in one word, AMAZING!! Probably the greatest entrance of a villain in any superhero movie that I've seen. And the action that follows was equally brilliant! Unfortunately everything else ranged from merely okay to downright baaaad. Tony sitting in a donut was downright cringe-worthy as was Sam Jackson's lame line about exiting the donut. Hardy-harr-harr.. who the heck came up with that one? And the scene where Tony gets drunk and rowdy at the party immediately reminded me of the scene where Peter Parker does the same thing in SPIDER-MAN 3. Yuck!! And I agree with Roger Ebert - the finale was both overwhelming and underwhelming! Overwhelming because of all those hundreds of drones flying around blasting Iron Man with all the firepower they can muster. How the city stayed intact with all those huge fireballs left and right is beyond me. Much less how lucky can one Iron Man get against a slew of such machines. Even by comic-books standards this is really pushing it. But then we get to the showdown we've been waiting for - Iron Man vs. Whiplash! How long does that last? Oh a few measly seconds. Are you kidding me?! How can you create a climax which isn't even 1/4 as great as the racetrack scene. I wish they scrapped all those drones and gave us a proper ending with Iron Man vs. Whiplash. I mean this ending makes the ending in the original one (Iron Man vs. Iron Monger) look like a masterpiece in comparison. And I actually considered THAT one pretty underwhelming - there's just not too much excitement seeing two metal suits clanging against each other.So yeah I thought this one was a considerable drop-off from the first one. The actors were all good (though I still prefer the acting in the first one) and the racetrack scene was superior to anything in the first film but outside of that the story is really uninteresting and bland. And the ending, as I said, was both overwhelming and underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I am not a big comic book fan, nor do I know too much about "Iron Man." I am a big-time movie fan though, and there are certain things that a comic book movie (and basically ANY movie) needs to be successful.And they are: THRILLS... EXCITEMENT... SUSPENSE... STORY... "Iron Man 2" has none of them. How does a movie like this get released without them? "Iron Man 2" has no exciting plot for the hero to overcome to stop drastic consequences. No exciting action sequences to keep us on the edge of our seats. I don't know or really care how much this film keeps to the comic it was based on--if it doesn't have an involving, exciting story, it fails.All of the actors, Downey, Johannsen, Favreau, Rourke, Cheadle, give mediocre, forgettable performances. All of them are good actors who I have enjoyed watching in other films, but seem to just be trying to be cool, hip, and clever in front of the camera this time.This film should have reminded me of the "Batman," "Superman," or "Spiderman," films, but it has more in common with the "Ocean's 11" movies: a bunch of big stars hamming it up, trying to be "cool," and having fun in front of the camera, instead of trying to make a good movie.What does Mickey Rourke's villain want in this film? How will it affect the world if he achieves his aims? Why should we care if he succeeds? Why are there no moments when Iron Man seems on the verge of losing everything? This film is an example of letting success go to the producers' and actors' heads. Hopefully the fan-boys will realize and admit it stinks before more action and comic book films turn out as dull as this one.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely Entertaining, But Slightly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like an unwritten rule; in the world of comic-book movies, No.2's are the best. The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, Superman 2, X2, Hellboy 2; all better then the originals. So it's disappointing that Iron Man 2, the sequel to one of my all-time favourite comic-book movies, doesn't join the club.The movie kicks off where the last film ended, with playboy inventor and millionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity of Iron Man to the world. Little does he know that a Russian genius named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) plans to take revenge on Tony for an old family grudge. Six months later, whilst Tony is soaking up the public love for Iron Man, Vanko strikes hard. This couldn't come at a worse time for Tony. Unbeknownst to anyone but himself and Vanko, the palladium in Tony's chest reactor (the thing which is meant to be keeping him alive) is slowly killing him. Whilst he races to find a cure, he promotes his assistant and love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to CEO of his company, Stark Industries. Slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and oddball rival arms dealer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) are snapping at Tony's heels trying to get him to hand over the Iron Man tech, with Tony's military pal Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard) caught in the middle. And what's up with Tony's new, mysterious assistant Natalie (Scarlett Johansson)? For the first and third acts, this film rocks hard. One minor quibble (why say that the soundtrack is made up of AC/DC songs, then put just two of their songs in the movie?) Apart from that, these 75 minutes are the most sensational fun that I have had at the cinema so far this year. The performances are great, the dialogue crackles, the visual effects are fantastic and the action is electrifying. For those glorious 75 minutes, I would rank Iron Man 2 as one of my favourite comic-book movies.Unfortunately, director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux trip up badly in the second act. There's some action (Vanko's jail break and a punch-up between a drunken Tony and Rhodes in another suit), but this part is mainly talking. Based on the snappy dialogue of the first act, this shouldn't be a problem. But, apart from the occasional burst of inspired writing and some brilliant in-jokes (I loved the Captain America reference), this part of the movie is surprisingly dull, drifting off more than it should and lacking the rock'n'roll energy of the other 75 minutes. Tony's burgeoning alcoholism (apparently the most emotionally potent storyline in the comics) is tossed aside in an embarrassing party sequence, whilst his heart poisoning is dealt with too quickly and confusingly. Plus, Rourke's brilliant villain gets relegated to scenes in a laboratory. The acting, humour, action and occasional bursts of wit save this act. But the energy and pizazz of the first and third acts is gone, making these 45 minutes the spanner in the works which stops Iron Man 2 from matching, or topping, its predecessor.The acting is consistently brilliant. Don Cheadle is an improvement over Terrence Howard. Cheadle's more convincing as a colonel and in his relationship with Downey Jr. than Howard, whilst bringing grit and humour to the part. As Pepper, Gwyneth Paltrow is both warm and witty. The bickering between Pepper and Tony is a highlight, showing the love-hate relationship between two people dancing around their true feelings for each other. As with the first Iron Man, you could argue that Paltrow imbues the proceedings with welcome heart. As Justin Hammer, Rockwell is hilarious, yet he is also edgily intriguing. Hammer is a ratty, strange copy of Tony before he experienced his epiphany of the first film. He reminded me of Venom from Spider-Man 3, except better utilised and more suited to the performer. Rockwell nails the role with his quirky brilliance. As Vanko, Rourke creates a character with commendable humanity. Whilst Rourke could have easily been comic thanks to his exaggerated Russian accent, he instead comes across as an imposing and intelligent character, simmering with barely compressed rage. Scarlett Johansson does what she needs to do in the role of Natalie AKA Black Widow; she remains enigmatic enough for a spin-off to be welcome, and provides a sexy attraction for the men in the audience. One thing that Johansson excels at is her stunt work. In the final 30 minutes, she faces off against a hallway of goons, and the results are breath-taking. Garry Shandling is note-perfect as Senator Stern (he gets the film's last and best line), whilst Samuel L. Jackson brings his usual cool and charisma to the role of Nick Fury, the director of the mysterious S.H.I.E.L.D organisation.But the film belongs to Downey Jr. As Stark, Downey Jr. is magnificent. He is funny, smart and spot-on with the one-liners. He combines super-human energy with a humanity which makes even Stark's most selfish actions forgivable. Downey Jr. is one of my favourite actors, and he doesn't disappoint with this superlative performance.Iron Man 2 is absolutely top-notch blockbuster entertainment for its first and third acts; thrilling, hysterically funny, written with envious wit and brilliantly acted and directed. I'd say that these portions even surpass the first film. However, one thing that Iron Man had was consistency in its brilliance, something which its sequel lacks. The middle act of this film drags it down into the middle tier of comic-book movies. Maybe I'm being too harsh. Maybe when I see it again, I'll change my mind and show it more love. For now, Iron Man 2 is a half-stunning, half-lacklustre film which overall makes a blast of fun at the cinema, and a solid, if not great, kick-off to the summer season of movies. Be sure to stay after the credits for one mouth-watering teaser, which has me excited for one particular upcoming Marvel project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr played the role of his lifetime. i cant think of a more perfect person for the part. I went into the theater hearing a crap load of bad reviews about this movie so i was expecting it to be not so good but hey with an all-star cast like this its kinda worth seeing. So i'll tell you know, i don't know what those people where watching because this certainly didn't suck at all. Robert Downey and Don Cheadle made a perfect duo. Yes some things in this movie could have been different for example i didn't totally agree with the b-day party scene. Not that it wasn't cool but its just not iron man and hes suppose to be unstoppable but yet Don gets in the suit and totally beats his butt. I was kinda disappointed at the ending fighting scene with whiplash. i was looking for a high action packed fight and i got to see about 10 seconds worth of men getting strangled and blown up. Besides those to things, i thought the movie was very enjoyable and would go see it in a heart beat. Being a guy, I enjoyed the most Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow being in this movie. Scarlett's role as the black widow was very surprising to tell you the truth. She did great with her MMA training and the fighting scenes with her and the things she did...wow thats all i have to say. The CGI and the fighting, all the way round good acting i loved it. its worth the money go see it.8-10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and Irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not say that I had very high hopes riding on this one when I entered the theater, but i was looking for a fun movie to watch on a Friday night. But it was not to be and I walked out of the theater tired, irritated and drained out to the core.The first Ironman was a pretty picture: concise, great build up and action and clear humorous dialogs. Ironman 2 is a mess and looking from the current reviews and rating, a highly overrated one too. Things which did not work for me:1. Such absolutely brain numbing chatter between the characters! Was there any script for the lines? 2. Poor characterization, poor chemistry between the leads 3. Poor production quality: Yes! poor! Scarlett's fight sequence in the building was one of the most laughably staged ones in recent memory 4. Absence of a compelling plot: Well i do not expect every movie to be the Dark Knight, but hey at least you can put a semblance of a non- derivative plot?Mind numbing junk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumbled up rubbish. Loud, flashy and boring. I quite enjoyed the first and hoped that the sequel would be maybe half as good, which would render it watchable if nothing else. Am I being too harsh - well when you go to the cinema and you have low to moderate expectations and the film still falls some way short of those... then you're not going to be happy. (a) it's a sequel and (b) to an action movie so how good was it ever likely to be ? I didn't expect a sequel of the calibre of Aliens or Godfather part II, however I did hope that it would be a sequel something like like Lethal Weapon 2 - some decent ideas with a fair amount of filler. Entertaining, watchable but ultimately fluff. Explosions, car chases, gunfights, more explosions, big frickin guns, unlikely escapes, bad guys, even more explosions and a happy ending all neatly wrapped up and presented to the audience. Yay the world is saved again, and we all go home happy.***SPOILERS*** There were several plots, most of which were not properly developed, Samuel L Jackon appears and promptly leaves again, Robert Downey Junior seems bored with it and puts in an acting by numbers effort, Mickey Rourke is rubbish and miscast as a Russian, Sam Rockwell is bad guy stereotype #37, the action sequences are like MTV videos... This was like a film that had a series of different directors who ignored the previous script and devised their own without watching what had been shot previously. How does Paltrow continue to get work ? Who decided to make Scarlet Johansson a brunette ? He can duplicate a process that takes place in the centre of stars going supernova in his garage ? I'll give this a 2 and that's for Scarlets butt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling Stark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Iron Man 2 is kind of like observing a largely bloodless car crash while someone provides amusing narration. The plot is a wheeling mess, but the film is rescued by a lively, screwball script and some sharp improvisation from an ensemble of talented performers. Least amongst them is Mickey Rourke as the vengeful Ivan Vanko, in a performance that belongs to a far darker movie. Indeed, his scenes highlight the film's frequent lurches from breezy to black, which, combined with an apparent explosion at the on-set minor character-making factory, create an experience far less satisfying than its simple-minded predecessor ? which itself was an ideal response to the "darkening" of comic book adaptations brought about by the Nolan brothers.This sequel is best when it focuses on verbal sparring. Because, while Favreau is a competent director, he has people scenes and CGI scenes; he hasn't the skill of Jackson, Cameron or Spielberg at blending the human and the virtual. This leads, after some mecha gunplay straight out of Halo, to a disappointingly perfunctory final confrontation.After it's all over, one is left scratching one's head. What was the purpose of Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), besides laying multiple beds for multiple sequels? Why did Rhodes (Don Cheadle) overreact so dramatically at Stark's (Robert Downey Jr) birthday party? Was their ensuing bromantic tussle the sole trigger for Rhodes' subsequent robo-larceny? It all amounts to an overlong, overcomplicated, occasionally enjoyable disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It feels like Iron Man, It sounds like Iron Man, it looks like Iron Man yet something is missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was eager to find out if Iron Man 2 could become as good or even better than the first entry in the franchise like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Unfortunately it is neither as good or better - a slight disappointment.Without going into detail, the 2nd arc drags on far too long and the character of Rhodey and the Black Widow go from A to Z without any real explanation. On the bright side of things Robert Downey Jr. still delivers the goods.The pacing is way off and so is the supposedly climax of the film. A huge letdown. Marvel didn't do itself a favor by rushing the sequel so fast. I think another year or so would've done the franchise justice.In so many ways Iron Man could've been to Marvel what Nolan's Batman is to DC a hit with the critics and fans alike. With this entry they dropped the ball. It's not the worst sequel - it's not FF 2 (that franchise stinks as a whole) but it isn't X2 either.Jon Favereau is still the man to direct the franchise but Justin Theroux must stay away from it. By any stretch of the imagination he is no Mark Steven Johnson (who completely ruined Ghost Rider) but he just isn't ready or capable to write a screenplay for a Blockbuster of this magnitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was ready to love this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About three days before I went to see "Iron Man 2", I watched the original "Iron Man" for the second time. This time, my 20 year-old watched it with me. She'd never seen it before and loved it--thanking me for recommending it to her. And, considering that I not only saw the film twice (that's very rare for me) and gave it a 9 in my review, I obviously was stoked to see the sequel. Too bad I was so underwhelmed by it.While my daughter said she also liked this film and said Tony Stark (Rober Downey, Jr.) was a jerk like he was in the comic books, I though he was simply a jerk--and perhaps my not reading the comic book made it harder for me to take this bothersome portrayal. Now I am NOT saying I expected him to be perfect--after all, in the first film he was truly irresponsible and sarcastic. But, in "Iron Man 2", you also liked him despite, or perhaps because of these flaws! In this sequel, that likable roguish quality was missing...he was simply an annoying and self-indulgent jerk. Now my perception is not everyone's, I know. Perhaps it's because I am 46 (a bit old for this sort of film) and because I haven't read a comic book in 35 years. Whatever the reason, I found it hard to love the film when I disliked the leading man so much. Heck, while he was very one-dimensional, it was often easier to like the baddie (Mickey Rourke)!! At least he had some sense of purpose in life other than his own misguided narcissism.My other serious problem with the film is the over-reliance on special effects. Too often, the film simply overloaded my senses--as it seemed bent on topping the eye-popping images of the first film. And, while it did this clearly, it did so at the expense of the plot and, more importantly, character development. As a result, I just can't see this film as anything more than eye-candy for the very easily amused and not a film with any serious depth--something that was NOT a problem with "Iron Man". Watch it if you want...just don't expect a lot of magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes Beyond the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? Jon Favreau can never disappoint. Whether he's funny as an actor or artistic as a director. He's a master of his craft and definitely found his niche. He's an amazing director, with an uncanny ability to cameo in his own movies as a great comic relief.Robert Downey Jr., is an actor I've been watching for years. From being sweet and hilarious in Heart and Souls, to sarcastic and witty with an edge of drama in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang to perfecting his ability in playing Tony Stark. Robert is versatile and can go beyond some of the other great actors.Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect female to play Pepper Potts, as seen in the first film. She's funny, she's brainy, and she's sexy. She's got a beautiful face to look at and a sweet voice to hear. Her character, Pepper, takes a backseat for screen time to make room for others, but she still plays a prominent role in Iron Man's future.Samuel L. Jackson, gets a small cameo and Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as a really sexy, seductive, ass-kicking seductress who bounds to keep both Tony Stark and audiences on their toes. Don Cheadle comes along as well to play sidekick and Mickey Rourke is chilling and terrifying as villain Ivan Vanko.There's mind blowing special effects, triple the intense action sequences and give just the perfect amount of comic relief and you've got a sequel that does ten times better than the original. It's not surprising. Iron Man, wasn't bad by any means, but it just feels inferior to this. I can't imagine how it will seem when the third chapter is unveiled.Strap yourself in for a roller coaster ride of a lifetime. It's fun, it's dark, it's full of surprise and it's action packed. It's a great film for everyone. Grab grandma, grab your friends and let's go see Iron Man 2!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming off of Iron Man (1), I really had pretty decent expectations for this movie. It seemed like the writers had their act together in creating a well thought out film that could combine both coherent plot-lining and captivating special effects. Iron Man was never the most popular comic book, but the producers recognized that they didn't need to create an A.D.D. nightmare to compete with the big boys.Boy, they sure f*cked up with the sequel...I understand that Stark is supposed to be increasingly eccentric, and Downey did a fine job of communicating that. But guess what? The rest of the characters were written that way too, which is just too much! Even the bit players are obnoxious and unbelievable. In Stark's Senate hearing session, for example, the audience lets off a hooting of cheers and applause every 10 seconds, and the investigating senator shouts "F*ck you Tony Stark; F*ck you Tony" into the microphone at the end of the hearing. Believable? Hardly. Necessary? Absolutely not. Trashy? 100%. Even superhero movies have to have some element of the plot grounded in reality to make a connection with the audience. Iron Man 2 had nothing.Don Cheadle was a poor substitute for Terrence Howard, delivering his lines without any sense of purpose or emphasis. I typically think Cheadle is a fantastic actor, but poorly done here. Again, the resounding issue in the film comes down to believability. The "willing suspension of disbelief" is absolutely necessary in any fictional work (particularly one with such fantastic future technologies), but should absolutely not apply to actors' ability to connect with their roles, nor to the coherence of the plot.The worst thing about the whole ordeal was that the movie was so terrible that I was forced to leave half-way through the movie, before Samuel L Jackson even made an appearance...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron-Man 2: Stark raving mad over Favreau's folly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All these months of waiting on Iron Man 2 and my worst fears have been realized. You can rest assured that I am not going to glorify any of what I saw because I feel like I owe it to anyone or anything or because I was happy with at least a small part of the movie.This was like Spider-Man 3 or Superman 4 Quest for Peace. It was only a shell of a superhero movie. Why any time was spent on Tony's ailment, is a puzzle to me. Why? Because so much time is spent showing us that no ego is stronger than his.How can anyone care that he is sick? I know I didn't. Nothing endeared him to me. His self centered, near sighted outlook on life made me sick. His overinflated ego is the near death of my interest in this franchise. It is not Downey's fault, although I still wish he had not been selected as Stark in the first place.It had plenty of boom and bang tempered with ooh and ahh. Unfortunately for fans of the noise, it was short-lived in two different parts of the movie. For me, I don't care how loud the noise is or bright the flashes are as long as they are used intelligently. In my mind, that was the only thing that Favreau decided to give the fans, apparently not knowing we are not all like he is. To help you understand how much Favreau disappointed me, his presence on the screen repulsed me. When he decided to put his character in one fight scene, all I could think of was how little he must have understood what makes a superhero movie a good movie. I thought it was totally self indulgent and neglecting the attention the moment required. He just couldn't help but rush to a joke throughout the entire movie. Hopefully, this was his last shot at making a superhero movie. But wow, thanks for making money for the studio, eh? I give kudos to Rourke, Paltrow, Cheadle and Johannson. Paltrow's involvement was upgraded to a different level, showing her strengths just as she should have. And although they never got much of a chance to build much, Johansson and Cheadle made their presence very noticeable with hopes of more to expect in what I hope is a recoup of quality in Iron-Man 3(which would mean Favreau-less). My favorite scenes though were with Cheadle, as the denied friend and as War Machine. He was truly the best part of the movie. I hope Johansson comes back as Romanoff again, I liked her in this role. As little time she had on screen, this was one of her better roles. I think this character fits her fine.Rourke was a great villain. But I felt he was not quite as fearsome as the trailer made me believe. I was entirely engrossed with his character until he died. While his Vanko seemed truly capable of being evil, his demise was almost anti-climatic. His leaving the story made it even more of a disappointment because Rockwell's Hammer was allowed to live. BTW, I never liked Rockwell's Hammer because his character was as much of a joke as Favreua's take on this movie.Getting back to the loud explosions and bright lights, one scene near the end is the best example of why this Iron-Man is a great example for a weak superhero movie. While a large portion of the city is in flames, where is Iron-Man? Why, he is too busy talking to Pepper about her future. Dying children, women and men, ahhh, too busy here, folks. Iron-Man has a thing for this woman. Can't be bothered now. Give me a superhero who can't be bothered to help mankind and I give you nothing in return. I was hoping throughout the movie to see his ego fade away. Matter of fact, I had thought he learned a lesson near the end of the first Iron-Man. Guess I was wrong.4 out of 10 - plain and simple. Suggestion: wait til the DVD hits Redbox. And disregard the positive reviews for the movie itself, it sucked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Compared with his masterworks (Elf) this film by Favreau represents an abysmal decline.It is a piece of patriotic propaganda and hence shows all the deficiencies of the genre, even if the purpose, resisting Capitalistic Amerika is honorable. But it is interesting that this film in fact shows striking similarity to Nazi propaganda insofar it represents the Russians as fair haired Aryans and insofar it praises belligerent heroes.Some scenes with grandiose choreography and design do raise the film above the level of average Hollywood propaganda. Therefore 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Transformers 2. Bigger budget, more big names, more special effects. Less of a coherent story to make it all work.Shoehorn Scarlett Johansson into the plot like they shoehorned her into a leather suit. Not because it makes sense to the movie. Just because it makes sense to the 18-35male demographic. Figuring out how to use her in the movie appeared to be an after though.If you go in expecting to be disappointed that it doesn't re-capture that feeling you got from the first Ironman you should not be too disappointed as it will meet your expectations. Just go in expecting to see more special effects and try hard to ignore the seemingly thrown together scenes and rambling dialog.I think Mikey Rourke gets the award for worst casting here by far. As a bad guy he was utterly boring! He seemed to be phoning it in most scenes. Only showing up at the set to collect his paycheck. This movie could have been much better with a more inspiring bad guy. Just about anyone would have been better than Rourke IMHO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey Jr. Enters Legendary Territory With This Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's clear that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark. As he did the first time around, he portrays the perfect combination of suave and selfishness, energy and ungoverned gluttony, troubled spirit and a soul seeking redemption and responsibility. It's clear that Downey has brought everything to the part. This movie is about Stark's spiritual growth. He's certainly bitten off more than he can chew mostly because of his proclamation to end the last film. He's way overextended himself and now everything is crashing down around him. He really has to dig down deep and that's the mark of a true hero. How can the awards people keep overlooking this part? RDJ as Tony Stark is now the stuff of legend. Think Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal. Pacino as Michael Corleone. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry. John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn. Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone.Tony Stark isn't a mutant or a ninja or nothing silly has happened to him. Stark isn't a cheesy, tights wearing superhero. It's great that he can't jump into a phone booth and be on his cheesy way. He's a flawed man but he's anything but ordinary. This sequel perfectly picks up where the first film left off. Every step of the way is believable and incredibly interesting. All of the amazing effects are grounded in realism. I know they built the Iron Man armor and War Machine armor in real life and mixed it flawlessly with CG. It wasn't all a CG mishmash and all of it plays out in stunning fashion. There was a realism to everything. Using practical effects and a practical suit of armor paid off big-time. I seriously enjoyed not being able to tell the difference between a CG shot and a practical shot. The suits of armor develop a personality of their own. They communicate and allows us to see certain POV. Even the drones were amazing. There are so many great details that I truly believe this movie will be king of the multiple viewings. I can't see myself ever tiring of the action or performances.</fullReview>

While the cast is immensely pleasing and the effects nearly perfect, there is just no story here. This inability of film-makers to actually produce these special effects films which also contain at least an interesting story is a great curiosity to me. If one were a student of Marvel comics, you might recall the many great stories that the writers made around their characters. There is a great emptiness, a gratuitous over- stated violence about this film that is sad, given the audience and potential for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very childish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Iron Man 1 was an 8/10.Iron Man 2 felt very childish and maybe that's because the comics are the same way (I never read them so I don't know).What I do know is that there's a brawl between Stark and Rhodes at a club-like party inside Stark's mansion. The fight is so childish that it completely contradicts their character's backgrounds (a highly ranked military officer and a brilliant inventor).The villain is absurd. He's a brilliant scientist that rivals Stark's genius yet he's been incarcerated for 15 years for selling nuclear weapons. Judging from his abode, he is living in poverty. Why wouldn't someone who can hack Justin Hammer's research facility in less than 30 seconds, create an arc reactor from scratch using his father's blueprints, mobilize his own mechanized soldiers using remote control live a life of poverty?The villain is surprisingly stupid for a genius. He walks out onto an active formula 1 race to "whip" cars that are coming out of a corner at 100+ mph. Why didn't he just shoot stark with a sniper rifle? Why even build the weapon at all? How the heck did they manage to whip any car traveling at such high speeds?Why the heck and how the heck did Stark manage to participate in the race at the last minute with his company logo on the vehicle.We have no idea what Howard Stark's cryptic message really meant or how Stark Jr. decodes it so quickly to create a new element (yes, the ones you find in the Periodic Table of the Elements) during his down-time.Although there is more action in this film, it felt empty. I didn't care the way I did in the first film. It felt like Matrix Reloaded - lots of action that felt contrived.There's a gag in the final minutes of the film, where Hammer's cigar rocket is proved defective, but what if it did work? Wouldn't Stark and Rhodes both be annihilated and why was whiplash exposing his face? Speaking of Rhodes, the character does some insanely stupid things that mock reason. For example, he trades the War Machine suit for some high tech weapons from Hammer. That's like trading a sword for a broom. Not only is it a stupid trade, there's no thought of the potential consequences, and he betrays Stark.The one thing that puzzles me most is why Stark would let Rhodes in and out of his lab as if it were some kinda college dorm.Black Widow appears out of nowhere and we learn nothing about her. What a waste of a character.Nick Fury just pops up and says stuff that seems so trivial that I feel nothing towards the scene.The final battle against whiplash was over so fast I couldn't believe it. It was like a virgin on prom night. Very unsatisfactory. Instead, the fight scenes where spent fighting generic looking robots, which we didn't get to see a lot because the fight was done at night while flying (a budget-minded move to cut cg expenses perhaps).Everyone except the villain are invincible in the Marvel universe. Actually, that's just a guess. Maybe whiplash will return with a minor-concussion on his left index finger due to his self-destructing whiplash bot. A small army of rogue robots shoot up a glass dome. Broken glass rains on the attendees below, yet no one is impaled. The same robots self-destruct several minutes later, but no one dies. War Machine has a mini gun with what seems to be infinite ammunition. Compare how long Rhodes held the trigger down to how long Jesse Ventura fires his mini gun in Predator 1 (by the way, he has an entire backpack of ammo too).Whereas Iron Man 1 felt like a comic book movie made for adults (who aren't seeking intellectual entertainment, but rather something that is entertaining without being too intellectually insulting), Iron man 2 feels like it was made for children, who wish to be intellectually abused.Comic books have earned a huge fan base and created elaborate canons. Aliens and Predator did the same thing without comic book origins - look at them now. Two of the most recognizable monsters went from film icons to the butt of many jokes thanks to childish scripts in their successors. If this continues, comic book movies will tread the same tragic path.</fullReview>

Great!!I queued up and saw it, blessing my lucky stars!Wow!It's amazing to see the number of actors joining the directors club. We knew Jon Favreau was good when we saw 'Elf'. He just keeps on getting better. This is phenomenal. I am afraid this movie is not for 'artsy' type. Girls and refined folks! Advice for y'all! Keep away. This ain't your scene! This is a plain and simple hardcore action movie with a great story and even greater action. Mind blowing action! Both the movies have great scripts. Favreau is lucky with that one. And awesome actors playing them. I am not gonna give away the story. I recommend you see for yourself. If ever there was a 'Phoenix' in Hollywood, its Robert Downey Jr. A decade ago he was convicted and imprisoned. The only thing going for him was Ally Macbeal. Hollywood had written him off. Now he's headlining two big franchises. Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes. Speaks volumes about his quality. He rose from his ashes. The other 'Phoenix' being Micky Rourke. He's just awesome as 'Whiplash'. I think i will add some 'Vankoism' in my vocabulary when i criticize any software...'Thees sooftwer ees sheeet' in a Russian accent.I know i didn't give much of a review because i don't want to prejudice any potential viewer. All i am going to say is 'You will not be disappointed'. I leave you with that note and let you judge for yourself....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who said there is little or no story in this movie, just what were you watching? The couple making out in front of you, or were you busy attending to your SMS or email messages? Now I just got to know that Sam Rockwell was a contender for the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark in the first film, I am so glad he didn't get the part and Robert Downey Jr did.In the first movie we got to see a lot more of Iron Man, while Tony Stark stood quietly in the background. In the sequel it is Tony Stark that matters more than Iron Man. In fact Iron Man has become a mere tool for ego and fame and is beginning to become a liability to SI and tony. Unfortunately there isn't enough running time for the director to explore the deeper character of Tony Stark and his struggle with his alter ego and alcohol. Shame.Pepper Pott should have had more anger, anguish and frustration, but the character was not explored.I agree with some reviewers in saying that there is likely a spin-off in the Black Widow character. Although I must say, Scarlet Johannson's performance was a bit off. I always thought the character to be quite a bit colder, as in an ice queen.Is it me or is Samuel L. Jackson putting on tens of pounds?! I could hardly recognize him in the café scene with Robert Downey Jr!!! Shame that Sam Rockwell is still playing villain. He is quite a versatile actor who is constantly under-utilized and under appreciated.Notice how I am talking about characters and not story or the SFX? Well, for those of you watching this movie thinking there is a better story than the first, you do know that you are watching a sequel to a comic superhero screen adaptation. 30-40 years of history does not shrink well into a 2 hour movie... it won't even fit a 10 hour one.As for special effects, what else can you not expect to be thrown into a modern blockbuster like this? Heck, even the kitchen sink can be entirely CG! What's new since Jurassic Park? Overall, there is perhaps a re-watch value somewhere, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket you pay the first time round.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I actually paid money to watch this horrible thing!! The movie has nothing to see, no plot, no character development and no realism at all!! (SPOILERS) The movie is basically about a super awesome guy with a tin armor, who is a very wealthy, very sexy, very cool, can hack any computer in seconds, brought world peace with his "tin" armor. The story continues when you see that he is also a genius scientist who discovered or created a new element in about 15 minutes!!It gets better when you see the all bad a** guy/scientist also who drinks vodka all day and loves his parrot!! a scientist whose body is all covered by tattoos and looks like a thug.Bottom line, if you want to waste your time, at least waste it more decently, there are a lot of retarded movies way better and realistic than this one. It makes me sad that these kind of movies are funded and produced in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a great flick, not doubt about it. But, unfortunately, it fails to live up to hype and expectations of the first Iron Man.There were enjoyable action scenes in Iron Man 2. However, they didn't feel as compelling as the first one. Through each and every action scene, it's easily predictable that Iron Man will just win, so that does take out most of the enjoyment from them.There is a lot of humorous and satisfying dialogue throughout. This is probably mainly due to the stellar cast. Robert Downey is perfect, again! Sam Rockwell was probably my favourite actor in this movie as he mixes evil and comedy up very nicely. Most people didn't like him because of his attitude, but personally, he's acting is wonderful.ScarJo is sexy, but that's about it. She isn't really given much to work with and the one long action scene she is provided with seems too forced and clichéd to have any powerful affect. Don Cheadle's just there, he's not great and he's not bad, nothing too fancy about him.Samuel L. Jackson is provided with very little screen time, but I assure you, he delivers just like you would expect him to deliver. The ring on the tone of his voice is impeccable.Mickey Rourke is a fantastic villain and he really had me satisfied in every scene, but it was quite unfortunate how quickly and easily he lost the final battle. Blame the writers on that one. Using an actor with so much potential, but failing to use him to his full potential, that's just a shame.That's the acting side of it. Right about now, I'd probably give the movie an 8. But the biggest problem Iron Man 2 had is, in my opinion, the lack of continuing the storyline.A storyline was introduced with Tony's father and Rourke's father. It was mentioned here and there. Samuel L. Jackson also played particular attention to Tony's father. Yet, in the end, a storyline that was built up significantly from the beginning and the middle had hardly any affect towards the end, if any. It's almost like it was forgotten about and was merely introduced to by time. That was disappointing.Overall, Iron Man 2 will satisfy your hunger, but it will leave the dessert compartment empty and unsatisfied as it lacks many of the elements that made Iron Man 1 such a big surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to expand on the original, a filler for the proposed Avengers movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark's ego swells to enormous levels. Written as some kind of Steve Jobs meets Richard Branson amalgam in a superhero costume, Robert Downey's wise-ass treatment of the character (still at tangents to what he represents in the original comics) seems self absorbed and cheeky. How could anyone find him likable as a hero? But beyond all of this is a simple fact, this sequel fails to do what every sequel must i.e. expand on the original and take the premise into uncharted territory.Stripped down in this second outing to its bare essentials - one liners and scant cartoonish action - the films defects (glaringly obvious even in the first) conspicuously swell and rise to the surface. The story puts Stark in mortal danger; the miniature arc reactor that keeps him alive is now poisoning his body, discharging lethal toxins that weaken him and leave limited time to find a cure. Amidst this he finds himself embroiled in a wrangle with the US government over the ownership of the Iron Man armour and what it represents (weapon or instrument of peace). If all of this weren't enough, he is threatened by the random appearance of Mickey Rourke's Ivan Vanko, who as Whiplash thumps Start and his Iron Man armour in the movies best scene, set in an over-crowded Monaco racetrack.Once the initial dust has settled though, the film turns into a self absorbed, faux character study. This superhero Bucket List setup, where our hero may be dying and therefore disregards all concerns about his image and worldly perception, does not make for good entertainment. Even with all its flaws, the original film never sank to a level where it didn't amuse us, whether it was in exploring (but also exploiting) the socio-political landscape of the war on terror or Stark's guilt-stricken conscience, bruised by the extent of his organizations exploits. Because director Jon Favreau is no Sam Raimi, even his attempts at parodying the character (ala Spiderman 3) in self deprecation mode ? with Tony Start dancing around in full armour on his birthday - feels embarrassingly unfunny. For action junkies, the cluttered night time scenes with Stark and Jim Rhodes (underwhelming Don Cheadle in armour as War Machine) lack the aerial panache of Iron Man fighting it out with Jet Fighters from the original.The film makes one fact glaringly obvious; comic book movies are not comic books themselves, they are movies and are expected to function in ways that films do. That Iron Man 2 doesn't is a failure that stems out of its short-sightedness to connect itself to something bigger and greater. Intended as a tie in to the upcoming, proposed (and so far non- existent) Avengers movie, it instead becomes filler for it. The movies tone implies it is a setup for the teams ultimate formation, and the blink and miss appearance of Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer, intended to provide drug like highs in audiences viewing pleasure, only confirms this observation. This is not a film but bait for a much bigger commercial franchise on the horizon and depending on how you see it, you will either enjoy it or feel duped by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the movie in a press screening here are my humble thoughts:Before I start with my short review of Iron Man 2, I have to say two words about Iron Man 1. I really dug the first one despite of being a little disappointed by the grand finale. Robert Downey Jr. kills it, action, humor, pacing... loved it. I'm not a big comic geek, and not that familiar with the original Iron Man comics, so please excuse if some of the stuff I thought was weird, was actually accurate adapted.So while the opening credits where rolling and I saw all the big names of actors that I happen to love, I really thought that it might be hard to give all of them a fair amount of stuff to do in the movie. And as it happened to turn out, I was right. I was especially disappointed by Mickey Rourke's part as Whiplash. Don't get me wrong, Rourke was great. He looks mean as usual and I loved every scene he's in. Unfortunately Favreau really pulled a Darth Maul on him. After the last fight I honestly sat in my chair and was like "that's it? you can't be serious?!". Rourke's Character had almost the same potential (at least from his talent as an actor and his looks in the movie) as Heath Ledger's Joker in Dark Knight. But he never lived up to that expectation due to the lack of screen time and, well... a purpose.But the main problem I had with Iron Man 2 was the lack of a meaningful story and motivation for almost all of the characters. We are introduced to Scarlett Johansson's "Black Widow", and blame it on my lack of knowledge of the graphic novels, but I had no Idea what her purpose in the movie was. The first part of the movie she's just the hot secretary with almost no lines. Eventually she puts on a tight super hero costume and tries to find Whiplash. There is a brief action-sequence, where she kicks some ass, but truth be told, Hit-Girl would wipe the floor with Black Widow. What I really liked though, was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. He totally killed it and you can tell he enjoyed his part as the sleazy scumbag pulling the strings in the background.I also liked Don Cheadle as James Rhodes (he was on par with Terrence Howard on this one), but I felt his character suffered from the lack of time for character development. There is this scene, where Tony Stark is seriously messed up, partying at his home in his Iron Man suit and randomly shooting stuff. Rhodes is tired of the situation and grabs himself another one of the Iron Man suits, battles Stark and than leaves. With the suit. I don't know if that's the way it was done in the comics, but I didn't like it at all. In the first movie we witness how Stark becomes Iron Man, how he needs to learn to use the suit and become one with it, how he builds it and we can understand, that he is the only one, who could use it that way. Apparently we're wrong, because all you need, is the suit. It's like anyone could be Batman, if he just could get a hold of his cape. There is no explanation as to why Rhodes can fly this suit like he owns it, there isn't anything told about the relationship between Stark and Rhodes. I just felt this part was incredible weak.The whole movie felt like a setup for another movie. Characters are introduced, stuff happens, but nothing really matters, at best it hints, that there COULD be happening something in the future.Another big problem I had though, was the lack of 'magic moments' and thrilling action, like in the first flick (I still get goosebumps, thinking about how Tony Stark flew in his suit for the first time). Everything just runs too smooth, there is almost no tension, you never think anything could harm Tony Stark, you never feel something bad is about to happen. If I compare this with the incredible Dark Knight, it feels like a kids movie, something like the ranks of Sky High. Plus, there was just to little Iron Man in Iron Man, to little I care about. Iron Man 2 was made to prepare us for The Avengers and Thor, but by being that, it kinda forgot to be something in it's own. That's the biggest difference to the first flick, who was original, fresh and smart.Sounds pretty much like a bash, but all that being said, I was fairly entertained. The performances of the main characters each were pretty good. The cast was perfect. Of course all the special effects are amazing, with a lot attention to detail. I loved all the 'augmented reality" stuff going on in Starks garage. The movie is funny (actually it felt more like a comedy than an action flick) and when the action happens, it's looking great. The biggest let down is the potential this movie and most and for all the characters had, which wasn't used. However this is only the review of someone who's fairly unfamiliar with the graphic novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is definitely a superior film, and unlike most sequels, is not a huge let down from its predecessor. I would argue that Iron Man 2 has aged almost as well as the first Iron Man. It examines some real world questions of weapons accountability and the mental and physical toll playing a superhero can have on one person.Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson make solid appearances in the film, and Don Cheadle takes over as Rhodey, with a few surprises in store for the character. Jon Favreau, who directed the first two Iron Man flicks, has an increased role as Tony and Pepper's assistant and driver Happy Hogan, and along with Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, provide some funny moments throughout the film.The film also develops Pepper Potts, but the true newcomer is Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko aka Whiplash. I quite enjoyed the idea of this character and his main entrance is quite cool, but like Vanko's caged bird, he becomes too much of a lab rat and I think this is a misuse of the character. In other words, one can say Whiplash enters with a bang but goes out with a whimper that is a bit too reliant on special effects.My only slight complain is this portion of that character and Iron Man 2 still handles the issue of Tony's legacy very well and gets 3.5 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film certainly must have been an anticipated one following the huge success of the first 'Iron Man'. And yet this is now commonly viewed as one of the weakest MCU films. Is it? Yeah kind of but it certainly isn't 'terrible'. Sure the film does suffer from a lack of focus and perhaps it tries a bit too hard to set up 'The Avengers' but it is still a pretty entertaining film throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is once again excellent as Tony Stark, even when the film makes Tony just a bit too damn arrogant. Admittedly the main villain, Whiplash, is a bit of a let-down, especially considering that he's played by Mickey Rourke, but Sam Rockwell makes up for it (for the most part) as the secondary villain, Justin Hammer. The action sequences are once again excellent, especially the finale, and the film once again maintains the MCU's trademark tone and atmosphere. In short, 'Iron Man 2' certainly isn't perfect and by no means 'better' than the first film. However, I will admit that when I first saw it, I actually did think it was better because I actually wasn't too big on the first film when I first saw it. Nowadays things have obviously changed but I still love 'Iron Man 2'. Good solid fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second film in the Iron Man series (in case the title didn't give you that info), directed again by John Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. With the world now aware of Tony Stark and his Iron Man suit, he has to deal with his own demons as well as a world who fears and craves his technology. A vengeful mad man with ties to the Stark dynasty surfaces to try and take Stark down. Ivan Vanko (Micky Rouke) is Whiplash, aided by Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who himself envies Stark's success and genius, is tasked with bringing Stark down. Stark has to deal with Whiplash, Justin Hammer, the US Military, a mystery man called Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who thinks that Stark has a lot to offer the world, and Stark's own demon's and doubts. All the usual's are there; Gwyneth Paltrow is Pepper Potts, Clark Gregg is Agent Coulson, John Slattery is Howard Stark in various flashbacks, Garry Shandling plays Senator Stern again and Paul Bettany once again voices Jarvis. This time around Don Cheadle plays 'Rhodey' Rhodes (War Machine), and Scarlett Johansson, makes an appearance as the story progresses as Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) giving a glimpse of what her character is going to bring to a future Avengers film - sexy but deadly. My own personal opinion is that this 2nd film is definitely as glitzy and action packed as the first film and is a good sequel, but, the story doesn't seem as strong. The story takes place almost straight after the first film with many of the conversations/ actions a direct reflection of events of the first film. To me this felt like Iron Man 1.5 rather than an Iron Man 2 but I still enjoyed it as a movie in its own rights. Robert Downey Jr once again demonstrates why he was born to play this role, he is both believable and lovable. I can't fault any of the casting or acting. The CGI is tastefully done and only adds to the on screen spectacle being played out. The pace of the film is like a mild jog with the occasional sprint to keep things interesting. I'm awarding this 7 out of 10. I enjoyed the film and it tickled my taste buds for more to come from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

After buying the movie on DVD I got to say it is one of those movies that had to age to be appreciated.While it is not a superior sequel it is still a enjoyable movie with some things that make it work and some not so much things that will make it work.The film centers this time on new cast of characters along with developing them as the film goes on which helps make it work.Iron Man 2 story took some time to get a grip of where this was going and what was happening to the characters that you have to be pay close attention to or else you'll miss something.The acting in the movie is up and down where some of the cast doing well and making the film work despite some flaws in the script There is some very original quotes in the movie which I liked and they help make the movie fun.The music in the movie works helps with the movie and some songs that movie fans know from the first note they heard it. There are impressive special effects which you would come to expect in Iron Man and Marvel movies they spare no expense with the effects it really goes to show that with a little talent and a lot imagination you can create some impressive workIt just this sequel took time to enjoy and the fact some of the flaws can hurt the movieBut with good acting, impressive effects and characters you'll find it to be just as good as the other line ups in the Marvel Cinematic UniverseI give Iron Man 2 an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is such an egotistical, relentlessly uncompromising man, he can't help but earn one's sympathy in Iron Man 2, the sequel to the overwhelming success that was Iron Man. Stark must deal with a Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), who believes that he stole the complicated plans for his own personal Iron Man-technology from his father, his other arch-rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who is establishing an gigantic uprising of metal monstrosities, and Congressional jurisdiction attempting to make Iron Man property of the Defense Department rather than his own personal technology. Talk about Atlas shrugging. On top of this, his company is now run by his longtime assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his best-friend Rhodey (now played by Don Cheadle) may now become his sidekick to stop Vanko.Iron Man 2 is probably the most kinetic, fast-moving, briskly-paced sequel that could've been made to such a surprisingly elegant, intriguing film. Initially, with all this stuff going on, this sequel looked like it was going to follow the messiness and unfocused nature of Spider-Man 3, but director Jon Favreau manages to, for the most part, keep things moving steadily.I begin by reiterating the main element I praised in the original film and that is Downey's wonderful, wholly spirited performance as one of the most narcissistic males to take the screen in years. Stark is a tricky character to play, on one hand being a generous philanthropist and an uncompromising genius with a love for chemistry and science, but on the other, being hopelessly cocky and basking in the light of his own self-centered arrogance. How does one make a character like that watchable, let alone likable? Downey Jr. somehow pulls it off, using tactile energy and quick-witted humor as a means to convey a character we simply enjoy watching.Another fascination I have with Stark is his ability to be and remain public about his abilities as Iron Man. Most heroes prefer reclusion, resorting to closeting their abilities by acting as if they are darker, more elusive alter-egos. It's at least fascinating that Stark doesn't play by these old constraints and chooses to be as open about his alternate persona as a person who just took up a new job.With that said, there is more of a focus on Stark as a human rather than Stark accompanied by a large, straining iron suit. This way, his problems appear more humanly to us (not wanting to give up something that is rightfully his, trying to establish peace amongst large groups, etc) and his agony feels more close to home. If there is an unfortunate element to be found in Iron Man 2, it's that the focus too often shifts and there are really too many things going on here for them all to be truly explored in one-hundred and twenty-four minutes. This isn't as half-baked as it could've been, but it's not as deeply involving or as nourishing as it should have been either. And just when you think the ideas have all shown themselves, out pops Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of the organization S.H.I.E.L.D, to inform Stark about his father and how he could be valued in the organization. And just when you think that's the final plotpoint, a twist features Scarlett Johansson's Natalie as someone that is more than just Stark's latest piece of eye candy.The idea of Stark refusing to surrender over his technology and advancements to the Defense Department alone could've made for an unbelievably interesting story about staying true to one's inner-self and holding on to what is rightfully yours, regardless of price or negotiations. However, could you see that being the main point of a superhero film? Neither could I; too many bad guys and too little time.Iron Man 2 is at least an ambitious sequel, looking to tackle a wide-range of ideas and central conflicts had by its title character. The problem is it takes enough plot from a potential Iron Man 3 in its quest for ambitiousness and variety. The action sequences remain fluent and grandiose, the actors all fill their parts nicely (if only Mickey Rourke was given more time to shine), and the sense of fun and excitement is still present. There's just a sheer listlessness of execution that needed to be discussed when implementing so many wonderful ideas.Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L.

		<shortDescription>A sequel that could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming off of one of the better Marvel films to date, Iron Man 2 is an OK film, but I expected a lot better. With Robert Downey, Jr., arguably one of the more popular actors in the world today, in the starring role, why wasn't the writing up to par this time? Yes, it may be said that the first Iron Man revamped Downey, Jr's career, it was notably because the writing was up to his performance, which was good, by the way, and the sequel is more worried about being an action movie and introducing new villains, allies, and trying to be funnier, which eventually becomes one of the more tiresome elements of the film. That being said, the film's action is quite satisfying, especially the last scene with the kind of robot war that happens. Unfortunately, it's the only good one. Otherwise, the party scene is reminiscent of Spider-Man 3's dance scene, and the Justin Hammer character is unnecessary and unfunny, but the film hits a few good spots, and it recovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would have been great had Terrence Howard not asked for so much money and just done the part, Don C. is a good actor but if you want to maintain continuity than for the love of film making use the same actors, because the combo of Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and the rest of the crew made a very strong foundation and that foundation got some holes shot in it when they brought back "Roddy" (Terrence Howard's original character) and replace him with a completely different actor!!! What the heck guys, you could have given him a different name/title/rank something, but making the same character and having him played by two different actors is just wrong. Also the part of "Justin Hammer" was a bit much, but I think that was the whole point so we can let that one slide. Mickey Rourke made a great addition and the special effects were top shelf, definitely a good movie, but what keeps it from being a great movie and out-doing the first is the continuity which was ruined by one simple actor not willing to play ball. Who knows maybe there were other factors in the mix, but I stand by the point that you shouldn't have two difference actor's play the same character. Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, a good sequel among numerous bad ones out there. The first Iron Man movie was an incredible feat in terms of action, story, effects, music, and so on. Naturally, such a film would be tricky to beat, but luckily with such a huge fan base and source material from the comics, Jon Favreau was able to sort of "upgrade" his antics in this hit sequel that's sure to blow you away.Plot: Tony Stark has brought peace to the world (and revealed his secret identity) thanks to his high tech battle suit and most people love him. With this comes some unfortunate problems such as a strained relationship with his assistant Pepper Potts and the government seeking to get its hands on the Iron Man armor, but those are the least of his worries. A figment from his family's past has come back to haunt Tony: Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash who seeks revenge on the Stark family and he has rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer backing him up. Even with the help of Rhodey a.k.a. War Machine and Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, can Iron Man rise up to the challenge? Time to suit up! This is a worthy edition to the Avengers storyline. First of all, the action scenes are absolutely great, plenty of things get blown up and the effects make it even better. I love the story as we explore more of Tony's character as he tries to deal with his newfound fame and threats both physical and mental. All the other characters have a good amount of development as well, especially Pepper and Rhodey who becomes War Machine. The villain Whiplash is surprisingly a great villain; not only does he look cool and that he's a significant physical threat, but he's also very smart and tends to be fairly manipulative.My only major complaint is the secondary villain Justin Hammer. He's very condescending and egotistical, which often gets to point of being quite annoying. Everyone knows it and everyone hates him. He makes you feel like punching him in the face, which I guess is the point but nevertheless he's a pain and so is Senator Stern who also wants the Iron Man armor.In conclusion, despite the above problem, Iron Man 2 is a film that may actually be better than the first one. It only furthers the excitement of when the Avengers come together. It's twice the iron, twice the action, and twice the fun, so I recommend that you give this one a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very much enjoyed this film it had a great look and feel. I especially liked the relationship between Tony Stark and Sam Rockwells characters it was funny and looked great on screen. I thought this film was not as strong as the last one but really had some great visuals and script.Jon Favreu really brings a unique and interesting approach to the marvel universe that i am interested to see develop into other genres. I thought the Mickey Rourke character was slightly over the top unfortunately and i failed to really see the point of his character but apart from that i really enjoyed and I'm looking forward to seeing how the story develops in the avengers movie in the coming months. So all in all i felt the film was mostly positive and I i would give it a strong 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing despite a few drawbacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will be disappointed if you go into this movie expecting the same seamless storytelling and FX spectacle that "Iron Man" was from start to finish. That said, the good parts of this movie will grab you in exactly the same way and they come frequently enough that you can easily overlook the more disappointing parts.A good example of this high-low effect in "Iron Man 2" is our reintroduction to Tony. That sequence where, suited, he leaps out of the plane and flies into the Stark Expo is just mindbogglingly good, and the subsequent speech and old-time movie get you interested in what's coming up next. Unfortunately, then we are immediately introduced to Tony checking his blood toxicity - this being Tony Stark, the viewer immediately assumes it's a blood alcohol check. We aren't really given any preparation or hint that it's anything more than that, so we're left more confused than anything else until the reason for that gradually becomes clear as the movie progresses.There are some really good high spots, though. To mention just a few: The start of the movie, with that overlapping narrative from the last movie while we're dropped unexpectedly into somebody's apartment in Russia in wintertime; the Monaco racetrack scene; the fight during the party; that little confrontation in the jail cell between Tony and Vanko (even with no FX, it had good dialogue and atmosphere); and more.There are also problems, but I'm not going to go into those, as the high points are so good, other than to say that I'm not sure whether to rate the big fight at the end as a high or a low point. There's a bit too much CGI and a bit of a sense of Deus Ex Machina lurking somewhere in the rafters. Vanko is the most emotionally invested one in it, unlike back at the racetrack in Monaco, when Tony very definitely was reacting emotionally to the Russian and what he had done. A little more of that reaction at the end would have been nice.Overall, though, the movie is a solid 8 on a scale of 10.I miss Terrence Howard as Rhodey, but Don Cheadle really gets into the character and he handles those action sequences perfectly. You really believe he is the one person (ignoring SHIELD's existence for the moment) who can effectively say "NO!" to Tony Stark, while his conflict as he tries to do the right thing is very clear.Outstanding performances by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke as the bad guys, and Garry Shandling was a delightful surprise, especially at the end.****Spoiler alert**** Gwyneth Paltrow had a lot tougher job this time around, but in relatively few screen appearances, she conveyed Pepper's many transformations and her inner turmoil (in addition to the obvious freak-out in Monaco, of course) so well that you could feel Pepper's relief at the end when she finally and completely quit her employment at Stark Industries, and you can also understand exactly why Tony took the resignation the way he did. A very unexpected but satisfying outcome to that whole subplot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall a huge disappointment, but still a rather exciting and exhilarating ride. The main problem with Iron Man 2 is that it does too much in the most complicated of ways and yet misses obvious ways to tie the plot together in a more condensed form. Tony Stark is dying because of his Iron Man suit. Ivan Vanko wants revenge on Stark because Stark's father ran his father out of the country and stole his idea. The American government wants the Iron Man suit. These are the main three plots going down. After a great set-up the film is all ready to roar into action when SUDDENLY the antagonists spend the second act delegating their work. The American government hires Justin Hammer to build a suit, Hammer can't build a suit, Hammer springs Vanko from prison etc. And it goes on. The villains all need someone else to do a part of their plan which makes for a lot of talk and not a lot of action. Keep in mind, all this is going on without any involvement from Stark/Iron Man. He's searching for some unknown element to stop his suit from killing him, whilst setting up a spin-off (The Avengers). I appreciate what Marvel are trying to do, but the film was all foreplay and then a quick handjob. Couldn't Vanko have had some clues towards Tony's cure? At least then these plot strands could have been linked in some way. Still, it's enough to leave me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another iron in the fire for Downey Jr.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a full-on high tech bag of laughs from beginning to end, on an even grander scale than Iron Man 1.Mickey Rourke plays a superb adversary, Ivan Vanko, with his homemade killer suit replete with electrified whipping cables. The action during the Monaco race scene is breathtaking: the crashes and impact feel realistic even in its ridiculous sci-fi context.Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., suffers a bit of Iron Man Pox due to clocking up too many air miles in his hefty flight suit. This is not helped by other foes and colleague Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, played by Don Cheadle, hopping on the iron-clad bandwagon to steal his thunder; so-much-so that I even felt a tinge of sympathy for the billionaire narcissist.Appearances by Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow are notable only as welcome eye candy ? especially Johansson in her skin tight butt-kicking suit ? but failed to make and real impact with their performances, this mostly due to weak characterisations within the script.Topped off by a good performance by Sam Rockwell as Stark's jealous slime-ball rival, Justin Hammer, Iron Man 2 is an action-fest that will appeal to many, but especially CGI graphics nerds with a sense of humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some flaws with the integration it's still a good superhero sequel that is worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel that has been overly hyped didn't meet it's expectations of how great it was going to be, but it's still a passable sequel. It tries to be intelligent but it felt like there was just a tad bit too much talking. Although I liked the debating scene in Washing D.C. And this movie just didn't flow cleverly like the first one did. It should have carried the tone of the first half of the movie although it wasn't all that great with the second half. Tony Stark still has the egotistical and wisecracking personality like the fist Iron Man movie but he comes off as an asshole in this. Tony Stark has been a bit of a asshole that tries to enhance or always tries to be on top even in the comic books. But his character in this just wasn't all that likable. In the first Iron Man movie Tony Stark had a decent blend of being a guy with a heart and being a bit of an asshole. I guess now his ego has skyrocketed way more after becoming Iron Man. The main villain Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke is a more developed villain than the previous one but lacked that interesting appeal that grabs the attention like what Jeff Bridges did. This also has more action going for it compared to the previous movie and it sweet to watch but it just lacked the soul compared to the first movie. Maybe cause the plot isn't integrated very well into the action sequences, it's done alright but not as well as the first one. The plot about the alter-ego leading the way for conflicts to start for a normal life in a Genius Billionaire Tony Stark daily lifestyle is done alright but nothing groundbreaking. Especially with great power comes a lot of responsibilities that he has to deal with. This isn't really a superhero movie that the kids will enjoy as much as the adults, simply because sometimes it has way too much talking going on. And some of the scenarios just doesn't make any sense, not because it's implausible but it just doesn't make any sense. This movie could have been a lot better if most of the scenarios and actions were integrated in very well. Overall this is a good sequel and isn't a dud but a film that is worthwhile seeing despite some flaws.7.5/10</fullReview>

After revealing that he's Ironman, congress is asking him to pass over his Ironman suit in the name of National Security.

They butt heads of all places at Monaco Grandprix. Will Tony Stark/Ironman be able to convince the new Crimson Dynamo to stand down like he did with his father ?Why they didn't go with the original Crimson Dynamo's suit design is beyond me. He was one of the more interesting character in the Ironman series. The problem might have been he was a Russian agent, and that country no longer exists. But in any case, the new Crimson Dynamo is not in the caliber as the original, and didn't seem as worthy opponent to Ironman. When the antagonist isn't good, the story suffers. The voltage of this second Ironman was lower than that of the first. So my take is, they better bone up on Ironman saga, and come up with a better story next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this second installment of the Marvel Comics hero Iron Man, Tony Stark has revealed himself to the world as being Iron Man. Senator Stern(Gary Shandling) is trying to alarm governments that Tony's technology could possible fall in the wrong hands. At that moment Ivan Anton(Mickey Rourke)is fulfilling the wish of his dying father, who once worked with Tony's father, to create a new energy source to power a stronger Iron Man suit for himself. There is a general consensus that Tony is slacking with his world protection as his turns Stark Industries over to right-hand woman Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow). Rival industrialist and opportunist Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell)must convince the evil minded Ivan to team up and disgrace Stark in front of the world. Also starring are: Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Leslie Bibb and small role for director Jon Favreau. Super F/X with intense action. A very strong soundtrack helps make IRON MAN 2 a memorable flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an OK sequel, but not better then the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally loved the original Iron Man. It was the best summer movie of the year when it came out. When i heard they would make a sequel, i was both thrilled but thinking, how are they going to top the first one. Honestly, my worst fears came true. Iron Man 2 takes place alittle bit after the first one, with Iron man enjoying his fame and attention he is receiving for revealing the truth of his identity at the end of the first film. Robert Downey Jr as always is fantastic as Tony Stark. In my opinion, he was not only born to play the super hero, but he IS tony stark in real life. Thats what makes the chemistry so amazing and real. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Iron Mans best friend, War Machine, after Terrance Howard was fired from the movie. He does a good job, hes a great actor, but i felt like he was alittle out of place, seeing as how this is his first official super hero movie. He also lacked chemistry in the friendship between Robert that Terrance had. The villain in this movie, Whiplash, is played by the fantastic and amazing Mickey Rourke. I gotta say, he went all out in this movie. He did not hold back, although i did feel like his character started faltering when Sam Rockwells character came in. This is where it all ended for me. Sam is a great actor, i have enjoyed many of his movies, and i respect him as an actor, but in this movie, i thought he really sucked. His character is so pathetic in some of the scenes he comes out in, i feel like if they had removed him and only kept Mickey, i might have awarded the movie a 9 instead of an 8. Some of his scenes are just plain stupid or pathetic to me, and i really felt bad that Mickey had to go through with doing these scenes with such bad scenes. Also, the actual fighting does not happen till the last 10 minutes of the film, and by then, you don't really care much for it anymore. Overall, i really wanted to fall in love with this movie, but i found myself thinking that it was okay at best. Sam is the only actor i will complain about in this movie, since his character sucked, but overall, i will award this movie an 8 out of 10, if you loved the original, definitely check out this one, just don't expect it to be as good or better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depending on your point of view, my summary line by Iron Man/Tony Stark either describes the picture pretty well or not at all. That would have been the best line of the picture if Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) hadn't of come up with "This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst". And I always though antidisestablishmentarianism was the longest word in the English language.I'm echoing a lot of viewers who thought more of the first Iron Man flick than this one. Too much emphasis on the special effects and blow 'em up action and not enough on character development and motivation. At least they mentioned War Machine by name, or I should say Don Cheadle mentioned it. But how does anyone know who Black Widow is unless you follow the comic book series? Mickey Rourke looks every bit like he might have just stepped off the set of "The Wrestler", and as I think about it now, I don't think there ever was a pro grappler named Whiplash. I wonder why.The one thing I always look forward to in my Marvel Comics films is the manner in which writer and comic book legend Stan Lee shows up. Just as in the first Iron Man picture, Mister Lee is credited as himself, but is actually shown and introduced portraying Larry King in a quick early scene. The first time around he was doing the Hugh Hefner thing.The Fox News Network's Bill O'Reilly also gets some face time here in a background sequence doing one of his Talking Points Memos on Pepper Potts. I'm thinking about that now, and how his appearance neatly ties into the pro-American, patriotic stance the picture takes with Iron Man's character and Tony Stark's refusal to give up his personal private property, both very conservative viewpoints. O'Reilly goes after Pepper Potts' inexperience in being named the head of Stark Enterprises, and it seems I've heard that argument before about a certain President.Hopefully the Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) appearance makes the wait for The Avengers film something to look forward to and not a disappointment. The Fantastic Four films were only nominally successful, and I look for something bigger and better from the next Marvel movie franchise.</fullReview>

The action works very well, the interplay between the actors is strong, and the movie has a great sense of humor (unlike the Spider-Man films).Robert Downey Jr. embodies Tony Stark, he doesn't just play him. Paltrow is very good as Pepper Potts. Ditto for Cheadle as Rhodey. Mickey Rourke is okay... whenever he plays a role, he is just playing himself, though. His work in "Sin City" is the exception to this.This movie is quintessentially what a comic book based film should be. Down to the old AC/DC track playing during the credits. If any character from Marvel ever channeled Bon Scott, it's Tony Stark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark leads strong in entertaining follow up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up an old copy of Total Film magazine (issue 160) the other day which was promoting the future 100 and Jon Favreau, Iron man 1 and 2 director said "The big challenge is how do you not have it be two guys in suits hitting each other? I've done that. I don't want to do more of it." I read this after watching the 2010 smash on DVD and was rather surprised as there was plenty of guys in suits hitting each other, particularly at Iron man's own home which begs the question, how different is this to the first one? The first Iron man shook up the superhero summer two years ago which was overshadowed by the Dark Knight but it was still a great blockbuster and a great story, being funny, light hearted and 100% action packed. And although this release is fun entertainment, it falls quite short of the bar the first one raised.Opening with star of the moment Mickey Rourke being a recluse and formulating a plan to attack Iron Man the story is laid ahead for us and soon we are with superhero Tony Stark, a legendry comic book character and thanks to Robert Downey Jr, an icon of masculine bravado and cocky swagger that you cannot hate him for. He has created a genius and if there was ever a reason to go see a film for the best comic book real world character, here it is.Rourke as Whiplash has been praised by many, certainly his evilness and swagger is excellent but in relation to the story his motivation to go after Stark seemed rather strange.Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L Jackson set up the upcoming Avengers film nicely with carefully reserved performances giving us all something to look forward to.The story of Iron man 2 sees Stark living with himself as a now global superstar and the difficulties he conceals behind the scenes with his health, well being and fame.There are a few lapses in action sequences which are all rather flashy rather than substantial in the moment fights. The Monaco grand prix is impressive and as mentioned the big suit fight in the house is rather good.The great quality of this action film is it has a deeper meaning to a popcorn film. It feels more than a warm relaxing entertainer than a franchise maker. Sure Iron Man is glorified to the heavens in occasional conventional action battles and 'emotional' confrontations with friends and fans but this all feels genuinely authentic and exciting, the icing on the cake if you will and where you may read reviews with 3 out of 5 stars this deserves an extra one for being pure guilty and entertaining indulgence.And yes, it is by no means a match for the 2008 release but for a laugh, for entertainment and for something containing one of the best comic book creations in Tony Stark, this is certainly worth catching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd give Shellhead2 four stars, mainly on the strength of the performances, which transcend the odds by holding their own against the utterly massive layers of visual FX.Mickey Rourke follows up his Award-driven Wrestler role with an attention to detail that went as far as choosing the designs for his full-body prison tattoos and even creating a hitherto unscripted film role for an avian Cockatoo sidekick (which itself steals a scene or three).Downey as Iron Man inventor Tony Stark refuses to be sunk by his character's many, many flaws, essaying his performance with an air of "My work will redeem my lousy personality" that recalls his virtuoso performance in his earlier Charlie Chaplin bio flick. Cheadle handles his reluctant/replacement hero role with aplomb, appropriating one of the Iron Man suits in the name of some "greater good," which of course proves to instead be an even greater evil (operating within the machinations of the military industrial War Machine).The unfortunately-named Pepper Potts, as played by Gwyneth Paltrow, holds her own against Downey as her boss-slash-love interest, matching and even usurping his boxing-style banter in all their scenes together. Samuel L. Jackson is clearly just warming up his role as former soldier-turned-super-spy Nick Fury, agent of SHIELD, a character surely destined to appear in virtually all the future Marvel Comics films being set up in Iron Man 2 (news footage from the Hulk movie appears on one of Tony Stark's lab monitors, a busted Captain America shield is used as a construction prop, the mysterious appearance of Thor's hammer takes one character offscreen until the final post-credits roll, a map in the SHIELD office indicates the Black Panther's activities being tracked in Africa?.).And Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow rocks that leather jumpsuit (her stunts being done mostly on wires, rather than CGI generated as insinuated by Mr. Shepherd, tho a stunt double does indeed handle a few seconds of the more ambidextrous maneuvers).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film Review on IMDbIn Iron Man II there is a battle is raging between Stark Industries, the government and the press now that Iron Man has been made public. Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr. states that this technology is unlike any other kind in the world and he is trying to protect it by keeping peace. Hammer Industries is trying to get their hands on this technology as they provide the weaponry for the Military. When during a press conference Mr. Stark takes over the video monitor to show the failed attempts of similar technology, he wins the battle with the press. However, his friend Lt. James "Rhoadey" Rhoades, played by Don Cheadle has to do his job and get this technology to the government. In this superhero themed movie there is good versus evil and we find that there is a support group behind Iron Man to help him succeed on his journey. The lighting of this film allows for the tone to be set and for the various scenes of action and romance. The film includes romance, action with slow motion and freeze frames to the grace of physical actions. Although this is a fictional film you find yourself getting caught up in the possibility of this really being able to happen. There are some of the action scenes that are a little unrealistic, but portrayed well.This movie is similar in theme to Batman. Both films are based on super heroes that have extraordinary tools they use. They both have the support and influence of others, with Batman it is his butler and with Iron Man it is Pepper Pots, played by Gwyneth Paltrow and his driver. These films display the typical super hero here to save the day. Although, there is a big difference between Batman and Iron Man, it's that Batman's identity is kept a secret and Iron Man's isn't. This may be part of the reasoning for the raging issues with the government and media because they know who to target, just not how to obtain the suit.Tony Stark is a business owner who creates a suit that will allow him to defend off evil and be a hero to the world. However, this film does have a theme based around family as there is a connection between his behavior as an adult and his childhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inder Nagra Iron Man 2 The movie Iron Man 2 was directed by Jon Favreau and released in 2010. Robert Downey Jr returns as billionaire Tony Stark in this sequel. Micky Rourke plays the role of the villain as Ivan Vanko. Sam Rockwell plays as Justin Hammer who is Tony's competitor and makes weapons and sells them to the government. Don Cheadle plays the role as James Rhodes who is a friend of Tony Stark and also a lieutenant of the US Army. Scarlett Johansson plays the role as a black widow who is the secretary of Tony Stark and later helps him fight Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the role as CEO of Stark industries.Iron Man 2 just about pulls it off, but only just. I would give this film a 7/10. It's a strangely paced film and suffers at times from incredibly long exhibition and poorly unrealistic story lines that seem to be added to no doubt develop the revenge storyline rather than the Iron Man 2 story that I wanted to see. The acting of both Tony and Ivan at sometimes are very poor. However rest of the Iron Man 2 was spectacular in places such as the action scenes, the visual graphics and the costumes and in general fun and entertaining. Even though there were boring, pointless and highly confusing moments in the film.The story of the film is of Tony Stark's fight against The US governments attempt to obtain the suit for themselves for the military, Justin Hammer's company developing their own suits to rival Iron Man, Ivan Vanko's revenge mission on Stark as he claims his father was the one who designed the Arc Reactor Technology and that Tony's father Howard Stark stole it from him which is all bundled together with the plot of Tony's Arc reactor which is keeping him alive is also poisoning him and he needs to find a solution, which comes in the most ridiculous and confusing way possible. The genre of the film is action, adventurous, sci-fi and fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this was a big hit in theaters, and it is very well made and you couldn't have put together a better cast. The story is clever and there are a few twists that I did find amusing and surprising.That said, I got kind of bored by the revelry in Tony Stark's self destructive behavior. Okay, you need a hook that seems new and interesting but I thought I was going to see a fun action movie. This seems more lifted out of a Scorsese movie. The first one was a of corse a brand new discovery for me, but it seems that it had more of the wiseass humour, that I like so much. Not so here. The laughs are of the "I like to see people in pain" variety. The action scenes, although well made, seems too reliant on CG. The talking computer drives me crazy. It's good its voice is absent from the most part at the end.Now for the good parts: The scene at the hearing. Hilarious. Not just from Downey Jr, but also Sam Rockwell and of all people, Garry Shandling. It's a bit of an odd opening, but it's clever. Using the Iron Man technology as a parody of the world's fear of nuclear bombs was inspired. Think the second Iraq and North Korea. North Korea actually got slammed pretty badly here. Lucky, they can't sue.The Mickey Rourke character? Is it just me or does he get uglier and uglier every year. That's a compliment. His duplicity and abilities comes as a complete surprise, when finally revealed at the Stark Expo.They found a suitable replacement for Terrence Howard, although Don Cheadle is probably better suited for high drama. His character's IQ seems to have dropped a few points as well.One thing, though. What's with the Audi plug? Tony Stark's car and the big sign at the Expo.</fullReview>

But if you like that sort of thing (they are still tying a few things together for another movie and I'm not talking about the inevitable third installment in the series), you will have quite a few things to enjoy here, as did I and a quite a few others.It risks quite a bit for trying to stay true to the first part and have quite a few character beats, instead of many action scenes, that might have won more fan boys and would probably have grossed more at the cinemas. But as it is, it did play well and it's a very good film. I am a big fan of Robert Downey and he really is smooth and does know what do with this role. He owns it. A talk-y superhero movie, that works on almost all the levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2Super-heroes should never reveal their alias ? who do you think they'll blame for all those flipped cars, smashed buildings, and dead bystanders?Luckily, Iron Man, otherwise known as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is well heeled, and can easily cover restitution.But what he can't afford is: a Senator (Garry Shandling) demanding his technology, a Russian looking for revenge (Mickey Rourke), a Russian with a secret (Scarlett Johansson), relationship woes with his assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow), best friend (Don Cheadle) and dead father (John Slattery); not to mention a corrupt competitor (Sam Rockwell), and the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson).With its revolving door of characters, its lack of action, and endless Avengers Initiative preamble, Iron Man is much denser and duller this time around.Moreover, if Iron Man's armour existed, it wouldn't belong to the government, but on the stage...in the ultimate production of The Wizard of Oz.

		<shortDescription>Very good but falls short of excellence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt the characters of Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johansson(I'm sure I have spelt her name wrong) were given far too little to do and in fact were under-developed especially for a person like me who does not know too much about comic books (as a matter of fact I do not remember the Iron man saga from my childhood at all, must have missed it or something). But I guess it is to be expected in such an action packed film that focuses mainly on Tony Stark aka Iron Man and his best-friends Pepper Potts and Rhody. Mickey Rourke is like a cat with nine lives, the guy just keeps giving as many comebacks as he can possibly be expected to churn out and keeps getting better with age, his Russian accent was so authentic that whenever I looked away from the screen while he was talking, he sounded exactly like my Russian co-worker. I can't wait for part 3.</fullReview>

Scarlett Johansson in a red wig is here as well.All are talented &amp; do perform well under Jon Favroux's very capable direction.Running time before the credits is about 113 minutes,over 90 of them are well done computer effects.I do hope they forget about doing part 3,.there is nothing that memorable about the characters to warrant another film.\ My ratings say it all. a low 3 star rating.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You wanna be a war machine? Take your best shot!"The second movie in superhero franchises often is fantastic. X-Men 2, Spider-Man 2, Batman Returns, and The Dark Knight all managed to improve over their pretty solid predecessors. While Iron Man 2 can't quite join those movies by improving over the excellent Iron Man, it's still an enjoyable movie in it's own right.It may&nbsp;not be quite as consistently entertaining as the first movie, but Iron Man 2 boasts increased star power with the inclusion of Cheadle, Johansson, Rourke, and Rockwell, as well as even more special effects wizardry than its predecessor. The increased focus on the expanded cast &nbsp;and even more elaborate action scenes comes at the expense of some of the humor and perfect story flow that made the first movie so darn great, but Iron Man fans won't be very disappointed with this new movie, I can guarantee you. Iron Man 2 is flashy, fun, and another fine comic book movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this iron man as compared to the first more fighting and better effects all in all as a super hero movie just not up to the level of many super superhero movie to have come out during the years. For instance i enjoy watching the spider man movies as well as christopher nolans batman and dark knight (which i consider the best ever super hero movie to come out).More over the last action scene was way too short come on it could have been done a little longer.7/10 is a fair rating for this film mainly because of the good action scenes and the humour. I therefore recommend it to those who enjoyed the first movie you will not be left disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IM2 is a good movie on it's own merit. The movie is based on a comic and you should therefore not expect too much of this movie. It's a fun action movie. What works for this movie is the witty dialogue, spectacular visuals and the overall fun feel of the movie. What one might say doesn't work for this movie is the pretty formulaic story, the forgettable characters (with the exception of a few) and a plot that can be ripped to pieces under scrutiny. So would you like this movie? Yes, if you're not critical and are just looking for an entertaining movie that doesn't take itself serious. Also the violence in this movie isn't extreme (with the exception of a few scenes) so kids can watch this movie under the guidance of their parents. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is straight out entertainment. From the special effects to the fast paced way that the story is told, there is always something to keep the audience glued to the screen. Robert Downey Jr. is well suited in his role as Tony Stark. He portrays brashness with a bit of satire and the result is a performance that is captivating and at times, funny. Mickey Rourke also does well as physicist, Ivan Vanko. Rourke is a natural at playing sinister characters and in Iron Man 2, he comes off as someone capable of going to unknown lengths to get what he wants. Though this film appeals first to eyes, there are serious themes that underpin the story; themes like greed for power and money, the overpowering urge for vengeance and even the importance of parental love. In general, I liked how the film makers mixed in doses of action, humor and intrigue which together made for an interesting movie. I am looking forward to another sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and James "Rhodey" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side, must forge new alliances and confront powerful enemies..Iron Man was a breath of fresh air in the super hero genre. While it was still a blockbuster and therefor lacked any true depth, it was fun, entertaining, enjoyable and definitely one notch above anything else we had seen in this category. Iron Man 2, the sequel, doesn't quite follow up. The one thing that remained is the great performance by Robert Downey Jr., he is one of the most charismatic actors today and the role of Tony Stark suits him like a glove. I would go so far as to say he's basically playing himself. Unfortunately, in all the other fronts, the film falls flat. The plot is extremely simplistic, too simple in fact, the new characters, Natalie Rushman, Ivan Vanko and Justin Hammer are paper thin and the action sequences, although enjoyable, just aren't impressive at all.Regarding the new additions to the cast, I thought both Don Cheadle and Mickey Rourke did an OK job considering what they had to work with. Scarlett Johansson felt a bit underused. Maybe underused isn't the right word, I just though her character had no real purpose, if anything, she was eye candy. Sam Rockwell was pretty good but again, the material just wasn't that great. Overall, Iron Man 2 is not a terrible film but it's pretty inferior to its predecessor and nothing more then your typical summer blockbuster.6/10</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, this is a very fun movie to watch, the special effects are of the hook, RDJ is still great as Tony Stark, and yeah, Mikey Rourke was totally awesome! But, the're a lot of random things going on in this movie, I mean the dialogs are totally of focus, leaves you with a filling like your watching a sitcom, the're is far lesser action scenes than the first, especially the ending battle, where're you expecting some epic 30min action to go down,it's is like resolved in a couple of minutes. And such more fails, like an example, Tonies birthday party, man that was some random stuff right there. And ow yes, I was especially irritated with the whole Avengers movie sucking up scenes,what the hell was that!?Yes, I wan't to watch the Avengers movie and the other Marvel upcoming projects,but give me a break, the whole movie felt like a big promo spot.All in all,amusing,but not great.</fullReview>

I'll just point on one important mistake that put me down. It's the final duel between Iron Man and his sidekick, versus Whiplash. First of all, it's to damn short, only one and a half minute. I felt like when I was younger and I watched hours of introductory fights before Mike Tyson boxing match, and then he steps in the ring and ends fight at half of first round. That scene was supposed to last at least 4-5 minutes. And the scenery for it, a park, at night, with no one around ?!? WTH !? No cars to crash/explode, no collateral damage (except for the trees and park-benches). Because of this carelessness I'm kinda disappointed to that level that it swayed me from giving this picture a perfect 10/10 score to only 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with part 1, "Iron Man 2" delivers a fast paced kick of action and adrenalin.There is a good story to part 2 and it doesn't have a dull moment. There is action from the very beginning till the end.And of course, the cast is amazing, just as in part one. However, one thing that puzzled me was why they had Gary Shandling in this movie. He was so out of place here, and he looks like he is constantly constipated. But other that than, the cast did a marvelous job. Hats off for Mickey Rourke for his performance in particular.The movie is full of cool effects and lots of wonderful CGI. Truly a treat for the eye.Usually, I am not too keen on movies based on comic books, but the Iron Man movies are actually making it work. So it would be cool with a third one somewhere down the line."Iron Man 2" is definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but not bigger than part One.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film was a huge surprise so expectations for this sequel were quite high, though I try not to hype films up too much. But with an interesting end to part one, "I am Iron Man!" I was licking my lips with anticipation. Would this film live up to the 2008 prequel?The story is about Tony Stark (Downey jnr.) dealing with many different issues at once. From his deteriorating health problems, to confessing his feelings for Pepper Potts (Paltrow), to preventing the US government from taking his Iron suit away from him. And to top things off, we have a new rival who is creating his own suits, a new super-bad guy who wants to destroy him and even his friend, James Rhodes (now played by Don Cheadle) who doesn't really see eye to eye with the billionaire owner of Stark industries.Iron Man 2 has cheesy lines, as do all superhero movies but in this one, the characters know they're cheesy and therefore it's funny. Though the script is good, the sub plot is not. The first film allowed us to feel Tony's pain and see how he became Iron Man, this one lets us see a certain vulnerable side to Tony's character, which is brief but interesting yet it's the actual story that is perhaps the biggest let down, though I have to admit, this film is still fun.Robert Downey Junior was born to play Stark and that fact is confirmed in this film. He breezes his way through the cocky egotistical billionaire and shows us why he is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. His one liner's at time are entertaining to say the least. Gwyneth Paltrow is an excellent actress and she shows it, but a: she doesn't have much to do, and b: is over-shadowed by the new secretary in town. Scarlett Johansson will flaw you with her looks alone. In fact, probably just her looks, but if you ever had doubt about her beauty (and I'm guilty here) then you will be proved wrong as soon as you lay eyes on her. Having said that, her acting is a little robotic and she mostly just broods throughout the film. Her character isn't given much scope and her fight sequences are there to give her something to do. Don Cheadle turns out to be a pleasant surprise. Though I'd have Terrence Howard back any day, due to continuity, Mr. Cheadle puts in a good performance though there are moments where his character is definitely confused-dot-com. Sam Rockwell plays Justin Hammer, Tony's suit-building rival and he is very good. The character is a serious man who at times is the films laughing stock, but that helps the humour in the script, of which there is plenty. Mickey Rouke's character is interesting but doesn't do much. However, Rouke's acting and Russian accent are very good and therefore you appreciate his role in the film.Director Jon Favreau also puts in a funny extended cameo as the body guard and we also get to meet Nick Fury, setting us all up nicely for the upcoming Avengers movie. There are also some quirky references, the best being to Captain America and a cheesy little scenario that takes place at the end of the credits.The action sequences are fantastic. The first one being Whip-lash's introduction at the Monaco Grand Prix. It's exciting, enticing and edgy. The finale is split into two segments, a very long chase involving War Machine, Iron Man and lots of drones. This sequence alone is breathtaking, which inter-cuts with Scarlet's fight sequences. The actual final standoff is a letdown, but that's all I can say. CGI in this movie has really improved and at times it's flawless. You can't imagine how many times I watched that Iron Suit with envy. It's a sexy piece of armour.One thing however that does annoy me about this film, and I do not know how the director or even the production company missed this, is how easily Don Cheadle's character grasps the ins and outs of the prototype upgraded suit, which becomes War Machine. You remember how long it took Stark in the first film to master Iron Man's mystical ways? Sometimes, logic goes out of the window, and that's why, to this date, we don't have a perfect superhero film, except maybe the original Superman movie, but no, there were moments in that that were pathetically illogical too. I also think the director needs to rethink the bad guy for part 3, though rumour has it he is taking the Mandarin as Iron man's nemesis, which is a good and positive move. The reason is that in the two films so far, everyone, good or bad has similar attire; an iron suit with a lovely light on the chest and it becomes a little boring. Flamboyancy is what lacks in these superheroes and let's hope the next instalment can make up for it.BEST SCENE: Whiplash appearing at the grand prix takes my pick as the best moment, and there are a few of them. Just seeing that suit fix onto Tony Stark's semi-battered structure makes me want to go and buy a suit like that. Ah!!!FINAL VERDICT:Not as good as the first yet not so far away. Iron Man 2 is a fun ride and definitely up there with the cream of the Marvel adaptations. Witty, well executed and lots of action make this almost perfect except for a weak sub plot and a few overlooked flaws. Bring on Iron Man 3.8/10 - Admirable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When all is said an done, Iron Man 2 delivers. The question now perhaps is, did we need it in the first place? First things first, Downey simply makes this entire franchise worth watching and waiting for. He's got the Midas touch here when he's the troubled and pseudo egotistical Tony Stark. I simply can't think of a more capable and gifted actor in the last several years who's been able to reposition himself as an elite actor after years of a spiralling demise. What Downey brings to this Marvel tin soldier is depth and heart (even if his seems to be failing). The sequel picks up where the last one left off and for the first hour really has me enjoying these faces again. And with the scope of real domestic issues here, I was captivated. But as the story continues and Marvel simply wants to force feed us the impending crisis (as Sam Jackson seems to keep popping up to remind us) in all various remote locations in the world, we have to start cataloguing what elements are important to the story today and what can be shelved for later. After all, Avengers is still years away. Sam Jackson pops up and then flares up more and more like a case of vaginal warts. He offers the parties involved nothing of substance, but the possibility of a relationship later. More and more characters are introduced, subplots and villains galore and an army of Iron men. All of this occurring at the pinnacle disintegration of Tony Stark. Here Favreau begins to touch on the real dangers that Tony has within him, but finds a quick fix amongst the film canisters of a drunken father. Before you know it, the two hours have whizzed by and you can't help but wonder if you simply watched a retread of of the first Iron Man plot line. The film still works because of the richness of all the characters and it showcases how much the best actors can take what would potentially be a subpar script and make it into a gem.</fullReview>

Downey is again on the mark with his one-liners, and Rockwell was hilarious as a brown-nosing corporate pig. One main villain (who's not as comparable as recent comic book movie villains) fits his role nicely (Rourke is good at being cocky). However, I will say I though Howard brought more to the character of Rodhes' than Cheadle did, but it hardly matters when the War Machine armor is strapped on. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film and all the amazing action sequences it had to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this movie pretty good. Not as good as the first one but it's been a while since I last saw either of them so don't trust me too much on that. Mostly I enjoyed it and here's why.Iron Man 2 attempts to be great by bringing in graver situations and a deeper plot. Like all sequels it's trying hard to go one step further than the first film. I think the graver situation is a brilliant idea (I've always rather liked grim movies) and the solution to it was good too however the more complicated plot had me confused a lot of the time. Several new characters were introduced and next thing you know they're diving into the story like there's no tomorrow. I like that aspect of it. But I think plot-wise this is one of the films I'm going to have to watch again to understand and get a thorough grip on. I'll let you readers decide whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.As for the script, it's fantastic as usual and the actors really make it come alive. Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as always, it's so good to have a hero who can be obnoxious when he wants. I'm beginning to get so tired of those good-doers, but back to this film that side of him was more shown in the first. Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. know what they're doing; they both make the characters seem incredibly realistic with their own strengths and weaknesses despite the fact that one of them is a superhero. Their chemistry is very real and I liked the way the script captured that every now and then inbetween action. As for Iron Man's buddy Rhodey he's had an change of actor and a bit of character too since the first film if you ask me. Who else would beat the crap out of a drunken iron man? Who else would steal one of his best friend's suits? I'm still not sure whether I like those two ideas or not...anyways I think the new actor for him isn't quite as good as the previous one. He still manages to be funny but that's more because of the script than him. I don't know how to describe it but he just hasn't got the same presence as Terrence Howard.Overall I think that being the sequel it has to live up to the first film and it certainly does in some respects trying as hard as it possibly can to do so. Generally that's good enough for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is the 2010 sequel to the amazing 2008 film Iron Man. It stars Robert Downey Jr, Gywneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle and Mickey Rourke. The film was a huge success at the box office, making over $600 millon worldwide. The plot revolves around our hero Tony Stark, who is refusing to hand over the Iron Man technology to the United States government. A new nemesis, Ivan Vanko, is working on a suit of his own using the same technology to get revenge against the Stark family for what they did to his own. Tony has to wield his armour once again to stop Vanko once and for all...I would like to point out first that I believe this film is inferior to the original. That film felt a lot more developed, serious and more realistic. Iron Man 2 is a great movie filled with action and some witty dialogue, but in the end it falls short of the seriousness of the original movie. This film also abolished the responsible Tony Stark seen at the end of the original film, turning him back into his arrogant, boastful self once again. I also didn't like the villain choice. The villain was tough and epic, but at times was boring, uninteresting and just came out of nowhere. The action sequences also felt inferior. The original had Iron Man flying to a war zone to kill terrorists and then flee from F22 raptors. Now, we get a far too quick fight on a race track and a comedic battle to the tune of Another One Bites the Dust by Queen. It seems as if the creators wanted to play around the CGI equipment, resulting in the action sequences becoming far less serious and significant to the plot.Speaking of the CGI, it is also really inferior. The Iron Man suit looks a lot more plastic like. The metallic details present in the original don't seem to be here, and as a result the CGI looks a lot less convincing. Nevertheless, it's still good. The movie is also riddled with several (but very minor) plot holes, such as Colonel Rhodes sudden knowledge of how to activate the Iron Man suit. Speaking of Rhodes, the recasting of him was partially successful in my eyes. They made the character the same, only in this movie he also seems to be a bit of an asshole, but I think the sheer difference in appearance between Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard make it difficult to recognize him as the same character. I believe appearance is a major factor when it comes to bringing characters alive. You associate actors with characters, so changing actors creates an odd feeling.The film isn't all bad, however. It does lack some action like the original film but does use it's talking scenes to develop the plot, so it's not all a waste. The inclusion of War Machine was awesome, though he could have had more screen time, and the final battle was also great fun but a little too short and abruptly ended. Though it contains some flaws with character development, CGI action scenes, over the top comedy and some minor plot holes, Iron Man 2 is an entertaining super hero movie that will delight fans of the invincible super hero. Don't expect it to be as serious and moving as the original, but still expect an enjoyable, appealing summer movie.I give this film a 6/10.</fullReview>

As always, Chitwell McGregor is on hand and is just awesome- who is more funny than him? His facial expressions alone deserve comedy awards!!! True this film is not gonna win any awards but who cares?! It has a great supporting cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly! Its is funny, enjoyable and a really good holiday picture.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't hinder the potential for Iron Man 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is harsh, inappropriate, and perhaps a bit exaggerated to compare this sequel to the likes of the third installment in the Spider-Man franchise, but I couldn't help but think of how both just seem to deflate any momentum their potential sagas have going. The difference is that while "Spider-Man 3" was over done and downright laughable at times, "Iron Man 2"is just simply... done. There is little to hate about the film, but not much to really like.This installment lacks the episodic quality most superhero films require. There is too much downtime and too few points of interest to allow for a wide enough landscape to justify the two hours worth of material. After the exhilarating sense of discovery we experienced on the first film, the sequel needs some emotional draw and high risk scenarios. By the time you reach the super charged final battle sequence it is simply too little, too late.The film also seems to assume that everyone who saw the original installment stayed past the credits to see Samuel L. Jackson's cameo. The introduction of Nick Fury is nonexistent and it comes off as mildly silly to have this character with an eye-patch (however cool it may look) suddenly come into the scene if you are unfamiliar with the background, which for the most part, I am. The beauty of the original was its accessibility to the masses who aren't familiar with the lore of Iron Man, but this installment lacks that same quality.The menace that was Obadiah in the original is not given an adequate replacement. Mickey Rourke serves well as Whiplash but the role is reduced to a minimal two main sequences. Justin Hammer is played well by Sam Rockwell but his character's antics and goals are kind of silly and don't really raise the stakes very high. Also, isn't Natasha suppose to become Black Widow or something? Is there not suppose to be a hint that she's going to go through a transformation of some sort? I'm not even sure who Black Widow is but I kind of expected to get some sort of nod in that general direction. That disappointed me. I know nothing about the lore of the comics, so forgive me if I had inappropriate expectations.It's a worthy enough sequel that doesn't carry the franchise forward very much, but also doesn't really hinder the potential for an Iron Man 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As in any Marvel movie, there has to be action, and were there is action, there is a story and plot line, while the story crashes, the plot stays OK.I had to go back and watch this movie again to see all the fails in it. It felt to much like the first and the first was much better than the first, there may not have been as much action, but the story and the plot were much better. A Russian Scientist has created a new type of weapon that he intends to kill Iron Man with, and is later to work with a weapons creator "HAMMER". To create a new version of the Iron Man Suit. As the action was OK, everything else failed. This was in a way a disappointing movie that I would not recommend to anyone, if you liked it great, I'm sure that their are people who really enjoyed it, i didn't, felt to much like a stupid futuristic movie.6/10Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, I thought that this one was not excellent, but just as good as the first one. It continues where Iron Man 1 left off, and introduces plenty of new characters that die-hard comic book fans will know by heart. The action never stops. Plenty of good CGI. The soundtrack is classic rock by AC/DC and there's some laughs. Comparing it to that other super hero movie of the last decade is easy....it ain't no Dark Knight but is more like Superman II. Stay after the end credits for a bonus scene. This is the best superhero movie of 2010, period. Too bad Terence Howard doesn't do a good of a job as Don Cheadle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always had and in fact always will have a sense of awe on the level of technology Hollywood manages to apply in creating motion pictures. The sequences, sets, artwork etc. look extremely genuine on screen that gives us a real time experience. Now, there is a popular sect of movies in Hollywood that boasts extravaganza in everything except a logical storyline and among them as one of the front runners is Iron Man 2. Directed by Jon Favreau, the director for the first venture of Iron Man series casts all the same actors in the previous roles and the new ones being Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle and Mickey Rourke in this sequel which boasts almost twice the quality of the visual effects produced by the first film. Tony Stark is back, this time as the most popular figure in the world because he is the IRON MAN. After the dramatic revealing of his secret identity, Tony Stark pledges to achieve universal peace. But all superheroes cannot carry out their 'good job' so easily; there are always obstacles in the form of villains. So does iron man, who faces hostility in every clichéd way possible. Very much like Spiderman 3 , Iron man 2 fails to impress due to two reasons. Robert Downey Jr plays very redundantly throughout without experimenting and Gwyneth Paltrow plays her role like a zombie. I doubt whether Don Cheadle actually had any idea about his role in the movie because he moves back and forth with the nature of his character. Scarlett Johansson looks stunning but again lacks a well defined role. The only relief in terms of acting was Mickey Rourke who did justice to his role though not given much screen space. So in first case the lack of character definition provided the major flaw to the movie. If the actors had done a good job, I wouldn't have cared much about the complex storyline. For one thing, the sequences are so startling that one thing struck me immediately; the filmmakers have lost all respect for the world. So here, the second factor too comes to effect where the director has complicated the theme with less of logic and more of mindless destruction and in a way terrorism too. So if you are ready for a thrilling and chilling ride with lot of explosions, firing and iron man vs. iron man and if you think the story accounts to nothing, then iron man 2 is the one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, and well worth your money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I will keep this review short and sweet. The movie was good. It wasn't a mediocre movie, and it wasn't amazing, but it was a fun movie. Iron Man 2 feels like a sequel should, an extension of the first. There were dull parts, and exiting parts, and the villain is very interesting, but somewhat unbelievable. The fact that he is a poor Russian living on the street, but somehow a scientist, I still have problems with. There are still lots of funny, Playboy-oriented parts, and lots of butt-kicking action scenes. One of the two problems that I have with this movie is that problem is that, without spoiling the movie, it got somewhat unreal near the end, specifically on how a certain-other someone can fly the suit without experience. The other reason is that, there really isn't anything new, it is very much like the first movie, and if you didn't like the first, it won't do anything to draw newcomers in, but fans of Iron Man and the comics will be pleased. Although I prefer the first, it is hard to make a sequel that is better than the original, and this is almost as good as the first. I payed $11.00 to see this movie, and I don't regret it. I will most likely buy it on Blu-Ray (or DVD), and I am thinking about buying the first as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I made my daily IMDb check a few months ago and saw a concrete date for an Iron Man sequel, I called up my best friend and we both cried tears of joy. Then reality started setting in and i started thinking about not only the well known reputation of sequels, but the reputation especially of superhero sequels. Given that there are a few exceptional and even better sequels to superhero movies e.g. Spider-man 2, X-Men 2, The Dark Knight etc. So I started to become skeptical. as the date drew closer and i saw trailers being released, I became even more afraid. The idea of multiple superheroes was shown in the trailers and immediately my thoughts strayed to the utter disappointment of *swallow* Spider-man 3. So naturally i became even more afraid. opening night I went to go see it, nail biting the whole way in and secretly thumbing a rosary in my pocket... OK not really... When the movie started, The fear of another SM3 was wiped away. From start to finish this movie is definitely exceptional. the action is brilliant as are the special effects, and Robert Downey Jr. brings the screen to life again as the smooth talking Tony Stark. The multiple Heroes/Villains technique was also played off very well this time around and during the movie subtle (some not so much) hints were dropped about a third movie (DON'T MAKE ANOTHER MISTAKE MARVEL!) overall, excellent sequel that is just as good if not better than the original. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Favreau's followup to his 2008 smash hit Iron Man, based on the Marvel Comics superhero. We reunite with Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) right where we left him. He has announced to the world that he is indeed the man inside the suit of armor, and the world has never been safer because of it. Tony has run into a bit of a snag when the government tries taking the suit from him because they see it as a weapon, while Tony calls it a "shield". Meanwhile other copycats are attempted but fail, making the Iron Man suit a one of a kind, and therefore not a global threat.Well, like any good superhero story, a villain surfaces. Ivan Vanko (known in the comic book world as Whiplash, played here by Mickey Rourke), a Russian engineer whose father worked with Tony's father Howard. Vanko is out for redemption for what the Stark family has done to his, so in true evil villain fashion, Vanko tries to take out Stark with his own weapon design, only with some minor modifications.Back home in the US, Tony is bombarded with requests for his suit by the military, including his friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes a.k.a. War Machine (Don Cheadle). Tony is also feeling some pressure to join the organization S.H.I.E.L.D., a group spearheaded by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who is essentially creating a Justice League like group that in the comic book world includes Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, and Thor to name a few.The majority of the film focuses on Tony and what his legacy will be. Is the Iron Man a weapon or a shield for the country to get behind? Is it a hazard or a necessity? Tony must decide what is right for his company, his country, and himself. His faces congressional committees, the media, and terrorist threats. It's not an easy life for the man in the shiny suit.As far as sequels go this one is not bad. What I was hoping it would do that it failed to do was add something different to the franchise. The action in my opinion is worse. It's to forced and over the top, unlike the first film where the action meant something. He battled his way out of a cave of terrorists, he saved a village under attack, and he fought the man who tried to ruin his company and keep selling weapons to the rest of the world. Here he fights a swarm of robots, his friend, and a the main villain twice, the first of which is cool, the second being lame.I was pleased with the acting of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, one of Stark's competitors. Rockwell is building up an impressive body of work as of late (excluding Gentlemen Broncos) and this film is no exception. He is smarmy and gets under your skin. I was also pleased with Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson (plays Tony's assistant). Neither one annoyed me or took away from the main line of action.The real winner for me was the screenplay by Justin Theroux. Downey Jr. played his role perfectly and hit each line the way he should have. The only character who I thought lacked the most was Rourke's. I thought he was at a disadvantage to begin with because he spoke limited English and had a Russian accent. I wasn't a huge fan of him overall in the film. Not sure if it's the character or the actor. Either way, I could have done without him.What I am curious about is whether or not the Iron Man franchise will be done with. I am aware that The Avengers is in the works (the group of super hero mentioned earlier) so he will all but surely get a part in that. Whether or not he'll get a new movie by himself is up in the air for me. They need a really, really strong villain that has interesting abilities and can speak English.Overall a good movie. A little too much emphasis on product placement and neat gadgets, but a a good movie nonetheless. Those expecting a solid action packed thrill ride might be let down by the in between moments, but I think for the most part people can enjoy this film. No glaring flaws. Just a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong follow-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this comic-book-movie sequel, industrialist Tony Stark battles a new electric-whip-wielding enemy, plus the US government, plus a rival weapons maker, and ? of course ? himself. Iron Man 2 met my expectations as a solid popcorn-movie followup, complete with believable characters, a plausible plot, and lots and lots of action.Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), revealed to the world as Iron Man in the first film is quickly subpoenaed by Congress, which wants his weapons. Stark, of course, is adamant that the feds not get their hands on, well, his own body. This leads to the introduction of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), who holds many government contracts and who is apparently insanely jealous of Tony Stark's success.Meanwhile, in a far-off land, a tattooed Mickey Rourke ? playing a Russian physicist, no less ? plots his revenge on Stark, something about his dad being done wrong by Stark's dad lo those many years ago. And this leads to Rourke becoming Whiplash, a man powered by a device similar to Stark's own chest implant, only with giant electric whips. Neat trick, huh? That the military eventually ? okay, quickly ? gets its hands on one of Stark's suits shouldn't come as much of a surprise. But in this movie, anyway, the army isn't the bad guy, so there's that. After all, Stark's best buddy is James "Rhodey" Rhodes, played here by the excellent Don Cheadle, who's a lieutenant colonel. And you just know, having seen the first movie, that Rhodey will suit up himself here, as War Machine.Although the movie gets off to a slow start, focusing a bit too much on Stark the person rather than on Iron Man the action dude, it perks up when other characters enter the fray, particularly Scarlett Johansson as a notary in the employ of Stark Enterprises. (Note: She's not just a notary.) Downey Jr. is amiable as always as Tony Stark, and it's as great of a fit here as before. (Some would say this role represents typecasting for Downey Jr.) Stark is brave but vulnerable, smart but besotted. He's lost without Pepper Potts, his assistant and true love, and their relationship dips and crests throughout the movie as well.In fact, all returning actors reprise their roles rather well, and most of the new ones immerse themselves in the Iron Man universe seamlessly ? including, I should note, Samuel L. Jackson, who barely appeared in the first Iron Man movie but is in several more scenes this time around, as Nick Fury. Yes, THE Nick Fury. Garry Shandling's also on board as an oleaginous senator.Only real quibble is with Rockwell as the slimy Hammer. At first, this looked like a role more suited to Greg Kinnear ? smarmy white dude ? which would be beneath Rockwell, who's a strong actor. But later on it looked more like Rockwell was too ? pardon me ? cute for the role as Hammer, who turns out to be much more ruthless than at first blush. Sam Rockwell doesn't look ruthless at all, and he isn't convincingly ruthless.Still, quite a bit of fun. There should be at least one more IM film, says director Jon Favreau (who has an on screen role as well, as #1 helperdude Happy Hogan).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sequel, still the better comic book movies from recent Marvel offerings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's anything I hate about a movie, it's a sequel that fails to live up to its predecessor's quality (I'm looking at you, X-Men 3, Spider-Man 3). But hey, while it's not as good as Iron Man, Iron Man 2 is a good comic book movie, not for everybody though.Robert Downey Jr continues to impress, I can't imagine anybody else playing a better Tony Stark than him. Downey and Paltrow have such on screen chemistry, they carry the whole movie. I love the rest of the casts as well, Mickey Rourke is oddly charismatic as Whiplash, Scarlett Johanson is hot as Black Widow, Sam Rockwell made Justin Hammer so damn cool. But Don Cheadle steals the show as the new Rhodey, I wish he has more screen time.The actions are pretty if a bit tame, but if you're in it for the action, there's a lot to see here. A showdown at a Monaco racetrack early in the movie, where Tony pulls a CGI briefcase that unfolds into an armor is the highlight for me. As a 3D animator, I couldn't help but stare at the screen with envy. Your mileage may vary though, I'm not sure girls would appreciate two guys in super suits fighting a battalion of robots as much as guys would. This movie is very much an advertisement for Marvel's 2012 Superhero mash-up The Avengers, and that's why it can be pretty complicated (or boring) for people who are not familiar with the Marvel universe.I think I'm one of the few in the theater who knows exactly why a black man with an eye-patch and a hot Russian femme fatale, from a secret government organization called "S.H.I.E.L.D". keeps bothering Tony Stark about "The Avenger Initiative". Expect cameos from Captain America's shield and Thor's Mjolnir. All in all, though not as lauded as Iron Man and Chris Nolan's two Batman films, this is a good comic book movie. It's made by people who have such passion and respect towards the original material, and it shows in the final product, I hope all the future Marvel movies receive the same treatment. Knowledge of the Marvel comics' universe may help you enjoy the movie more though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a sequel to the excellent original you expect more and better. While this movie isn't bad it did not wow me like the first one did. Robert Downy junior is excellent and does save the movie from getting extremely dull. I can understand the director's approach to make this superhero movie into something more. But in doing so he sacrificed the one thing that matters the most in movies like this,action. There is not enough action. And the action that was depicted wasn't nearly as exciting as it was in the original. For a movie about Iron Man there just wasn't enough Iron Man to be enjoyed. And let's face it. That is the one reason people are coming to see this movie. To me the plot in an action movie is always secondary. Since in this case the focus was on the story I do have to say something about it. Well,that is going to be difficult. There is no coherent plot to speak of. And as a result it is far less compelling than it could have been. The villain (Mickey Rourke) isn't bad ass enough to actually be taken as a serious threat. The introduction of Black Widow showed promise,but ultimately was more used as window dressing. Finally we got to see War Machine in action. Still far to brief for my liking. All in all there is a decent movie but nowhere near the level of the far superior original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too fractured</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picking up where the first Iron Man film left off this film continues the tale of Tony Stark, the rich and somewhat eccentric inventor of technologies most people can only dream of.Being a typical action film this one is filled to the rim with explosions, chases, fire and women that are too beautiful to actually exist. There is a story line and it isn't half bad - it's enough for a decent film. But, and this is a major but, as it tries to mimic the stories from the cartoons it skips through this story a bit too quickly at times leaving gaping holes and making the film feel like running across a giant Swiss cheese where you have to jump the holes to make it to the other side.The appearing Nemesis is fun to watch and the trails that are left to the Avengers are clear enough - but fitting, somewhat. Appearance of most characters is good - just a few that are a bit dodgy (Johansson didn't really work for me in this one) All in all, this is popcorn cinema, but not the best of it. It can be enjoyed, but there's better things out there to enjoy. If it had been less fractured it would have been very good.6 out of 10 amazing sources of energy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iron Man 2" could be critically bashed a hundred times over. So just have fun with it instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man 2" was a good sequel. I am only so simple with words because that is all it was frankly. Now before I sound like an unsatisfied little boy, I thought the movie was very entertaining, therefore it did it's job well. I hate comparing sequels to their predecessors, but the reality is that nowadays or just "right now", when it comes to a series the "bar" must continue to be raised higher and higher and higher. I can guarantee myself that this is a very rare thing; for the "bar" to continue to grow higher. I will not compare "Iron Man 2" to any other film because all films are different and that is just unfair. But anyways back to business. As I sat beside my easily-impressed, overall fun friend in the theatre, much yearning to take a washroom break (perhaps this affected my perception of the film), I was wishing I could just have a fun time like him as he laughed his head off at all these comedic scenes. But me being me, I found it hard to ignore the questions running through my mind. It was impossible for me to push away the feeling that the mood in "Iron Man 2" was continually changing. As in, every 30 seconds. During scenes that seemed to be giving off a rather serious mood, I remember thinking the film right there was trying to make me feel concerned for so and so. But then the feeling instantly vanished as if I was supposed to forget about it and laugh. This happened quite a number of times.I won't bother debate about the "realness" of "Iron Man 2". I would only say the visual effects were incredible and among the best around right now. I'm sure an incredible amount of time, effort and money were put into that. The only troubling thing was that the huge amount of CGI took away much of the "human" feeling in the movie. That is, the film element that very much helps me connect with the characters. This is the same problem that I had with "Transformers 2". But then again, this isn't a review on that movie at all. So I'll kick myself now and move on.In this movie Robert Downey Jr. gave a solid performance just as he does in the first film. Some other characters however were more "invisible". What I am trying to say by that is many of the characters with smaller roles had no depth. They seemed to be there for the sake of having another joke in the film. Then again, maybe I'm just boring.Anyways, it is not my intention at all to make you turn away from watching this film. I just figured perhaps if you are reading this after going on "IMDB" you are someone looking for something more critical than "It was a good movie.", which you'll find almost everywhere else on the internet. I hate communicating like this because you could get the very wrong impression that I did not like "Iron Man 2". I really, really liked it.So the bottom line is: If you are like my awesome friend: go right now and see this movie. If you are like me: go right now and see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is based on the Marvel comic book series. Six months after Billionaire Tony Stark (Played by Robert Downey Jr.) has freely admitted to the whole world that HE is Iron Man, he is now being asked by the government to hand over the Iron Man suit, which he refuses to do. He appoints his secretary Pepper Potts (Played by Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries. He tries to deal with several dangerous things, such as a rising toxicity level within his blood from using the Iron Man suit, his friend James Rhodes (Played by Don Cheadle) using one of Tony's suits to become "War Machine", and a dangerous new supervillain named Ivan Vanko (Played by Mickey Rourke) arriving on the scene.And what did I think of the film itself? I thought it was rather fun, not as good as the first though.I think one of it's main problems was the script, which seemed to get a little hectic while balancing all the subplots, but it didn't drive it to the point of no return. It was a nice story. Fast paced, although the length is noticeable once or twice.Performances are pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. once again shines as Tony Stark, adding much needed humor to the movie. He and Gwyneth Paltrow have excellent chemistry together, Paltrow herself is a great performer. The same chemistry can't exactly be said for Downey and Don Cheadle. Cheadle was alright, but Terrence Howard just played the character better. And Scarlett Johansson seemed to add little to the story as Natalie Rushman aka. Black Widow, she seemed like eye candy, but what gorgeous eye candy.Now villains. Mickey Rourke played a really good villain, Sam Rockwell, not as much. He tries to be funny, but half of the time it's a bit more annoying than funny. But, I won't deny that it was still a good role.The Visuals of this movie are remarkable, once again Industrial Light &amp; Magic has brought brilliance to the screen. But what good is a movie without it's Sound? The sound design is just as brilliant in the movie, and I think I see another possible two Oscar nominations to Christopher Boyes' tally.In short, the film is a bit over the place, but it's still thrilling, hilarious, and features some good performances.I give it **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anything that's the media these days is that sequels rarely surpass the original in turns of epic scope and balls-to-the-wall action with the exception of The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 as well as the first two X-Men films and Hellboy 2. In my opinion Iron Man 2 is an entertaining and bombastic superhero movie that does well with what you expect from a sequel to the first hit back in '08 but it falls really short on some levels.Well, to put it quite frankly, the sequel itself doesn't feel as coherent as the first film which did a great job of setting up the hero and the suit he uses to fight evil with great doses of humor, warmth, and charm. There are so funny lines in the film but the jokes fall flat and don't have that serious bite that was prevalent in the first film. But the biggest flaw is the story. So many loose threads are left hanging and are never resolved again. I was pleased with the introduction of Whiplash(played excellently by Mickey Rourke)and his motivation to go toe-to-toe with ol' Shellhead, but the film rarely goes in depth into his personality and his inner workings for the audience to truly sympathize with this character. Add to the fact that Natasha Rushman/Romanov known as Black Widow has barely any decent character development along with Sam Jackson as Nick Fury and you have a film that leaves you cold in that respect.Though a plot is essential to telling the story, I was really let down by the lack of action scenes in the film. I enjoyed the fight between Iron Man and Whiplash in the early part of the film as well as between War Machine, but there wasn't enough action to get my adrenaline pumping like it did in the first film. By the end of the film where you thought you was gonna get a satisfying climax, the fight between Iron Man, War Machine, and Whiplash(who looked more impressive than when he first appeared) was over FAR too quickly for it to be truly awesome. Needless to say I was let down BIG time.There's one scene that I felt defied logic. When Iron Man arrives to confront Justin Hammer near the end of the film, Whiplash programs the drones to kill Iron Man and not only that, use War Machine to attack him as well; one of the best scenes in the whole film. But when the robots start firing their weapons, absolutely everyone in the building suffers NO casualties whatsoever. Then finally when Whiplash is defeated, he sets off a self-destruct switch that programs all the robots to explode yet in the aftermath of such event, we witness no injuries or deaths that actually happened. This movie was supposed to show the consequences of letting weapons of mass destruction out into the public yet we never witness the horror of it.With all that said, is Iron Man 2 a good film. The answer is a fair yes and I was entertained. However, there's no denying that it is the weakest compared to the first film which I enjoyed a lot. With the recent news that Iron Man 2 will tie into the upcoming Avengers film, I feel somewhat skeptical as to how this all is gonna play out. I like superhero movies but when they start crossing over into other universes, it becomes all too much. Iron Man 2 is a good film but it's story and plot leaves a lot to be desired.</fullReview>

To make matters worse an evil inventor from Russia named Ivan(Mickey Rourke) manages to copy Tonys technology, and become Whiplash, and he teams up with Tonys rival Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell) in hopes to beat Iron Man at his own game, will Tony defeat before it's too late? I like Robert Downey Jr, and the effects where incredible. I liked Gwenyth Paltrow, Scarlett Johannson, Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and Samual L. Jackson. But Don Cheadle seemed out of place, who is replacing Terrance Howard. Nothing against Don Cheadle he was alright, but Terrance Howard made that role from the first one. Like I said it was entertaining, but not as driven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite Spider-Man 2, but worth the wait.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An awaited sequel with high expectations, Iron Man 2 will definitely satisfy the summer movie goer's need for a action packed film. My original expectations for the film were that it would be as good, if not better than the original Iron Man. Although the film didn't live up to my expectations, it did everything, but disappoint. Although campy in some parts, the film succeeds in building on Tony Stark's character crisis, provides humor in unexpected places, and drops many clues for the future Avengers film. I would have loved to give this film a 7.5, but couldn't score it as high as an 8, so a 7 will have to suffice. If you enjoyed the original film you will more than likely love this one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie was enjoyable, but they just tried to pack too much into one movie. Any one thing in the movie did not receive enough attention and the movie lacked because of it. The special effects were good and the action sequences were fun. The acting was as expected and Mickey Rourke stole the camera. Don Cheadle worked, but there was no common thread that held the movie together. They attempted to tackle way too many topics. I have given worst movies the same score, but this movie never came together for me. I am honestly just excited for Avengers movie. Everything else is secondary until that movies comes out. I enjoyed the movie, but I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone. This is the type of movie that I would watch if it was on TV, but I do not think I would ever sit down and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If every second part was a Terminator II oder a Dark Knight, this one could have been a disappointment. The truth is, most second parts are just not as good as the original. That one line very much sums up, what I think about the movie I've just seen. Don't misunderstand what I'm saying. Iron Man 2 is fun to look at, it is worth the money, if not for the visuals (seen that before), at all events for the soundtrack. AC/DC just sound great coming from a cinema-sound-system - the one thing, by the way, that definitely got better in comparison to the first part: there are two AC/DC songs in this movie. If they continue that way, I'm really looking forward to part 5 or 6. Apart from the soundtrack, the dialogues are funny most of the time, and really well done in one scene or the other. Especially when Mickey Rourke lurks around. On the other hand, you may start wondering, why he is lurking around at all... But let's not start counting the plot-holes or wondering about the motives of the villains, or why the 'Hammer' doesn't lose his lollipop to the next best gangster-wannabe from his own outfit. If you watch this movie and wait a year, you'll probably remember some not-so-special good old Hollywood-action-flick-handiwork, a rocking soundtrack and one or two pointed quotes. And, maybe, you remember the few scenes that were not so standard-action-flick-like at all and more like those boring, slow moving things where they actually take the time to paint a character from different angles and try to take a closer look at his thoughts or motives. And when you think of that, you'll be looking forward to the third part. Not only because of AC/DC, that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Iron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a few years ago the careers of Robert Downy Jr. and Mickey Rourke looked like the smoldering aftermath of one of the explosive battles in Iron man 2. Now they're together staring in one of the biggest movies of the summer. The problem is biggest does not always mean best.Downy reprises his role as weapons mogul Tony Stark. We pick up the story after Stark announces he is Iron man. Soon we are pulled along with him as he's stretched every direction by the government, friends and enemies. As he's spiraling out of control he becomes somewhat of an ass but Downey's irresistible charm pulls you through.Rourke joins the cast as a disgruntled Russian baddie who invents his own suit and weapons manufacturer and rival to stark, Justin hammer (Sam Rockwell) finances his operation. Rourke steals almost every scene he's in with little dialogue. His presents on the screen is commanding. Rockwell is solid, as Downys smarmy know it all rival. But in the end the show belongs to Tony Stark. Downey keeps you hanging on every word with the help of Justin Theroux's dialogue. There is sharp wit and bite with every snarky comment. The movie oozes humor and it saves the picture.While Theroux wrote great dialogue, his story suffers from a bloated plot. Too many new and uninteresting characters such as the members of S.H.E.I.L.D. put a speed bump in the middle of the movie throwing of the pacing a bit. Sam Jackson and Scarlett Johansson give wooden performances that take away screen time from the Downy, Paltrow would be romance and the more interesting plot line of Starks daddy issues. I understand that they are trying to set up an Avengers movie but not at the cost of Iron Man.The action is bigger and louder as you would expect in a summer sequel, but is unnecessary. Its always gonna be more fun to see one dastardly bad guy pummel the hero, than whole mess of not so dastardly ones get ripped to shreds. The smaller action scenes do work but the climax leaves the movie down flat. In the end Iron Man 2 leaves you wanting a little more man and a lot less iron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well what do you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you went to see the first Iron Man movie what were you expecting? Thats right, Guns, Women and Explosions and lots of them and that's precisely what you got. Now that the second movie is out I have heard many people complain that it is rubbish and not as good as the old one and I ask myself "What film did they go and see?" Because when I saw the new Iron Man I loved it. I don't mean in a "film of all time" kinda way, I mean in a "seat gripping adrenalin" kind of way. It has all the essential elements of the previous movie with the addition of Scarlett Johansson which, in my books, is a very welcome one. Now this isn't the first time that I have heard people say this about a film which leads me to thinking that there is a sub-culture of people whose MO is to immediately dislike a sequel. Granted, in most case the sequels are never as good as the original but when you are considering movies like Iron Man you can't maintain too high an expectation or you will always be disappointed. With this movie I think they did good.To conclude, the long and the short of the movie is this, starts off where the last finished, starts going out of control, chaos, nearly dies, avengers do their bit, new suit, big fight, the end. Walk out into the sun, look up dazed and go "Mental, I want that suit" Have a beer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as great as I had hoped but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the comic book, Iron Man. I perhaps always have. I also loved the first Iron Man movie. I'm not a purist, I just think it's a fun story. And it probably helps that I also enjoy TheOnion's video they did making fun of Iron Man's trailer back in 2008. Classic! However I digress...The good parts of this story are simply what you can surmise from watching the trailer: 1.) Bad Ass robots and suits all over the place. If you are someone who like the nerdgasm that sits at the heart of the Iron Man story then you are going to like some of the battles. 2.) There's a pretty good badguy in Sam Rockwell. Could have been a bit stronger but he's becomes a better baddie by the end of this sequel. The Mickey Rourke character was okay. Could have made it still a bit stronger. 3.) MINOR SPOILER: Personal angst and drama of Tony Stark. Ehhhhh. It was not so enjoyable this time. Mainly because we have to deal with an issue that plagues him throughout the story until (of course) he solves it at which point you may be shrugging and thinking, "Okay, check that problem off the list. Next problem Tony will have to innovate around?" I think at this point whatever angst he might have had in the first movie about his father-son issues and his doubts about his own purpose gets pushed to the side which is a real shame, because, heck, that was a vulnerable part of Tony where he found himself actually contemplating his own mortality and and purpose in the world. So, my opinion? Pushing that very cool dramatic father-son issue to the side was probably not the best choice. But heck, at least it wasn't completely forgotten. And it did play a certain role in him figuring out his own next invention. But seriously, too many dramatic issues in one two hour movie made the overall treatment of the dramatic issues rather shallow -- too much ground to cover, too little time. Over all, I still give it an 8 out of 10. Not saying it was exactly what I had hoped for but it was still rather satisfying. May not see it again for a while, but that's okay. I'll still go see the next one... and probably the ones after that if they make them...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't go for this genre of movie--comic book action if you will. I didn't see the first "Iron Man" installment, and probably would not have seen this one had I not owed a favor, lol. But I'm glad I saw it. I think it was good enough for what it was intended to be. I can't say that I'm surprised it was a solid film because I knew beforehand it had a superb cast of actors in it. And though it might not be anywhere near a 10 on the IMDb scale (I'm giving it a solid 7), for someone who wants to pass away a couple of hours and be entertained, to laugh and ooh and ahh at the action and special effects, this movie works.I will admit that it did drag a little in the middle and I even dozed off for a short spell. However, when I awoke, I was able to jump right back in and still leave the movie theater fulfilled. And I think that's the perfect description of the film overall.As in all good sequels, if you can jump in and "get" the movie without having seen the prequel, nine times out of ten, that denotes a solid film. The plot is kind-of thin, so there's not a lot of intense thinking and figuring out things involved, which means it's light-hearted. So if you're looking for an intense mystery or something, this is not your movie. However, if you just want to be entertained and laugh at a cute dialogue and "ooh and ahh" at special effects, this movie works.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a real fan of Iron Man movie. The first one took me off the ground by getting Iron Man's character right!!! This time around, Tony's back and Robert Downey Jr. did a fabulous job as Tony and Iron Man. War Machine looks good but only with his mask on. Now story wise, the movie fell short. Mickey Rourke did a fabulous job yet again. However, I'd have loved to see Iron Man do the things that he does in the cartoons; Blow #$%@ up and save the day. Hope, next installment, they get it right. Samuel L Jackson, playing Nick Fury was good. He is the man who will start the Avenger. In fact, in the end, we see Tony filling in for Avenger Initiation project. After the credits, you see a hammer lying on a huge pit. This suggests that the mighty God of Thunder, Thor could be expected soon in an upcoming project with Iron Man. Maybe, Iron Man 3??? To sum it up, I got the worth of my money spent in the theater. Full Price by me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Lo my friends and step softly for the time is upon us. Yes, the chattering, nattering Cyclops of another summer blockbuster season looms on the horizon and that means for the next four months we shall bear witness to a glorious parade of A-Listers, abundant CGI, myriad explosions, scripts of questionable cogency and of course, the first shadowy harbingers of NEXT year's summer blockbuster season. (You're a teasing sonuvabitch J.J. Abrams. Yes you are) Leading the cavalcade of popcorn munchers this year is IRON MAN 2, a worthy follow up to the 2008 original, if not exactly the supersonic laser-powered upgrade I'd been hoping for.The plot, (for those of you with the amazing ability to somehow avoid the ad campaign while still possessing an internet connection) is as follows. Despite being a billionaire superhero, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has loads of problems. His company is in disarray, the government wants him to hand over the Iron Man technology, and that very same tech is slowly poisoning his blood. As if that wasn't bad enough, along comes Ivan Vanko (Rourke -- the least likely Russian physicist you'll ever encounter I'd wager) a scary looking' fella with access to Stark's technology and a penchant for laser whips. After smacking our hero around on a race track in Monaco, Vanko is spirited away from prison by Justin Hammer (Rockwell) a corporate rival to Stark who wants to 'make Iron Man look like an antique'. All the craziness leads to a crisis of faith for Tony, which in this case means being loud and obnoxious while wearing his robotic duds. His buddy, James Rhodes (Cheadle) has about all of the crap he can take and hijacks one of the spare suits, leading to the christening of War Machine, a character far too competent to be referred to as a mere sidekick. Long story short, Stark broods in humorous fashion, gets his mojo back and helps his partner in robo- justice take down a squadron of murderous drones built by Hammer and programmed by Vanko. Oh and Nick Fury (Jackson) and the Black Widow (Johansson) are hanging around too, presumably because it was a slow couple of days in the Marvel Universe.So what's good? As in the first installment, this is Robert Downey Jr.'s show to steal and he makes most of the opportunity, proving to be the most entertaining and charismatic of the super powered bunch in recent memory. Even when the script has him doing things that border on absolutely silly (eating donuts while lounging in a giant donut or skeet shooting random objects with energy blasters) he makes Stark an engaging, flawed protagonist who's just as interesting as his world saving alter-ego. The rest of the cast holds up well, though it may be just a bit too large to make full use of everyone. While there's plenty for Cheadle and Paltrow to play with, Rourke and Rockwell don't really have enough time to develop as truly menacing threats, which is a shame because they both do a fine job when they're on screen, Rockwell especially plays the sleazy industrialist type to a tee and I could see him making a return later on down the line. The whole 'not having enough to do' problem goes double for Johansson and Jackson, the Widow has to wait til the last act to beat up a generic squad of goons, while Fury seems to hang around merely to tease us about THE AVENGERS. Effects are top notch as expected, Iron Man and War Machine look spot on as do the various beams, blasts and booms doled out by their arsenals. Same goes for the carnage inflicted by Vanko's energy whips -- it's just too bad they don't feature into the story more as he's a much more interesting villain than the swarm of drones in the finale, which, while realistic, come off as rather, well, drone-like.What's not so good? I know it seems like a harsh judgment to make against a flick of this nature but there are some parts of IM2 when it just gets too silly for its own good. Which bugs the crap out of me because the original knew when to play it safe and when to let loose with the one-liners. Now there are some memorable dramatic moments sprinkled throughout (Stark meeting Vanko in prison, the developing relationship between Stark and Pepper Potts) but they come off as tragically outnumbered by bad comedy or just straight-up wonkiness. The whole DJ sequence at the birthday party being a perfect example of the former while the bit with the gigantic table of mysterious fatherly revelations typifies the latter. Seriously, while that was going on I thought the erstwhile Mr. Stark had unknowingly wandered into a third NATIONAL TREASURE. Now, a friend of mine pointed out the inherent nitpickiness of bitching about a secret laden table in a movie where the main character flies around and fights evil in an indestructible suit but it still doesn't sit right with me dammit. Finally, I love robot on robot violence as much as anyone else, but he fought the Ironmonger at the end of the first film, couldn't we step outside the over-sized mech suit category the second time around? And if not, couldn't you at least have the courtesy to bring in the Crimson Dynamo?Should you see it? Despite the snark-heavy tone of the last few paragraphs, I think you'll find a lot to enjoy at IRON MAN 2. (before I forget, someone you know has probably spoiled this already, but make sure to stay after the credits. You won't regret it) Just know going in that while it has plenty more of all the things that made the first one so good, it's also?. well, it's misplaced its heart. Here's hoping Favreau and company are able to get it charged up and back in place by the time the Mandarin comes callin'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 : Very big Expectations and most of them fulfilled.....what a grand movie...loaded with the best actors, superb visuals, thrilling sound effects, unbeatable charisma of Mr. Tony Stark(Downey Jr.).........etc.....!!!!This movie is a followup of the first part from the point at which it ended.The movie starts with a bang...'Stark Expo' the one initiated by Howard Stark. Enter Mickey Rourke or Whiplash who is the son of the scientist who helped Howard Stark(Tony's Father) to develop the arc reactor technology. He is driven by vengeance(Watch the movie for more). Cut two..Enter Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell) the man who wants to take over the popularity of Tony Stark....Cut three The US government demands the Iron Man suit and Tony says..'The suit and i are one'.... then Whiplash attacks Tony on a F1 circuit...Rockwell is impressed and he hires whiplash to embed the technology in the suits built by him...at th same time at a party Tony goes super weird and displays the prowess of his suit in a party wherein Rhody comes and takes a spare suit to his command.......whoooaaa..i'l stop....what i wanted to suggest over here is that the plot is too big and the characters are too many and so none of them was properly used......too much cling-clang...and yes there's the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson whose attitude spits fire throughout...!!! Paltrow is just okay as the assistant cum the new 'CEO' of Stark enterprises...!!Jon Favreau has done a good job. He knew exactly what to do to make this movie bigger than the First part and he's pretty much successful but the screenplay makes the movie suffer...!!!! Also the characters were not given space to act or to justify their character completely...specially Whiplash and Nick Fury(Samuel)...And for me the biggest disappointment was replacing Terence Howard as Rhody by Don...Although Don is good but Terence was far more better in that role in the first part.Now the USP's...Downey Jr. is the life of this movie.....terrific performance. You can enjoy each moment when he is on screen. The action and the effects are realistic and mind-blowing....!!! In my take this movie may get Oscar nominations for Visual effects, sound mixing and sound editing..!!!!As was at the end of the first part a scene of the arrival of Nick Fury, even this movie has a special after credits-roll scene....Do watch it....and applaud for Robert Downey Jr.!!!! Iron Man Rocks..!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another sequel that disappoints.Yeah, I gave it a six. But I had trouble giving it that much.First, the good: RDJ as Tony Stark is enjoyable to watch. He nails the Tony Stark character, flaws and all. His line delivery makes you forget that there really isn't much action in the entire flick. MR as Whiplash is even better. Nails the Euro-thug, tattoos and all. Too bad this movie is PG 13 so all the kiddies could see it because if Favreau had the nuts he would have increased the violence knob and shown just how dangerous Whiplash could be. Too bad Whiplash only feels like he is always on the movie. Really, he has little screen time. And the final battle is over before you can say, "that's it???".I like my good guys flawed and my bad guys bad. Instead, the PG13 rating makes sure the only reason I went to see this flick is the effects.Now the bad: What's the point? This was a long Seinfeld episode. Stuff happens, but it just don't add to a hill of beans. Maybe we were lucky with Dark Knight (what a movie should be) and don't want to settle for this weak attempt to generate money and interest in other movies.Yes, me may see Thor. Yes, we may see, HulK. Yes, we may see Captain America. But if this is how Favreau handles this many characters then how is he going to give each of them appropriate screen time? Maybe the third instalment needs new direction. Christopher Nolan are you listening?Final review: This is a dog you take for a walk but don't be surprised when this dog don't hunt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Iron Man 2, there were a lot of promises made by Jon Favreau. He was going to improve on the first one, give us bigger villains, bridge the avengers, and above all, introduce us to War Machine. I was very exited for this movie, the first is one of my all time favorite films, mainly because of the performances by the entire, fantastic cast, and a perfect blend of darkness and humor, with a main hero who didn't go to far in either direction, Does this movie live up to that modern classic, not quite. There are some great elements, First off most of the cast is fantastic, RDJ is a fantastic actor who puts that great energy and attitude from the first on full display here, but the big surprise here is Mickey Rourke. Perfectly, and menacingly playing the Russian villain Whiplash. Also, the action scenes are amped up to 11. Every bit of action is great. There is some great, snappy dialogue as well. However, that essential feeling of the first film, that spark, is all but missing. There are some terribly misguided scenes here, such as a drunken fight straight out of spider man 3 (shutter). Which brings me to the War Machine storyline, which could have been handled much better. Don Cheedle, who i normally love, is flat here, and the friendship chemistry just isn't there as much. Also, while very funny at times, the movie gets a little jokey for it's own good. But overall Iron Man 2 is a fun time, just done expect anything mind blowing.

		<fullReview>7.7Sometimes I like to think that we are in a digital Renaissance. Consider the advances that we made during the Renaissance. Perspectives in paintings, improvements in architecture, and an overall advance in education. Consider now the industrial revolution. Machinery eventually led to electronics, and eventually the increase of reliance on computer systems and the jump from analog technology to digital technology as well. Computer electronics can be programmed to serve virtually limitless functions. Our world today is a proof itself that not only is it efficient, but very welcomed by almost all humans.When people advance, so do their military forces. In fact, a lot of the time, a nation's military seeks to secure technology, so as to keep the enemy, or other nations, from gaining and utilizing it as well. This is probably the most realistic aspect of Iron Man 2. The rest is, well, a superhero movie. However, there is one thing about Iron Man that differentiates him from (most) other superheroes: his powers are purely technology based. This leads me to believe that the "Iron Man" is a possible reality, some day in the future.The film and franchise's hero is Tony Stark, a young billionaire and genius inventor. The superhero is Iron Man, who is basically Stark in a cyber-suit of sorts. However, I'd like to think that the Iron Man aspect of Tony Stark is more plausible than the Stark part of him. A 21-year old billionaire/genius inventor is a superhero. It is something that does not exist in our world. In fact, to whom can you compare Stark to? Da Vinci? Well, I'm not an expert on this, but I don't think Da Vinci was as rich as Stark was. Nor probably was he as promiscuous as Stark was. Da Vinci was said to be a generous person, who practiced humility. Stark is seen by many as, like one character in the film labeled him as, "a prick." Stark and Da Vinci have one major thing in common: they are both genius inventors. So in this age, that I like to call the dawn of the Digital Renaissance, Stark does not exist. He does not take place yet in our world. But neither does Iron Man. The question is, which will come first? But that's enough foreshadowing. I went into Iron Man 2 with little expectation, just as the first film. The first film really impressed me. I wasn't expecting much out of the superhero flick, especially after having seen some other very good ones. Iron Man 2, sadly, fails to deliver like the original did. However, it is by no means a failure. In fact, it is a pleasure to revisit this take on the Iron Man universe. While there is no wrong in taking a moment to breathe in the air, business needs to be done. Where does Iron Man stand? Who (or what) is the villain? There are multiple villains/threats to Iron Man in this movie. There's Whiplash (one of the greatest villains in comic book films), Hammer, the U.S. government, and palladium. While I was expecting the weakness of the film to lie in it's use of so many villains, it was the lack of focusing on the biggest threat that was its biggest flaw.Not only is Whiplash's part downplayed, but so are many other characters' as well. Black Widow, and her other identities, barely has no weighty dialogue in the film. It seems like everything she said was to add to somebody else's comments, or was simply lost in all the action going on around her. The only new character whose part wasn't toned down was Hammer. I guess that ultimately that's what happens when you focus on so many villains at once, but I really think that the film should have centered on Whiplash, given that not only was he a good villain story-wise, but Mickey Rourke's performance and portrayal of the character was excellent.Iron Man 2 is a film that seems to be comfortable being exactly what is. The first time around, it seems like they worked hard to make a good film, not just an entertaining film, and succeeded in doing so. This time, it seems like they went more for an entertainment route, rather than, "we can make a good superhero film". While there's nothing wrong with that, I still feel that business needs to get done, and there was a huge opportunity missed with Whiplash and Mickey Rourke in this film. Still, Iron Man 2 sports good direction, good performances, and is only hindered by an unfocused script. If it was entertainment that they sought, it is entertainment that they delivered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this one falls into the Spidey II mold-mucho personal introspection on the part of the hero, his flaws come out in a big way, and there's a rather drawn out flat section of the movie where he's Not Iron Man, and it does drag things down some. They were going for more charcterization I realize, but-it's kinda slow.What works? Downey Jr. as Iron Man is up to par as he was in the first, it's quite good. This is his role.Paltrow as Potts is okay, but they did make her out to be a shrew.I liked Scarlet as the Black Widow, not on screen all that much but what they do show is perfectly fine.Baddie's plot-well the Crimson Dynamo(Rourke) teams up w/ a rival arms builder(Rockwell), to field an army of Iron Man-like Drones. Takes'em out w/ Cheadle's help. Mucho explosions, shooting and flying around. I would have liked a couple more scenes like that during the movie, honestly--just to help the pacing.Roarke is okay as Vanko there you just don't see him doing that much save making Drones, hacking into networks and slicing up a couple Le Mans cars. That part was fine, by the way.Check it out though, a good way to open up the summer--though you can be forgiven if you think you've seen parts of this before-Robocop or Transformers esp come to mind.*** outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good to be back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. No secret that I really enjoyed the first Iron Man movie a couple of years ago. For 2, we get the return of key players: Robert Downey, jr as Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and Jon Favreau as the director. We also get an onslaught of new players: Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Scarlett Johansson as Natalie/Natasha/Black Widow, Garry Shandling as Senator Stern and Don Cheadle (replacing Terence Howard) as War Machine.Onslaught may be the best word I can use to describe the film. It is an onslaught to the senses. There are so many characters - both good and bad. There are so many explosions, fights and booms that we resist the urge to blink. There is so much overlapping and oddly paced dialogue that we strain to fill in the blanks. And what of the inside jokes and "advertising" for future Avengers fun? OK, maybe "Fun" is the key word, not onslaught. These characters are a blast (pun, slightly intended). Watching a creepy Mickey Rourke plot revenge in the Russian darkness is terrific. Sam Rockwell chewing scenery is not to be missed. Garry Shandling's snarky senator is a hoot, especially at the end. And I have been surfing the net all night searching for a suitcase sized Iron Man suit. OK, not really ... but that was super cool.The best I can offer here is that this is an onslaught of fun. The great and talented Justin Theroux was brought in to script the multitude of players and story lines ... he must be a master juggler as none get cheated in their screen time. Even Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is given a much heavier workload than in part one - setting the stage for his NINE scheduled film appearances as Mr. Fury.The film is huge and spectacular, but falls just short of the first one for a single reason. The wow of discovery can only be had once. That's not a knock on this one, but timing is crucial. Must also mention the brilliance of Robert Downey, Jr who seems born to play Tony Stark. Of course, the brilliance of Mr. Downey is that he always seems born to play his roles. He is a great actor ... check his ability to spout wise cracking one-liners and then mix in a couple of actually tender moments with Paltrow's Pepper Potts. Not many actors could do that effectively. He pulls it off seamlessly.What really matters is that it's a fun trip to theatre. Don't expect this year's Best Picture winner. Expect to laugh and be visually wowed. I certainly was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are Two Iron Men Better Than One?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Check your mind at the door, and you'll enjoy Iron Man 2. While not as good as the first, it is still a fun, entertaining sequel that gets the job done and has enough explosions to start the Summer off in style.The story picks up right where the first left off. Tony Stark reveals his secret identity to the world, he is Iron Man, leading to complications for the billionaire playboy. Robert Downey, Jr. was once more in top form here as Stark, but his snarky quips seemed to lack the same heat that they had in the first film.Meanwhile, the U.S. government wants Stark to share his Iron Man technology, while Stark is dealing with a rival business tycoon Justin Hammer who wants Stark's tech to ensure his contract with the government. Sam Rockwell does a marvelous job as Justin Hammer, and actually steals the show, kind of playing that geeky guy that everyone says ya better not pick on cause they'll be your boss someday. Now, on top of all that, Stark's arc reactor in his chest that is keeping him alive is also killing him cause the element it's made of is toxic, which I thought was an extremely nice touch that added some much needed drama to the story.As you can see, this is a busy story, but director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux managed to keep the film from feeling all cluttered, giving it some room to breath, which is something that a certain webhead failed to do in his third outing (--cough!-- Spider-man 3), but it does feel jumpy at times and certain plot threads seem to be left dangling for a touch too long before they return to them to tie them up. Of course, this is an action movie, and the action in the film ups the ante from the original, having more explosions and giant iron fists of fury. If anything all of the action sequences were so well executed that they left you wanting more, but it is sad when the most show stopping scene of the entire film occurs a mere thirty minutes into the film at the Monaco Grand Prix, but the finale was still well executed.Spinning all that into a frenzy, Stark must confront a villain named Ivan Vanko, a.k.a. Whiplash, who uses these awesome electric whips that he wraps around Iron Man and electrifies him with in the awesome action sequence at the Monaco Grand Prix. Vanko, played by "it" actor Mickey Rourke, was not as menacing as the trailers led one to believe, but he serviced the job well, but ultimately I missed Jeff Bridges from the first film. Regardless, Vanko is bent on vengeance for his father's misfortune which was at the hands of Tony's father, which I felt was not really touched upon all that much, and I think Rourke's character was actually the most underused of the film.Perhaps there was no way for them to capture lightning in a bottle again, after all, seeing as how the first film did feel so fresh and original, but they did a good job of continuing the story, giving some more character development and such. As well, there were many nods to other Marvel characters like Captain America, Thor, and The Avengers, not to mention the film featured Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson who looks just like a comic book vixen ripped straight from the pages, and Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson himself. In the end, it managed to be a worthy successor, and makes me wanna see more from this iron clad superhero on the big screen.I give Iron Man 2 a 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The man in the iron irony"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's not fall over ourselves too much trying to define the merits and faults of this film and comparing it to 'Iron Man 1.' I'd rather just look at the new one and see if we can tease out any new ideas and angles.The 'Iron Man' stories begin with the happy union of technology and business, and have a protagonist unlike the meek, altruistic sort of comic book super hero. Tony Stark is the son of a corporate giant, born rich (though unloved), a profligate rogue, a wild playboy. He is the slightly rotten fruit of big-time capitalist success, the second generation that doesn't give a damn and just wants to have fun. However, he is also his father's son, gifted with a gigantic ego and also a genius, and so he has a heroic role forced upon him. Being a valuable commodity, he is kidnapped, and must escape by building a suit of hi-tech body armor instead of the mega-weapon his captors want. He suffers severe heart injuries in the process, thus becoming vulnerable at the same moment that he rises to super power. And with the vulnerability, the genius, and the growing power, he makes it clear that he remains the devil-may-care playboy.Later Stark is inspired to adopt his extraordinary creation, with him inside it, in the interests of protecting mankind. In the comics the enemy was communism. Now (in the first 'Iron Man' movie) it's terrorism and a rival within Stark Industries who would take it over, the evil Obadiah Stane, played by Jeff Bridges. In 'Iron Man 2,' the enemies are two: a foolish prancing peacock of an upstart industrialist competitor, Justin Hammer (an excellent Sam Rockwell), who wants to eliminate Stark and his company and have his, not Tony's, exo-skeletal weaponry be what the Pentagon exclusively buys and uses; and a dangerous maverick Russian, half criminal, half tech wizard, with bad memories of Tony's father. This individual, Ivan Vanko (a brilliantly used Mickey Rourke), winds up unwillingly serving Justin Hammer, but breaks out on his own in time to do battle with Stark and Hammer, allied.I think it's safe to say screenwriter Justin Theroux is having some fun with the sacrosanct values of the original Cold War era comic source of Iron Man. Capitalism's worst excesses are mocked through the smugness of Justin Hammer, with his constant preening that's always shown up as pointless, and through Tony's own boasts, most of all the stunner, "I have successfully privatized world peace!" This declaration comes at a donnybrook Senate hearing supervised by a smiling nonentity of a committee chairman (Garry Shandling) at which Stark manages to commandeer the room's visual system and make a mockery of efforts by Iran, North Korea, and Hammer to copy his Iron Man suits. That's a provocative statement. Privatizing warfare (i.e., in Orwellian terms, "world peace") brings to the liberal mind horrible thoughts of Blackwater and its ilk. Such warfare is a definite, real-life Bush era trend. Privatizing world peace, on the other hand, may sound like a good idea if it takes away from nation states their capacity to wage perpetual war. Unfortunately such privatizing would (and does) also undermine the authority of the principled international bodies that attempt to maintain order.Theroux also has fun this time with foreign threats, as an aspect of Pentagon (and war-industry-promoted) paranoia, which were taken so seriously in the first Iron Man film with its evil Middle Easterners in caves forging weapons. This time the foreign enemy, spouting Russian words and a creditable accent, covered in tattoos, with a pet cockatoo, an S&amp;M outfit, and lashing Formula One racing cars to pieces with electric whips, is...Mickey Rourke! Right out of 'The Wrestler, but looking happy and tan since his recent comeback. But it's hard to say whether the flurry caused by Rourke's deliciously absurd Ivan Vanko is satire on right wing paranoia or the frivolity of spinning out quirky villains ? la Ian Fleming (whose politics were not deep, or congruent with today's realities). ' Above all the "ideas" of either 'Iron Man' movie, whether serious or frivolous, looms the by now seemingly inimitable and essential personality of Robert Downey Jr., who as Tony Stark gets to play endlessly creative riffs off the kind of outrageous, funny but dangerous, clever but seriously unwise person he was in his own real life as a heavy substance abuser and party boy whose using got him into constant trouble and finally prison, treatment, and sobriety. He gets to fulfill the A.A. Promise, 'We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.' In playing Tony Stark, Downey gets to relive his past, without the alcohol, pot, coke, or heroin. When he was on the downward path of the addict he was doing some of the most important research into his role. That research is why he can so easily access the outrageousness and edgy wit of Tony Stark. This role is sometimes seen as a surprising outcome of Downey's comeback, coming after serious stuff like 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints;' 'Good Night, and Good Luck;' 'A Scanner Darkly;' and 'Zodiac.' But Tony Stark is really quite logical, representing the addict's fantasies of glory as well as his self-scrutiny. When Tony's told at the end of 'Iron Man 2' that he's been diagnosed as a classic narcissistic personality, he readily agrees. Any connection with the personality of the typical corporate CEO is, of course, purely coincidental. Not for nothing does the 'New York Times' critic A.O. Scott's review of 'Iron Man 2' begin with the heading "The Man in the Iron Irony."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Addition to Marvel. Not so much to Iron Man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark. I started reading comics since I could read (circa 1989) and Iron Man didn't really catch my eye because he had more depth than most of the comics. And as a kid, I didn't like depth outside of explosion from ordnance and impact action. Iron Man had a problem that just didn't interest me and that problem really took a toll on issues. That problem was ALCOHOLISM. This is what separated Iron Man from other super heroes. (That and he wasn't induced with super powers, but enough with semantics). So I am going to open this up with; Why the hell is Stark not an alcoholic in this. They replaced his alcoholism with egotism. But - he was an ego in the comics too...No, I won't bash this on stance of being a comic-nerd. But I will say this. Iron Man 2 should be called: Avengers Initiative Initiative. It had more bearing with the Avengers than it did with the actual Iron Man. The movie has a lot to tell and it tells it pretty well. Stark is under fire from Congress for owning and monopolizing the MOBILE SUIT WEAPON, Iron Man. His Arc-Core also seems to be slowly killing him and he still has to maintain Stark Industries along with policing with Iron Man. The action has about the same pace as the first movie. Maybe even weaker? I can't say that though, it does a decent job at delivering, but Iron Man doesn't really face many humans in this one, like he did in the first one.The effects are outstanding of course, with plenty of effects to choose from. From multiple IRON MAN suit designs (which made Iron Man so cool EARLY on in the original comics) and explosions and gun fire. The cast is stellar; everyone does their part well. The director even plays a 400% more direct roll in this movie and does it really well. You will hold no ill-will toward Jon for being more of a ham in this movie. He provides key comedy relief.Don Cheadle plays the new War Machine. A face I didn't really like when I heard about the change, but he does a great job none the less. As far as the rest, if you're a comic book fan and eagerly await the following Marvel movies to bring The Avengers to Fruition, then you will have to see this. If you're just an action fan that enjoys comic-book action, then this should be priority if there is nothing else out to sate your hunger. Everyone else? You can easily take a pass and not feel bad about it.Overall the movie is well done and it's tough to weigh which one was better. Both movies have great things about them. But again, I didn't feel like I was in an Iron Man movie. I felt like I was in a prologue to a prologue to the Avengers that was catered with OUTSTANDING Robert Downy Jr. Humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man vs his ego</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that this instalment was a little disappointing, despite the fact that I have seen it before. I guess I was simply caught up with that scene where Whiplash walks out onto the racetrack and starts slicing up cars, which I have to admit was quiet unbelievable, in the sense that even though this is a superhero movie there still has to be some logic for people's actions, and this particular scene actually defied all logic. However I will get to that in a minute because that wasn't the only scene that sort of defied logic because most of the film was actually quite boring, though it did pick up a bit at the end (though there really was very little of Whiplash actually being Whiplash, with the exception of the Grand Prix scene and the scene at the end).The film begins six months after the end of Iron Man and basically Tony Stark is running around playing up the fact that he is a super hero and is responsible, single-handedly, for keeping the United States at peace. However the government has a problem, and that is that they don't like the idea of such a powerful weapon being in the hands of an individual, but Tony Stark really doesn't want to give up his little toy. There is another problem, and that is that Tony's arc-reactor is slowly poisoning him, and also starting to turn him slighty mad (which his alcoholism doesn't help all that much). In fact much of the movie involves Tony Stark trying to remain on top of things while Whiplash is working for his rival in the background.While Whiplash is the main villain, one could argue that the actual villain in the film is Tony Stark himself. The problem is that he has one gigantic ego, and this ego is actually starting to come back and haunt him. The fact that he is slowly dying due to the toxic power core in the arc reactor is case in point, but while it is slowly driving him mad, the fact that he is trying to keep it hidden really doesn't help one bit.We are also beginning to see the Avengers start to come together here with the introduction of Natasha Romanov, who is actually keeping an eye on Tony Stark on behalf of Nick Fury (who has other problems that Tony's behaviour is not helping to solve). There are also a few hints being dropped with regards to the arrival of Thor in the scene, with reference to some events going on in the South West. It is also suggested that the events in the Hulk are also going on at the same time, which is a little odd because while the Abomination is smashing up Harlem, Whiplash and his army of robots are flying around smashing up Queens (and you'd think that their paths might cross).Now, as for that racing car scene ? Tony decides that since he owns the car he might as well take it for a spin, on the track, during the race. While this does play up to Stark's ego, the fact that he is coming second really doesn't make sense (and I'm not entirely sure if you can simply jump the fence and start driving if you, the driver, haven't qualified for the race). Then there is Whiplash ? if Tony Stark, at the spur of the moment, decided to start driving the car, how is it that Whiplash knew that Stark would be in the race. Personally it really makes little sense, but then again it is a superhero movie, and does work to show that Stark's ego is his own worse enemy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is the continuation of the Marvel universe in theaters, it is unfortunately much lower than the first film, Robert Downey Jr back in the shoes of Tony Stark and is excellent as in the first film, the film errs again the villain Mickey Rourke is a good actor is very poorly used, the first fight Iron Man vs the villain of the movie I forgot the name is too short and disappointing I expected more, the final fight I particularly liked the character Pepper Potts only serves to mess up, the more obvious that we have good things in this film beyond the great special effects, we have the first appearance of Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow which steals the scene in the fight scenes, one thing I hated that movie was excessive bad jokes and unnecessary things such as part of the party which in my opinion should not even exist, it seems that placed just to fill time, Iron Man 2 is hardly a disaster is to some fun times, even with a bad villain, the film has a good soundtrack as well as the predecessor and a good performance of Robert Downey Jr, unfortunately this may be the worst film of the Film Marvel Universe.

After the first 30 minutes i wanted to go home and go to bed. Plus I'm tired of Stan Lee making cameos. Its not cool and he's an awful actor. Marvel is tacky. Iron Man 2 is allowed to ad-lib. Maybe it was groundbreaking in "ELF", but for this, it's cheese-factor seems over-the-top, just plain bad. Even the music tried so hard to invoke intensity and fear. Please, really?! Go back to a movie like Rosemary's Baby from the 1960s and experience real fear. It's too bad, the original premise could have been an interesting exploration had the story been better written. Bottom line: bored out of my mind. DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE, download it for free. DC comics gets their movies right. Marvel is a whore and Im glad I sold all my comics because they peaked in the late 1970's. Hollywood is beating a dead horse.</fullReview>

His character is carefree, quirky, irresponsible and genuinely funny, the opposite of what you'd expect from the suit of armour. It makes the movie sufficiently tongue in cheek that you can enjoy the action without having to worry about the plot line being too serious. Just goes to show what getting the right actor can do for a movie.Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson provide plenty of female interest to the proceedings. And then there's Mickey Rourke, who performs brilliantly as a mad, brawny Russian bad guy with plenty of character, who outwits everyone else in the movie. Excellent stuff.This is a light hearted affair but really enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is the obvious sequel to the first Iron Man film which was released back in 2008, it's also directed by Jon Favreau. While the first Iron Man was a great comic book film and just a great film in general, Iron Man 2 is simply just a good film and nothing more which is a bit disappointing because it could've been even better than the first. Iron Man 2 does have a lot of things going for it but at times it feels a bit bogged down because of a weak villain and a severely underused Mickey Rourke. Favreau's direction still manages to be great here but it's undermined by a weak villain who serves no real threat to Stark. Early on we get a great action sequence that gives us a good look at Whiplash and he even looks promising here, but sadly this is the best sequence that he's in and everything else he's in is just disappointing. The character of Whiplash is only here to be a plain old bad guy, he has nothing interesting and is just flat out boring at times; he never really poses a threat to Stark. The film is just one huge set up for The Avengers and at times feels a bit uneven because of the whole setup, I know that they had to plant seeds for the film but the film should still be able to stand on its own. The acting in this film is once again great and everyones does their best, though Mickey Rourke looks bored with everything. The stand out here is once again Robert Downey Jr who really is Tony Stark, this guy was perfect for the role and ended up being the best casting choice that Marvel has made yet. Marvel know's what they are doing when it comes to casting which is why it's odd that Rourke's character serves little to no purpose in the movie, they could've done so much more with the character. The score in this film is huge step down from the first and is just okay at best, it's nowhere near bad but it's also not even close to the first film's brilliant score. Iron Man 2's score just seems like a generic that was just thrown in because the movie needed one and boy does it feel weak, although the ACDC music does make up for it at least. When it comes to blockbusters such as this, you need a score that is both huge but not overly distracting to the point that you can't pay attention to the movie itself. Iron Man 2 is a step down from the first bit still manages to be a good time at the movies if you're willing to chuck your brain at the door. 3.7/5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is the first movie done slightly worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is essentially the story of Iron Man 1 all over again. Tony Stark is a selfish irresponsible man who must correct his ways. The villains consist of an American businessman teaming up with a terrorist from a far away country. Tony Starks life is in danger and he must use his intelligence to invent something that will help him survive. Of all these huge retreads of the first movie, Tony being a reckless and selfish hotshot all over again is the worst. Whereas the first Iron Man movie did a good job of showing Tony Stark trying to better himself as a person, Iron Man 2 sends his character all the way back to square one. By making Tony Stark once again this irresponsible hotshot the movie essentially negates all of his character development from the first movie. This movies intention wasn't to tell a compelling story. Instead it is basically one big trailer for "The Avengers" trying to satisfy comic book fanboys. "Look there's Iron Man!", " Hey there's War Machine", "Wow Black Widow's here too!", "And there's Nick Fury", "Cool there's Captain Americas Shield". Instead of making a good sequel they basically just told the same story as the first movie except with a bunch of Avengers related stuff. However with all this said, I don't think Iron Man 2 is a bad movie. Robert Downey Jr. is still great in the leading role. The soundtrack is great with classic songs from AC/DC and Queen. The action is much more entertaining than in the first one. And also the special effects are pretty good. Unlike the first movie Iron Man 2 doesn't take itself too seriously and thus makes sitting through the movie pretty easy. It's not a good movie, but it's a decent popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an okay film that is nowhere near the level of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When talking about the marvel cinematic universe it is seen in a highly positive light because of the high standard. But this film is really not one of the best and in fact gets a lot of criticism. This story sees tony stark against the government to keep his iron man suits while also encountering an old enemy that has the power to destroy iron man. Now Robert Downey jnr is great as tony stark and this film is no different, I do believe this is the weakest of his performances as the character but he is still great and provides everything that the character should be. The supporting cast is also top notch and they do a really good job in this film, Gwyneth paltrow stars as pepper Potts and she does a great job. Her chemistry with stark is excellent and is easily the best relationship in super hero films. There was a lot of controversy about don Cheadle being James Rhodes but he also did a superb job and his chemistry with Downey is a key part if the film and played up well. Now I think Scarlett Johansson did a good job in her role and her character provides a lot of mystery and intrigue that helped her character. A fantastic performance was definitely delivered by Sam Rockwell as Starks adversary Justin hammer. He was funny and entertaining while being a menace and did a really great job and shows just how good an actor he is. The story is where this film falls apart though, this film has like 5 major stories and it is just too much in too little time and it just makes this film bloated and cluttered. The script was okay with the actors doing a good job with the dialogue, however, there was just a ridiculous amount of comedy when it wasn't needed and the drama was also lost. This hurts the style of the film with the mix of comedy and style not working. But this is an iron man film and the action is awesome and the style of iron man is really cool. This film isn't that strong but it has some positives about it and is not a bad film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thin story saved by special effects and humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Iron man 2" is full of ideas that are undeveloped . It's a shame , because there was potential here. The writer starts a subplot and leaves it not really going anywhere with it. The health troubles , conflict with the army , problems of loyalty , Vankow's desire of revenge? The movie doesn't explore any of this subplots and they are all too quickly resolved.There is no real plot here. There's a bunch of ideas thrown together in hope that somehow they will make a good story. The more I think about it the more I realize that "Iron man 2" had only one real purpose ? introduce Natasha that will be important in the "Avengers" movie. Ironically , her presence here is pretty much pointless (except looking pretty and some action near the end of movie).The movie doesn't know what to do with it's characters. Ivan Vankow and Justin Hammer who were supposed to be main villains don't really do anything through entire movie. Vankow has two fight scenes and that's it . For the rest of movie he is constructing a weapon , while Hammer just waits. Vankow isn't one bit interesting or scary character. His motivation to attack Stark doesn't have any real importance to overall story. The writer could also do much more with Justin Hammer.The performances are good with the exception of Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle. Johansson is boring , while Don Cheadle is very stiff. I missed Terence Howard . The plot is thin with some plot holes. I also couldn't buy the new element. I know this is a comic book movie , but that was just stupid."Iron man 2" is a disappointing sequel. The thin story is saved by the humor and brilliant special effects. The movie was obviously enjoyable enough to be a box office success. The next movie was even dumber than this one despite a more serious attempt at writing a story. "Iron man 2" at least doesn't take itself too seriously and works as popcorn movie. I give it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Bit as Good as the First Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the end of the first movie "Tony Stark" (Robert Downey Jr.) admits to the world that he is Iron Man. This sequel picks up where the last movie left off with a few major developments. First, a Russian physicist by the name of "Ivan Vanko" (Mickey Rourke) sets out to avenge his father's supposed betrayal by Stark Enterprises by killing--Tony Stark. Additionally, Tony Stark's main rival in defense armaments named "Justin Hammer" (Sam Rockwell) wants to acquire Tony Stark's technology by any means necessary in order to corner the market on Tony's invention. And if these two problems weren't bad enough there is also another problem Tony has to deal with?he is slowly dying. Anyway, rather than disclose the entire plot and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that I thought this sequel was every bit as good as the first movie. Naturally, there is plenty of action and CGI but like the original movie it also brings back the humor and the same attractive actresses in Gwyneth Paltrow (as "Pepper Potts") and Leslie Bibb ("Christine Everhart"). Along with that, Scarlett Johansson ("Natalie Rushman") also graces the screen. Likewise, both Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke put in fine performances as well. In short, I believe that if a person liked the first movie then they will probably like this one too. Above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Iron Man 2" is the sequel of "Iron Man", I liked and enjoyed this movie because had so much action and again the visual effects were really great.Robert Downey Jr. shows us why he is the best selection for Iron Man with a great interpretation for one more time. I also liked very much the interpretation of Mickey Rourke who played as Ivan Vanko a bad scientist who is the enemy of Iron Man. Don Cheadle has a nice role in this movie as friend of Tony Stark and as Lt. Col. James Rhodes.Finally I think that "Iron Man 2" was a little lower than the first one but I liked it very much because of the action and the suspense of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, for a human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IRON MAN 2 is a surprisingly decent sequel and a definite improvement over the silly, convoluted and somewhat childish original. Try as I might, I could never get into the first film's storyline involving a supremely arrogant Robert Downey Jr. and a "what's he doing here?" Jeff Bridges. The effects were unremarkable and the story bogged down in the "origins" nonsense that made it a chore to sit through.This sequel gets into full stride straight away and explores what it's like to bear the weight of responsibility. Stark is by now an alcoholic who ends up alienating most people around him, and I just found the whole thing more involving and engaging. There isn't an overwhelming about of action, which is great, because the two set-pieces that do occur (the race track showdown and the extensive climax) are all the better for it.Downey Jr. remains a bullish and unlikeable character, but there are more interesting supporting roles here for Don Cheadle and, in particular, Mickey Rourke, who's enjoying something of a career renaissance as of late and who has a ball as the crazed, whip-wielding bad guy (and I absolutely LOVE those whips!). It's not perfect, because Gwyneth Paltrow is still a drippy irritant and director Jon Favreau needs to learn humility after casting himself in a supposed comedic part, but the presence of special agents Samuel Jackson and, in particular, Scarlett Johansson, add to the entertainment value immeasurably. I just we could have had more Kate Mara...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All visuals, little to no plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be the first to admit that I enjoyed the original Iron Man. It was not only a fun summer blockbuster but it had a great plot for what it was and was assuredly one of the best summer blockbusters in recent memory and also either the best or second best out of the MCU (the other one being The Incredible Hulk).This one is different. You have a villain that at the end of the day will only be remembered as "The guy that Mickey Rourke plays". He did a good job in the role but the material he was given was hopelessly bland. Robert Downey Jr and his material is fun to watch on screen. For a fact most of the people did good jobs it was just the material that they were given.Then there's the plot itself. What we have here is that the device keeping Stark alive is poisoning him slowly. He seems to want to live out his days happy (at least that's my interpretation). But soon you have some moronic Weapon's creator that wants to steal Stark's Iron Man to distribute to the US Government. As well as a Russian scientist's son trying to kill Tony because he believes he should have gotten all the glory that Stark has.The plot seemed to have too many separate things going on at once, making it very under-developed. However this movie is entertaining to watch. If you can adjust to just watching a movie that's more about the jokes and action rather than developed plots then this one will be for you.Not only that but another complaint is that it just seems like unsubtle build-up for the Avengers. Granted every MCU film was build-up to The Avengers but this one just made it seem like it's not standing on anything else. You have the Black Widow (who's hopelessly miscast - sorry I had to mention that) and Nick Fury basically trying to get fan boys excited for the 2012 movie. It can work but aside from the average entertainment from a Summer Blockbuster and the build-up. This movie doesn't have a lot going for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me say this is a bad movieThe Main theme as i understand it in Iron Man 2 deals with the inability for human beings to communicate with each other, whether it be a Man trying to tell a women he loves her, a Father trying to do likewise with his son, or the problems that a rise between different cultures like Americans and Russians.It also happens between film makers and their audiencesHonestly the Tower of Babel featured more eloquenceRobert Downey gets the ball rolling by speaking in a garbled chopped up syntax through out the movie, the man just cannot get to the end of complete sentence without changing his thoughts mid-sentence, he might start out talking about the genius of Albert Einstein and half way through suddenly transition about his favorite YogurtThen there is the Villain played by Mickey Roarke, an American actor playing a Russian, yeah that always works out good, Rourke speaks his lines in a thick Borsht soup version of Russianese that is practically indecipherable, the Delphi Oracle was more precise then this guy.here is an example: ' i VANT BUERD" he is trying to say: "I want my Bird" turns out the only thing this Yahoo likes is his white bird. The character speaks like that through out the whole Movie in chopped up half sentences, its laughable.Then there is Tony Starks father, seems old man Starks never rarely talked to his son, which is why Tony is the flamboyant bad boy throughout constantly rebelling against authoriantian figure's, why Howard Stark was like that we can only speculate Maybe he was jealous of his boy, maybe he saw his genius of a lad as a future rival and closed him off, who knows, but guess what Daddy dear left Tony a hidden Easter egg in a home movie, yep instead of the guy taking the time to have a heart to heart with his lad while he was alive he slipped it into a movie that he just knew his son would watch when he had decided he needed to hear from his Dad, such is the though process of super geniuses Then there is Scarlet Johansen looking all dishy as The Black Widow, another Russian who barely speaks, she seems to be totally out of place in this Movie,we have no understanding of where she came from to rise to such a level in Stark Industry, laughably this ambiguious speaking Ruski know's more about Stark industry then Tony Stark does. She seems to dropped straight out of thin air to land this Job at a billion dollar defense contractor, and they say its hard finding work.It seems Tony is dying, yep, the Palladium that is keeping him alive , in one of those cruel twists of fate is also killing him, and because he is dying Tony figures the perfect response is to act like a douche bag to everyone. Tony cannot seem to tell anyone that he is a goner not even Pepper..his girlfriend, but is she his girlfriend, does he love her..i just don't know, he certainly doesn't show it between checking out Scarlett and arriving at a party with two blondes ,but since its classic Tony Stark to always be misdirecting his true emotions this could be par for the course. We are also to assume that Gwyneth Paltrow loves him, which is why she puts up with his nonsense but her role as Pepper Potts is only a plot devise, Gywneth is never given the screen time to grow beyond anything but a quick sketch of a character. She cane be summed up in 3 or 4 words: efficient, intelligent, long-sufferingAnother theme throughout is destruction, all that Stark built must be destroyed, If Tony has a fleet of beautiful cars they must be trashed, his beautiful home demolished, Howard Stark built a beautiful park for all to enjoy yep that has to be attackedMaybe it represents Arnachy, Tony's inability to keep anything because of his repellant personality, though in the end he seems to find the only thing he really needs.Don Cheadle and Gywneth Paltrow give OK performances making the most out of the material they've been handedSamuel Jackson as Nick Fury is so miscast that its frightening, His nick Fury comes off as Miss Johnson's Pimp rather then her Boss at SHIELDin summing up this picture i Think Mickey Rourke had it right..give them the Bird</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the events of the first movie, Tony Stark aka Iron-Man (Robert Downy Jr.) has revealed to himself to the world his true ID and he is making history. Ivan Vanko (Michael Rouke) avenges his father's death whom he believes his father's ideas were stolen by the starks years ago and decides to make himself a powerhouse named Whiplash. However, Tony is dealing with issues as the radiation in his pacemaker is slowly killing him as he needs a different kind of energy that can make him healthy for with the help of Pepper (Gynth Paltrow), Nick fury (Samuel L Jackson) and BlackWidow (Scarlett Johanson) as he faces an enemy far worse than his last one.An entertaining sequel to an excellent Marvel movie and probably the weakest of The Avengers set up movies as Jon Fevervue returns as director. This movie deals with conflict including decent character development and good acting but i do admit it is inferior to the first movie or The Avengers no doubt but there is some nice action sequences and good effects by ILM. However, i do admit it's a good sequel that also sets up for the next Avengers movie by the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as good as Ironman 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script was weak, the acting predictable, the action reminiscent of The Transformers and the soundtrack, which had promised a whole lot of AC/DC featured exactly TWO songs from them.Other than that, I suppose it was okay entertainment.While Ironman was not particularly highbrow stuff, the script at least was pretty good, and the plot moved right along.Ironman 2, however seemed to be all over the place. The beginning/intro was WAAAAAAY too long and very boring. The plot came and went, editing was not particularly tight, the action sequences were over the top and after a while I was hoping the movie would self destruct.I saw no point (other than eye candy) for the introduction of the kung-foo fighting girl, just an excuse to see a pretty girl dressed in a skintight outfit kicking ass - did NOT really help the plot.Ivan-with-a-grudge character could have worked, but the writing would have needed to be way better.I'm glad that I didn't go to the theatre to see this, would have cost a lot more and I would have been even more irritated.So if you like to see a bunch clownasses blowing things up without a particularly good story, you may enjoy this.</fullReview>

To be fair, I just don't really care for the Iron Man idea, Spiderman and Batman are much better ideas.But there's just a lot of explosions and computer special effects. Plus Tony Stark is too weird and boring, the part with him getting drunk at the party and the colonel using one of the Iron Man suits was just boring and too long. The only part I liked was the first fight between Ivan and Tony. The electrically charged cables were a cool weapon. And Gwenyth Paltro is just a waste. She's so boring in these movies.FINAL VERDICT: I don't really like Iron Man any way, so I don't recommend it, but I'm sure a lot of people liked this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power Rangers and fans of Will Ferill's 'ELF' should enjoy this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Americans will yawn or laugh this sci fi off the screen, for the most part, but if you dig Will Ferrell in Elf (2003) , or you're a 6 yr old Power Ranger, you should dig this spectacle. The plot is an overlong, unengaging mess. I was'nt able to cease all brain activity, kick back and enjoy hard hitting action sequences which I do in most good action films. While the special effects are not up to the Hollywood standard and far from reasonably convincing, it can be a teeny bit entertaining if you appreciate how far Hollywood has come. It used to be seen as the home of unintentionally comical mainstream movies of interest only to freaks and those who like to day dream about kicking some bully's a--. While that's not a fair assessment of that country's current output, it's not a totally undeserved one concerning its past. So it made a refreshing change to see that the US ? along with other Canadian countries ? had begun producing stylish biopics, and energetic efforts like RAY, Walk the Line, and Oceans 12. Sadly, I don't think they're quite ready to stray off from that if they're going to introduce their films to the rest of the world.The film's first big action sequence provides a weak mix of 'futuristic plot holes' and bad 'character development', all of which threaten to scupper the entire project until a potential surprise that goes for the heartstrings, which is why I gave it 4 pts. I did read somewhere that Favreau claims an Ironman sequel was never his goal, and that he was trying to tell a moving and emotional story. Strange mix? I'll say. To fully enjoy it, (whispers...) make sure to turn a blind eye on the special effects, seriously. The visual effects by US VFX house Pentamotive are hilariously awful, managing the same effectiveness as Favreau's ELF, which came out a full eight years ago. Surprisingly, Favreau's skills with CGI has not improved in 8 yrs. Neither has his storytelling or directing ~by baron_genitalstrassen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Potts, too many suplots and too long to get to the suited- Scarlett shots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of the original film was that at focused on the origins of the character, a side-benefit of that was the fact that it had Robert Downey Jr in the lead as the charismatic billionaire playboy Tony Stark. Let's face it, following Stark around for the first 40 odd minutes was as much fun as the bits where he put the claustrophobic's nightmare suit on and fanged around with rock music playing in the background.Now for #2, we've been there and done that.Perhaps that's why they chose to focus the first 10 minutes on establishing the new playa in town Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who it must be said looks like he is carved out of wax in this film? Perhaps the lethal cocktails of drugs, alcohol and steroids that he has ingested over the years has pre-embalmed him from the inside out? In any case he looks creepy, which is a good thing I guess as a villain.Vanko is the son of an ex-colleague of Tony Stark's Dad, who was the original brilliant scientist and inventor who set up Stark Industries in the first place.Vanko's Dad has just died, and he has decided he does not like Tony Stark one bit.I think I'll take a breath to point out that Iron Man 2 is a good film, but not the great one as some have suggested, and like Spiderman 2 it is nowhere near as good as the original, (why does everyone talk Spidey 2 up? It was mediocre at best.) The problem is that they tried to force too many new bad guys in, and tried to bring in subplots for Pepper Potts of all people, even Stark's bodyguard gets his own couple scenes, I know he is the director but give me a break! What I am trying to say is that they took too long to get Scarlett Johansson in the catsuit, and once they did she only got a few minutes to strut her latex clad stuff. (For all the reports about her frontal assets I need to say that there is strong competition from behind... so to speak.) Everyone now knows that Stark is also Iron Man, and the government wants him to hand over the suit so that they can do... whatever with it. What everyone doesn't know is that the very thing keeping Stark ticking is also slowly killing him, and he desperately researches every possibility that might prolong his life and save him.Along the way a nifty young lawyer named Natalie (Johansson) moves into Tony Stark's radar screen, he is entranced by her various skills and capabilities - and no doubt by her amazing rack and smokin' body - and appoints her his personal assistant. This is handy for the latter part of the story, (and hopefully a sequel that will ideally take place in either a sauna or nudist colony. I will be happy in either case.) Pepper seems a little perturbed (jealous) by her presence... but who the hell cares? Once Vanko and Stark finally are introduced all logic and plausibility flies out the window. This is OK in small doses as leaps of logic are required in any superhero film, but the first film took such pains to show just how all these crazy events could almost be believed in so-called real life that changing tack and throwing logic out the window is annoying. So many leaps were required that I was puffing and my knees were sore by the end of the first Iron Man / Ivan Vanko battle.Vanko and Hammer ultimately team up to move towards their dual goals, for Vanko revenge for Hammer the #1 spot.Nick Fury (Sam L Jackson) pops in (contractually obliged to be in almost every Marvel superhero film for eternity) and informs Stark that he knew his Dad, and that he might revisit some old home movies for advice and perhaps assistance.(I soooo wanted to bag Mickey Rourke as the bad guy, especially when I knew he was to be a Russian. I thought his accent would be tortuous but it actually wasn't, at least right until the very end. I think he did OK in a mostly non-speaking role but didn't add much to the film bar his saggy cheating death appearance.) When watched in isolation Iron Man 2 is a bit of a muddy mess at times that survives largely on the goodwill and credibility forged by the far superior original. I liked bits of it and think the franchise definitely has more in it to come, but feel a little let down by this one. Perhaps that's why I waited almost 2 months to watch the damn thing after it came out.Final Rating - 7 / 10. Worth a look, but the original was far superior. Less Potts, less Roads, fewer bad guys, more Scarlett in the suit and a return of the more palatable Tony Stark for 3 please Mr Favreau. I'll even let you have your own pointless sub-plot if you do that for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ew, What Stinks..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I liked the first Iron Man movie. Unfortunately, I found that this one really lost its way somewhere in the mix. I don't know if it tried too hard to do too many things and thus ended up being watered down or whether the vision people saw on the inside was just clearly out of touch with the people sitting in the theater.Any time I turn to my wife during a movie and we agree it's horrible is a bad sign for me. How this was green-lit all the way to theaters is beyond me. Certainly some people must have tried to shape this up along the way during development, but overall this is simply *not* a good movie...not even a good popcorn flick.At this point, I hope there will not be an Iron Man III. If that is in the works, I really hope they go back to the drawing board and figure out what worked well in I, what flopped in II, and steer a good course in between. Better luck next time, but you won't get the vote of my movie dollars either way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One major complaint I had against the first movie was its lack of that thing super-heroes and villains do: fighting. It had plenty of charm, good acting, and a decent plot, but the action was shoehorned into a mediocre 5-minute bout.The sequel largely remedies this in several great and intense scenes. Yes, what we get is overkill, but after the the first film I wanted overkill. Frenetic, heavy-metal overkill.And if you have to sacrifice a little of the charm, well fine, just not too much. But truthfully, the same chemistry that made the first film great is still there, just hidden behind the loud effects. Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Tony Stark (as usual), and still has his great verbal moments with Pepper Potts, his secretary played by Gwenyth Paltrow and friend Rhodey, now played by Don Cheadle (an improvement over Terrance Howard).While I liked Jeff Bridges as the villain in the first film, it was probably because he lacked the usual character extravagances of a comic book villain and was just a brilliant businessman out to kill (literally) the competition. The sequel gives us two new bad guys with more nuanced characterizations. As Vanko Rourke is menacing physically, but that isn't the scary part about him. Instead Rourke contains a subtle rage and brutality behind a cool, grinning expression, which is more terrifying than overt, cackling serial villainy. Unlike the first movie's evil industrialist mastermind, Rockwell is neither evil nor a mastermind as Justin Hammer, but still great as an incompetent, comic-relief foil to Tony Stark.But the film also tries to pack in a lot more than it should, like Scarlett Johansson in tights (visual appeal aside) and Samuel L. Jackson (as important as Nick Fury is). And the film is a little too long and slow in the middle. The plot could easily have been condensed, but as with so many of Tony and Pepper's awkward conversations, it takes its sweet time to get to the point. But as saddled as it is with too many elements, the movie is never dull, and unlike other bloated super-movies like Spider-Man 3, it doesn't disrespect the characters it had to pack in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After see the Iron Man 2 years ago, there was a sequel to it, and I was very exhilarated after I saw it.Before I get to the review let me say this right here, If you HATE Transformers/Iron Man 2, YOU'RE AN IDIOT. As of now, the Golden Raspberry Awards is the worst thing that the movie industry has ever done. Seriously?!! Transformers 2 was the best movie of 2009, hell, I even got the DVD for my birthday!!! And you scumbags out there didn't even pick "Old Dogs", "Land of the Lost", "G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra", or "All About Steve" hell, even Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 for that award!! But no, you're just too stupid to do so and picked my all-time favorite movie.The people of the Razzie Awards are just a bunch of lame ass people who have no acclaim for movies. I'm pretty sure that Michael Bay threw his Razzie Award in the trash can for what they've done.I know a lot of Transformers fans out there in the world are probably mad from what they've seen. They'll probably rant on them pretty soon if they get a chance to do so. I mean, Transformers 2 for Worst Picture? That is just sad. Transformers 2 haters can shut up for a while. I prefer this movie than "Alvin and the Chipmunks 2" because that movie has one of the worst endings I've seen.Seriously, the Razzie Awards sucks now, because of this. I'm going to give them two middle fingers for saying that. Transformers 2 gets two thumbs up as well.The bottom line: Golden Raspberry Awards SUCK!!!!! Now, it's time for the Iron Man 2 review.It stars Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L Jackson, Mickey Rourke etc.With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts, and James "Rhodey" Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances - and confront powerful enemies.I actually enjoyed this movie more than Alvin and the Chipmunks 2.Both Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Iron Man 2 are AWESOME.After that long rant and a short review, the movie's a must-see.Iron Man 2 gets 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about lack of plot. This movie was more of an excerpt in an arbitrary part of Tony Stark's life in which he faces a MINOR foe that as well as an ill timed sickness than anything else. This movie was a big disappointment after Iron man 1's success, and as a big fan of the first and of the comic, I must say, this story was not worth the $170 million budget that they put into it. However, it achieves a rather successful gross at the box office because of the lack of competition. Wait until the DVD comes out. Jon Favreau, make Iron Man 3 about something like the first one was.Tony Stark dismantles his opponent rather easily, and the movie's plot scenes are rather cliché (though of course the fighting is cool). Something more original than the father's movie tapes or finishing the bad guy with his new rival has to be done. (Sorry for my vagueness in this review, I don't want to spoil anything, but trust me, this movie is a major disappointment.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first one was a revelation! i thought it would be hard to see a comic book adaptation which would be a class apart, until Dark Knight and Iron Man changed that perception, Batman Begins was great but more of a build up to the great sequel! I certainly hoped so for the Iron Man franchise too.Guess that was not to be!I don't want to brush away this installment as unwatchable or anything like that but hey this one gets nowhere close to Iron Man 1. well being a comic-book junkie myself, i feel this movie as a stand alone is good enough maybe but as compared to its predecessor it does not do justice! What went wrong then?!! well the movie is good, maybe even great at some parts but the sum of it isn't. I think Mr.Favreau took too many things and tried to stuff all of it into one movie, nice touch in adding Nick Fury and references to other characters from parallel Marvel universes(Thor,Cap. America) but i think overall the movie was too Superhero studded for its own good. Robert Downey jr. is great as usual but the script makes him look silly at times!!( He seems carried away by the tongue in cheek side too often) There was way too much emphasis on the comic element of his character than i deem preferable in Iron Man or Tony Stark for that matter. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow has to be content playing just Stark's arm candy yet again! Scarlett Johansson looks hot in her leather tights as Natasha Rumanoff but her character is very vaguely fleshed out! As for the War Machine character, it was such a huge letdown i don't know where to begin. Firstly why on earth would they replace Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle!!! well i know Howard cant raise a candle to Cheadle in the acting department... but hey this is an action adventure we're talking about, and Howard looked good in Iron Man!I mean Don Cheadle as an action hero?? i doubt if there are many takers for that! I read somewhere that even Howard doesn't have a clue what happened?!!And the way the guy just steps into the Cybernetic guided armor-suit and flies off!! where the hell did he get trained for that, i guess in the Army?!! Jarvis would only respond to Stark I would have thought!! Coming to Mickey Rourke, well ,the guy kicks ass alright but then we miss Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane here! Being a Sam Rockwell fan i just explained his uninspiring act to myself by guessing he needed the money!! I read a review titled Clash-Bang-Boom! well that's all there is to this movie, which of course it does well..... but it's all style without substance!!I am being liberal in rating it 6 stars because i just adore the franchise...i was this close to giving it a 5/10.(well what do i know, i am just one of the audience!!)I pray they don't mess up the third one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as IM I</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about Iron Man is that it's the closest thing we have to reality, we'll never have powers like Spiderman, or superman, but we might someday be able to build a suite like Iron Man's. You connect with the movie more then any other superhero movie, and that's a good thing.The first movie simply blew me away, so my expectations for this one were a bit high. the movie starts out a little bit boring, but slowly starts to regain what i loved most about the first, a compete movie. Most superhero movies have sequels planned before the first movie comes out and the script is written to fit the movie and its sequels, thus giving us a fairly incomplete first movie. The movies would be great; don't get me wrong, but they wouldn't be complete, to me the first iron man was complete. It had everything, the story was great, the actors were amazing, and the visuals were stunning, okay im running out of adjectives here. The second was not, as I said the beginning was boring but half way through it picks up and blasts off into a great movie. This movie has more action then the first, but less of everything else-- including less plot-- but it's still a great movie. Go watch it you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Score: 6.5.Note: I did not see the first movie, but I didn't think it was necessary.First, the good parts. Robert Downey Jr. does well playing Iron Man, a superhero who has various personal issues but yet isn't annoying. He's also supposed to be a physicist but unfortunately he seems unconvincing in this role. However, that's easy to dismiss as he rarely actually does any physics in this movie.The plot isn't very strong. Basically the military wants the Iron Man technology and there's also a nemesis that wants to destroy Iron Man and blow stuff up. Unfortunately none of the issues Stark faces here are particularly tense. This wouldn't be overly problematic if the action made up for it, but it doesn't.In fact, the action scenes mirror the social conflict in this movie. I never felt that Stark was in any danger in this movie. The longer action scenes were a bit painful because of this. I blame the lack of tension on the G rating of this movie (in some places it's PG-13), but it's on the lower end of PG-13. As a comparison to another superhero movie, Iron Man 2 is far tamer than 'Spiderman'.Perhaps the most painful part of the action was Scarlett Johansson, whose martial arts choreographed scenes were laughable, in a bad way. In fact, any fighting in this movie is essentially what you would find from a movie for little kids. Disappointing.The redeeming quality of this movie is some of the dialogue, which was humorous on many occasions, although silly at others. Hopefully the powers that be will realise that trying to make action appeal to such a wide age range is virtually impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I get to the review itself, the first Iron Man was a big surprise for me. The first movie had a good balance of action and drama. The pacing of the movie was good. It didn't slow down drastically and neither was it rushed. It was a good character story as well.Sadly, Iron Man 2 fails where the first succeeded. There are 2 epic battle scenes in IM2, as many have mentioned, the Monaco scene and the final epic battle. Both were a joy to watch but if removed from the movie, IM2 would be a failure. Scarlett Johansson had an action scene of her own, as evidenced in the trailer, which was pretty cool as well.What really ticks me off about the movie is how much hype was built around certain characters and how miserable the final outcome turned out.It's no exaggeration that War Machine is a major factor in promoting the film. But the manner in which he is introduced is just silly. And it doesn't get any better for him. War Machine really was a waste, even in the final battle it's Iron Man who steals the limelight. No doubt it IS a movie about Iron Man but why throw in a big name hero if he ends up being pathetic sidekick? And it felt to me that War Machine really was nothing more than pathetic.And Olivia Munn's role is just plain stupid. All the talk from Favreau about Iron Man heading in a serious direction and needing her to re-shoot her scenes... So much hype and you probably won't even notice her in the movie.Jon Favreau (Happy Hogan) has more lines in this film and so does Samuel Jackson (Nick Fury). Again, nothing noteworthy.The saddest part for me was how Mickey Rourke was criminally underused. His acting was superb but his character itself came across as an introverted man with harboring much hatred and hellbent on revenge. Which is probably what he was meant to be but when played out on screen he wasn't as interesting as I thought he would be.Now for the good points of the film. There's quite a bit of comedy in it. And it's pretty funny stuff too. Sometimes really silly but still tolerably. And while many think Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Justin Hammer was annoying, I thought it was brilliant. At least he added some sort of vibe to the film. And the Monaco and final battle scenes alone are worth sitting through the film.I've probably come across as being overly critical of the film but IM2 is not as bad as I make it to be. It's frustrating because it doesn't follow in the footsteps of the first, which on the other hand was a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Iron Man is Dead Weight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was among many surprised by the first "Iron Man" film?Though not at the quality of its content, but rather by the hyperbolic praise it inspired.Two years later, I approached its sequel with adjusted expectations. I don't hold the original in high enough regard to register disappointment here, but this follow-up choreographs a demented dance from the collective missteps of its predecessor. The sloppy superhero storytelling that seized the reins around the midpoint of ye olde "Iron Man One" is in full control of this galloping horse and buggy, and it's a long, stupid ride.The nucleus of the problem is that our hero's alter ego, played winningly by Robert Downey Jr., is infinitely more compelling than that guy from the title. Everything interesting about Iron Man is on the interior of the suit, and Tony Stark, the eccentric billionaire, disappears inside of it.Superman, Batman, and Spiderman?the undisputed triple-A heroes?all have distinct personas once they get into character; they're more distilled versions of themselves. Maybe there's something else to be said with a man whose true identity is anything but secret, but when Stark changes wardrobe, he leaves his soul on the vanity. Not only does he look like a robot as Iron Man, but he behaves like a children's action figure with limited functionality? You know, six points of articulation, few to no action phrases, batteries not included? Screenwriter Justin Theroux appears to identify this weakness, minimizing Stark's in-suit exploits, but heaping on extraneous subplot in its place.And those are the swirling protons and neutrons in the tempest of troubles Iron Man battles between the lines. Never mind that we have a great villain and a terrific performance by Mickey Rourke, let's have Iron Man fight a slew of robots?Or, I'm sorry, 'drones.' By the way, is there a duller word in the English language than 'drone?'Then add a throwaway 'didn't know my daddy' motif; the meddling foundation of the upcoming "Avengers" film; the egotistical self-casting of director Jon Favreau as a disposable but oddly recurrent bodyguard (who also just so happens to have a fight scene alongside Scarlett Johansson); Stark's diminishing health; and his floundering friendship with buddy Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), and you have a film pulled in more directions than it has the means to navigate.The result is an impossible staircase of sloppily intersecting ideas and characters, with plot lines too thick to funnel into a single cohesive narrative, and too underdeveloped to be independently compelling. That "Iron Man 2" survives at all is really a miracle, and great performances where they count are largely to thank.And yet I find myself once again in the confounded minority, bewildered by the wave of support the "Iron Man" franchise garners. When it comes to this sequel, I can count the memorable moments on one hand, and I'm pretty sure they were all in the trailer. The space between is caulked with contrivance and overstuffed with plot elements that dilute what meager strengths it has."Iron Man 2" isn't a disappointment; it's an undercooked, overblown cautionary tale of blockbuster film-making at its most mediocre. Adjust your expectations accordingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but it's not nearly as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau has finally given us a sequel to the amazing super hero movie that was Iron Man. Tony Stark is back to give us more witty one liners, smashing action, and to sleep with all 12 Maxim cover models. Unfortunately, the sequel is beginning to show a few signs of what I like to call sci-fi syndrome. It has gotten a little bit too in love with itself, and as such is going too much in depth with side characters. In the first movie, Robert Downey Jr and Jeff Bridges dominated the screen time, showing off Gwyneth Paltrow on the side when it could, and this lead to a great feeling of the hero against the villain. In this sequel, Mickey Rourke did an amazing job in his character, was actually intimidating, and seemed completely cool, but he hardly had any screen time at all, so it was impossible to actually see him as a powerful villain to be feared. Jeff Bridge's character was clearly evil and a force to be reckoned with. This dilution of the villain and hero lead to this movie's fall from grace.Now, I do need to point out here that the movie was enjoyable. The action scenes were gripping, and the funny and cool lines were still there. It was just clearly inferior to the first movie, and therefore a letdown. The characters were weaker, and the acting from everyone except Robert and Mickey was a bit unpolished. The movie was still fun, and it was still worth seeing, but it wasn't anything great like the first would have lead us to believe this would be. Is it worth $10 down at the cinema? Maybe if you're really bored. But if you have a decent TV, maybe wait to get this one from Netflix and save yourself a few dollars. Overall, Iron Man 2 receives a 7/10 from me.

		<shortDescription>IM2 ? A downgrade in the Armor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a mess and where this justifies for me, the failure is miserably the lack of a good coherent story and by mashing together incoherent dialogue and junk-yard style action sequences against loud music. I even didn't think the first Iron Man was "great", but it had charm and attitude supplied by RDJ and an engaging origin tale, but it lacked in coherent or involving super-hero action at times (the last act's showdown of IM1 just didn't do much for me), and this film does suffer as well, even though they litter with so many iron man suits in the last act, it's just all noisy, dark, and uninvolving. This is a directing deficiency of Favreau, who is more suited to do the funny character bits, but lacks the vision for great action set pieces and sequences. The only stand-out action sequence was the Monaco race car sequence. The rest are pretty much lame and non-dramatic with no real menace.I did find the humor in abundance and enjoyable, but these are interspersed with quick cut scenes and fail to sustain the drama or lack of, such as the introduction of Nick Fury and company, a bit clunky. The problem arises from the screenplay where they are trying to infuse the S.H.I.E.L.D and Avengers backstory into the movie is ham fisted. The heart of the story is the flaw in the arc reactor which is poisoning Tony Stark is causing behavioral oddity which leads to his alcoholic and self destructive nature. Being a flawed in the comics and constantly battling personal issues, RDJ is spot on with his performance. But a great potential villain in Whiplash portrayed by Micky Rourke, earlier on induced some coolness and menace and later on he just whittled down into a tinkerer with robots and hacker type role. It's just a shame that he was underused in the film. Justin Hammer was just not credible as a villain: obviously rich, to act as a foil to Stark, but so stupid and incompetent, you wonder how he got that way -- a real estate mogul that decided to switch to weapons when Stark left the industry? I just thought Sam Rockwell was miscast and wasted and I didn't find his character mean or scary, only funny and slightly pathetic.One good and bad thing was the Black Widow, sure an eye-candy and unevenly used throughout until the end during Scarlett's overly-edited action sequence just seemed tiresome to watch. Overall, a downgrade from the predecessor, still enjoyable for most parts and certainly a whole lot of fine-tuning required for the IM3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Smug For Its Own Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Iron Man 1 was fun, mainly seeing a serious actor like Downey Jr having a go at comic book action. He was surrounded with quality support and provided a nice, out-of-his-comfort zone performance that made the film a little more than the average comic book effort.Downey Jr is back in this and again supported by a good cast. But this time he's too comfortable in the role and there's no real sense of involvement for the audience. Reminded me a little of the later Roger Moore Bond films.The support cast is fine, but like Downey Jr all pretty much one-note. Rourke has little to do and Rockwell is wasted. The women are a bit better, with Paltrow having a bit more to do and Johansson having fun.I'm sure this will be a success and sure that it will probably generate a third movie; I just hope that the next one is a little more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Listen! This Sequel Is FUN!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read professional reviews citing an absence of sparks between Pepper Potts and Tony Stark, lack of story, and lack of meat in spite of its being a "...slick production..." So I was tempted to enter the theater with dampened expectations, but just couldn't muster the disappointment necessary. In spite of that, I was not disappointed. This film was not only serviceable as a sequel, but is a fine sequel with a great story, an awesome villain, and an aptly saucy Pepper Potts.Development of Stark's textbook narcissism cycles nicely, giving the on-screen version of this flawed comic book hero the adequate feeling of supposed superiority needed to further appropriate character development in this direction.So don't listen. This is a fun film, which we all enjoyed, and cannot wait to own. Hope you enjoy it, too.It rates an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

Let's face it, as dynamic as Tony Stark is, would his best friend be a straight faced Cheadle or slightly laid backed Terrence?

		<shortDescription>Better than the average, but not up with the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a good film. It has two dymanic, beautiful leads at the top of their game. Is has a mean looking, potentially threatening bad guy. It has smart, shiny, clever technology and mercifully, at 124 mins, isn't too long. These are all good qualities and add up to a solid piece of cinematic entertainment.It is a sequel, and a piece of a greater story, so does it stand alongside it's predecessor. Not particularly well, sadly. It lacks the freshness and revelatory qualities of the original and doesn't provide anything new. This time Iron Man is confronted with more Iron Men. So I guess it's just, literally, more of the same. The relationship between Stark and buddy Rhodes is rehashes rather than built upon, likewise with loyal confidante and friend Pepper Potts, where there is a clearly a spark, but adds no more than a kiss toward the end - an easy cop-out.Where it's greatest failure lies, is that there isn't really any excitement. The bad guy, Mickey Rourke, confronts Stark/Iron Man during a sensational, thrilling action set-piece in Monaco (with a very cool weapon, by the way), but then virtually disappears for the entire second act, while the less effective (though highly entertaining) "other" bad guy, Hammer takes over. There is no tension building and no real threat to Iron Man (other than a serious butt-kicking). The hero never really seems in any real danger - even when he faces death fron his own life-saving chest thing, he simply invents a new one and the problem is solved.So, how does it rate overall. A good film, entertaining, clever... better than your average hero movie, but not up with the best. By the time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Comic-Sequel of All-Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the critical trashing of this film, it's hard for me to understand why? Okay, so maybe there's no "originality" but this is a sequel. We have already seen what the world of "Iron Man" offers, so what more "originality" do you need? Or is it due to some sort of lack of story? I thought the story was good...it was'nt bad, but what do I know? For me this film was just as good as 2008's "The Dark Knight." Instead, there you had the late Heath Ledger who stole the show as "The Joker." Downey has made "Iron Man" only what Bale wishes he could make "Batman." "Iron Man 2" may not be the greatest comic-sequel of all time but a pretty close race. Here is my Top 5 comic-sequels of all time.1. THE DARK KNIGHT 2. IRON MAN 2 3. BATMAN RETURNS 4. SPIDER-MAN 2 5.

		<fullReview>Yes, Yes the movie was awesome..... but the 1st part was the better one. As an Iron man fan, the reason for the success of the 1st part was its story.... there was a smooth flow , from creating Tony's new weapons to the US military,then getting captured, building the Iron Man Suit for his escape, feeling the importance of Iron man for the safety of the people(and then kicking the butt of those terrorist), the suspense of Jeff Bridges and the final show down. But the 2nd part had too much talking and less action. Only Quentin Tarantino has the art of making a movie on the subject of talking ..for e.g. Pulp Fiction ,Inglourious Basterds. Anyways ...the point is that its a summer action blockbuster..so we expect a lot of fire works.. Mickey Rourke is excellent in this movie, he had that villain's attitude, and the fight between him and Tony at the Monaco Track is worth your ticket. In fact he is the best villain after Heath Ledger of The Dark Knight. All in all a must watch movie, have a blast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The brilliance of the first installment, the direction of favreau, inclusion of Theroux (of Tropic Thunder fame) for the script and the charisma of Downey Jr. created huge expectations for this sequel. The film delivers in almost all departments but Iron man 2 lacks what everyone is mentioning as "that something".With a cast that includes rourke, rockwell, Cheadle and downey himself, the movie never slackens. Downey is at his best as Tony stark and Paltrow is even better than the first installment. Johannson is just eye candy. she has a few good action sequences but does not have any major role to play in the movie. Samuel Jackson appears to remind us of The Avengers here and there. The dialogues are well written. The action sequences are brilliant. Lauri Gaffin's sets are gorgeous.Theroux could have sharpened the script here and there. A few complexities refrain us from regarding this in the same level as Iron Man 1. Nevertheless it is a treat to watch. Go with an open mind and forget Iron Man 1 for a while and you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is ROBOCOP (1987) on steroids. This movie is action packed with the requisite theater-vibrating sound effects along with a high-thrills and a SPIDERMAN (2002) personal backstory that lends a nice balance to this summer blockbuster. A few weaknesses persist that take this movie down a notch - a rather sedate opening sequence that also leads to a underdeveloped, stereotypical antagonist, and an Ironman lead-in that somehow ends up on stage without revealing any remarkable landing sequence. There's the amazing, but over-the-top sedan scene on the Monaco raceway. The movie has a superb martial arts sequence in the league of BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) much more enthralling than THE DARK KNIGHT'S (2008) fight sequences. This sequel, like SPIDERMAN 2 (2004) extends the personal drama and confronts the lingering father-son relational bitterness (though not even its resolution was perhaps underdeveloped as well). IRON MAN 2 (2010) presents a rather fascinating dynamic of two villains, both well played by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (who had an amazing starring role in the relatively obscure movie MOON, 2009). The narcissistic charisma of Ironman and the intimate focus on terminal death issues were well played out in the movie. The climax while explosive, failed to reach the heights of THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) nor the personal intimate and emotional intensity of BOURNE IDENTITY (2002), THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004). Interestingly, IRONMAN 2 is able to avoid the crass, overt sexual titillating excuse, though there is plenty of insinuations. Overall, IRONMAN 2 is blockbuster, summer lead-in entertainment that has both the riveting emotional dilemma of a hero and feel-good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man + extra charisma - Novelty - Initial charm = Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not difficult to guess the best part of the movie. Sometimes you feel that a particular role was destined to be played by a particular person. You can't separate the role and the person. Robert Downey, Jr. is Tony Stark. He is so convincing that if not for the backlash of the fans you may very well change the name of Tony Stark to Robert Downey, Jr. He is absolutely enjoying this role and it shows on the screen. Also Mickey Rourke is an excellent casting choice for Ivan Vanko / Whiplash. He is really cool. I read that it was Downey who initially proposed Rourke's name for Whiplash.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is good. But I thought the cheeky romance between Stark &amp; Pepper in the first movie was not so great here. They could have improved the dialogue between them. Sam Rockwell plays Justin Hammer, the rival weapons manufacturer to Tony Stark. On one hand I was seeing Downey, Jr. absolutely enjoying his role but on the other hand I thought Rockwell was somehow not into the role and was somewhat disinterested. Rockwell is such a fantastic actor and especially after last year's Moon, I think it's time for the studios to make better use of him. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black widow is arresting as usual but her fight scene is the only action piece in the film that was rather boring to me. It was there to please Scarlett's fans but the makers should have taken more care about it and made it a tad more interesting. And Don Cheadle is brilliant in his role as Lt. Colonel James Rhodes / War Machine.The Iron Man was such a fun movie because it was novel and also there was a cute charm to it. Iron man 2 repeats it, so somewhere the novelty is lost and this is not as charming as the first part. Nevertheless Iron man 2 is a very engaging watch. All the action sequences are cool especially the piece on the race track. Once again, I hated Scarlett's fight sequence. When I saw all those drones at the climax, I was afraid for a while that this might turn out to be torture to ears like Transformers 2 but thank gosh there is not much metal clanking. The final showdown between Iron Man and Whiplash was surprisingly a low key affair, I mean they could have put a few seconds more there.All in all this is a really fun watch &amp; you won't regret spending money on this. There is a special clip at the end of the credits which shows the discovery of Thor. If you didn't knew by now, check this on Youtube. For the fans of Thor, this would be thrilling.I'm seeing a full blown invasion of the screens by the Marvel characters in the coming years. With Thor coming in 2011 and Avengers probably in 2012, Marvel fans would be licking their lips. I don't know what else will be coming in the next 10 years. The coming decade could very well be a decade of superheroes if DC also joins the fray.I've actually got a crazy weird idea for a movie whereby Marvel heroes attack DC headquarters with the help of DC villains and in the sequel DC heroes attack Marvel headquarters with the help of Marvel villains. Just imagine Team 1: Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Whiplash, Galactus, Dr. Doom vs Team 2: Spiderman, Ironman, Hulk, Lex Luthor, The Joker, Thor.

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of R Downey but Iron Man is the genre I like. We go to movie quite regularly so the trailer is something "must" watch and it's an interesting trailer though. If you want to watch this movie, you must go to theater to enjoy the sound effects. But if you are like me, expect somethings new of the iron man then it's quite disappointed. The film makes me remember Transformer 2 where there are many more robots. While each new robots has some specialties, I was sitting in the theater last night to watch dozen of cloned iron man and the real one has nothing new except that the suit now is packed in a brief case size.The story is not in any direction. It's not the revenge of Aton or it's not the Tony Stark's position reactor. I feel like the writer need to add a bunch of things to make the film longer and to have place for some humor senses.Iron Man 2008 was a Marvel success but I might expect more than an ads when came to see Iron Man 2 last night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Particularly effective introductions can manage to encapsulate the essence of a character within a single brief scene. Iron Man 2 manages to do one better by introducing its protagonist in a fashion capturing him to a tee, but also representative of the majority of his film's faults and successes. Seen from behind, Iron Man leaps out of an airplane, soaring through the air (pausing only to be inelegantly hit by a firework) to land before a cascade of screaming fans, backed by bikini clad dancing women, his armour removed to reveal grinning, gregarious millionaire industrialist Tony Stark. It should be exhilarating and sure to raise an immediate vast grin, and yet something feels... off. Perhaps the aerial descent or Stark's smirking on a revolving platform feel slightly too long, the pace seemingly compromised for the sake of matching AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" (an inclusion which, given their 'Greatest Hits' release titled after the film, feels gratuitous). Perhaps the sequence feels too forced to fully enjoy its excitement and offbeat humour. Upon the film's culmination, such exact sentiments of enjoyment yet vague distance remain intact, making Iron Man 2 an indisputably fun watch, but one which feels unmistakably (for lack of a better word) assembled. The first Iron Man was that true rarity: as close as Hollywood will come to a big budget grass roots blockbuster. Financed by the up and coming Marvel studios (for the first time in charge of their own superhero characters) and helmed by a director with only bland kid films as credentials who championed improvisation over a cemented script, with a formerly 'uninsurable' actor as the relatively obscure hero, the lack of expectations led to the remarkable combination of those involved both striving to prove themselves and taking the liberty to play around. Such ambition, innovation and earnest soul are what Iron Man 2 seems to lack, replaced by a fusion of by-the-numbers rekindling of successful components of the first. One can almost smell the checklist: "inner demons leading to progressive change, unrequited sexual tension, scene of Stark building an invention, a final showdown with big armoured foe" (a woefully brief and brainless anticlimax for a film continually gearing up to a final showdown), while new, interesting thematic links (Stark's boast of 'privatizing world peace') remain tragically underexplored. Furthermore, while returning director Jon Favreau mercifully manages to balance his plethora of new characters enough to avoid the 'villain overload' syndrome plaguing many such comic book blockbusters (Spider-Man 3 and Batman and Robin most grotesquely), all feel like quick sketches rather than truly realized characters, despite the formidable array of star talent. Similarly, all characters being stuck in different subplots, none of them particularly enthralling, makes for jumbled focus and awkward pacing (Stark's 'evolution' in particular transpires far too early) draining any sense of scope or threat from the film. In many ways, the film feels like a bridging gap towards future superhero smash The Avengers more than self-sustained narrative, with surprisingly little happening despite the flashy trappings.The fault, it would seem, lies with new screenwriter Justin Theroux, who seems determined to take the genuinely fresh array of characters and situations and shoehorn them into tiresomely contrived narrative arcs (the 'father drama' of both Stark and antagonist Ivan Vanko is particularly dreary), none of which feel genuine or compelling. John Debney's musical score serves to further sink in the cliché, his collection of optimistic, soaring strings a severe drop in quality from the former film's spunkier rock score. That said, only the most jaded would entirely dismiss such an unashamedly enjoyable action smash on account of a clumsy script, and Iron Man 2's redemption lies in its fun factor. In spite of his film's seemingly heavy thematic core (revenge, betrayal of friends, looming mortality), Favreau is wise enough to keep the tone brisk, breezy and often hilarious, and, while still keeping action sequences sparse in favour of character development, sustaining a commendably scrappy energy when things start to go boom (with the exceptions of an embarrassingly ill- advised armour-clad drunken throwdown and the aforementioned dud of a climax). As frustratingly entangled as the film may become, boring is a word which never comes to mind. In spite of less screen time, looming death and a more ambiguously unlikeable characterization, the peerlessly quirky charisma and cocky sparkle of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark remains immutable, while his armour-clad alter-ego is as slick and captivating as ever. Enormously more watchable than any other contemporary protagonist, Downey Jr. (while incrementally flatter than his first crack at the role) remains easily worth the admission price singlehandedly. Despite moments recalling her former exasperated charm, Gwyneth Paltrow struggles to make alienated love interest Pepper Potts much of a compelling counterpart to Stark, and Don Cheadle (apart from a superb comic denouement) offers stern composure and wounded frowns to the best of his considerable talent as Stark's military liaison buddy James Rhodes but is given few moments to truly shine, even when clad in the formidable War Machine armour. Mickey Rourke's imbalanced Whiplash feels a definitive case of a brilliant characterization improperly handled by the script, yet Rourke bleeds enough vindictive menace and abrasive weirdness to make his otherwise stock villain tremendously effective nonetheless. Sam Rockwell's rival industrialist Justin Hammer is an exquisitely irritating shadow of Stark, his simpering arrogance threatening to steal a show otherwise cemented by Downey Jr., but the unfeasibly gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, despite her best attempts at contributing steely dignity to the fray, feels blatantly reduced to spandex-clad, vicious action-unleashing eye candy - a fact that few viewers are likely to object to. While still lively and fun, Iron Man 2 feels too scattershot to come close to the emotional resonance or high-flying exhilaration of its predecessor. With any luck, the sinister shroud of inferred studio string-pulling can be shaken off by round three, that the Golden Avenger might reach his soaring potential once again.-7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun watch but no Iron Man 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has all the makings of an amazing superhero action movie in the league of The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and even the original Iron Man movie, but unfortunately it didn't live up to that expectation. Don't get me wrong, this movie was enjoyable start to finish but it didn't have the emotional punch of the other movies mentioned. Really there is no heart here, and never once does the movie require you to think.Without the great work of Robert Downey Jr. in the role he was meant to play, this would movie would lack charm as well. Iron Man 2 is close to two hours but seems to lose the time. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), a truly great villain for Iron Man didn't have enough presence in the film. His final scene ended up feeling fairly corny.It's hard to express everything wrong with a movie like Iron Man 2 but there just wasn't any meat here. Gwyneth Paltrow who was terrific in the first Iron Man is only allowed to play one note here until the very end. She's the party pooper to Robert Downey Jr.'s perpetual party.Don Cheadle steps into Terrance Howard's shoes as Rhodey well enough but as with every relationship in this movie, the Cheadle and Downey Jr. story is underdeveloped. Scarlett Johansson plays Downey Jr's new assistant, hired on the spot. She adds some sex appeal to the cast, but again, it feels like we didn't see very much of her, and no bathing suit scene.The main problem I have with this movie is that we don't tread any new territory. It feels like this movie just had to be made because it was going to make a lot of money. I wanted an Iron Man 2, but one that was more engaging. Jon Favreau does all he can with the uninspiring script and plays "Happy", comic relief and a bright spot in the movie.In the end, this is a light, fun sequel that still leaves a lot to be desired. It seemed to be filler left on the cutting room floor from Iron Man 1. Iron Man 2 will not be selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, but it's going to make a lot of money. Probably pass the 400 million domestically and maybe even scratch close to the 1 billion mark worldwide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I'm the biggest Iron Man fan I know. My Myspace name is Tony Stark, I loved Iron Man 1, and I enjoy the comics too. So I'm no guru but I'm just giving you some perspective.I'm a big fan but still did not like this movie. It was over 2 hours long and I felt EVERY minute of it. The magic was gone. The fights were few and far between and very short. I can hardly count that scuffle between drunk Ironman and War Machine a fight. There was too much politics, too much talk, and no heart. Why the filmmakers decide to have him expose himself as Ironman is a mystery to me. Where is the charming funny Tony Stark? And where's his cute relationship with Pepper? None of it gelled. Mickey Rourke could have been a cool villain but he was defeated almost as easily as his drones. This movie was on Transformers 2 level. And that's actually a very good comparison unfortunately.This was a sequel that should have beaten out the first. But it doesn't compare to it. I wanted a superhero blowout and I got a political snooze fest. Sorry, Ironman 2, I wanted to love you, but you just weren't epic enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sequel...but?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that i truly enjoyed the movie. Sequels are tough because we all develop our own unique expectations based on the original. As a sequel, this is a home run. As a first movie, it would be a bit disappointing. Why? First...as a sequel. Great humor and humanity from RDJ. Don Cheadle is excellent while Mickey and Sam Rockwell make great antagonists. Action scenes are well done. Although, I would have liked to see more fight scenes. The leading ladies are OK. Character development is well done and the tie to future movies is fun and loose enough to give latitude for additional movies.As a stand alone movie, it is a bit disjointed and would not have created the din that arose from the original.I have friends who blasted the movie (6 out of 10). I disagree. It is a fun couple of hours with engaging twists and turns. GO SEE IT! You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the surprise success of Iron Man in 2008 a sequel was bound to be made, with Marvel aiming to make the ultimate superhero film, The Avenges. Whilst a sequel was always a risk of never matching the quality of the original, but most superhero films then to buck the trend with the first sequel.Six months after the events of the first film Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has become even more of a star because of his success as Iron Man. He made Stark Industries into a more ethical company and appoints his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as his new CEO. But there is trouble on the horizon: the US Senate demand that Tony hands over his Iron Man suit, the palladium that in the arc reactor that keeps him alive is also poisoning his blood, killing him slowly. There is also a deadly threat from Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who develops his own reactor and powerful suit so he can gain revenge against the Stark family. Vanko gets recruited by Tony's main rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to make an army of suits so they can take down Iron Man. With Tony slowly dying his behaviour becomes more erratic and he slowly drives his friends away, with his best friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) to steal one his suits, allowing War Machine to be born.Iron Man 2 has many good and bad elements, mostly good. Jon Favreau continues in the director's chair and adds to his cast of talented actors. Of course Downey and Paltrow were great together and had excellent chemistry. It was a shame that Terrence Howard left as Rhodey but the filmmakers found a great replacement with Cheadle, an excellent actor with a role that increases in this film. Rourke and Rockwell both made great villains, particularly Rourke as the intelligence and powerful Vanko. It was a shame he did not have more screen time as he was a great as the bad guy and shows he was not just a one dimensional character. Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson were also good additions (yes I know Jackson was in the end-credits scenes in Iron Man). But they screen time was limited. Favreau improves as an action director with better actions scenes like in Monaco and the special effects were brilliant like in the last film. But the end fight scene could have been a little more epic. Favreau makes the tone of Iron Man 2 a little more serious then Iron Man was (which was not bad at all), but he keeps a strong scene of fun in the film and there is a lot of humour throughout. He knows how to deliver a blockbuster. Plus there are plenty of hints toward the upcoming Avengers film, which is great to see for all the comic-book geek within all of us.But Iron Man 2 is not as strong as Iron Man. The screenplay by Justin Theroux is sadly a little too unfocused and had too many subplots. Some elements do not fit as well in the film and makes it a little too long and some felt forced like Rhodey's falling out with Tony. It also suffers from having too villains, confusing the audience on who they should focus on. What made Iron Man was because it had a simple story. But this is minor and the screenplay is solid for the most part.A very enjoyable start to 2010's summer season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this I thought it looked great. Now that I saw the film not so much. The film's action sequences are not that exciting, the plot is confusing at times, and there's not as much humour as before. It got better near the end with Scarlett Johansson doing some fighting as well as the fight with Ivan's robots. To say this film was a disappointment is an understatement. This film makes Iron Man look like a classic compared to this one. Now Iron Man was a great movie but i wouldn't consider it a classic superhero movie. Robert Downey Jr. seemed to play the role the same in this movie but i can't say he was that cool in this one. The scene when he's drunk with the iron man outfit on was just stupid and the fight between him and Rhodes was poorly done. This is just a stupid action movie that will probably entertain kids a lot more then adults.</fullReview>

This follow-up to the 2008 success has some problems with the plot, I'm not saying it's a bad movie but certainly worse than its prequel. There are a lot of scenarios but none of them explaining what's really happening. Furthermore the action scenes we have aren't excellent at all, the storytelling is amusing and entertaining, acting performances up to the situation as well but the whole product is less convincing than Iron Man 1. I'd certainly recommend it but without great expectations from the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Follow Up To The First One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I finally saw Iron Man a time after it came out, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Initially, I was reserved as comic book films were kind of just coming into their own. But, with so many now producing high value entertainment, expectations going into Iron Man 2 were slightly elevated. While I don't hold this series as dear to heart as the Batman reboot films or Spider-Man, they are extremely entertaining and RDJ's Tony Stark is one of the best comic book heroes to grace the screen. Thankfully, IM2 proves to be both highly entertaining and a great next step from the first film.First, let me go through what didn't really work in the film. My biggest gripe, much like the first film, was there felt like kind of a lack of action. And when there was action, it didn't feel like there was enough. With the final battle scene aside, most of the action was short lived. They were some really well developed set pieces, but it felt like we were just being shown a sample. And it's too bad, because the Whiplash character is a pretty cool villain and War Machine makes a pretty awesome sidekick. Secondly, it felt like there was a little too much happening in the film. There has been some complaints about this pulling a Spiderman 3 and stuffing too much into it. And, it does suffer a bit. There's the Hammer storyline, the Vanko storyline, the SHIELD storyline, and this isn't even getting into all the personal stories involving Tony himself. It's just unfortunate, because so many of the stories don't get fully developed to their potential, a mistake that creates a bit of disconnect. With those being the biggest complaints, there is more good in the film than bad. The acting ranges from excellent to serviceable, but most of it is excellent. All the leads: RDJ, Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, and Don Cheadle are fantastic. Don Cheadle actually does a better job here than Terrence Howard, as Cheadle seems to provide some challenge to Stark that really gave the relationship some umph. It should be noted that this film really demonstrates how RDJ is the perfect choice for Stark. He is endlessly entertaining and is at least 50% of why this movie is so great. He's consistently funny, shows great depth to a character that is egotistical and a little unbalanced, and proves once again why he has returned to having such a great career as an actor. The other actors are sufficient. Scarlette Johansen doesn't have a whole lot going on, showing up for a few small parts before a big action piece at the end, but she handles it naturally and shows she could even come into action pretty well. Gwyneth Paltrow provides a nice foil for RDJ as their dialog and scenes are just the right kind of bittersweet. Even director Favreau plays off some nice comic relief as personal aid Happy, who gets a bit more meat in this film. Speaking of Favreau, his directing here is once again spot on. He further turns Stark into someone of a complicated nature. He's self centered, sure, and he boasts and gloats in the spotlight, but he's also quite complicated. He's not exactly the hero type, but he is a hero, and that makes him one of the more intriguing Marvel heroes. The layers in the film aren't all bad either. There is a lot in the film about family, but it isn't completely shoved in your face. While it could have been easy to have Tony go into some very dark places and brood over his family, it is instead dealt with just enough to add that extra layer to Stark and touch on the element of the story. This is one of the few additional story elements that I truly enjoyed. The dialog here is also very well written, and it helps as it keeps the whole movie very entertaining. Because, as mentioned, there isn't a whole lot of action.What action there is, is fairly entertaining, if on the short side. Mickey Rourke here is way underused. He does a great job, and his character is very fascinating, but there isn't really enough of him. It felt like he could have come out like Dr. Octopus from Spider Man 2, a villain whom we could sympathize with and got to see plenty of. Sadly, there are so many antagonists here, that most of them interweave through each other and no one villain comes off as intriguing as they should be. The action falls into this line. Because of all the villains, the action plays light and interweaves in the story. We get short action scene in the beginning at Monaco, one in the middle between Iron Man and War Machine, and the climax. And while they all look fantastic, each scene feels like a preview or merely a taste. There isn't nearly enough of what we think we're going to get, and it is disappointing when the scene ends before we are ready for a conclusion. The problem here is my same gripe with the first film: the action never fulfills it's ambitious promise.But, don't let these facts keep you from the film. Much like Tropic Thunder, if there's any reason to see the film, it's for RDJ. Luckily, he's also the main character, so you see quite a bit of him. Also, it's quite lucky the film is actually well written (as was the first film). But beyond Downey Jr., this is quite an entertaining film and one that will truly kick off the summer film season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2. Must be the start of summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau is out to make a good comic-book summer popcorn movie with Iron Man 2, no more no less. Anyone expecting the super dark out of this film lime the Dark Knight need venture along to something else (for one, Nolan's own Inception, but that's not here nor there). We once again have Tony Stark, the man and self-made legend, who is unique among superheroes as he 'came-out' as it were at the end of the first film as being in fact Iron Man. He now has to deal with other things, such as the government wanting, telling, him to hand over his technology for defense ("I have just privatized world peace" is a keeper of a line), and his heart and soul Pepper Potts, and other new things, such as prickly competition in Justin Hammer, a hot red-headed secretary who can kick ass (and other things)... oh, and his father's legacy and the possibility that his technology for his heart may kill him.So as you can imagine, Stark is not quite at the top of his game. He can still kick ass as Iron Man - when the suit is in close proximity - but his nearly-close-to-deathness and still cleaning up after Stark company mistakes (such as the gnarly Russian cold-war leftover Ivan, aka 'Whiplash', played with gnarly gumption by Mickey Rourke), make him even more of an egotistical jerk than usual. This is what Favreau makes interesting: Stark has grown over time, but the obstacles in his path really knock him for a loop despite always putting a slightly self-deprecating and sarcastic face on things (or, other times, drunk-off-his-ass face on things, which brings Rhodey to become a "War Machine"). What does a hero have to do to still be an extravagant billionaire out in public and not have to suffer fools trying to crib his technology? Stark's complexity carries the dramatic weight (if sometimes not quite as much as before; the midpoint becomes a little sluggish, though certainly not unwatchable when Sam Jackson comes on screen as Nick Fury), and Downey Jr still makes him one of the most fascinating and just plain f***ing fun superheroes around. Tony Stark is someone you'd love to hate if he weren't such a lovable louse. He's a womanizer and doesn't put on airs, but he deeply cares more about things that do matter than most, and Downey is able to balance out that snark and sense of humor of things with more heartfelt moments like with Paltrow's Pepper Potts (watch those scenes where he offers her the CEO position and then near the end when... well, don't want to spoil that, but they are touching). The new additions to the cast help a bit as well: Rockwell has some fun playing a one 1/2 dimensional slimeball of a politico, and Rourke gets to grit and act gnarly with the best of them as Whiplash. And Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Romanoff... woof.Oh, and the action is still high-flying and exciting and has some surprises in store for the audience (others like the 'ex-wife' actually, pleasantly, underwhelm as irony), and Favreau is able to still manage getting in the humorous beats in those intense moments of action and daring-do. While not every joke hits or line connects, enough do to keep things going on; Favreau even has fun with himself in the Happy Hogan role in a fight scene that is just about perfect for him. The biggest problem though is the allusions - no, wait, flat out references - to the upcoming Avengers movie and other tie-ins to the Marvel universe. In the past it was a little more subtle (a SHIELD joke near the end of the first one, and a cameo of Stark in Incredible Hulk notwithstanding), and in this they are crowbared in a few scenes, albeit one involving Captain America is very funny.But look, this isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't necessarily trying to up the ante on the first one (though, frankly as one of the truly great comic-book adaptations, what could), but it kicks some ass and gets some laughs and assembles a top-shelf cast for a script that's worth the time and money and energy. It's a nice kick-start: the summer of 10 is here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downey Jr. and Rockwell are outstanding, but this sequel lacks the balance and energy of its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Iron Man was a total knockout when it was released in early 2008. It was an all around awesome movie that surprised just about everyone with how well made it was. Having Robert Downey Jr. sizzle in the lead role likely helped, as did the blend of action, thrills and laughs. It was a great start to the summer, and one of the few movies people remembered even came out that year after The Dark Knight was unleashed almost three months later. With hype running high on Iron Man 2, is there any way it could even possibly match up to the original film? The film opens with an interesting introduction to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who does not appear to be much of a fan of Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Rather quickly, the film jumps a few months after Stark's announcement to the world that he is Iron Man. He has become an even bigger celebrity, has helped bring peace to a few warring nations, and the US government is hounding him to hand over the technology for military use. And that is just the start of his new set of problems to go along with his new public identity.While Iron Man was a fairly straight forward story with fairly little jumping, at times, Iron Man 2 feels like a convoluted mess. On top of Stark coming to terms with his new life and problems with long time friends and colleagues Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard), writer Justin Theroux throws in rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to turn up the heat alongside Rourke's Vanko, new "assistant" Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) and a more fleshed out Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). While a movie like The Dark Knight was able to use its multitude of story lines to its advantage (with no small help to its longer running time), Iron Man 2 seems to have problems not too long after blasting through the starting gate.The multiple stories going on and weaving throughout the film are not bad, they just lack the interest and the drive the story at the heart of the original film had. At times, there is just so much going on that it becomes boring and feels like it is dragging the film out. I originally envisioned the added emphasis on S.H.I.E.L.D. and the first real push towards 2012's The Avengers would hinder the film, but at times, they are the most interesting things about it. Their mere mentions and initial origins feel more fleshed out, and more developed than half the ideas Theroux seems keen at throwing at the audience. They are the elements that stick, and despite having just come from the film, seem to be the only real integral things I can take from the film.Even worse is the character development. With the exception of Stark and Hammer, the rest of the cast gets very little time to really do much of anything. We get hints at how deadly an adversary Vanko is, but outside of a moderately thrilling sequence at a racetrack, we never really see how devastating he can be. Rushman is more of an enigma if anything, and seems to be here strictly to offer a tease for what may be a pivotal character in a later Marvel film. The chemistry between Potts and Stark is the only thing worthwhile thing Paltrow really gets to offer in the film, and Rhodes seems even more downplayed here than in the original film (even though Cheadle seems to be a much better fit for the character than Howard ever was). Spider-Man 3 had this same problem of adding too much to a good thing, so why did anyone think it would work out for the best here? But I digress. Downey Jr. was perfect the first time in the role as Stark, and looks even more at home in the role here. We really get to see the psychology and inner workings of the character more in this film, and Downey Jr. pulls it off with finesse over and over again. There are times where he looks like he should and wants to be doing more, but even at his most subdued, he is chewing up everything around him. He was born to play this role, and at no point does he ever seem to lose track of who the character is or how he should be played. At the same time, Rockwell knocks his role right out of the park. He plays Hammer with just the right amount of sleaze and sarcasm that he nearly steals the show in some sequences. He does great as the villain, and while some may be annoyed by his character, I could not get nearly enough.The effects are stellar across the board. I had heard some of them were not quite up to par, but I could not find any scene where I was not impressed by what was happening on screen. They are not perfect by any means, but the wow factor of the original film is still on display here. And thankfully, the extended ending battle scene for the most part more than makes up for the stilted and much too short battle from the original film's finale.Jon Favreau took a gamble on Iron Man and it paid off. For Iron Man 2, I think the gamble was a bit too much. I really enjoyed his extended performance as Happy Hogan, but the film just lacks the balance and the energy of the original film. There are some awesome sequences, and excellent performances from Downey Jr. and Rockwell. But as a cohesive whole, the film just feels like a bit of a disappointment. A decent disappointment, but a disappointment nonetheless.7/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

There you go.That technical glitch aside, I'd give the movie a solid 7.5/10. I wasn't quite thrilled with the action or the plot, but solid performances by Downey and the supporting.</fullReview>

The plot was well themed but it lacked direction at certain intervals. I kept on reminding myself that this is a comic book movie, this is a comic book movie...But so was Iron Man. The director tried too hard to make it good but in the end it just lacked a strong plot that made the first one so good. Also, the bull technology nonsense that they kept on talking about just made my head spin. So many plot holes, so many unnecessary scenes and characters. In the end, the director just created a summer blockbuster; in nowhere would this ever be considered a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequel drop-off is a well-known phenomenon, but it still bums us out when it occurs. Most of us only bother with extensions of films we liked, as we hope the next edition will buck the industry trend. Like Godfather 2. No such luck in Robert Downey Jr's further adventures in this superhero's supersuit.After a great early scene in which a witty, sarcastic Tony Stark triumphs over a pompous senator's (Gary Shandling) political posturing, the film drags emotionally - especially compared to the charismatic, sympathetic Stark persona introduced in the first film. Six months after the events in that one, we now find a Stark who is initially too full of himself, then anxious and morose over threats to his health and the superiority of his technology over those who would do evil in the world. Scarlett Johansson and Mickey Rourke head the new arrivals, as a surprisingly versatile assistant and arch-villain, respectively.The adrenaline rushes of battles and explosions are viscerally comparable to such scenes from the first, but lose some punch, having to overcome the long morose stretches of Stark wrestling with his issues. There's still a decent scattering of comic relief in Jon Favreau's direction of the script Justin Theroux wrote with The Master - Stan Lee. But the overall energy level is disappointing. Not enough to kill the franchise, but at least offering a cautionary tale for the brains behind an Iron Man 3 to remember what made the first one such a winner.Viewing Tip - After the interminable (as they always must be for stunt and f/x-laden fare) credits, there's a brief scene for which fans should defer their exits, allowing the less faithful first shot at the restrooms.Spoiler Alert Quiz #1 - Among a handful of familiar talking-heads doing segments in character on TV screens within the film, Bill O'Reilly delivers what his detractors would likely regard as a classic example of the bone-headed, pompous, ill-informed overreactions to the depicted events that define his Fox News persona. Is his willingness to speak those lines intentional, compulsive, clueless, or self-satirical? Spoiler Alert Quiz #2 - Sci-fi flicks, like many others, require considerable "suspension of disbelief" for audience engagement. Which facet of this film demands the greater stretch - Scarlett Johansson kicking serious butt, or Mickey Rourke reading and working from complex sets of high-tech blueprints?</fullReview>

I sure got the wrong picture about Iron Man 2 after those, this was not a disappointing film. In fact Iron Man 2 in my opinion was the best sequel made of a superhero-movie.This movie had it all!Great performances, funny jokes, excellent music and Samuel L.

		<fullReview>Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man' was a favorite in 2008, it was a show-stopper. The expectations from the sequel of the cult-hit are gargantuan. Does 'Iron Man 2' entertain? Is it as good as the first? The answer is finally here: 'Iron Man 2' is rough and tough, it doesn't touch the bench of the original, but entertains majorly. Favreau's direction is spell-binding! Stark has revealed his identity as Iron Man and is resisting calls by the United States Government to hand over the technology. Ivan Vanko has also duplicated the technology and built weapons of his own, creating new challenges for Stark, so what happens next? Some portions are so so freaking amazing! Mickey's intro as Whiplash takes your breath away, it's the best sequence in the entire film. Even the fight between Iron Man and War Machine is majorly entertaining. The climax beings with a bang, but is a letdown to watch Whiplash getting bumped off soon. But despite the hiccups, 'Iron Man 2' is a winner! RD Jr proves yet again we don't need another Stark/Iron Man when he's around. He's fantastic, once again. Mickey Rourke is another topper. The Legendary Star is kick-ass as Whiplash, he hardly has any lines, but his powerful expressions speak more than needed! Sam Rockwell is terrific in a villainous role, the highly-talented actor sinks his teeth into the character. Gwyneth Paltrow is charming. Scarlett Johansson looks a million bucks and does a good job. Don Cheadle is superb, we can forget Terrence Howard. Jon Favreau has never been a great actor, but he's fine here. Samuel L. Jackson is cool in cameo.On the whole, 'Iron Man 2' will surely rules the hearts of millions. It has the potential to make you think to visit it twice at the movies. Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRON MAN 2 2010Written by Justin Theroux. Directed by Jon Favreau. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany, Leslie Bibb and Garry Shandling.Ol' Shellhead and company return in another blockbuster to kick off the summer movie season and they more than prove the first Iron Man was no fluke. Palladium-powered by excellent performances, great action sequences and a funny, fast-paced script, Iron Man 2 rockets into the pantheon of best super-hero movies ever.The story begins with billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) seemingly at the top of the world. He's fulfilling his father's dreams of a better tomorrow by hosting a year long technology expo and batting aside the demands of a smarmy U.S. Senator (Garry Shandling) that Stark surrender his amazing armor to the government. Claiming the rest of the world is years away from creating anything like Iron Man, Stark arrogantly and entertainingly presents himself as the man who has privatized world peace and says he's capable of handling any problem that arises on his own.That's more boast than fact. Stark is actually being slowly poisoned by the Palladium in the energy generator in his chest and hasn't found a way to prevent his own death. He's attacked and nearly killed by mysterious Russian Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), who's proved Stark wrong by building an energy whip harness obviously similar to the Iron Man armor. Weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) also buzzes about Stark like a bothersome gnat and while completely overmatched by Tony, Hammer proves to be the fulcrum upon which Vanko's ultimate vengeance will turn.Stark isn't alone to face these threats. He's joined by his loyal and frequently bemused assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), his faithful bodyguard/chauffeur Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannson), a young woman from Stark Industries legal department who proves to be a whole lot more than meets the eye?which is saying a lot when you look like Scarlett Johannson. Air Force Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) gets a chance to don his own armored battlesuit and the magnetic director of SHIELD Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) turns up to offer Stark his one and only chance to save his life and stop the technological arms race he started from spinning out of control.There is one legitimate criticism you can make of Iron Man 2. While it's more action-packed and a bit funnier than it's predecessor, it lacks the same dramatic depth. At the heart of the first film was a well developed story of an immature and self-centered man learning to grow up and accept his responsibility to the rest of the world. Iron Man 2 doesn't really have that sort of simple humanity at its core, though it does dabble a bit in Tony Stark's complicated relationship with his father. This movie is more bloodless, focusing on standard blockbuster plot mechanics and witty banter.While not as narratively vital, Iron Man 2 is still an excellent film. Downey Jr. and Paltrow are just as engaging. Rockwell, Rourke and Shandling are perfectly comedic and menacing as the movie requires. Cheadle joins the fray as a man torn between his friend and his country. Johannson doesn't get to do much more than look good and kick ass, but she does each exceptionally well. The special effects are first rate. The script has more laughs than most straight forward comedies. And director Favreau deserves a lot of credit for keeping an awful lot of balls in the air and never letting the movie sputter or sag.Iron Man 2 is exciting, clever and a whole lot of fun. If you liked the first, you should definitely see the second and that's about all you can ask for from a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly better than the first, but still does not cut it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you this: the first Iron Man was ridiculous. Iron Man 2 attempts to be more grown up audience-oriented, but it fails flat on its face at many points. All the characters are pretty much cartoonish. Well, one should not expect much from a comic book-based production. However, the dumbest part (as it is always the case with Hollywood) is their depiction of Russia and the Russian people. First of all, Moscow is not a some kind of a snowed in dumpster. These days it is more impressive than London or NY. It is what it is and if you are not sure about that, then buy yourself a plane ticket to Moscow and see for yourself. Secondly, why the heck those Hollywood producers and directors cannot afford to get even one actor who speaks realistic-sounding Russian language? They make stuff up in the dumbest way when it comes to things foreign! And it looks stupid and cheap. What is the story with their idea of the Russian names, too? All those "Ivan Vanko" names sound idiotically made-up. Also, how come that practically each and every actor who plays a Russian character does not even remotely resemble a Russian-type person? I mean, the good old Mickey Rourke is so overloaded with Botox that he does not even look like himself anymore! And who told those Hollywood people that a great inventor and a scientist would look and act like an ape and a very common thug of a completely indiscernible national origin? Do they meet a lot of ingenious and highly educated thug apes there in Hollywood? In short, the director of this movie did not bother one bit to make his production appear even reasonably realistic where it could use some realism. The whole flick just screams "we know that whoever will watch our movie is a dull, uneducated garbage-food eater and whatever we make up is going to be good enough for our 'IQ in the negative range' viewer!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge misstep by Marvel, pales in comparison to part 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was a great superhero movie. Iron Man 2 is a bad one.The level of maturity took a serious hit here, as if Marvel intended to address the 2nd instalment to a younger audience who would not care about the absurdity of the scenario. The final battle is notoriously epic in its failure to generate any climax whatsoever, and the villain dies in the most disappointing way, reminiscent of Darth Maul in Phantom Menace.Worst yet, Don Cheadle is a disaster as a replacement to Terrence Howard as James Rhodes. One of the worst acting performances I have ever endured.The introduction of black widow was poorly executed as well, and I could hardly get through the endless party scene where everybody has fun with the iron man suit, which scene could have been more relevant in an American Pie movie.I could go on and on but it would not help this sorry movie. Bottom line, horrible scenario, some bad acting performances, intended for kid audience.</fullReview>

The story was lame with so many flaws in them that inside the movie itself, the characters are pointing them to you as part of the movie, ironic isn't it? It seems that the female actresses were just there to be pretty, which I have nothing against, but I was not entertained at all. The Iron Man overall special effects were kind of repetitive since the story was not there. Tons of heavy metals and pieces of 4" thick glasses flying all over the place and nobody gets hurt in the crowd. In summary, it was a waste of my time ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best way to sum this movie up is that it's like rain, one droplet isn't a huge problem but add enough and you have a flood. So it was with this movie slowly chipping away at the Iron Man mythos from the first film and creating problems. Almost everything that the first movie laid out was systematically destroyed in this one.--- Spoiler --- In the first movie we're shown that it was this nearly superhuman feat of genius that Tony built the Arc Reactor in a cave, then went on to build the suit with the best of the best of current technology. In the second movie we learn that his father built something better...in the 1970s, when the Apple IIE, Atari and VW Golf were top of the line technology.In the first movie Tony is a savvy businessman. In the second he lets his company crumble away without care, finally ousting the ruins onto Pepper to run.In the first movie he uses the Iron Man suit to stop various conflicts and destroy illegal weapons caches. In the second movie he uses the suit to pee in, dance around drunk at his birthday party and explode watermelons over a bunch of scantily-clad young women. We're told early on that he's the cause of world peace but we don't see any of that. It's one line fairly early on and then forgotten about.There are far too many filler callouts to the upcoming Avengers movie and solo movies. Captain America's shield, Thor's hammer, Nick Fury, etc, making the movie feel like a rushed out, desperate filler to attract attention to those movies instead of making a good Iron Man movie. "Hey if Tony Stark has a Cap shield then it must be cool! Lets go see it when it comes out!" Sure there's a lot of slow-motion action sequences and explosions and a few laugh out loud moments but for those who care about Iron Man and aren't in it just to see 'an action film' it's a pretty sad to see a great super hero stumbling around drunk, making bathroom jokes, peeing in his suit and making a fool of himself for 98% of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is mildly entertaining, but the problems are glaring. First, the "hero" of the story is actually quite obnoxious - what he learned from Iron Man 1 didn't seem to transfer over. Second, too much talk, talk, talk without any content. The dialog didn't really move the story along. It was mostly made up of Tony Stark arguing back and forth with every character in the story. Third - the under use of a really good bad guy. Mickey Rorke makes a great bad guy, but they didn't use him near enough. Fourth - The over use of the obnoxious bad guy - Hammer just got on your nerves. Fifth - the under use of a great actor like Samuel L. Jackson - who was he suppose to be in the movie and why was he even there??? All in all it was a bit of a mess - it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRON MAN II. May he rest in peace. As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1. But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film. Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read. Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot. Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity. Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch. It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide. What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept. Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible sequel, don't waste your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having absolutely loved the first Iron Man film (gave it an 8/10) I went into this with relatively high expectations. Unfortunately, it was a mess. There is no story here, just a heap of awkward scenes, characters that just seem to be kind of ''there'', and lots of boring angst-filled conversations. Why does Tony Stark still insist talking at the same time as the people he has a conversation with? Who the hell is the villain here, the crazy-annoying Hammer guy or the bird-obsessed Russian? These are not compelling or scary villains, they are just smug, annoying failed comedy elements.By the way, let's make something clear: I don't give a goddamn about Captain America, SHIELD, or all that other fake comic book garbage. It's nice that they found another franchise to milk, but I don't want them do devote any time to hype up ANOTHER MOVIE while I'm in the process of watching THIS movie. I get the bad feeling this whole movie is like a giant advertisement for the upcoming Avenger movie, and that's just sad.But the absolute low point for me, in this movie, was Scarlett Suckhanson's character. The minute I saw her face, I wanted to have her die screaming. I still can't put my finger on what annoyed me so much about her, but it probably has something to do with her gobbling up more time that could be spent on some worthwhile plot thread. She also has an air of smugness that most characters are already overloading the movie with, so that doesn't help. She's just in the movie as eyecandy, nothing more.Anyway, this is turning into a rant, and I've spent way too much time thinking about this already. So, to summarize: poor sequel, poor plot, smug characters, they blew their money on CGI and big-name actors, and the result is a terrible mess. Good afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i really don't understand how this movie is receiving good reviews. in a nutshell i would say that this movies is incoherent at best, looks like it was made in bits and pieces and just mashed together. what Mr Jon favreau should realize is that in follow up sequel of a huge hit audiences just expect the same movie with few upgrades. the upgrades are here, new suits, new characters but no link to each other. take mickey Rourke's character, poorly developed making him look like a prop, even though his character is dark and really powerful. Samuel Jackson keeps popping up.. not clear what he wants to say or do, even though most fans already know. virtually no chemistry between stark and Potts, they move a notch backwards from the first movie. and the worst character is that of Scarlet's, she has absolutely no idea what she is doing there, what to do with herself. and why did rhodey steal the suit and do nothing when he was directed to allow hammer make those modifications. the best character would be of Jon favreau, as happy, at least he moved up a notch. the movies special effects are the highlights, good production value, thats it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Iron Man 2 earlier today and I found it quite boring and annoying. I am not a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. but I liked the original Iron Man. Personally I found this film boring because of the lack of action and the amount of talking. Also another mistake of the movie was letting Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard. Cheadle and Downey Jr. did not have the same great chemistry like Howard and Downey Jr. And Iron Man's character is very weird in this. For example their a scene where's he's at a party in his suit. That was very awkward to watch.The story is also very predictable and well not that great. While watching I was also very confused throughout the movie. I liked the villain he was cool enough but other characters were annoying like Scarlett Johanson and that other girl. Iron Man (2008) was great because they didn't overreact with the story, I just didn't really like this movie. Granted it had some good moments but not enough for me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not a comic fan, I pride myself in being intellectual in my choice of movies. I thought that the first Iron Man was a fantastic action movie bolstered by the remarkable acting of RDJ. I enjoyed the first movie so much that I was convinced that its sequel would be just as equally, if not more so, entertaining and action packed and complex as the first movie. With all that being said, Iron Man 2 was a tremendous letdown for me. The final action scene was a complete joke. The small details in the plot that were supposed to enhance and enrich the movie and make it more complex failed horribly. The whole ordeal with Samuel L Jackson was a good thought, but it would have served the movie better if it had spent more time with the smaller details of the plot. I found it extremely difficult to take "Hammer" seriously. I understand that he wasn't supposed to be the dark force that RDJ is up against, but he could have still been made to be a believable character. Mickey Rourke did a good job acting, and RDJ was okay at best, and in the end I find that I was severely disappointed with the finished product. The movie came across to me to be just another one of those "America is bad ass and always wins no matter what" movies that have served only to polarize my faith in the American Cinema. It lacks depth, it lacks complexity, and it just seemed second rate to me.</fullReview>

Every dialog scene runs like two 5 year olds squabbling. At times I felt it was difficult to hear where the actual conversation was going. Conversations were usually a string of one liners, and didn't carry the story at all. There is plenty of completely random sub-plots that don't really add anything to the story. I have no idea why Scarlett Johansson was even included in the story. She added nothing to the overall plot, and every scene she was in made absolutely no sense. I came in with the impression it would be an action movie, but we spent an hour and a half waiting for any action at all. And when it comes right at the end, it is over before you know it. I will say, some of the effects are extremely well done. And that is the only saving grace for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a private point of view, this is our first "family" trip since "Iron Man 1" and if the first had been a honeymoon, this second is rather an Odysseus. What will happen with the third movie? From a comic fan, I have been hugely disappointed by this sequel.When they cast Rourke as villain, my expectations were low and the actual watching even in Imax didn't get them up. He may be OK for "Sin City" but not the marvel way. In addition, the choice for his character Whiplash is dumb because it's like directing a Robocop movie delivering tickets! When you want an amazing movie, you find an amazing bad guy: remember Dark Vador, Terminator or Green Goblin! Then I discovered the second villain: Hammer. Well, it's a crooked businessman so this isn't a choice for action. In addition, his cast is terrible because Sam Rockwell hasn't got any charisma and is always weening.Scarlett Johansson is a fine Black Widow but her involvement is mishandled.Sure, Robert Downey is still the perfect Tony Stark and there are some good moments (the movie with his father, the new armors) but I didn't find the fun I had two years ago! I think Mr. Theroux is a better actor than writer and that he should have stayed on Mulholland drive.In conclusion, it's Iron Man washed and void that you see and it will be the result as long as you give the screenplay to people who are not reading comics as hobbies. Adaptation = No filter!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of the first movie and was really looking forward to this film.There is no reason one should know anything about the source material for a film to understand what is going on, which means the script was poorly written. I knew nothing about Ironman and enjoyed and completely understood the first film.There are characters introduced that do not further the storyline at all. Also, the villains in the movie do not have clear motivations. It was all just surface violence for CGI techs could show off.By biggest disappointment was that much of the science in this science fiction movie did not make enough sense for me to believe it. Example... the whips sliced cars in pieces, but did very little damage to Ironman's suit, that was already riddled with bullet holes. Coupled with the poorly written screenplay made for a disappointing night at the movies for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this, don't get me wrong. It's a brilliant summer blockbuster, but there's just something off with it, and can't put my finger on what it is. Everything is there, a good balance of action, drama and humour. I'm racking my brains as to why I didn't enjoy it as much as Iron Man. I've came to the conclusion that's it just isn't memorable enough. It's as if they just made it for the sake of having a sequel. There's nothing that memorable about it at all. The pacing I feel is really uneven, there's only 2 main action scenes, and as good as they are, I just felt that they were just showing off the special effects. It just didn't have any substance. Robert Downey Jr is a brilliant actor, and I have to admit, there were scenes in Iron Man 2 where he really did make me laugh. The comedy was spot on, and it contained quite a lot of 'laugh out loud' moments. Anyway, the problem I have with Stark is that he doesn't feel like the same man from Iron Man. He comes across as arrogant, where as in the the first movie he was really smart. I wasn't too keen on the introduction of the Black Widow either, as much as I enjoyed watching Scarlett Johansson on a 60ft IMAX Screen. I left the cinema feeling flat, and disappointed. I'll wait for the DVD release and watch it again. But I wasn't that impressed today, sadly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a sequel to Iron Man 2, it has what Iron Man shone in, amazing effects, creative ideas, and action-packed fight sequences. I love the interesting character designs, special effects and action, which are found throughout the whole movie. If you are watching it for the action, you are sure to love this movie.However I stepped out of the cinema in a certain sense of disappointment, amidst all the action, there didn't seem to be much plot build up. In my opinion, the actors played their parts spectacularly. Mickey Rourke was bad-ass, Robert Downey was as joker as ever. The jokes were funny. But if you're looking for substantial storyline that would make you leave the theater satisfied, look somewhere else. While the storyline was not exactly predictable, I feel that it could have been better brought up to a higher climax, and that gives it a 5/10.</fullReview>

Everything about the film was top notch, the acting the special effects, the set pieces etc. However it just goes to show that unless you have a good story &amp; a good script, there is something missing. You never get invested in the story even for a second. That was what made the first film what it was, a really fun &amp; engaging storyline. This had absolutely none of that whatsoever. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't good. The word of mouth on this will spread (badly) &amp; I would be shocked if this makes as much as the first film which relied on the excellent word of mouth to make it such a successful &amp; very well reviewed film. It seemed like they really should have made the script the most important part of the film. Mickey Rourke did the best he was given, but he just wasn't an interesting/scary bad guy at all. Especially comparing to Jeff Bridges of the first film. I wish people would stop comparing this so much to the first film &amp; stop rating it so high based on that film. If you hadn't seen the first, it doesn't hold up well as a standalone film. In fact if this was the first "Iron Man" It would be doubtful we would have seen a second film. On a good note Robert Downey Jr. is good to an extent, but they should have let his own personality shine through even more as he is the reason people love the character. Unless you're a die hard "Iron Man" fan you will find little to want to watch this more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie you just watch eating your popcorn as it is over the top action.What I did not like about this movie,1)It lacked comradeship between tony stark and colonel(played by don)Terrence Howard was the better choice as seen in the first part. 2)pepper and tony stark have differences but is not shown clearly about it. 3)tony stark in iron man suit dancing for the ladies on his b'day(it insults the iron man suit) 4)Character of mike dies easily(is whiplash supposed to be weaker than the one in the 1st movie?) in the end. 5)Why the hell would tony stark enter a f1 car? 6)over the top action...a true example of how Hollywood producers cash in on an action movie with a lame script. 7)The supposed funny scenes were not funny for the most part. 8)scarlett's character black widow can access files easily built by a genius named tony stark.the good notes on this movie, 1)Scarlett johanson looks sexy with her red hair and her action moves look nice better than megan fox in transformers. 2)I love paltrow's pepper character(which guy would not want a loyal,pretty assistant like that?)and she handles all his work as the CEO of stark industries 3)Tony has a way with the ladies.He gets any girl he wants to. 4)Tony realises that his father actually loved him after what he left for him. 6)This movie makes way for the avengers movie......(samuel jackson,black widow,don are there for a reason in this movie)See it if no better movies are there. It does disappoint with its lame plot but we need to remember that it is a superhero movie and decent plots should not be much expected. So far dark knight is the best superhero movie and hopefully it always will be. Don't expect spidey to be there for the Avengers movie. Chris Evans better bulk up his muscles if he wants to play Captain America in the Avengers movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't listen to what anyone else says yes there's problems its not perfect but every movie cant be the dark knight. Robert Downey Jr does a great job reprising his role as Tony Stark, Don Cheadle is way better than Terrance Howard as James Rhodes, Mickey Rourke is one of the best bad guys I have seen in a while ( though his character lacks depth), Scarlett Johansson is smoking hot as Black Widow or Natasha Romanov, Sam Rockwell does a great job as Tony Stark rival and antagonist Justin Hammer and kind of steels the movie in a funny way. Unfortunately Gwyneth Paltrow just complains and yells the whole movie ( just like in sky captain...) If you don't mind some talking( and Gwyneth Paltrow) there's a lot to enjoy here even more so if your a fan of the comics. P.S. stay after the credits</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was what i expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching the first Iron Man, I was a little disappointed. The movie was entertaining to watch, but it did not have enough action, or Iron Man in it. It seemed like a ton of story telling, and not enough of what the genre it is under: action. So, with this in mind, it took my friends a lot of persuading to get me to go see the next Iron Man in theaters, but they did so, and boy do I regret it.First off, don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was OK and watchable, but I was not happy spending so much money on it when I could've just borrowed it from my brother when he bought it on DVD. Usually when I go to the movie theater, I want to watch a movie that would keep me entertained throughout the entire movie, and making me want to see it again. Iron Man had neither of these.When the theater employee up front was done talking about how people should turn their cell phones off and all that good stuff, people started cheering for the movie to start. I just sat there and waited patiently. As i was watching the movie, I was waiting for some sort of action to occur. When I finally got it, it was at a slower pace than I would've hoped, and it ended very quickly. I started realizing that this was happening the entire movie. It takes a long time for action to occur, and when it does, its length is low. Now, the movie has a lot of story telling as i was saying before. Importantly, there were way too many scenes and characters in the movie that you would not understand if you know nothing of Iron Man outside the movies. In other words, if you haven't read the comics, you would not know the names of some of the characters, or even how they were introduced. Thats right, they don't introduce some characters. For example Samuel L. Jackson's character. It just seemed he came into the film randomly.There is still some great parts to this movie. The dialog at times could be funny and entertaining, and just the overall special effects that Tony Stark has in his work area is a treat to the eye. The last action scene had a lot more length than the others, and definitely a nice little relief from the entire movie.Overall, this movie is a nice little film to watch if you don't care about the action scenes. If you're a big Iron Man fan, and read all the comics and such, then you would love this movie. If you are like me, the casual movie goer who is looking for a film that will be action packed and full of explosive fun, spend your money elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and saw Ironman 2 on May 8. I felt like it was a waste of my money. I have not seen the first Ironman so that may have influenced my opinion but the whole time I was bored by all of the conversation and no action. The only fight scene at the end lasted not very long at all. I would not recommend this movie to my friends. There are a few times in the movie where things go unexplained like where he goes into a race car for no apparent reason. I didn't even think the characters were very developed either. The bad guy does not explain why he wants his original bird back from Russia and it's just not a good movie overall. I also was drifting off into sleep-that's how boring the movie was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Naturally, after having seen Iron Man 1 and the fabulous Robert Downey Jr, seeing nr. 2 at the cinema was a nobrainer. But, while Spiderman and Batman produced the same cinematic level, Iron Man 2 does not. The cast is brilliant, the action scenes and gadgets are wonderful, but the plot fails completely. There is too little character development, too few surprises and, frankly, not enough big laughs either. The story could have done with more drama, like the first did, more ups and definitely more downs. RDJ's acting is over-the-top. Fun at times, but tiring at others. There are too many unfinished story lines, which suggests faulty cutting. Ms. Palthrow has had better appearances. Her character also could have done with more development. RDJ deserves better. And so do we! I'll keep my fingers crossed for nr. 3, but get some real writers in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but Worthy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark and alter ego (sort of) Iron Man in the highly anticipated sequel to the 2008 hit, Iron Man. In Iron Man 2, billionaire Tony Stark must contend with fatal issues involving the government, his own friends, competition, and new enemies due to his superhero alter ego Iron Man. Iron Man starts with our main villain, Ivan (a very vengeful Mickey Rourke), preparing to get his revenge on the whole Stark family for allegedly ripping off his dead father's ideas of post-modern technology and the Iron Man concept. Meanwhile, Tony Stark reveals he is Iron Man, and that his technology is so advanced that it will take years for other countries to harness the power and technology to match Iron Man. Of course, he is wrong. Iron Man 2 really soars when Robert Downey Jr. is on screen. He really makes Tony Stark his own, because Downey Jr. is a lot like Tony Stark: funny, charming, and totally narcissistic. This isn't a jab at Robert Downey Jr. I have been a big fan of his for a long time, way before Iron Man was around. Gwyneth Paltrow is in her usual top form, as she plays Tony's on- again, off-again love interest. As far as the villains go, Mickey Rourke is good enough. He is tattooed and ripped to the tee, and is memorable. He is very hard to understand though, and the Russian accent is forced. It's really not a huge problem though, because his character doesn't do a lot of talking. That leads me to villain number 2, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), who talks too much. Justin Hammer, who is sick of having a second-rate company compared to Stark Inc, teams up with Ivan to take Stark down. Sam Rockwell's performance was a lot like Downey's, but comes off as annoying, rather than funny. He ends up being a second-rate villain, a lot like Topher Grace was in Spiderman 3. The main problem with Iron Man 2, is that it seems like it is just a whole bunch of parts of a movie, but doesn't come together as one. It isn't nearly as refreshing as Iron Man was, nor is it really anything new. Iron Man 2 is gold when Robert Downey Jr. is working his magic, and when he suits up for the visually amazing action scenes. And yet, Stark doesn't suit up as much as we'd like, and that birthday party scene shouldn't even count. That scene was neither funny nor necessary, and should have been cut out. Another problem is the Avengers sub-plot. Yes we get it, there will be an Avengers movie, but you don't have to have Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson hogging screen time, when Tony Stark has other things he should be doing. Overall, Iron Man 2 is an okay sequel. It is not as good as Iron Man but if you were a fan of the first one, I can't see you hating this one at all. The inevitable Iron Man 3 really needs to have a better script and fall back onto its strengths though. Those strengths being Robert Downey Jr. and the originality that this genre desperately needs.Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 Much, Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I enjoyed the two action sequences in the two plus hours of Iron Man 2.That's an exaggeration, but not by much. It wouldn't be so bad if the plot could sustain the rest and for the most part, it didn't.And that was the biggest problem with Iron Man 2. Along with the poor editing and the excessive character additions, like the original Batman series, the rushed and over bloated storyline really weighed down the movie. Sure, Downey Jr. did his best, and was a real saving grace, but even he had to realize this movie was not up to par.(Spoiler Alert, but needs to be told as it's the majority of the film) Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is dying due to his heart device, acquired in the first Iron Man, that's poisoning his blood. Oh, sorry. That's plot A. Plot B is about the Government wanting the "Ironman" weapon. C involves a secret spy and her not-a-secret boss from another comic book. As for D and E: two revenge-seeking/Stark hating males for alternate reasons. And F is for the conflicted (and replaced actor) friend of Stark. Did I leave any out? Oh, G is for a Walt Disney-like Daddy along with the normal Daddy-Issues. And H is for Giveaways, Charity, Crossovers and a suicidal daredevil.On a personal note, and I'm generally criticized for this ? who cares, it's an opinion, I cannot stand Sam Rockwell. Sure Moon was a somewhat good movie, but it wasn't Rockwell that drove that feature. Here, again, he looked out of place and was just plain boring. Like Downey, Jr., he did try, but had an enormously unsuccessful presence. Despite my personal feelings, still, I got what character he was trying to portray, but we've all seen these evil, revenge-minded and jealous corporate guys at least a dozen times before, but with a tremendous amount of believability, pizazz and villainy that Rockwell didn't come close to possessing. Heck, even the unoriginal and obvious villainous character, Obadiah Stane (played by Bridges from the original Iron Man) had the right qualities Rockwell lacked.Though I have a neutral opinion on Rourke, I sincerely felt him miscast in this role and like Rockwell, overshot his "bad guy role." It is written that he spent time (visiting, I suppose) a Russian prison and even more time attempting to learn his Russian lines. He even went as far as wanting to do the whole movie in Russian! (Director Favreau thankfully disagreed ? he was hard enough to understand when he did speak English.) In probably the worst scene in the movie was their attempt to recreate the Batman/Joker interrogation scene from The Dark Knight. It didn't work as a rip off, nor as a scene on its own. I forgot to mention the not-at-all-funny bird fetish Rourke's character had was his idea. Perhaps he should come back down to earth after his one-time-only great performance in The Wrestler.The rest of the cast was so-so to great. Favreau was funny but his one-man fight seemed so Lethal Weapon 3'ish while Rushman (Johansson) fought off half a dozen or more men. Speaking of Johansson, or her character Rushman, she was great when she kicked butt. Unfortunately those scenes were even fewer than the overall action of the film. Paltrow was so-so and mirrored Vicky Vale (Basinger from Batman) with the number of screams and over-acting/reacting. As previously mentioned Downey Jr. was excellent and kept his scenes going. In fact, for die-hard Downey Jr. fans, this would be a definite recommendation.Overall, the movie felt rushed (and was,) but thankfully due to the always great Downey Jr., the always impressive technology (loved the suitcase,) crossovers (think shield in addition to S.H.I.E.L.D.) and the (good) few and far between action scenes, the movie's worth a viewing. Not on IMAX as I did ? I wouldn't go that far. It's more expensive, it's not in 3-D and you get a letterboxed version of it. In fact, it would not be the end of the world to wait for this enormously inferior sequel to his DVD/Bluray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Iron Man, probably one of the worst superhero movies in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no expectations going into Iron Man 2....I enjoyed and loved the first Iron Man movie and liked the story, characters, flow, and feel of the movie. I liked how it took a character like Tony Stark and put him in post-Cold War America and yet stayed true to the comics. At the same time, it deviated from the comics and had its own stamp that was fresh.Yet with this movie, it's like none of what made the first one great even carried over. All that seemed to carry over was that Tony Stark is a millionaire -- putting millionaire douche-bag Larry Ellison in a cameo cemented that. Stark's a combination of Steve Jobs meets Batman, complete with his own Mac Fest.But that wasn't fully realized at all in this movie. It became an excuse to show explosions, have cool scenes, and show Iron Man suits. The story -- which is what made the first one great -- was largely absent. Ivan Vanko's character was the only one that was fully fleshed out, partially due to Mickey Rourke's great performance. You liked Justin Hammer and could actually sympathize with him even though he is a smarmy jackass. The other new character Natasha/Natalie/Black Widow really was a non-issue in the movie and seemed to be a void in this to make an impression.Yet Tony Stark was totally unlikable in this. The 'underdog' character from the first film wasn't there -- sure, what's on his chest is killing him. Alcohol is killing him (yes, they vaguely referenced the "Demon in a Bottle" storyline from the comics but that was it). But there is nothing to Stark this time that makes you root for him like there was in the first movie. Really, you hope he gets what all millionaires like him get and that is to lose everything. His character never really comes to that realization (the party scene doesn't count). The only character that seemed to have changed at all in this movie is Pepper Potts.This movie lacked the sophistication and overall story of the first movie. Even though Terrence Howard wasn't that great as James Rhodes in the first movie, he actually made a smart choice in avoiding this movie. Don Cheadle did very well with the material (or lack thereof) he had to work with. The movie doesn't even explain how he's able to just jump into an Iron Man suit and use it. I was hoping that part of the movie would be about explaining that or even growth for James Rhodes as well. Instead, Rhodes inexplicably being able to use the suit and deliver it to the U.S. military sends the movie to the climax.I would say see it if you're a fan of comic book movies, but don't expect it to be like Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight or even Superman Returns. It's not. It's almost like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen bad. So go in, turn your mind off, and don't worry about the plot, characters, or anything else that make movies enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vince McMahon Promoting Our Defense Industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 brings Robert Downey, Jr. back as Tony Stark, billionaire playboy by day and Iron Man superhero by night. The film does something unusual for a superhero movie, the mask is stripped away and Iron Man's identity is confessed to and revealed. Now everybody wants a piece of Tony Stark.Starting with the Senate Armed Services Committee headed by Garry Shandling has him subpoenaed and ordered to turn over the technology that created Iron Man. As survival was the first goal of the creation that seems like not a good solution to Downey. Rival defense conglomerate head Sam Rockwell also wants in on the technology.In a plot that was lifted from the cult Fifties science fiction classic Red Planet Mars, Rockwell makes a deal with Russian Mickey Rourke to get the technology. Rourke's father apparently was working along the same lines as Downey's father and he feels the Iron Man concept was stolen by him. He and Rockwell make a Faustian bargain.In the meantime Downey just wants to get away from it all and even turns his company over to best girl pal Gwyneth Paltrow. Gwyneth who seems to be all legs in this film is really up in it trying to deal with business and Downey at the same time. Another woman who has some mean limbs herself is security expert Scarlett Johanssen who leaves a trail of broken males strewn in her path when she's on a mission.Of course the special effects are what the movie-going public is paying to see and I note that there is an IMAX version of Iron Man 2 out there which only seems right. If I can I should try to see it in that media.If I had a favorite in the cast I would say it was Rockwell. His rivalry with Downey is something to behold. I do love the way these two market their defense wares for the government. It was like they left the promotion to Vince McMahon. Is this the way of the future?Folks who love the superhero genre will love Iron Man 2. The rest of us are somewhat amused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't exactly live up to expectations...but Great nonetheless!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Iron Man released in 2008 it was pretty much the Dark Horse of superhero films. No one really expected a film based on a character the general public knew next to nothing about to do really well, especially not in the same year as a certain film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring the late Heath Ledger was also due to be released. And yet the film was highly successful, critically and commercially, propelled Robert Downey Jr. to new heights of stardom and pretty much began the renaissance where Marvel superhero films were concerned. But perhaps one of the best things about the first film (apart from the well-structured plot, the excellent dialogue, the brilliant acting etc.) was the cliffhanger ending of Tony Stark revealing his identity as Iron Man to the world! RDJ's line 'I am Iron Man' plainly spoken in a matter-of-fact tone itself, perhaps more than anything else, set the momentum for the high expectations everyone had of the sequel. And the trailers, when they came, set expectations even higher...and then when the film came out...it didn't live up to a lot of those expectations. It certainly didn't live up to mine...But it was fun nonetheless!The film gives us everything we wanted and more. The dialogue is great (though not as good as the first), the action scenes and visual effects are truly awe-inspiring and even the themes and overall plot is pretty gripping! The theme of the movie is clearly legacy which refers not only to Howard Stark's legacy to Tony but also Tony's legacy of Iron Man to the world (and on a much narrower scale, to his friends Pepper Potts and Jim Rhodes). Many of the plot points, such as the US Government wanting the Iron Man technology, other villains getting their hands on the technology, Tony's struggles with leading a double life (though he doesn't really have a secret identity per se) etc. seem to be natural progressions from the first film. Some others like the Ivan Vanko revenge plot and the backstory involving Howard Stark and Anton Vanko do add greater depth to the film version of the Iron Man mythos (and the whole Legacy theme). Jim Rhodes becoming War Machine and using the Mark 2 armour as well is clearly the culmination of the foreshadowing from the scene in the first film ('next time baby') and the Natasha Romanov subplot was pretty interesting as well (not to mention the fight scenes).So what WAS this film missing then? Well for starters the plot just didn't flow as organically as it did with Iron Man 1. Of course its not as though this ruins the movie...its only a very subtle difference but it can be felt nonetheless. Case in point, Tony just has a drunken armour battle with Rhodes during his birthday party, blows up about half his house in the process and then...is sitting on a rooftop having donuts waiting for Nick Fury to show up! And Fury's involvement seemed kinda like a deux ex machina to cure Tony's condition and get him off the erratic behavior thats been plaguing him for most of the film and back into action for the final battle. Which brings us to the tone of the film. Iron Man 1, while it did have a fair share of humour, was largely pretty serious in its tone, even dark in some parts. Iron Man 2 was expected to be dark (most superhero sequels are) and one would expect that a film in which a major plot point is the protagonist slowly dying of blood poisoning would be exceedingly dark in its tone, but instead Iron Man 2 has MORE than its fair share of humour (so much so that the last scene itself was more of a joke than anything else). Even Pepper and Tony arguing over his not telling her about his condition was made humorous, whereas it should have been a touching emotional moment. Nonetheless, these issues thankfully do not detract THAT much from an otherwise excellent film though Iron Man 2 could have easily surpassed the original had the afforementioned shortcomings not been present.That said, I must comment on the whole 'Avengers Initiative' subplot that has slowly been building up over the course of multiple Marvel Studios films that is clearly leading up to the much awaited Avengers film. With this film, I get the feeling that things are clearly escalating on that front as compared to Iron Man 1 and The Incredible Hulk with characteristics of the 'shared universe' becoming glaringly apparent and not so subtle anymore. Nick Fury and SHIELD playing a significant role in the film, Captain America's shield making a clear appearance, the scene with Thor's hammer after the credits, the Avengers Initiative folder etc. seems to be making the notion that Iron Man isn't the only superhero in the world a bit too obvious. It seems now that Marvel is committed to this whole 'Avengers' film project so hopefully they'll see it through without any major hiccups.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel worth watching, but lacks the fun of the first film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man returns, and after the success of the much-loved first film,he meets old friends and new friends (too many).Here are some pros and cons you should consider before watching the film.PROS: The acting is great. Not only a superb performance by Robert Downey Jr., but Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson steal the show. Don Cheadle is much better then Terrence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives a much improved outing then her weak performance in the first film.There are some funny moments. Comedy is a strong point in the film, and the screenwriters did very well with it.The CGI and other visual effects are even better then the first. Epic sequences such as the race track battle and the final battle are amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat.Impressive direction, cinematography, and music are some key elements in this film. Besides, I love Stan Lee's cameo!!! CONS: The entire middle of the film is extremely dull. Barely anything happens, and not even a surprise appearance by Samuel L. Jackson could boost it up. Some of this is redeemed by the action-packed climax, but it's probably the film's weakest point.Way too many characters! I could do without certain characters, which would make the film a little less confusing.Black Widow is so underplayed in the film. She is very useless, and could have done a lot more with a lot more screen-time.The script could have been better. Some unnecessary dialog make it uneven.Overall, if you're a comic-book fan and have seen the first one, see it. If you're not, rent it. But remember, it doesn't come close to the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spider-Man 3 Syndrome: Exhibit: C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Iron Man was different from your average comic book movie because it lacked the unnecessary drama, instead replacing it with many more laughs, a much more likable main character, and plenty of comic book flair usually missing from the other comic movies. With the success of Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to go forth with their long-waited and epic idea to bring a few of their best heroes together into one massive flick that will make anybody that is a fan of comic books squeal with glee and delight. The Avengers is sure to become the biggest addition of comic book film-making since the original Spider-Man broke barriers and records many years ago. The Avengers will be incredible.Which leads to the biggest issue of Iron Man 2: the film is just a tad notch above set-up flick. Just like what Dead Man's Chest in the Pirates franchise did, Iron Man 2 became a 2-hour movie with a slew of conflicts in which were not all resolved because there is another installment coming. Suffering from the Spider-Man 3 effect, Iron Man 2 is chock full of story lines interweaving together, and not all of them are interesting, and not all of them even reach a resolution. We see more Tony Stark than Iron Man. The cameos steal the spotlight. Some of the villains were whether annoying or as much of a threat as a newborn puppy. Many pieces were built around the set, but not all of them fit.Tony Stark 2?er, I mean, Iron Man 2 is about our hero (Robert Downey Jr.) taking on the government, rivals, and even his own health?which is depleting rapidly because of hit artificial "heart." With his health slowly dying away, he starts drinking, acting even more eccentric, and even stepped down from his CEO duties. In the meantime, the Iron Man technology is being imitated around the world, with an intelligent Russian (Mickey Rourke) trying to kill Stark with his own version of a powersuit. Justin Theroux provides the screenplay, and stuffs it up with cameos, references to the future, problems, villains, and a few plot lines from old-school Iron Man comic book issues. A lot goes on.Let's at least marvel at the powerhouse cast. Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job as Tony Stark/Iron Man yet again, providing a great blend of narcissism with subtle fear of death. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't get much screen time yet again but does a great job with the material she has. Other performances throughout the movie were very good, including Garry Shandling, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Sam Rockwell, Don Cheadle, and to an extent Scarlett Johansson (whose fighting skills nearly stole the entire show). Great performances, but nearly all the supporting actors I mentioned didn't have much time to truly craft a whimsical, memorable performance to the likes of Heath Ledger as the Joker, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, or William Dafoe as Green Goblin.The acting isn't the only thing chock full of small samples and no main course; there was little action, little tension, little chemistry between the two leads, and little suspense. What progresses the movie and prevented it from being a total disaster was Robert Downey Jr. entertaining the masses with his portrayal of Stark. Granted this is a movie about Tony Stark, but the film is called Iron Man, and one would hope for more of him in the suit. As a matter of fact, Iron Man engages in action in only three scenes, with one of them being extremely short. Just like in the original, the final epic battle was extremely short, extremely underwhelming, and very anti-climactic. Whiplash could have been an intimidating force to the likes of the Joker (in both versions, shut up), Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, and Syndrome in The Incredibles (not a Marvel villain but a comic book-like villain nonetheless).Like a cruelly beautiful woman, the film is a big tease. There are a lot of characters, but they aren't in the film enough. The special effects were very good, but were not used a lot for the action scenes. Plenty of hints and references towards other Marvel comic books, but none of them lasted more than a minute (even though the last one was indeed------wow). Another problem is that the freshness and originality of Iron Man disappeared, which made this a tougher follow-up than one would assume. Is the film disappointing? Yea, loosely. Is it entertaining? Most definitely, but the potential carried is what makes this a somewhat-frustrating movie. It made most of us beg like an unsatisfied bum for 2011 and 2012 to arrive so we can see more (and longer) comic book crossovers.Bottom Line: Iron Man 2 is most definitely entertaining and loads of fun?sometimes. Other times, we are watching a storyline we don't really care about, watching appearances we know should last longer, or watching potential get ruined because it's being carried over to the next installment of the Marvel movie-making franchise. While this is more script issues than directing issues (Jon Favreau did a decent job, but his character wasn't necessary at all), someone during the production should have stood up and shouted "What's with all the loose Walt Disney references??" Wait, wait, wait, I meant "Isn't this a repeat of what happened to Spider-Man 3??" Iron Man 2 = Spider-Man 3, except more fun, much less embarrassing, and a better-looking future. The film isn't a boring disaster, but you are constantly left with a desire for more--long before the movie is even over. Now why can't this Avengers movie come faster?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RDJ and Favreau keep this busy sequel an excellent and amusing thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superhero movie follow-ups have been a tough business lately. "Iron Man 2" marks Marvel's first sequel since "Spider-Man 3" left millions disappointed in 2007. So to quell any lingering fears, "Iron Man 2" is not a letdown. It's far from it. To think director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey Jr. would lose sight of what they did that turned a lesser Marvel character into a multi-million-dollar franchise would be a gross underestimation.Downey Jr. does not relinquish Iron Man's reputation as the wittiest superhero ever brought to the big screen. "Iron Man 2" provides just as much of a humorous joyride as the 2008 film, backing up all the subtly outrageous dialogue with superb visual effects and action that seizes all attention. It all still works because Favreau has locked down the blend between not taking the story too seriously but still telling it with conviction.But oh yes, "Iron Man 2" complicates things a bit. Self-outted billionaire superhero Tony Stark aka Iron Man has a lot on his plate from government subpoenas asking him to hand his suit over to the people to a private matter: his fake heart -- the arc reactor -- is slowly poisoning him. Feeling like it all might cave in on him, Tony makes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), Stark Industries' new C.E.O. Screenwriter Justin Theroux ("Tropic Thunder") accepts the responsibility of weaving these plot lines in with three new significant characters. Mickey Rourke assumes the villain role: silently vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko, who after a failed attempt at using his own whip-toting arc-reactor suit to kill Tony in the film's first action sequence on a Monaco raceway, finds himself in the employ of Tony's arms-dealing nemesis, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). With Tony going in and out of the public's good graces, Hammer uses Vanko to create droid soldiers for the military, which would effectively make him the real "American hero." Scarlett Johansson goes redhead for a supporting role as one of Tony's new assistants who is more than she appears to be.The busyness continues because of Marvel's commitment to an eventual "Avengers" film in 2012 combining Iron Man and heroes of future Marvel films. Samuel L. Jackson appears as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, looking to recruit Tony for his team and nudging him in the right direction as Tony's deceased father, Howard, holds the answer to his "heart condition."The overcrowding, however, never gets the best of "Iron Man 2." Theroux has designed the story to move along quickly and effectively, letting the action and the humor carry the entertainment factor evenly throughout the film. The unfortunate trade-off is that very little resonates about "Iron Man 2." Tony's attempt to find a new core element for his arc reactor is the one true through-line. Everything else from Tony's feuding with Pepper and his buddy Jim Rhodes (Cheadle) to Hammer's frustrations with Vanko's progress to Nick Fury all act in service of the plot. The element of Tony's irresponsibility and alcoholism, perhaps the greatest potential of the film to make any kind of statement, appears in only a couple brief scenes. Downey Jr. and Favreau give us many great Tony Stark moments, but he doesn't have a chance to grow -- just make us laugh and remember how great a character he is.And honestly, how great a character he is. Downey Jr.'s shtick hasn't gotten old in the least despite his increased exposure the last two years and the writing caters to him even more this time around. Maybe a lesser actor playing a lesser character wouldn't be able to lift up a busy superhero story with this many subplots, but RDJ has that ability. With an imaginative visual effects crew at his back and a director who knows how to condense action and make it count, he'll likely continue providing easy-to-love action entertainment as Iron Man no matter how many different chinks these films develop in their armor.-Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it just me or nobody noticed Tony Starks struggle with death? In my opinion that was one of the key elements in this film and what made it interesting, the fact that the all powerful Tony Stark found himself not being able to find a solution to this problem despite all of the money and power he had. He found himself so helpless that he almost killed one of his best friends and lost control over his own life, using in a very irresponsible way his Iron Man suit. To make matters worst, none of his friends knew he needed serious help because of his own pride. This film in my opinion was about a super hero that was brought down to his knees like any other human being when faced with the ultimate enemy - death. For him, compared to this enemy, Whiplash was just a headache to deal with later. About the rest of the film, if you like action, it's a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(from http://cobyscomics.blogspot.com/2014/01/iron-man-2.html)After Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is Iron Man 2. Critics were pretty harsh on this one, and understandably so. It was a pretty obvious set-up for The Avengers movie, but, you know what? I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing.CheadleOne of the biggest controversies of Iron Man 2 was the change in characters for Rhodey. Terrence Howard only recently came out and admitted he didn't do the second movie because Marvel wanted to give 80% of his pay to Robert Downey, Jr, and they felt that the second movie would work with or without Howard. And they were right! I actually prefer Don Cheadle to Terrance Howard. Cheadle comes off as more serious and hardcore (even in that ridiculous Iron Patriot armor), where Howard has that artistic, flamboyant aire to him that's just hard to get past.WhiplashMuch like Iron Man 3, I didn't care about the villain in this one. OK, I guess it was pretty cool how they took the Blacklash concept and remade him into Ivon Vanko, son of Howard Stark's old Russian partner, Anton. This sorta kinda explains how Vanko could've developed the Arc Reactor technology, which was another so-so plot device for them to be able to throw in Tony's face how he wasn't the only one with that technology anymore.How in the world Vanko was able to survive full-on Repulsor Ray blasts to the chest, let alone perfectly time the incoming Grand Prix race cars to be able to whip them to pieces, is anyone's guess. Maybe his exo- skeleton gave him an increased strength and reaction time, Elysium- style? I guess we have to suspend disbelief for a minute here, in order to give Iron Man a credible threatening foe.My main problem with Vanko was, every time he came on screen, I couldn't help but see Mickey Rourke as a more piratey Hyperion from Immortals and Whiplash as Blacklash from that 90's Iron Man cartoon. Apparently, even Rourke was disappointed with the way his character came across (which, ironically, he talked about during the publicity for Immortals), so at least I'm in good company with my criticism.I gotta tell you though, as far as cool factor goes, when Iron Man and War Machine blasted each other with Whiplash in the middle, this one tops the charts.Natalie RushmanI can't believe I forgot all about Black Widow even being in this movie... I'm so ashamed....Who else was tricked and thought Scarlett Johansson was really gonna be Tony's assistant? As far as hot assistants go, if anyone could put Ollie's Smoak to shame, it would've been "Natalie Rushman".Post-Credits SceneMew-Mew! Remember how stoked everyone was to see Thor's Hammer at the end of Iron Man 2? I remember the theater literally applauding. I honestly didn't think it would ever happen. I thought Marvel was just effing with us, they'd never actually give Thor his own movie. But they did, and it was awesome! And Thor 2 was even better!Stan Lee!as Larry King. You gotta love the old dude's sense of humor: "So I finally, for the first time in my life, felt like I was a celebrity".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the Iron Man comic book series. This movie didn't come close to what Iron Man was about. Rather than have a real plot, with characters that you can care about, this new movie relies on made-up technological displays and lots and lots of explosions. No real substance. As far as having Scarlett Johanson being as an action heroine - not really believable! Still great to look at though - blonde or brunette. What was Gwyneth Paltrow even given credit for being in the movie...I'll bet she was in it for all of twelve minutes. All-in-all, at best this is a rental and not worth the money I paid for admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same in easy going sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We return again to John Favreau's take on comic book hero 'Iron Man'. This time man behind the mask, Tony Stark, is having a hard time of it as "the suit that is keeping him alive is also killing him". As well as that he has a Russian Mickey Rourke on his hand's financed by a very American Sam Rockwell. He should be having a hard time of it but the films chief flaw, surprisingly, is Downey Jr.'s inability to be anything other than charismatic, cool and in-control. Due to this we are never in any doubt that he will overcome these problems and thus suspense and dramatic thrust are almost null. Rourke is also a problem, his performance is fine, but in a film so big and silly introducing him as merely a physicist who has a reason for revenge somewhat belittles the audience's intelligence and his characters motivation. The film builds up ahead of steam and in doing so the inevitable battle at the end is easily one of the biggest anti - climaxes in modern action cinema. That being said, we do have a hell of a time getting there with Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johanson easily stealing the acting acclaim when Rockwell isn't on screen. The three of them together almost make you forget about the meek Don Cheadle and the kind-of-but-not-really pointless Samuel L. Jackson (cameo?). All that being said nobody will feel short-changed or un-entertained when they leave the cinema. Downey Jr. has enough quips and just enough fights to leave you smiling and the adrenaline pumping, and once again Favreau himself, makes the smartest decision of them all by having him out of the suit more times than not. He also deals very well in following up his bold decision to reveal who the man in the mask was in the first film. All in all 'Iron Man 2' lies just ahead of the Fantastic Four but well behind Spiderman and Batman on the league table of post-millennium superheros. A film this clumsy, repetitive, shallow and stupid has no right to be this entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iron Man 2" Lacks the Metal of "Iron Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Iron Man 2" ranks as a CGI-riddled, overblown, second-rate sequel. Director Jon Favreau's original Marvel super hero saga delivered a slam-bang, refreshing blend of superheroism and bad attitude on the part of its egotistical protagonist, and Jeff Bridges proved a worthy rival as his treacherous vice president who copied his high-tech armored suit and challenged to the death. While Favreau's ambitious sequel delivers more than enough exhilarating displays of pyrotechnic prowess, "Iron Man 2" is neither as nimble nor as engrossing as its spectacular predecessor. Indeed, Iron Man faces a new contender. Thuggish Ivan Vanko isn't as memorable as the sinister Obadiah Stane, but he does appropriate high moral ground as part of his crusade to topple our hero. Meantime, Robert Downey, Jr. is every bit as good as he was the first time around, and he tackles bigger problems in his encore in this follow-up adaptation of a popular comic-book series that came out in 1963. Unfortunately, "Tropic Thunder" scenarist Justin Theroux wraps everything up a predictable plot that presents a plethora of complications but few surprises. Some movies suffer from too many characters and too great an agenda. This is what cripples "Iron Man 2." The middle section of this 124-minute marathon buckles under the weight of excessive plotting and extra characters before the film recovers sufficiently for a triumphant ending. The action unfolds in chilly Moscow as destitute Soviet physicist Anton Vanko (Yevgeni Lazarev of "Lord of War") dies with his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"), at his side. While this is happening, the local news contains a broadcast of Tony Stark coming out of his metal closet to admit that he is Iron Man. Before the elder Vanko passes away, he assures his son that Ivan should have been in billionaire industrialist Tony Stark's shoes as Iron Man. As it turns out, Stark's late father Howard (John Slattery of "Traffic") and Anton were partners who collaborated on the invention of the arc reactor. Eventually, Anton was deported to the Soviet Union where he managed to scrape out an miserable livelihood. Ivan finds the blueprints that his father created with Howard Stark. He sets about to construct a primitive version of Iron Man's breastplate and adds two crackling fiber-optic whips that can slice through metal as if it were butter. Look out Tony Stark! If Ivan doesn't represent a minor threat in the overall scheme of things, Tony discovers that the very suit that enables him to carry out his vigilante crime fighting exploits is contaminating his blood and gradually killing him. In other words, our hero has got to find a new energy source that won't kill him. Meantime, a United States Senate Investigation committee, headed up by slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling of "What Planet Are You From?"), insists that Stark hand over the technology of his Iron Man outfit to the government for military application. Naturally, Stark doesn't cooperate. He explains that the suit and he are one and that America need not fear anybody cloning his flying suit of armor.Bored with the routine of running his massive corporation, Tony promotes his right hand woman, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow of "Great Expectations"), as the CEO of Stark Industries. Of course, Pepper is flabbergasted by this extravagant gesture on Tony's part. Our hero flies off to Monaco to race in the Grand Prix and runs into Ivan with his whips. Pepper and Tony's chauffeur Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau of "Couples Retreat") careen onto the race course and give our protagonist his suitcase version of his outfit. In no time at all, Iron Man emerges and defeats Ivan. Not long afterward, Tony's worst enemy--rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell of "Moon") -- breaks Vanko broken out of prison and cuts a bargain with him to clone Tony's Iron Man outfit. Ivan, however, is no flunky and he embarks on an entirely different program. Instead of replicating Iron Man's outfit, he masterminds an army of drones that Hammer wants to sell to the Pentagon. Stark stages the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows, New York, to carry on his father's legacy. Anybody who creates a worthwhile contribution to technology can display their handiwork. Hammer unveils his drones, but learns too late that Ivan's infamous scheme supersedes his own plans. The chief problem with "Iron Man 2" is its lackluster villain. As Ivan Vanko, Rourke appears appropriately nefarious as a walking, talking tattoo with a grudge against our champion, but he poses only a disposable threat. Mind you, he looks menacing enough, but his lack of charisma is only matched by his absence of hygiene. Now, Ivan's outfit looks more interesting, but Iron Man turns it against him in no time as he does the drones. Basically, Ivan combines Iron Man's adversary the Crimson Dynamo and the super villain Whiplash. Sam Rockwell's buffoonish second string villain qualifies as expendable. On the other hand, comedian Garry Shandling virtually steals every scene that he has as a Congressman, particularly the last scene when he decorates Tony Stark for saving the country from Ivan. Sexy actress Scarlett Johansson shows up as Natalie Rushman, a mysterious undercover female commando who can handle herself skillfully in combat with men. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Lieutenant Colonel "Rhodey" Rhodes from Terence Howard. Rhodes takes one of Tony's Iron Man outfits because he doesn't want his friend to have a monopoly on world power. She replaces Pepper since Tony promoted Pepper upstairs. Favreau gives actor Samuel L. Jackson more screen time this time as Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but this character does little more than act as a press agent the eventual "Avengers" team-up movie. Unfortunately, this installment generates neither enough excitement nor irony to overwhelm its own inertia. Anybody who walks out before the long end credits conclude their tedious roll will miss a brief scene where our hero's new antagonist leaves his calling card in a huge pit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty lame compared to part 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first Iron Man for the self-irony of Robert Downey Jr. He portrayed so well this self-absorbed narcissist with a somehow still pure heart, who finally learns to put his charms and material resources to good use. I loved the relationship between Pepper and him. Despite his success and fame, he is essentially alone, his only friend and not-so-secret love being Pepper. And I liked the fact that given the basic assumptions of the plot, most of it actually made sense.The second part fails in most aspects in my opinion. Suddenly Pepper is just another bickering b****, and he treats her just like that. All the sweet relationship and vulnerability that was visible in IM1 is gone. The plot is rather confused and very, very cliché. I couldn't believe they are really going through with the silly "Bad Russian" stereotype in 2010. This came 30-40 years too late. Yeah there are lots of machines flying around doing fancy stuff, so what. Seen that so often, a bit Transformers, a bit Spiderman, a bit Fantastic Fours. But nothing really that holds it all together, the saddest part being the characters turning from charming, funny humans to dumb, predictable Hollywood idiots.Johansson is beautiful, but her role is odd. She pulls off cool fight scenes though. Cheadle or his role, I'm not sure, were boring. Rourke did well except for the stupid role he got. Paltrow the same, could have been good except they gave her no lines but bickering.All in all way below part 1 and still below my humble expectations. 4 points for Johanssons fight scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated Iron Man I. Really, I hated it. I was disappointed with the plot, shallow characterization, wrong translation of Hindi etc. And after last year's piece of crap that was Transformers 2, I didn't expect this sequel to deliver because the trailers, the teasers or the plot didn't convince me. So, I go in the empty theater and seat myself in the second row. In twenty minutes, I've finished my popcorn and the crowd finally shows up. The theater's full. The movie starts rolling and Iron Man enters the scene and warmly greets the audience by a "It's good to be back" remark. The rest of it is pure awesomeness. Well, I'll summarize the whole experience in two sections for ur convenience:The Good : 1. Acting. The cast fits. RDJ is exceptional as Iron Man, Scarlett Johanson is perfect as Black Widow and Mickey Rourke excels as the formidable Ivan Vanko. 2. The story. Good story, very involving. 3. The action, obviously. 4. The special effects were awesome. 5. The humor. The humor was veryveryvery good. My stomach almost burst open during the last scene, which was Hilariously surprising.The bad: 1. Some actors don't fit their characters. I couldn't digest Don Cheadle as Rhodes after Terrence Howard's amazing performance as the same character in part one. Also, Samuel L. Jackson (whose appearance in this movie was a little more than a cameo) sounds more like Jules from Pulp Fiction than Nick Fury. 2. The last fight scene. You'll know why the last fight scene stinks, after you see the movie. 3. Bad character exploration. The appearance of characters like Happy Hogan, Black Widow and Nick Fury feel like a little more than cameos.All in all, a great movie. Best summer move yet and a must watch and must by on Blu Ray or DVD (whichever you prefer). Word to Marvel fans, specifically fans of a certain thunder god (like me), wait for the post credits scene!!!!4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Popcorn with a dash of Pepper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can actually feel summer coming, once the blockbusters start to come into theaters. And, the ultimate popcorn movie is going to start the season, this weekend. (Clash of the Titans does NOT count) It's Iron Man 2!! Key to the sequel, the return of Robert Downey, Junior, as Tony Stark. He is absolutely perfect as the brilliant billionaire man-child. Iron Man 2 picks up right where the first film left off, with Tony Stark taking ownership of Iron Man in a press conference. Of course, everyone wants a piece of him now. Congress wants him to testify about his actions and their global impact. Meantime, he still needs to perfect some of the technology, especially the parts that are keeping him alive. I was concerned (after watching trailers) that there would be too many villains and too much action that would take away from what I really loved in the first movie, which is Tony and his relationship to the important people in his life, Rhode-y and Pepper and others. I feared a Batman and Robin scenario. But no, Jon Favreau is back in the director's chair (and the driver's seat), and he remains true to the heart of what worked in Iron Man. In fact, we get more of Tony and Pepper, and even more of the story of Stark's origins. Mickey Rourke is great as the villain seeking vengeance. Even better (or worse), is Sam Rockwell, as Justin Hammer, a total tool who is a defense contractor and Stark Industries competitor. There are more fun guest shots and surprises. And, the action is fantastic, but it does not overwhelm the story or the characters. I give Iron Man 2 a 9 out of 10. I liked it even more than the first one!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you awaiting a review from a Canadian avid comicbook fan? I caught an advanced screening and Fans, SHELLHEAD returns with a Fury (bad pun)!If you can forgive some of the creative liberties Favreau and Theroux have taken with Marvel property, then you may agree that IM2 has met and in ways exceeded No 1. While some reviewers lambasted the dialogue and pace, this reviewer welcomes this Popcorn Recipe: its a (familiar) solid blend of humorous banter, intense action sequences, and character development of heroes &amp; villain who are morally conflicted in the face of adversity.New characters: The story picks up from Col. Nick's infamous visit/request at Stark mansion, to witness an angry Russian physicist Ivan Vanko who plots revenge in the name of his birthright. Rourke even brings a little swagger from his Randy the Wrestler persona and presents a formidable and deadly foe.Hammer the rival arms and munitions dealer is ever bit the wormy snide opportunist that only Rockwell can deliver.And you just can't take your eyes off of Rushman aka Romanov aka Black Widow who steals the scenes as the sexy legal PA and a SHIELD operative you don't want to mess with (or maybe you do). Those martial arts lessons paid off Scarlett I'm both impressed and turned on. Old Friends: From Pepper's reining in her newly appointed duties, to Hogan flexing some bodyguard muscle, to Agent Coulson the patriotic SHIELD journeyman, to Jarvis the omnipresent companion, to Fury continuing his Project Avenger recruitment, and to Rhodey finally seizing his opportunity to arm the big guns of War Machine, the cast of IM are back and larger than ever. Paltrow, Favreau, Gregg, Bettany, Jackson and NKOTB Chedle all excel with substantially stronger material for their key supporting roles.If RDJ first turn as Stark was a home run, then his return is a bottom of the 9th slam. RDJ further tailors the role he was born to play by showcasing the billionaire playboy as an egomaniac genius, a megalomanical god, a self destructive narcissistic, to finally a superhero reborn. From that moment Stark declares his alter ego thereby accepting the weight of accountability and responsibility, finding his balance when everybody wants a piece of the action cannot be easy. Its no small wonder that the comicbook storyline Demon in the Bottle is explored here. Ultimately, discovering his legacy will illuminate the answers.IM2 has succeeded by expanding the "bigger universe" and paved the way for continuing Marvel chapters namely Thor, Captain America towards an epic culmination of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.Welcome to Summer 2010 First Blockbuster. And you already know to stay past the closing credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now first let's just get one thing out of the way, 'Iron man 2' is NOT as good as 'Iron Man'. That's not to say that 'Iron man 2' is not a good film...in fact - it's a very good film. There's a lot to enjoy about Iron man 2, there's enough action scenes (though some suffer from the blurry/shaky cam syndrome), there's a fairly consistent storyline separating those action scenes (some might find the film a little slow, I personally enjoyed all the talking), there's a great cast including returning cast members Downey Jr, Paltrow and Favreou (this time with a little more screen time) and new cast members including the legendary Mickey Rourke (Whip-lash) and the ultra sexy Scarlette Johanson (Black Widow) and then replacement cast member Don Cheadle (war-machine) stepping in for the absence of Terrance Howard. As usual, Robert Downey Jr was brilliant and his portrayal of Tony Stark is just as good in this film as it was in the first. It's obvious throughout the film that he is enjoying himself and he's truly amusing to watch and helps keep the film humorous. Don Cheadle did a fine job of taking over from Terrance Howard, though I don't think he was any better in the role of Rhodey/War-machine than Terrance in the first film. The best part about Iron man 2 is the casting of Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan/whiplash as he is a great actor and truly lit up nearly every scene he was in. That been said I believe his part was a little under-written but I will get to that in a minute. Scarlette Johanson wasn't given much in the way of substance but it must be said that this is truly the most beautiful I have seen her look in any film! Red hair definitely works for her and she is ultra sexy when she's kickin' butt in her skin tight black spandex outfit! Ryan Reynold's is a lucky man!Great cast, great action sequences and a descant sprinkling of humour make Iron man 2 a worthy sequel and if you enjoyed the first film then you should for the most part enjoy this one as well.Here's the down side, I feel this film lacked the intensity of the first film. There were no real edge of your seat nail-biting scenes like the escape from the terrorists scene of the first film. The climactic scenes were not built up enough and many of the scenes ended abruptly and humorously as apposed to dramatically. An example of this was in the anti-climactic final battle in the film, it had all the potential in the world to be dramatic, you have Mickey Rourke who is a brilliant dramatic actor who hates Tony Stark with a passion and you have Robert Downey Junior an all-round brilliant actor and there was no drama! It was resolved so quickly! It was nowhere near as dramatic as the climactic final battle in the first film which is a real shame because it makes the whole threat of Ivan (Rourke) seem empty and harmless and the whole film suffers for it as the lead up for this final confrontation should have ended more explosively. Blame that on the writers!Lack of drama aside, 'Iron man 2' is still a good film and another worthy MARVEL sequel.So like the film I'm going to end on a light note, some people want to be Iron man, some just want to be Tony Stark, me? I want to be that figure-hugging black suit that Scarlett Johanson wears!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but only just</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I should say that I loved first IRONMAN movie. Indeed in many respects it raised the bar for future comic / action hero movies. Like the revised Batman movies it was not afraid to be a bit darker, particularly the origin story at the beginning of IRONMAN 1.Sadly the sequel has none of that. I'd say the studio executives wanted something that would appeal to everyone and unfortunately they got it. It's a Magnolia paint of a movie.Why? Well whilst I did care about Tony Stark in the first movie, I did not connect with any of the characters this time around. The director features too much in the movie. The comedy is slightly overdone. Finally, the bad guys: an arms dealing moron and a Cape Fear bad guy reject just did not provide any sense of suspense. Not in the same why Jeff Bridges did. Pity because both actors could do better with better material.On the whole the special effects are good but the plot, script and story are poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Iron Man film without any "spark"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 focuses on humor, rather than action or excitement and this causes the movie to be mild. Iron Man 2 is entertaining, but entertainment comes from humor most of the time. Therefore, Iron Man 2 is more like a Saturday show, a Saturday night entertainment than an exciting super hero movie which has a lot of action. Probably it is because the director, Jon Favreau is a director who made comedy movies like Elf or Zathura and the screen writer is the writer of Tropic Thunder, then much (sometimes too much) humor is inevitable. This is what Iron Man 2 has. In addition, the execution and the story were better in the first installment. However, there is a more interesting villain played by great Mickey Rourke (even if even this character is mostly passive throughout) The villain of the first movie was a businessman as known. There are some great visuals, War Machine played by Don Cheadle is included in the team, there are nice cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson is really sexy. There are a few real wow moments and most of them are in The Grand Prix scene. It was the best scene of the movie to me. It could have been longer, but it is definitely satisfying. However, till the final part, you have to wait, if you want to see action. Probably, directors have started to believe that in an action movie, if there is less action, but more drama, the movie becomes more deep and more serious. Some people call this as Spider-Man 3 syndrome. Iron Man 2 suffers from this syndrome at times, in the middle part of the movie. It makes us feel like we watch a comedy drama and this is not surprising, because as I mentioned, the director of the movie is Jon Favreau who made comedy movies, played in comedy movies and the script writer of the movie is Justin Theroux who wrote a comedy before, Tropic Thunder. As for the characters, Robert Downey Junior is again the star of the movie, but he was more funny, cool and witty in the first movie. Natasha Romanoff played by Scarlett Johannson is passive most of the time, the operation scene was entertaining, but it is sad that this character consists of a few showy acts. Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is not a wasted character like Natasha Romanoff, but mostly he sits down and masterminds the chaos. Then, he is included in a disappointing and too short final fight (a few minutes) It starts and finishes in a trice. There are three action parts in the movie. The first one is The Grand Prix scene, in the second one, Iron Man and War Machine are included in a chaos (pretty long) and the third one is the final fight. As a result, Iron Man is very humorous at times, entertaining at times, otherwise disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a feeling #2 would be #2. The ONLY memorable actor in this clown show was Mickey Rourke. Basically: This is not the first show. The first show had some soul and a story you can follow and get behind. Iron Man 2 is a Hollywood slop of arrogance. Instead of a good story they produced an overboard light and sound show that will leave you burned out. Let me explain the movie in child like terms: You love chocolate ice cream, and vanilla too, and Coke, and Sprite and Skiddles - so you mix all these things into one big gulp cup and drink. YUK, BLAA, BLAAAUCK. This is Iron Man 2.With out a story one can get behind, a movie becomes forgotten as soon as it is over. Except for the anger you have for blowing your money and time, this is remembered! I am going to have a difficult time trusting Robert Downey again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is not as good as the first movie. This movie has many plots and dialogue, and there were only have few action scenes. It is still entertaining and it didn't ended up like Transformers 2(why did i compare TF2 anyway?). I love to give this movie a perfect score but it's disappointing.Iron Man 2 wasn't a bad film it's just disappointing because it's not that action pack. It has only 3 or 4 action scenes, and 2 of them were long and the rest didn't last a minute. By the way the first movie only had 3 fights and those 3 were long. Good thing the finale in Iron Man 2 is more awesome and has more explosion than the first Iron Man's finale. The music score of the first Iron Man movie was better. The cast is entertaining. Robert Downey Jr. is still awesome. Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell are entertaining villains. Scarlett Johansson is hot and sexy as Natalia, but she's hotter as Black Widow(The name Black Widow and Whiplash was never mentioned throughout the movie). The director of this movie Jon Favreau is fun to watch as Hogan. The only problem in the cast is Don Cheadles. He's not playing Jim Rhodes, he's just playing his old roles.Iron Man 2 is still a superhero and the point of every superhero movie is the action but here in Iron Man 2 the action scenes were few. The movie has too much dialogue and plots, and few action. It's not a successful sequel but it's a fun movie to watch this summer. Iron Man 1 is still a classic superhero movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Stark reveals his superhero alter ego identity and while resisting calls by the government to hand over the Iron Man technology he finds himself threatened by a new enemy. I'm happy to say there's not much to dislike about Actor/Director Jon Favreau's excellent follow up to 2008's blend of comic book action, humour and effects.Iron Man 2 picks up where the first one left off, as billionaire Tony Stark must contend with the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies played by the wonderful Sam Rockwell and the perfectly cast Mickey Rourke.Thankfully Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt and looks great as the Black Widow, although the costumes cuffs looked a little out of place. Don Cheadle unnecessarily replaces Terence Howard as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes but is just as good, phew!The leads; Gwyneth Paltrow surprisingly cast in this role returns and is the grounded back bone of the film. Robert Downey Jr. once again is fantastic as the witty extrovert Stark. There's lot of emotion as you see Stark's father and a glimpse of their relationship. Downey's acting captures Stark's battles with his mortality and his alter ego fittingly.The effects are well executed and don't detract from the action or story in anyway. Fans will enjoy nods and references including The Avengers, Captain America and Samuel L. Jackson's second Nick Fury cameo, to name a few. Again there's a great script and storyline that zips along at a nice pace backed by a fitting music score and rock tracks. Personally, I feel it's better than Iron Man due to it's sharper editing and sleeker look. Stick around until after the end credits as there is a nice teaser of another superhero. Like the Fantastic 4's films all in all Iron Man 2 is the perfect comic book flick that captures the spirit of Marvel, it's just a shame Sam Raimi's Spiderman didn't have the same perfect blend of drama, action and adventure that Iron Man has...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DAAYUM!!! Much better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first Iron Man movie quite a bit, but there was a good deal of things in it that I was critical of. I felt that several bits didn't work very well, and the level of excitement just wasn't that great.They sure remedied that in the sequel!! Okay, so Scarlett Johansson didn't have much to do. Okay, so a couple of minor scenes were less than realistic (like, why do Happy and Pepper stay in the wrecked car during the fight when they could just run to safety - that sort of thing). And okay, so the drone army was not that threatening and didn't pack much of a punch. Aaand, Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played a little bit too much for laughs. But these are very minor things. The overall mesh of plot lines, character interactions, comic book references, humor, action and sheer visual candy combined to produce the greatest entertainment value of any Marvel-based superhero movie yet. Hot damn!One of the things I liked best was the "slow" part in the middle where Tony watched the old film from his father, and found the structure of the new element in the "key to the future" model city (a city which had also actually been built, and in the center of which the climactic battle took place). Great effects, great plot element! :-) And the particle accelerator he threw together; that was massively great fun for me!There were a long list of comic book references in this movie that everyone who hasn't read the comics will naturally have missed. For instance, the reason they turned Justin Hammer into the Sam Rockwell type (Rockwell tends to play the same character, always sporting his trademark Nervous Chuckle) was to make him a comical element. In the comics that character is older and tough and very confident, but the movie version consciously parodied him in order to add more humor to the movie. Not that it needed it; it had plenty to go around!I just don't have any rally major gripe about this movie; I thought it was fabulous entertainment and much better than the first. Who SEZ this isn't the Mighty Marvel Age of Great Comic Book Movies?!9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows more metal mettle than most sequels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's wrong to go into any movie with expectations, especially expectations built up by hype and marketing. But sometimes I can't help it, as was the case with Iron Man 2.The first film was a blast, one I never liked quite as much as some people but that grew on me upon repeat viewings. Robert Downey Jr. was great in the title role, Gwyneth Paltrow was better than she has been in a long, long time as his assistant and there was a great tease at the end featuring Samuel L. Jackson's character, Nick Fury.So Iron Man 2 had some big, metal shoes to fill. The trailer made it look as if it would do that and much more. Mickey Rourke striding forward, wielding some mad, electric whips. Scarlett Johansson looking gorgeous and athletic, more great chemistry between Downey Jr. and Paltrow, THAT kick-ass suit and Don Cheadle taking over the role of James Rhodes. I also knew that there was going to be more from Jackson and that Sam Rockwell was starring. Good times seemed guaranteed.I can't say that Iron Man 2 wasn't a whole heap of cinematic joy joy because it most certainly was. The script is fun, the performances are all great (with the leads just flawless, Rourke being absolutely superb and Rockwell being as fun as Rockwell so often can be) and the direction from Favreau (who also beefs up his role as Happy Hogan, the chauffeur) is assured and crowd-pleasing.It's a shame then that Iron Man 2 falls down in comparison to it's predecessor just by being a little bit too busy. I agree with everyone else who thinks that the whole Marvel crossover/Avengers set-up thing is getting a bit annoying and gets in the way here of what could have been a shiny, sleek beast of a blockbuster. Then we also have Stark's personal problems, his unresolved daddy issues and the general flaws that beset him even before he first donned the suit. I understand that it fleshes out even more of his character and helps define the man but it all feels like a bit much when all we really want to do is see more of the eye-popping action scenes and more of the entertaining bad guys.It doesn't help that Favreau peaks in the first half of the movie with a sequence set during the Monaco grand prix that tops anything seen in both films. Where can he go after that? Sadly, things move on to focus on metal on metal carnage and that dehumanises a lot of the bigger action moments in the latter half of the film.I guess to many people I will sound like I'm nitpicking and being too harsh here but there was just something holding me back from loving this movie as much as I wanted to. The fact that I even had that feeling while watching the film makes me sure that the sum of it's parts did not add up the absolutely fantastic whole movie I was expecting. But perhaps that's my fault for having such high expectations.See this if you like: Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Borderline psychotic cast in movie jumping from one CGI set to another CGI set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the cast of characters almost all borderline psychotics. All metal and no brains was the order of the day for almost every single character.My time in the movie was spent wondering whether crazy = funny; or whether the director intended to show the characters on the crazy side (particularly the villains whose main aim was mad revenge).The movie jumped from scene to scene as if the story line ran out of puff and required new energy by a change of set when the writer or director got bored. Given the crazy episodic nature of film's revelations, it almost seemed like a series of black comedy skits especially when you throw in Gary Shandling as a "senator". Unfortunately, the scene changes were not seamless.The only straight man for the comedic capers of the cast was Don Cheadle who after 20 minutes suddenly does a turn coat act before returning to the side of good.An the biggest laugh would have to come from Mickey Rourke who's fingers would almost destroy a computer key board does his tap, tap, tap and instantly breaks a complex encryption code and passes through the Fire Wall of a military computer. I seriously doubt whether Mickey Rourke's character displayed the brains to even turn on a computer!!!The racing car smash up in Monaco (20 minutes into the movie) was spectacular but it was then a long boring wait until the next action scene.Samuel L Jackson's character was tossed into the movie as a tie-in with the next movie or another Marvel comic movie production. The scene was like the diner scene in Pulp Fiction without any shootout.I had high expectations and was accordingly disappointed. The movie was more for laughs and spectacle rather than any serious story or character development.And why would people pay for attendance at a Tony Stark dinner when the entertainment provided required the audience to be on drugs to find amusement at the crazy antics?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old saying too many cooks spoil the broth springs to mind. Here there are too many plot elements and redundant characters. Mickey Rourke looks impressive but, like everything else here, is wasted in a film which tries to cram too much in. Whiplash, Black Widow, Nick Fury, Justin Hammer, War Machine are all quickly introduced and then scantly used. The first fight at the race track between Whiplash and Stark is the highlight but could have been so much better. For instance, we see Pepper Potts driving to deliver Iron Man's armour to him in the opposite direction to the race cars. This could have been an exhilarating scene worth of The French Connection, but not much is made of it. It is not well explained what Whiplash has against Stark. Then comes Hammer, a dull corporate villain very similar to the dull corporate villain in the first film. Why can't Hollywood get beyond these off the peg evil capitalists? A fight with another Iron Man. Some secret agents. Then more Iron men. A lot of gimmicky effects. Nothing we haven't seen many times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Favreau's (Elf, Hooligans, etc.) work and I think he made this movie to mock at his usual audience. He knew one would think "wow, that sure will be some twisted interesting film" so he made the most-cliché movie ever instead of that. That's the thing I like about Favreau (Elf, etc.) , he always changes and surprises his fans. If we start with the vision - the movie has some interesting stuff shot. That's a plus for it. Even though the budget had been low, the work is done nice here. Except for the BOTS - What the hell?! They reminded me of The Flabbers! The music sucked like a hooker. At one time I almost threw up. Favreau's (Elf) not allowed, I would guess, to push the boundaries much, so he can't create any memorable setpieces. The plot is the worst part of the film. I almost fell asleep till the end. So stupid, so predictable... And where did all the super powers come to that loser ad libber? We see him normal and after a second he has all the super punches and kicks and he even nebbishy teaches himself to fly?!? Believe it or not this is the tender side of Iron Man.It harks back to some of my favorite TV shows- from SPACE ACE to SUPER INFRAMAN to IRON KING to RED BARON to POWER RANGERS and beyond- and does so in a gentle, loving way. Our soon-to-be hero is actually enamored of art-house dialogue scenes. and his eventual reincarnation as IRONMAN is about as much fun as you could hope for in a movie like this. Favreau's (Elf) sure-handed direction never wavers and the uplifting ending makes it all worthwhile. You just gotta believe! I think even my dumb-ass brother who likes Virtual Rangers wouldn't like this Iron Man movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man was arguably one of the best superhero film of this decade, and a proper rival to DC comics' leading guy. Yes, it wasn't a sophisticated social study like The Dark Knight, and it had some really cheesy plot points. Despite its flaws, it was a light-hearted, pop-culture-heavy popcorn flick which also had guts to tackle on a masked vigilante cliché; the protagonist revealed its alter-ego! It was the coolest superhero movie till Kick-Ass, for sure.Now a sequel released. Expectations are massively high. All-star casts are even better than having Jeff 'The Dude' Bridges. Trailers and clips look magnificent. The soundtrack album is a freaking AC/DC collection! So... it it a worthy successor? The answer is NO, thanks to Marvel Entertainment.The good news first. Robert Downey Jr. IS TONY STARK. He nailed every scene. This movie is, presumably, full of improves, and RDJ stays in the character every time. The action scenes are well executed. Although the final showdown was a bit of let-down, aerial dogfights were new exciting addition to the series. Supporting casts are solid. Sam Rockwell was a dynamite in every lines. Scarlett Johansson was hotter than ever. Sam Jackson is the man. Most of all, long-forgotten Garry Shandling steals the show. The Senate hearing scene is one of the highlights of this movie. Trust me. It shines.AND the bad news; it just forgot to be intriguing. The reason Tony Stark being so awesome was that it didn't care about the future. He always followed the heart, and even being a hero was his choice. In the sequel, by the way, he's always dragged by other things: his sickness, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, villains, etc. He's SO stressed that he almost becomes another emo-Peter Parker. It made me just... uninterested. Villains are not interesting either. Though performances are magnificent in separate scenes, they just don't flow into the movie itself. Mickey Rourke just disappears from the main plot for half an hour. Improvisations are heavily used throughout the whole film, and one-liners simply fill out. Lines are great, but it feels disjointed at times.The worst news is that Marvel seems to be dying to see the Avengers in action. The whole feature seems to be a giant checklist for the Avengers. "Tony Stark's internal struggle? Check. Introduction of S.H.I.E.L.D.? Check. Warmachine? Check. Possibility of rivals? Check." They rushes things too much, and the grand finale doesn't feel grand at all. It just feels like a long preparation. This is what makes me worried at future Marvel project; they just don't get the idea of a standalone piece, and if they don't get it the future projects will repeat this mistake.Summary: It's like Quantum of Solace. It shines at times, but fails to be coherent. It looks like Marvel intended this movie to be a stepping stone to the Avengers, but please Marvel take some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really torn between a rating of 7 and 8 and should probably see it again before a final verdict. But my initial feeling is this one had too much talk and too little heart.While there certainly was more action, the action scenes - especially the last - did not feel threatening at all. The one possible exception to this is the first battle between Iron Man and Whiplash - the one on the race track from the trailer.The main problem is probably too much dialog, possibly too much happening, and too little heart. Too few quiet moments. I'm not sure.My guess is the film makers heard that people loved the humor from the first (which was mostly ad-libbed from the actors) but missed more action. So they apparently gave the whole cast (of GREAT actors all around!) free reign to talk up as much as they want in each and every scene. And they added action sequence after action sequence to make up for the mere two major sequences from Iron Man 1.The end result was slightly underwhelming, yet almost satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen the original Iron Man movie in the theater and so I blamed that to not liking it i.e. the big screen awe effect of having a super hero bash different villains was missing. So when I heard about the sequel, decided to watch it in the theater. Till yesterday morning, I thought it was a 3D movie but on checking the local cinema website I realized it wasn't. I think not having it in 3D was a huge mistake cause even though 3D is over rated, I'd think a movie like this would have gained a lot from it.I was a little excited after seeing everyone else looking forward to be amazed by Tony Stark aka Iron Man but 2 hours later and the only word that came to my head was rubbish. That's how bad I thought the movie was even though everyone else seemed to like it in bits.The problem is when I think about comic book movies, I have this high expectation because a comic book has so much material to build on so I assume the movie will be amazing and apart from a few, most of them are disappointing. I'm not a huge comic book person but I know a bit about them to know how bad these films always end up being. I suppose it's similar to the problem that the Harry potter movie series faces.Now talking about Iron Man 2. The story revolves around Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.), the rich multi millionaire play boy super hero who has privatized world peace. How the government is trying to get their hands on the technology/weapon that is Iron Man while trying to replicate it with the help of Hammer industries run by Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell). This time we also had a side kick in the form of Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time by Don Cheadle) who was the other Iron Man (?). Then we have Ivan Vanko (played by Mickey Rourke) who manages beat Iron Man up in their first clash with his garage built whip thing called whiplash and then gets hired by Hammer industries and creates a droid army and a new suit for himself. Wish they'd given him more of a role apart from talking Russian and sarcastic smiles/giggle.The ladies in the film were Pepper Potts (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff (played by Scarlett Johansson). Pepper Potts is Tony Starks secretary/love interest/better half etc ? whatever you want to call it. Gwyneth Paltrow sleep walked through her tiny role which wasn't a bad thing while Scarlett Johansson was the eye candy(?) of the film to make the hyper guys happy. Tight clothes, skin show, kicking ass (literally) kind of summarized her predictable cliché role.Finally we had the one eyed Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who tries to knock some sense into Tony Stark who goes off the hook in the middle of the movie. I wonder why Samuel L. Jackson agreed to do such an effortless role. Maybe it has something to do with the movie The Avengers.Few things that annoyed me... - If Ivan manages to beat up Iron Man so easily in his poorly funded garage project, I'd assume killing Ivan later on when he's got a whole new armor (with the backing of Hammer industries) would be quite a work out for Iron man and his sidekick butthe final show down between them was short and just too easy. - Don't call the creation of a new element an almost impossible procedure and then make Tony Stark create it without any hassles. - Yes we know what USA thinks about Iran, Pakistan, North Korea etc. You don't need to keep reminding us that through movies as well. - Yes Tony Stark is a playboy but do you really need to stuff that fact into our face every single time. - Justin Hammer was annoying...enough said. - Villains are important, give them more to say. - Do you really need a character in the movie for guys to ogle over.I'm sure there were more points but I just can't break my head over it. Honestly, Robert Downey Jr. did a good job playing TonyStark/Iron Man but the movie was just too boring, lame, predictable, cliché etc that his decent act couldn't save it for me. Overall I'm glad I just paid AED15 for the movie...it wasn't worth anything more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy storyline, no real plot, no theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Iron Man 2, and while I thought the first one was a bit overrated, I had hopes. They quickly dissipated.Firstly, there was no theme. The first Iron Man had a theme - it was about Tony Stark changing his life and becoming a better man. Iron Man 2 had no theme at all.Secondly, the plot was messy: there just happens to be another brilliant scientist who can build an advanced power source in a squalid Moscow shack? Okay, we had to swallow that Tony Stark could build one in the middle of freakin' Afghanistan, but twice? That's too much.Weren't Pepper and Tony supposed to get together at the end of the first film? In this one they stay at arm's length, and I wondered if there was any romance there at all. That scene from the preview where Pepper kisses his helmet and Tony jumps from the back of the plane after it? Gone.The Avengers? Samuel L Jackson with an eye patch? Who the hell wears an eye patch today and doesn't get laughed at? Why introduce paper-thin characters that really do nothing? And it's not like anything actually happened with them anyway, so why waste out time and goodwill?Thirdly, the film didn't really go anywhere in terms of advancing the Iron Man story. There were a few interesting concepts - what does Iron Man do now that everyone knows who he is? Will the US military get their hands on it? - but these, while addressed, where never really given much thought. Instead, Tony's best friend (Cheadle) steals the other suit. What? Even after being given an order to do so, why would his friend do that?Fourth, the acting: Gwenyth Paltrow is a terrible actress. So it Scarlett Johansson, but at least she's smoking hot. Don Cheadle is no Terrance Howard. While Howard himself isn't a great actor, he owned the role in Iron Man 1. Cheadle just didn't have the personality and charisma, and you'll note he gets very little screen time too.It wasn't a completely horrible film, but it wasn't worth the 7.9 IMDb gives it. Much closer to a flat 5.0. The direction is a bit messy - the action scenes aren't as clean as they should be. Some great SXF, as you'd expect. Save your money for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After Avatar the Boreathon comes the utterly boring IronMan2!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I thought it was safe to go back into the cinema, after the dreadfully boring disappointment of 'Avatar,' I go to see something even worse - 'Iron Man 2.' How can Hollywood spend trillions on such product? It is absolutely uninteresting, except for whether Gwyneth Paltrow is wearing her killer heels in some shots but not in others, with little action, appalling script, lax direction, and mindless high tech imagery. We spend over the first hour while Robert Downey jnr calls on all his past personal indiscretions to try and portray a super hero who is falling apart because he is dying - cue, inaudible supposedly smart ass dialogue with characters talking over each other, which is absolutely a killer and not worthy of all that Hollywood has done in the past hundred years!!!!!!!!!!!!! This film stinks, the action is useless, so-called invincible super killer drones (actually robocop lookalikes) are mown down in two seconds flat (Get bored did you, JON?), the characters not worth bothering with, repetitious to the Nth degree, and the villain (Mickey Rourke picking up his pension money)keels over inside a minute! Miss it if you can - luckily I only paid ?3 or $4.50 so I got away with it. The day before Polling Day in UK and there were some nerds from Uni calling it awesome - I don't recognise my country anymore. No wonder Tony Blair got away with it for so long!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't reclaim the originality and fun of the original, but it'll do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to go see this with a friend on Saturday night. Now, I heard the film from others that this a step or two below the original, but I went in with an open mind. By the time the movie was over, I was pleased. But then, after thinking about it more, this is a disappointment. The film is drastically different in pace. Honestly, it gets a bit of a bore for awhile, which never happened in the original. Sometimes, its just hard to take this film seriously as a superhero film. In my opinion, the overwhelming number of laughs and silliness in this film makes it hard to take seriously. There is a large list of new things in this sequel. First, we learn much more about Tony Stark's father than we ever did in the original. Its quite interesting. Jon Favreau has a much, much bigger role in this film than the original, and I absolutely loved his role in the film. We learn his character has a personality. The talented Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey,and I actually liked him better in the role. They both seem so different in the role. There's Scarlette Johansson as Black Widow. I was honestly disappointed with her role in the film. It was too small, I thought. Mickey Rourke is raw and sinister as Whiplash, the main villain, and its a perfect fit. He does an absolutely perfect Russian accent. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is a good fit for the most part, although it was hard for me to take his character seriously after awhile as a villain. Sometimes, it seems like all his character does is be funny. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this film as Nick Fury (he had a credit ending scene in the original). In a way it succeeds over the original, but for the most part it doesn't. It's missing some of the excitement and originality that made the original a truly great achievement in film. This is quite a bit different from the first, and you may not like how different it is. I certainly didn't. Many new actors, and a whole different type of ballgame. There's a bit, I think, too much silliness in this film. But still, it'll do. Go see this. Its not as fun as the first, but its not as disappointing as Spider Man 3 was. And do be sure to stay after the credits if you're a fan of Marvel Comics. Make sure you notice Stan Lee's cameo in this as well. Its rather brilliant. Overall, good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing to say the least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you remember how you felt right after having watched 'The Empire Strikes Back'? 'The Return of the Jedi'? 'The Matrix'? Or the first Iron Man movie?If you are like me, I would guess pretty darn excited -- 'Can't wait to see what happens next'! Now try to remember how you felt after watching 'The Phantom Menace' and 'The Matrix Reloaded' -- Well, after watching two of the biggest travesties in the world of sequels... I felt completely frustrated, angry and cheated! I won't say I feel the same resentment after having watched Iron Man 2 but it comes pretty darn close.Iron Man 1? A fantastic movie! Iron Man 2? I want my money back! And my travel expenses! What is wrong with Iron Man 2? Do you have a couple of hours?Maybe...no script? Really, are these guys serious? They make a movie costing around $150 million dollars and the script SUCKS BIG TIME.Plot holes anyone? There is NO motivation: you have no idea why you should care about the characters, since the characters themselves don't have a clue what they are supposed to do or feel and why in this story. I'm not saying the actors are bad, they are doing all they can, but they are given a crappy script to work with.No sense of suspense or danger: despite one hundred of explosions and a couple of thousand stray bullets in crowded areas, NOT ONE PERSON gets killed or wounded in the whole movie! The closest you get to 'wounded' are a couple of bruises. How am I supposed to care for someone when I KNOW he won't get hurt? This is a MAJOR difference from the first Iron Man movie, where the threat was real.Somebody desperately tried to make Iron Man 2 into a movie for all ages -- well, it worked, in the worst possible way.This is also why all of the action scenes are boring, since all you see is CGI animated cartoon robots bashing into each other -- sounds a lot like Transformers you say? That's right, but with EVEN LESS human emotion, since no one gets hurt.It was pretty difficult to mess this up, but they somehow managed to do it.I've read all the rave reviews -- "action packed!", "entertaining!" "terrific!" Are we talking about the same movie here? Seriously guys, either you have a very low standard or you have never watched a movie that truly deserves those rave reviews, like: The Matrix and the original Star Wars trilogy. And no, I'm not comparing Iron Man 2 only to 'classic movies'. Even newer movies like Star Trek or Kick-Ass or even Iron Man 1 were ten times better! Kick-Ass was made for $30 million, instead of $150 like Iron Man 2 and it completely kicks Iron Man 2's ass in every department.I want to erase Iron Man 2 from my memory but I'm afraid it will be very difficult -- still having nightmares about Jar Jar Bings -- Thank you Iron Man 2 screenwriters, for ruining the Iron Man 1 experience for me. I wish I could sue you.Why I still give it 5 stars? Because the actors tried. And because I smiled a few times. That's it. A DVD throwaway movie at most, it really wasn't worth my money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 Kicks-Ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll put it very simply, I think this movie was really cool. Excellent story, visual effects, action, all of it combined masterfully to create a great film that delivers entertainment and style throughout, without sacrificing a good plot. It has all the right elements and the cool elements in a proper balance making it fun yet not dumb.I liked a lot Iron Man 1 and I think if you also did so, then you would most likely like this one too. I really like films of this genre like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2, Watchmen and I think both Iron Man films are up to the level. It's great to see that this sequel is as good or even better than the first one.I absolutely recommend this movie, it kicks major ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterfully Executed Sequel! Action AND Heart... A Perfect Mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I'm one of the fortunate few who got to see this gem a bit early and I'm happy to report that they took what worked so well in Iron Man and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way. The complexity, depth, heart and action are even more off the charts than the first film. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one and built upon it masterfully. Now we get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer weaved with a celebrity who should have never let the cat out of the bag in the final moments of Iron Man 1. They promised to up the action from the first film and they certainly did but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. It has the same flavor and humor of the original and it may even focus more on the fabulous relationships already developed. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film. I didn't think that was possible. Everyone came to play and this great cast brought their best stuff and it shows on screen. Everyone knew Downey, Paltrow and Cheadle could act but Bill O'Reilly and The CNN anchor? Yes, they show up and do a GREAT job in extended cameos. Rourke and Rockwell are PERFECT as the duel foils for Tony Stark, I mean PERFECT. From the Grand Prix in Monaco to the amazing finale, buckle up because this is one intense, interesting, intelligent and fun ride. My only real complaint is that Scarlett's Black Widow has too little screen time. Still, a film that leaves you clamoring for more isn't the worst sin in the world.When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What was said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, TDK and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 2. I honestly can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a turd in the punch bowl!!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repeat: There's a turd in the punch bowl! This movie is a microcosm of everything wrong with Hollywood...and, unfortunately, humans in general.You see, in the most basic terms possible...people are, for the most part, stupid. There are far more of these stupid people on Earth than intelligent ones. So, if you want to sell something to these people, like a movie, you need to dial-down the intelligence level of the product. (In this way, Iron Man 2 succeeds!) For instance, let's say you want to sell a product to a group of Sarah-Palin-backing Tea Baggers. You already know, without ever meeting any of them, that this a group of people who supports a brainless political creation, one who doesn't even belong to the Tea Bagger party! (High intelligence there, eh?!) So if you were to invent a t-shirt with a saying on it, with the intention of selling it to a Tea Bagger...would you create an articulate, detailed argument on the t-shirt...or would you create something that appeals to the lowest common denominator? Would your t-shirt say something smart and factual like "90% of Tea Baggers got a tax cut under Obama!". Or would you just put Obama on the shirt with a Hitler mustache?! Which one is going to sell better? Same thing here with "Iron Man 2". A producer COULD spend $200 Million on something highly intelligent and with some redeeming value -- and sell less tickets -- or that same producer could spend the $200 Million on a bunch of special effects, A-list stars and explosions -- and sell more tickets. So, intelligent people (I'm assuming if you have read this much, you're probably more intelligent than most), we get stuck with these sorry excuses for movies all the time! And I, for one, am sick of it! Where does Iron Man 2 go wrong? Where to begin?! First off, Mickey Rourke looks like a feminine version of "Professor Chaos"! Where did they come up with that suit design, the Johnny Weir collection?! And Gwyneth Paltrow? How does she keep getting work?! She's the "Mark Harmon" of actresses! In one scene, she seductively kisses the Iron Man mask -- with no human in it! (Imagine her horror when she read the script for the first time and came across that scene!) I almost felt bad for her...then I reminded myself that she is Gwyneth Paltrow! Next in line for this money-grab excuse of a movie is the usually brilliant Robert Downey Jr. If his performance were any more wooden, his nose would grow when he lied!!In my opinion, there has only been one Comic Book movie worthy of a "10" rating and that was "Batman Begins". Iron Man 2 falls woefully short of that standard. A big step back from Iron Man 1 even. Don't let the fancy CGI and big explosions fool you...this is a clunker! Thank you for reading! JD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, if you expect to see lots of action in this movie - you will be disappointed! Basically, all the action you will see in this movie is what you saw in trailer. I know people have different tastes. I prefer action over drama and comedy, some people prefer different. So just so you know, this is written from action lovers point of view. First Iron Man had lots of action and was pumped with adrenaline, that is the biggest reason I liked it. This part just doesn't cut it for me. Here are few things I disliked a lot about this movie: - there are a lot of random things in this movie, an example: while there is formula race about to begin, Tony decides to jump in one and race. I don't know if i missed some important part in this movie but I was like "What the hell??? That makes no sense how the hell did they let him???" or Tonies birthday party, man that was some random stuff right there. - there is this agent played by Scarlett Johansson. To describe her shortly: she is James Bond 2. She can do anything: beat 20 guards? you bet, hack system made by a guy who hacked into important military system in 10sec? no problem. Just an examples, you will see through movie, don't want to spoil it for you. - I expected 20-30min intro and then some epic action with great special effects, but I had to wait an hour and a half for that and it wasn't even epic! - OK, movie is coming to an end, time for epic battle! Just kidding, fight is over before you say "cookie" - stupidity of some scenes concerning highly sophisticated technology and system (also jail) security, an example: guy breaks through pentagon-like security system in 10sec, there are more things I'd like to add but I don't want to spoil it much for you as I mentioned. - this movie is... boring. Talking, talking, talking, more talking, the worst part is - this talking isn't even interesting! After 30min of talking all I heard was bla, bla, bla... If at least it was something worth listening to, but only parts worth listening to were where Tony makes a good joke. Now, why did I give it a "high" 5/10 if it was disappointing (overall)? 1. Great special effects 2. This movie made me laugh A LOT3.Scarlett Johansson looks better then Megan Fox in Transformers.This movie should be tagged as (in this order) Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Sci-Fi and Action as last if you ask me. I don't think I wasted 2h on watching this, but I expected more, much more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me get this right; I am a FAN of the first Ironman movie;the American war propaganda machine looses its hero (the best weapon producer) when the Ironman character realizes after being confronted with suffering and death that peace is guaranteed by "having a bigger stick" than your opponent (good so far,.., but nevertheless fun with a bit of criticism); "welcome tony stark, the most famous mass-murderer in human history"(Ironman 1)- great; and so Ironman is created by tony stark, a charismatic, smart genius (very good performance from Robert Downey Jr.);and here in Ironman2: NOTHING, NO STORY, NO PLOT, EVEN NO ACTION; NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT; just nothing; the tony stark character isn't even smart anymore; he is just arrogant and sometimes accidentally funny;when you watched the trailer you have seen ALL the action sequences (and i really mean ALL!) in the whole film; the whole film is filled with senseless dialogues; why replacing Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle??? Terrence did a good job, Don Cheadle doesn't fit in (although he was great in Traitor) Mrs. Paltrow is just annoying, annoying, annoying; Samuel L. Jackson just makes a 2 min commercial for the avenger movie; Sam Rockwell, well.., not so good:)the only positive thing are the action scenes with Mickey Rourke at the beginning (just at the beginning..so about 5 min)and Scarlett Johanssons scenes ;) If you liked transformers 2, you will be satisfied with this brainless try of entertainment; My native language isn't English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great beginning and end, not so great in the middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr's wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.The problem is, the film just stops being so much fun in-between. In a large proportion of this time, it's either going too slowly with little happening that's exciting or even particularly interesting, or it's providing some silly moments like Iron Man lounging on a giant display donut. To be fair, there's no problem with the many subplots this movie has: they all blend together quite smoothly.The acting in this film deserves credit: almost everybody does a great job. Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow are just as entertaining as they were in the first film, Jon Favreau gets more to do as Stark's chauffeur, Don Cheadle is actually a little better than Terrence Howard as Rhodie (again, maybe because he has a bigger role), Mickey Rourke portrays a decent but overall ordinary villain, and once Scarlett Johansson is allowed to do something substantial with her own action sequence, she's well worth watching. The only weak link is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, who gets quite annoying after a while.Overall, Iron Man 2's slow middle section prevents it from being better than the first film as a whole, which is a shame considering how brilliant the beginning and end segments are.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong: this movie is FUN, from beginning to end. Too much talking? No way. Not enough action? Maybe, but there's plenty (2 fights, 1 'friend ruckus'). But the thread that ties it all together don't seem to be that strong (I blame it on Theroux). Anyway, go see it, you won't regret. One more thing: don't believe people telling that this movie talks way too much about the Avengers: a few bits here and there is not too much. And stay for the after-credits scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay film that mostly works because of Robert Downey Jr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is the sequel to the really rather good Iron Man and is a fun and easily enjoyed action film. Robert Downey Jr is again excellent as playboy technologist Tony Stark/Iron Man and his charisma and wisecracking keep the film rolling along nicely. The plot of Iron Man 2 doesn't really match that of Iron Man which was full of contemporary touches but the basic premise is that a Russian rival to Iron Man emerges and attacks Iron Man who must battle someone nearly as brilliant as he is.That Russian rival is the fantastic Mickey Rourke who puts on a believable Russian accent and looks terrific as the downtrodden son of a genius who lived in poverty and obscurity while the Starks lived in glamour and luxury. The revenge that Rourke's character creates is not much of a plan as it basically involves him fighting and losing in a very public sphere but that is only the setup for the rest of the film where Rourke is given the resources to build a credible threat to Iron Man's prowess.The first showdown between the main villain and main hero is a bit more flash than substance. Rourke's character with electrode whips is awesome but the Monaco GP is not well rendered. Mixing a real event that the audience will be very familiar with and the fantasy can work but it doesn't here. The cars fly about and explode at unrealistic angles and it is all just an excuse for fire. Later action sequences also make suspension of disbelief a little difficult especially when the heroes are cornered and don't just use their otherwise ubiquitous flying abilities to get out of a difficult spot.The action is what is always difficult about sequels. More explosions doesn't necessarily equal better fun. What was terrific about the first Iron Man was the character of Tony Stark. Here he again is excellent but too much time is given to shiny effects. Fortunately there is more than enough of Stark the man to make this a good film. For reasons that become clear during the plot, Stark is living life as if it could end soon and his breakdown is harming his business. The very reliable Pepper Potts picks up the slack and makes actually a much better CEO than Stark does even when he's not having emotional trouble.The father-son relationship stuff is interesting if not overly original. The key plot device contained within the design of a future world city is a little less creative than this reviewer at least came up with but it is still decent fare. The metaplot items are there for those who look hard enough including the Expo which seems a clear reference to Shanghai and Russian-American arms treaties that are currently going through Congress can be read into the Congressional hearing scenes though there's nothing quite as impressive as that cave in Afghanistan from Iron Man 1.The supporting cast are decent. The new Rhodes played by Don Cheadle is a massive upgrade and his is a much better supporting role representing the tension between the collective good as represented by the military, and the good that an individual can do represented by Stark. The plot that surrounds War Machine is very believable. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is the comic relief and while he may be a bit fidgety at times, the banter that he is on the receiving end of for the most part is terrific particularly before Congress. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff is not much more than a stereotypical sci fi martial artist but for those who are fans of hers she will have some appeal. Samuel L. Jackson gets slightly more lines than in the first film and he does what he can with limited screen time. Gwyneth Paltrow is again excellent - are her best performances the two Iron Man films? Pepper Potts is thrust into a more senior role in this film and Paltrow brings it off expertly, she has great timing with Robert Downey Jr and their scenes all work very well together.The lighting and effects are good if not mesmerising. The overarching shots of the Stark Expo are beautiful. Not all the visual sequences work well and the Stark Cheerleaders are an unfortunately size zero group of models so it is a relief that they are not featured much. The post-credits scene is just about worth waiting for but only just unlike the first film which was definitely worth waiting for.The film itself could be a 3 or a 4 star outing. It is not as good as the original but is still some nice lighthearted fun made much better by Downey Jr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film frankly is unnecessarily complained about, to a hilarious degree. The action of Iron Man 2 is both entertaining, although the sequence in Morocco is a bit too full of hesitations, and it has as much a plot as....well, any other movie that Iron Man is in does. Also, and though this won't probably be noticed the first time watching the film, Sam Rockwell's character is notably well acted. Hammer on screen contrasts greatly from Bridges' Obadiah Stane character, providing nice a anti-Stark-businessman contrast.Even furthermore however, this movie in ways like an MCU-exposition-pillar for the whole MCU-series; and not in a conspicuous okay-there-was-some-obvious-exposition-right- there way, but rather in ways that are either realized later or realized when the watcher looks closely. By "MCU expostion" I mean hints that tie this and that together that are findable in the film, or the introducing major MCU characters, such as Romanoff and Coulson (who was very minor in IM 1).And lastly, without the humorous and detailed Senate hearing scene at the start, Iron man/Tony Stark's persona and public stance regarding his Iron Man essence would be a bit vague. If the Iron Man movie series was simply Iron Man 1, (Avengers), and Iron Man 3, there would be plotwise an enormous hole - larger than if, say, Iron Man 3 were to be "erased" from film-existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 is a decent movie, I'm sure it'll entertain you, but don't expect it to reach the heights of the first one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 had some big shoes to fill, I mean, the first one was completely amazing, great action, great acting, overall great. Sadly, Iron Man 2 doesn't deliver. First off, it's not a bad movie, it's not good either, but it will entertain you, it's a pretty fun movie, but it doesn't reach the heights of the first one. But let's start:The acting again is very good, Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as Tony Stark again, but he is less likable in this film, because he's a bit of a douchebag, I know, Tony is a dick, but in a good way, you are entertained by his douchiness in the first movie, but in this one he's really doesn't give a crap about anything, so you just don't like him here. Gwyneth Paltrow didn't change much, Don Cheadle was good, when he was doing something, because for the most part he doesn't have much to do, more than Terrence Howard, but still not a lot of things. Mickey Rourke is great in the movie, he's a fantastic actor, and it makes you think that Marvel really wasted this opportunity, they paid for Mickey Rourke so they should've done something with his character. He nails every scene he's in, but they went all Darth Maul on him, he didn't get much screen time and he was badly developed, you only care about him because he's Mickey Rourke. Sam Rockwell was also great in the movie, he was the funniest guy in the film, he gave one of the funniest monologues I've seen, the "Ex-Wife", I laughed so hard at that one! There's also Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson, they acted well, their roles were a bit questionable, but they acted well, Nick Fury was pretty funny, and it was nice seeing Black Widow kick some butt.The writing in the movie is decent, the jokes work very well, especially Hammer's lines, the dialogue is pretty good also, but the main problem of the movie is in the story.The story is so convoluted, but mostly not because of so many characters as you would think, but rather because of all the different subplots. I mean, I didn't even get the feeling that there is a main plot, because there were so many and they didn't clear up as to what is the main story. Black Widow was obviously only in it because they needed to set up the Avengers, Nick Fury as well, which I'm fine with, because it paid off for sure, but Iron Man 2 got so preoccupied with setting up that they replaced character development and motivation with bad introductions. Jon Favreau did a good job directing again, it's really the writers fault that the movie failed. The action scenes were very cool again, the fight between Rhodey and Tony was awesome, one of the best parts, the fight where they team up against the mechs was also very cool. The climax battle with Whiplash? not so much. It was way too short, but it was fun while it lasted, the way they win was kind of dumb and they thought about it very quickly, but it's a pretty entertaining. The effects in Iron Man 2 are great, just like the first one, the suitcase fight sequence was AWESOME! The holograms look very cool, despite being a bit dumb. The soundtrack of the movie was great too, I especially liked the use of "Another One Bites The Dust" by Queen, that part was really cool.So overall Iron Man 2 is a pretty entertaining movie, it's in between good and bad. I do recommend it, as long as you keep in mind that it doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor, I'm sure there's enough humor and action to keep you entertained. I give Iron Man 2 a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark is back !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is actually great entertainment. Sure it's no classic but it has a quality cast and a decent enough story to make the two-hour running length worthwhile.Firstly, the dialogue is great. Robert Downey Jr. has some hilarious lines and director Jon Favreau also has some funny moments in his small role. The story is solid and easy to follow , with no obvious loopholes and good pacing. This is particularly clear with villain-of-sorts Justin Hammer , who we first see at the beginning in the court room but when he loses the case we can understand his motive for joining forces with Tough Guy Ivan Vanco. It's this sort of character development that makes this film compelling. It's also nice to see Nick Fury (a.k.a Sam L.Jackson ) make his marvel debut even if it is basically a short avengers commercial.In my opinion, this movie actually matches the original - it builds upon its biggest appeal , the charismatic Tony Stark , and delivers a substantial story that encompasses both action and wit. Nevertheless, the movie could have benefited from more action (there are only two major action sequences in the entire movie ) and a bigger part from Scarlett Johansson who was rather under-played. Still, good entertainment and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot Summary: the world has gain knowledge that billionaire and inventor Tony Stark is the man in iron suite and with that revelation come pressure and questions about his technology and inventions. At this same time, old enemies unknown to him plans to take him down. With the government against for not sharing his inventions, Tony must form new alliances to confront some powerful enemies. The theme of the movie was struggle for human dignity and human relationship. This is shown as Tony tries to show to the world that he not a selfish person but have more integrity than that while building strong relationship with others. This film share the same them with Iron Man 1 The film featured Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes with Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko. In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark is the same arrogant person but this time the government and public is putting pressure on to release the suit to the government and military which he refuses. After he was captured because of his weapons, he vow in a public press release that he will not manufacture weapons for the military. But his resolve to keep his inventions close to himself is shaken when an old enemy confront him with a replica of the suit he created. The pressure from the government becomes more and Tony become selfish. Tony must now revisit his unresolved feelings toward his dead father and then try and build a relationship with him to be able to resolve his dignity and deal with the pressure from the military. The camera angle in the scene at the Grand Prix made it more dramatic and suspenseful. In the scene, Tony's racing car was turn upside down from the crash and Ivan was coming unto him at the same time the background showed explosion from other vehicle crashing. The camera shot he scene form downward making the scene more dramatic. The director also uses motif in the form of music. Every time Tony get his suit to fly or is about to fly, you will hear the same sound playing at the background and become some kind of Iron Man entrance sound. Overall, I believe the director was able to illustrate the intended theme of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I'd like this. I like Mickey Rourke and have been a fan of his for years. I like Scarlett Johansson also......Robert Downey Jr. And I liked this movie. Quite a bit. One of my favorite parts was near the beginning ......with the cars ripping up, literally. And Rourke s character striding down the track. I love the action and muscle......the cars and special effects. An exciting way to start an action movie. This a good sequel and exciting. I loved the robot assembly lines ....very cool and strange to think about. Its kinda like an action science fiction combo. Lots of muscle and brawn, entertaining thrills and spontaneous combustion. This was a nice surprise. I'd recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid entertainment, slightly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a solid entertainment, cool and efficient and eager to please. If it is a step down from the great 2008 original, that's only because it lacks the freshness and surprise. Yet, you can't hold that against it, films like Iron Man, The Dark Knight and Watchmen have set the standard for everything that a superhero action picture can be. This film doesn't rise to that level but it gets the job done.The film's invaluable asset is, once again, the presence of Robert Downey, Jr. He knows how to take the role of a billionaire playboy with an endless supply of weapons and toys and turn it up to 11. His chief asset though is his mouth and we can see that during a virtuoso opening sequence in which he trounces a stuffy Senator (Garry Shandling) who is trying to suggest that his Iron Man suit is a WMD that needs to be in the hands of the military. He makes himself a media sensation by announcing "I have successfully privatized world peace." One person, however, doesn't agree. He is Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a disgruntled Russian physicist who is cheesed off at Stark because his late father helped develop the technology that has made Tony's family billionaires and died penniless and forgotten. He vows vengeance against his adversary and develops two cool-looking electrified whips which he intends to use to take Stark out. As played by Mickey Rourke, we see him as a ball of anger with a garbled accent, gold teeth and body marred by way too many mafia tattoos. Vanko is recruited by Jason Hammer (Sam Rockwell), an opportunist who wants to use the man's genius to steal Stark's technology.That's the main story, the personal story is actually far more interesting. Tony, you see, is dying. That thingamabob on his chest that was invented to keep him alive is slowly poisoning his blood. He tries and fails to find a cure. He keeps this information a secret from girlfriend, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and it is killing their relationship. I liked the relationship between Pepper and Tony just as much as in the original because there is real tension here. How can Pepper, who runs Stark Industries, maintain a relationship with a man who, basically, behaves like a giant parody of himself? What director John Favreau does with Iron Man 2 is keep up the pace of the original, if not the inventiveness. The movie is a red-blooded action picture all full of neat gizmos and perfect throw away moments. His action scenes are expertly handled, none better than a brilliant sequence on a racetrack in Monaco. Stark commandeers a race car that he owns only to have it sliced in half on the track by Ivan's electric whips. That sequence owns the movie for me and it cast a pall over the action scenes that follow. They aren't bad, but somehow I got the feeling that the movie played it's best hand too early.I was a little disappointed in the film's third act. The movie establishes a conflict between Tony and his late father and the conflict brewing in Ivan over his dead father but it never brings the two stories together. The third act is a loud, clanking battle but when it comes around to dealing with the personal issue, pulls up short. That doesn't make the movie bad, but it does leave you a little cold.Still Iron Man 2 is pure entertainment. You get what you pay for, no fuss no muss. It isn't perfect but it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big let down compared to the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first Iron Man movie, I must have watched it at least 20 times, maybe more. The story was well written and covered life, death, self exploration and rebirth. It was an action movie that took the time to build the story and not rely solely on slam-bam action to keep the audience's attention. Anyone who tells you that they were not moved by Yinsen's death scene is most likely not telling the truth. The audience got to know two Starks, the self indulging, selfish person and a morally correct one. With these points of reference in place, let's talk about Iron Man 2. In a nutshell, Slam, bam, thank you. What a departure from the original story. This time around, they focused on putting as much action in as possible and did as little story as possible. In fact, what little story there is insults the audience's intelligence. For example, Stark's Mark II armor is taken by Rhodey and they fight a battle to a stand still. First of all, Rhodey does not have an arc reactor chest piece. What is he using to power the suit? Second, Stark is wearing at least a Mark IV generation suit. Rhodey with a Mark II suit would have had no chance against it. Third, how did Rhodey get to be an expert using the suit? Fourth, how was a third party organization able to reverse engineer the suit so quickly and integrate other weapons?This crazy lack of logic is present throughout the story and really killed the movie for me. If you are looking for action, you will not be disappointed. The action comes on early and continues until the end. However, if you want a complete story such as with the original movie, you will probably be somewhat disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set a mere six months after the events of 2008's Iron Man, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has almost single-handedly achieved world peace. Only he is now facing opposition from Senator Stern (Garry Shandling), who is demanding he hand his weaponry over to the government, and, unbeknownst to others, is slowly dying from the palladium core in his chest designed to keep him alive. In Russia, Ivan Danko (Mickey Rourke), son of engineering genius Anton Vanko, who worked with Tony Stark's father, seeks revenge against the Stark family who caused his father's exile many years ago. He develops an arc reactor similar to Stark's, and publicly attacks him at the Circuit de Monaco, getting arrested in the process. Facing deportation and years in prison, Danko is approached by rival weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), who wants Danko to help him destroy Stark's legacy, and secure military funding.The first Iron Man was so successful mainly due to the success it brought to Tony Stark's transformation into the big red and gold suit, anchored by Downey Jr.'s magnetic central performance. Number 2 sadly does not step up the proceedings a la X2 (2003) or Spider-Man 2 (2004), which both developed the central story even further, as well as adding better characters/villains and amping up the action. Iron Man 2 disappoints on all of these fronts. Stark's gradual 'maturing' throughout the course of the first film was relatively perfect in terms of pacing and execution, but this is replaced here by Stark dealing with some dull daddy issues (although Howard Stark is played by Mad Men scene-stealer John Slattery), and Stark's concerns about his poisoning, which confuse above all else.Of the three new main additions, only Rourke's Whiplash is remotely successful, yet is kept oddly muted throughout the movie as he sets up shop in Hammer's workshop, carefully engineering a not-very-surprising attack at the upcoming Stark Expo. Hammer's over-the-top sliminess fits in with the shift in tone, moving away from the grounded feel of the first, and entering the more supernatural realm of the Avengers' world, where we have to accept intergalactic journeys and a character like Thor. Scarlett Johansson's Nastasha Romanoff does little apart from looking good in Lycra and bringing Stark into S.H.I.E.L.D., which heralds the return of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in what is nothing more than an extended cameo,So we are ultimately left with James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, this time played by Don Cheadle, who came in to replace Terrence Howard. Their relationship forms the best aspect of the film, and also leads to the best moment in the film when Rhodey finally dons a Stark suit (becoming a premature War Machine), and attempts to restrain a drunken Stark, dressed as Iron Man. It's the only scene with any real heart. Still, it's still quite fun overall, and it's interesting to watch Marvel's big plan slowly move closer together, with glimpses of Captain America's shield, the Hulk ripping it up on a news report, and Thor's hammer. When the credits rolled, I felt like I'd been slightly ripped-off by the climax, which pales in comparison even when compared to the first film. But it still left me wanting more, which can't be a bad thing.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked Iron Man 1, avoid this film. This might be worth watching if you're about to watch Avengers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent action scenes, a believable and interesting villain alongside one that you just want to hate. And what seems like half of the movie wasted on a worthless subplot that just makes you scratch your head at the stupidity of the characters involved. If you can watch this movie without thinking about any of it, it will turn out alright. It has numerous small bits that segue into the Avengers movie, but isn't really necessary to watch beforehand; still, while not a good movie on its own, could be worth watching as a marathon with the others.**Spoilers Below** When Tony Stark woke up in Iron Man 1, an electromagnet was in his chest, attached to a car battery, with the somber note that, when the battery ran out, he would die; that he has a few days of life on that battery before the end.In Iron Man 2, the entire movie plot is based around 2 elements; a relatively well executed revenge plot by one of Stark the Elder's old business partners that saves the movie; and the idea that the palladium- based reactor is toxic and slowly killing him, so he needs a new source.The latter is the serious problem with the movie, and not just a huge waste of time, but also so interconnected with the other plots in the movie that it hurts them all. We already know he doesn't need the toxic reactor to survive, if we've seen the first movie. We already know that an old rusty car battery has enough juice to keep him alive for days. Rather than just glossing over this non-issue with perhaps a brief cut-scene of him making a new reactor, or modifying some laptop battery tech and leaving his reactors in the suits, they instead go on a long, drawn-out "I'm dying and need to settle my affairs" tour, which gives a handful of decent comedy moments but otherwise just ruins what could otherwise have been an enjoyable movie. Even if they'd come up with a plausible reason for him to be dying, and then a plausible cure, this would still have damaged the movie; but not nearly as badly as simply throwing together the first piece of nonsense that came to mind. Ignoring that, the final villain bears a close resemblance to the Iron Monger from the first movie, but is still done well and different enough to be interesting. Overall; cut out many of the scenes of the movie before he completes his new toy reactor and it would be great. As-is? Strictly average, lifted slightly above by some good action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A star is born in this laugh-out-loud super comedy by the Director of Will Ferrill's "Elf"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as directer Favreau's "Elf" is Will Ferrill's crowning achievement to date, so it is clear that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark in his latest offering "Iron Man 2". This film's success proves there are a lot of people on antidepressants. If you like Will Ferrell's shtick, you'll unquestioably love Robert Downey Jr.Take two parts "ELF", add "The Dark Night", then subtract the former, shake it up in a blender. And the result is IRONMAN 2! OK! I agree that former SNL members have come up with family entertainers aplenty but there are some movies which may not be famous but can be very entertaining and may contain a hidden social messages that may not dawn on a lot of marble heads. If Robert Downey Jr. ever joined up with the SNL cast, we could say this is one such movie.With the blockbuster status of "Elf", Favs is evolved into one of the superlative comedic directors of our generation. The star of "Elf" is not doing too shabby himself. And why not! He is probably the funniest entertainer working in show business. I am not "toying" with you! Of course, I am referring to Will Ferrell. His performance as Buddy, the lanky nitwit raised by elves who is now on a quest to find &amp; bond with his biological father, was the paramount laugh riot work of 2003.There is a lot of excellently choreographed conversations in the film, along with excellent dialogue and talking scenes. If you have an interest in any of those fields, you will probably love this film. Tony Stark is now the stuff of legend. Think Sandler as Big Daddy. Schneider as Deuce Bigalow. Chris Farley as Beverly Hills Ninja. John Candy as the Blue Brother. Steve Carell as The 40 Year Old Virgin. Ben Stiller as Starsky &amp; Hutchins. And perhaps most appropriate here, Ferril as 'Buddy'.Final Word: A MUST watch!</fullReview>

Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts, and James "Rhodey" Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances - and confront powerful enemies....The sequel to the surprise hit of the other summer was always going to be hard work, and while it's nowhere near as good as the original, it was one of the better summer movies to be released last year, and to be fair 2010 was one of the worst years ever for summer blockbusters.If it wasn't for RDJ being the lead, this would have failed big time. Every other member of the cast appears to be on auto pilot, and it's just a great move of Favreau to include him in almost every single shot or scenario.The set pieces are a little bigger, but the best ones are used int he first half of the movie (the briefcase scene, and the birthday party).The rest of the film is Stark dealing with his inner demons and trying to fight his illness, which for an event film Can get a little boring at times.Rourke is okay as Danko, but he overdoes the Russian theatrics and does very little after using his lightsaber whips. Rockwell isn't on form in this, and i couldn't take him seriously because of the amount of fake tan on his hands.But there is still fun to be had. The chemistry between Stark and Potts is amazing and Jackson gets an extended cameo as Fury.There are also nods to Captain America and Thor, but very one knows that by now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back To Earth With A Sorry Bump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was a great film and it was obvious a sequel was coming. Usually, I sigh when studios see the dollars rolling in and go sequel mad but for once I thought a follow-up would be good. For once, there was not only room for a sequel and plenty of inspiration to draw from the comic books but the characters and scenario were there and begging to be developed and shaped into a superb Iron Man 2.However, Iron Man 2 fails to hit the same heady heights that the first film rocketed to. In short, the plot is convoluted, the characters fail to charm (perhaps excluding Mickey Rourke's Whiplash) and the action scenes are fairly boring and predictable. Also, whilst the first film had a steady dose of good humour (in particular, the disaster prone helper robots), Iron Man 2's laughs are very hit and miss. I don't count special effects as a positive any more. It's such a given nowadays and anyway, good special effects do not a good film make. Special FX is just the icing on the cake. Iron Man 2 has top FX but I have to say 'so what?'My main three grievances concern character, plot and climatic ending. Tony Stark is supposed to be a self-centred, egotistical fellow and this was well balanced with his more heroic qualities in Iron Man. He was a rich arms dealer at last finding redemption and and coming out from the warmongering shadow of his father.But in Iron Man 2, the negative traits are taken to unbearably obnoxious levels. Yes, maybe this is in line with his comic book character but surely you need your main character to be somewhat likable. In Iron Man 2, Stark is an annoying spoilt brat and not the lovable rogue that was so well crafted and acted in Iron Man. In particular, I thought the fall-out fight between Stark and Rhodey did neither character any favours. It was also fairly ridiculous- here are two friends on the verge of killing each other because Rhodey thinks Stark should stop partying.The film seems more concerned with setting up the 'Avengers' movie than actually being in itself a good film. I'm all for interlinking all the Marvel franchises but this should be a secondary objective. The priority should be to make a good film and then throw in a few nods/references/set-ups for sequels and spin-offs such as the 'Avengers'. The substory about Tony's illness and his eventual discovery of a cure is poorly executed. The film probably tries to do too much (the rise of Whiplash, Stark's problems with the government, SHIELD, Stark's illness and so on). Two of the characters carried over from the first film fail to carry their good form over. For Pepper Potts this is because she is largely relegated to the background in favour of Scarlett Johansson (who I don't like in this film). I don't whether the change of actor, the plot or the script ensured Rhodey was something of a dud but unfortunately, that's what he was- a dud.Plus Jon Faveau seemed to decide that his slight cameo role as Happy Hogan in Iron Man wasn't enough and gives himself a lot more screen time in this film. I don't think this was necessary.As for the main bad guy, I like Mickey Rourke and his character is fairly good. However, he's following a very tough act in the brilliant Obediah Stane (Jeff Bridges on top form) from Iron Man. In comparison, Whiplash comes off second best to the insidiously sinister snake that is the treacherous Stane. But that's no fault of Rourke's and, if anything, I think he should had more of a role in this film.In Iron Man, I thought the final battle was superb and actually felt that it wouldn't have hurt to have stretched it out a little (plus final blow was probably a little underwhelming). In Iron Man 2, the final confrontation between Iron Man (&amp; War Machine) and Whiplash lasts all of a minute (at the very most) and the final blow is terrible. Whiplash had about ten seconds to do something about it but simply stood there and got beat.Iron Man 2 is not a bad film. However, it fails to build upon the fantastic foundations set by Iron Man. When compared directly to its predecessor, Iron Man 2 does not fare well- which is shame. The first film actually exceeded my expectations, Iron Man 2 disappointed me. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumping the Stark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first IRON MAN movie was a planet-crusher. IRON MAN 2, well, maybe it could crush a small moon or something. It's still a full-fledged, fun-filled ferrous romp, but, like all superhero sequels, suffers from cramming us with characters and classic story lines in its desperate need to impress. My hole feels stretched. Not in that good way either.IRON MAN 2 opens in exhilaration: over AC/DC's Shoot To Thrill, Iron Man jets through night skies over city lights, camera/we on his steel shoulders, feeling the weight of the armor, the gut-thumping power of the afterburners in his boots, inhaling the burning breeze as he plummets like a missile into a packed amphitheater, landing onstage in a pose that can only be described as THOOM! You don't applaud an entrance like that. You throw panties.Machines clack his costume off his body as an Iron Chick chorus line (in tiny faux-metal undies) dances behind him. Billionaire playboy Tony Stark emerges (Robert Downey Jr., once again bringing his breezy brio) to open the Stark Technology Expo.Half a world away, in a dank Russian lab with no windows, Ivan Vanko (scary Mickey Rourke, body-tatted like Motley Crue and still pumped from his WRESTLER role like a balloon float gone awry) plots revenge on Stark for Stark's dad stealing tech ideas from Ivan's dad. He becomes supervillain Whiplash and scares everyone by carving Tony's racing car in half with his electric whips and showing off his puffy muscles.Everyone wants a piece of the Iron. Garry Shandling, excellent as a snide congressman, impotently orders Stark - who doesn't take him seriously - to turn over the Iron Man technology to the military; while sleazy Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the government's tech bitch, tries to duplicate the armor for military use, i.e. killing. (Of what other use is the military?) Hammer allies with Whiplash to unleash an army of robots which ultimately keeps the effects team up all night rendering CGI Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's military liaison and best friend. And gets to kick ass as the heavily-armed "second Iron Man" called War Machine.Stark's power source has been updated from the comic books: he used to plug into the wall like a regular old toaster, but here he has power cells that click into his chest piece - the same chest piece which keeps his heart beating yet is killing him softly through blood toxicity. Desperately seeking a cure, Stark nonetheless becomes fatalistic and bequeaths Stark Industries to his blond helper Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, forever pining after the playboy she will never have), and stumbles upon the alcoholism plot point very conveniently.And this is where the film stumbles as well. In the Marvel comicbook series, serious plot arcs like alcoholism gestate and develop over weeks or months ("Demon in a Bottle" was first published in 1979, then Stark fell off the wagon proper in 1983, forcing James Rhodes to don the Iron Man armor, precipitating War Machine), lending the story gravitas and "realism." While in IRON MAN 2, Stark goes lush, Rhodey croaks the damning key line, "You don't deserve the suit!" and commandeers the War Machine armor all in a few hot minutes, making it seem, well - ironically - like a comicbook. Or at least what people think comicbooks are - shallow, vacuous and unrealistic.I wrestled for a long time with the problem of why IRON MAN 2 is not as effective, not as compelling a film as the first one, and I realized: this A-list feature film falls into the shark-jumping phenomenon of the Cousin Oliver Syndrome - introducing new characters to replace well-worn ones. But this is only the second IRON MAN movie - we haven't yet grown bored of the original characters! And none of them have aged enough to look as bloated as Cindy Brady.Shark-Jumping: younger, sexier assistant in the form of Natasha (Scarlett Johanssen); a second Iron Man (War Machine); Avengers Initiative foreshadowing at every turn; Sam Jackson as Nick Fury, with so few lines of exposition they could have been said by anyone on a smaller salary; Captain America's shield; Thor's mighty Mjolnir, post-credits; 50 other Iron Men flying around making my CGI nerve twitch.I'm sick of them telling me that I'm sick of characters - when I'm not! I would have loved more scenes with Sam Rockwell spouting his inimitable patter; would have relished more turbo-charges like the opening flying scene and what we wouldn't give for more Russian-tainted cheese with mighty Mickey and his puffy muscles! The climactic battle between Whiplash and the two iron men is robbed of its impact by having to put Mickey Rourke into an Iron Suit and then on top of that ignominy, to have him remove his mask so that we can see him (the Spider-Man Mask-Removing Syndrome - ensure the ignorant audience knows who is behind the mask and then ensure the dumb dumb dumb audience can see the emotions on his face).Movie ends with a true metal song, with a true metal singer - Bon Scott's true AC/DC, Highway To Hell.Despite its overwrought overpandering, from its titanium thunderware to its tiny metal underwear, IRON MAN 2 delivers, but says nothing we haven't heard before in loud metal clanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the eye-popping special effects front and center, we need to again delve beneath the surface and figure what separates this from other blockbuster superhero movies. This is a fairly captivating effort, but it doesn't really advance things that much. I suppose Robert Downey looked tired because he was, after all, dying in the film, but I also got that little bit of smugness that comes from walking through the part. Still, there's a great villain who can match well and some great technology to keep things interesting. One of the demands of this is to make your protagonist somewhat vulnerable. It falls just a bit short at times in catching us. Still, I liked the byplay and the fun and don't regret having seen it. I liked the first much better because it has a more sophisticated plot and substructure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say I LOVED the first Iron Man movie. it has wit, charisma, charm, and a lot of awesome action. Sadly the same cannot be said of this sequel.While I am willing to go a long way for a Marvel movie, I just felt bored watching this. The film moves from one very tedious scene to another, and the actual scenes with Iron Man in are few and far between as the movie seems to focus mainly on Tony Stark's problems, scattering a light dusting of Scarlett Johansson in along the way to keep the male members of the audience entertained.The main villain of the piece played by Mickey Rourke is shown as being somewhat without motive in his hatred of Iron Man, and Don Cheadle appears lost somewhere in this huge mess.Over all, I had looked forward to seeing this on DVD for months, and when I finally did, I felt very disappointed by the drifting plot and by the numbers characters. Better than watching a blank screen - but only just.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This movie was an totally awesome movie". Thats what my 7 year old niece told me. Need I say more? I tried to sit down and watch this movie and good lord it was not easy. At least scarlet johanson was in this, too bad her wardrobe did not keep me interested enough, maybe a little ass shots or something would have kept me watching but nope. All this was, was a big movie corporation making more money off kids with nothing but crap. In fact part one wasn't that bad compared to this one. Although to tell you the truth I didn't even finish watching this movie. So if it has a killer ending with a twist you would not believe then Im sorry. But Im sure the ending is just as horrible as the first hour that I sat through. I give this crapfest 2 shwag blunts down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2010's bigger disappointments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the original Iron Man remains one of my most purely exuberant movie-going experiences of the last five years. I laughed, I cheered, I applauded at the end, and I still had a grin plastered on my face hours later. In fact, I loved watching Iron Man in theaters so much that I intentionally haven't rewatched it since and have no plans to do so ? I'm sure I'd still enjoy it, but I simply don't want to dilute that fond memory by noticing any deficiencies the movie may actually have. I don't have any immediate plans to rewatch Iron Man 2 either. But not for the same reasons.When I first saw the full Iron Man 2 trailer, which featured multiple villains, Lt. Colonel Rhodes robot-suiting up, Nick Fury setting up the future Avengers movie, and Scarlett Johansson doing something inexplicable, I thought it looked like a mess. And sometimes the trailer is honest: Iron Man 2 is a mess. A slick, polished, and amusing mess, mind you, with a predictably quirky and awesome leading performance from Robert Downey Jr., but still a mess. It's mystifying to me why so many of the same nerds who were enraged by Spider-Man 3 seem ready to die in defense of Iron Man 2, because the two movies have damn near the exact same problems with crowded story lines and one too many villains.Iron Man 2 is all over the place, breathlessly trying to tell its own cluttered story while simultaneously shuffling pieces towards the future Avengers flick. To the movie's credit it doesn't pull a Matrix Reloaded or a Dead Man's Chest and end with "to be continued," it's self-contained and can be watched on its own, but in every other respect it's one of the messiest flicks I've seen in years, with nearly every scene seeming to pick up with a completely disparate storyline from the one preceding it.The trailer actually left out one of the biggest plot threads: Tony Stark is dying, his blood poisoned by the power reactor in his chest. So he hands Stark Industries over to his assistant Pepper Potts and focuses on being Iron Man full-time, but after revealing his identity at the end of the first film the United States government is trying to get him to hand over the Iron Man weapon, an unscrupulous arms manufacturer named Justin Hammer plots to best Tony's designs, a crazy Russian named Ivan Vanko cuts even more to the chase by just planning to build a better suit and kill Tony to death with it, and Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson groom Stark for future opportunities on the superhero team they're putting together. Oh, and Tony feuds with his friend Rhodey. And has some alcohol problems, and copes with daddy issues, and of course has a romantic subplot. Holy overstuffed two hours, Iron Man!"That's okay," you say to yourself. "It's a summer action flick, I ain't in this for grand storytelling, I'm in this for all the action!" Well, I hate to tell you this, but there are only three action scenes in Iron Man 2's 124-minute runtime. Three, all of them robot suit-on-robot suit battles. The final one is admittedly a lengthy blow-out, but nothing in these fight scenes really begins to compare in vibrance, energy, or creativity with the train scene in Spider-Man 2, the Batmobile chase in the middle of The Dark Knight, or even Stark's escape from imprisonment in the original Iron Man. Robot suit men just punch and shoot at one another. Fun, sure, but nothing remotely spectacular.But as I said above the movie is still deftly carried in spite of everything else by Robert Downey Jr. What else is there to say? Dude rules. One of the best actors alive. Makes every line entertaining, makes silence captivating, generates chemistry with every other actor on screen no matter how little they may offer him in return. Tony Stark is a more flamboyant and probably more purely entertaining figure than any other on screen superhero we've seen, thanks much more to Downey Jr. than to the script, and I hate to even imagine what the movie would be like without him.The rest of the cast doesn't fare as well outside of the also awesome Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. Mickey Rourke seems bored as Ivan Vanko, his dialogue agonizingly drawled in a goofball Russian accent, Scarlett Johansson is never good outside of Woody Allen movies, and as sincerely shocking as this is to me, Don Cheadle as Rhodey is a clear downgrade from Terrence Howard in the original film. The critics, confused by the fact that Don Cheadle is usually a wonderful actor, pretended like this wasn't the case, but it is. Howard brought a certain spark to the character; I still remember his reading of the line "Next time, baby" two years later. Don Cheadle just phones it in, dry, flat, and devoid of any personality. Couldn't remember any of his lines a week later.So should you check out Iron Man 2? If you wanna see some dumb, pulpy fun with some laughs, some robot fights, and an immensely charming leading performance, sure, go for it. It's vastly inferior to the original (and, for that matter, Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes), but harmless enough, and if you see it stay through the end credits, because like the original film there's a secret scene at the end setting up the Avengers. But please, if you're only going to see one superhero movie from 2010, make it the far superior Kick-Ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark, A Self-Made Man Who Worships His Creator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, Iron Man 2, not during but after I saw it, made me ponder. It made me wonder about the endlessly precarious concept of privatizing the military. Look at the dangers we've witnessed, ones that have come true that we've taken lying down, of privatizing our health care system, our news sources, energy, mortgage associations. Tony Stark, apparently the coolest, hottest, richest and most famous guy on earth, after acquiring most of what he has as a war profiteer---as fans know and as the first movie tells us---he now has an unbelievable weapon that he wears and uses for long-distance transportation and frankly for fun. The government wants it, but it's his suit and he insists on doing whatever he wants with it. I'm not so sure I blame the government.Couldn't something that wreaks the kind of havoc that the Iron Man suit does be put to more productive and controlled use under the supervision of the people and their representatives? I look at Tony Stark and see---can't evade---a man in less discernible control of his ego than five Kanye Wests. Also, a man that rich is going to do anything, because he's confident he can---and he will---get away with anything. Yes, Stark is made out to be one swell guy, saving us from the danger of another guy in a weapon suit, even though that guy only really seems interested in hurting Mr. Yay Free Enterprise Stark, but he's Russian so we don't like him, so there's your reason for his being the bad guy. I feel we should spend less time rooting for Iron Man and being warier of his lack of discipline, natural monopoly and concentration of assets as he provokes more danger than he's worth. But hey, I'm not suggesting Stark apply for statehood; his ego already has anyway.I honestly really do go into colossal Hollywood blockbusters wanting to like them. I want to enjoy myself and admire the movie I'm enjoying. The most admirable quality of Iron Man 2 is the most admirable quality of Iron Man 1, which is that in spite of whether or not characters are hackneyed or effects are overblown and tedious, the rapport between the performers is always engaging, natural and razor-sharp. Naturally, the movie was pre-sold by Downey's charm. The movie has an enormously effective non-sequitary sense of humor that delivers huge laughs by undercutting any zeal. These big CGI set pieces, after all, take a whole lot of logic for granted. This example seems unanimous among viewers: Tony Stark, seemingly on impulse and out of nowhere, chooses to drive his own car in the Monaco Grand Prix, and Ivan Vanko mounts dauntlessly in the middle of the strip, dressed like a deviant jouster and sporting electric whips that can slice a car in two. He nearly destroys Stark, which is so thrilling that we almost overlook questions such as how Vanko knew that Tony suddenly decided to drive his own car in a race he wasn't even attending personally to begin with, or why in the hell the crowd does not flee but stays to collectively react throughout this cataclysmic fight like they're at a football game.The absolute highlight of the film is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, the classic Pushover Up To No Good. In a movie not only brimming with star ego but star ego that could cut diamond at a thirty-foot distance, Rockwell is pure refreshment. He is always a completely natural actor, as much himself as a character will allow him to be. In all, it seems as if the script is trying to make him all weasel, all antagonist, and Rockwell defies any two-dimensionality by making him, yes, a weasel, yes, an antagonist, but also a whole person. His way is by being laid-back and without affectation.Nonetheless, the dialogue scenes are so effective and enjoyable that when an action sequence comes around, it only inspires me to think about how the guys can stand it within those suits. Yes, the suits are shatterproof, but their bodies aren't. How many staggering plummets, ferocious poundings and sly detonators can you withstand without shattering all of your bones? Wouldn't the weight of being encased in iron make the blows hit harder? Stars can be acceptable as to need the skeletal least character in the story. They're watched for their own sake, not for their representation of a scripted character. It's about the cast itself, not what it's doing here. We love Don Cheadle, but largely what he's given to actually do here is oddly find time to chat with Downey while soaring through a typhoon of assailing missiles. (How slow must a missile be if your crony has time to advise you to steer clear of it?) I don't know what it says about Scarlet Johansson's quality as an actress that she's upstaged by her own backside. But she's given good performances in great films, and I think the issue has more to do with Jon Favreau's preferred camera angles and my being a guy.The vainglorious behavior comes naturally, but now it's advantageous as a put-on, a case of mistaken nonentity. The sequel to Iron Man does not offer a changed man. Within the hardware, impaired humanity becomes even more so, as inviting challenges of selfhood cross with a high-tech wet dream made everyman. I guess there are lot of young men who need icons like Iron Man. Narcissism and self-deception are survival mechanisms without which many of them might just jump off a bridge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PROSI loved the pacing, editing, cinematography, musical score, and all the other technical aspects of the storytelling.All of the actors were top-notch. While, I think Terrence Howard looks more like Rhodey than Don Cheadle, Don was better at acting the part. My GF, pointed out well for me. They both played various aspects of the character perfectly, and if you could combine the two performances, you'd get the perfect Rhodes. Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko was GREAT! This movie combined elements of Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo into one villain. And I was so glad to see them do it well. Especially the Dynamo suit Rourke wears.The other actors/actresses did as well as they did in the first movie. RDJ was perfect yet again, but more-so. Dealing with his "illness" and his alcoholism, and semi-depression. And all the stuff with his father. They beefed up Fury's involvement, which was very cool, and necessary to the plot this time.The character interactions, the action, the dialogue, the comedic timing of the humor was all top-notch.AND THE ENDING! Stay for after the credits!! I was so happy! It was the perfect set-up for future entries in the Marvel Movie Universe.CONSScarlett Johansson LOOKED the part. But she was way too "nice", and not hard-edged enough for her role, and I understand that it's PG-13, but she NEVER USED HER GUNS. And NO ACCENT. Come on folks.. she's Russian. Mickey Rourke affected an accent and learned to speak some Russian, and INSISTED on speaking Russian during the movie. COME ON!Justin Hammer was written wrong. He was funny, and offered great entertainment. But he's supposed to a sort of secret underworld crime-boss and a devious evil mastermind, of sorts. Not a fidgety, goofy bad-guy wannabe that gets caught.The final battle was over way too Fast! It was easily one of the shortest face-offs I've ever seen in a movie. His attack drones got a longer fight than him! WTF!? CONCLUSIONI LOVED everything else about this movie, except for the few complaints I listed. But because I had complaints, I can't give it a perfect score. Still, one of the very best comic book movie adaptations to date. And one of the best movies I've seen, in its own right as well.Great stuff! Overall, I'd have to give it a 9 out of 10. Not perfect, but damn close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitiously Bigger, but Better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My memories of the original "Iron Man" are generally limited to the notion that I had a good time watching it, and that, for a big-screen translation of a popular comic-book property, it was more cohesive and clever (and boasting a far finer cast) than its less-successful Marvel brethren (think "The Punisher" and "Incredible Hulk"). While it didn't come close to touching "The Dark Knight" (which is probably an unfair comparison for two wildly different superheroes), it was entertaining in a breezy, thrilling manner that got good mileage out of Robert Downey Jr.'s infectious, snarky charisma. "Iron Man 2" continues this cycle with consistent results: the action sequences are frantic and fast-paced without being incoherent; the cast well-chosen (with a barnstorming Mickey Rourke stealing the show); and the integration of CGI convincingly rendered. As both a continuation of the plot threads and character arcs in the original and as a standalone film, "Iron Man 2" is a solid, consistently entertaining effort that cements one-time indie darling Jon Favreau (who wrote and starred in the cult classic "Swingers") as the directorial antithesis of Michael Bay's sloppy, migraine-inducing action style. That being said, there is a nagging sense of lack within the proceedings, as though screenwriter Justin Theroux ("Tropic Thunder"), in an attempt to outdo the original, crammed in as many characters and subplots as possible simply to keep the film busy; while there are many Howard Hawks-ian comedic exchanges that recall the screwball comedies of the 1940s and '50s (many belonging to Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts), there are just as many characters who feel less than necessary (despite their considerable appeal, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson don't have much bearing on the film's outcome). If "Iron Man 2" is flawed for this reason alone, then that still makes it better (and certainly more ambitious) than most of this summer's blockbuster fodder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's decent entertainment but also a bit of a lazy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved the first Iron Man. It looked silly in the previews, but it turned out to an almost perfect mix of comedy, action and story/character development. With great anticipation I awaited this second installment..only to be mildly disappointed.Iron Man 2 doesn't stray too far from the successful formula of its predecessor, but for some reason it doesn't really add up.At least I am sure that the action is not to blame; there is a lot more of it this time around, and for the most part it is spectacular.There is still plenty of humor around as well, but Iron Man 2's track record isn't flawless here. While most of the jokes are pretty good, a significant portion does fall flat. Robert Downey still does a brilliant job, but Sam Rockwell's character, while well-acted, is annoying in a very non-funny way.But the biggest problem this time around is that all the jokes and the action don't really add up til a memorable tale. You never really get the idea that there is much at stake or that the narrative is going anywhere. The plot jumps through all the familiar hoops but nothing is really fleshed out. As a case in point, Mickey Rourke is totally wasted as the bad guy.Also, I am getting really tired of the phenomenon that a movie seems to exist solely as a commercial for the next installment in the series....half of the running time of Iron Man seems to be a commercial for the upcoming Avengers movie.Iron Man 2 offers enough action and jokes to provide two hours of fairly solid entertainment..but unlike the first part, it's not more than the sum of its parts. Not all of the humor works, and in terms of characters and story it feels lazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I guess it's the best superhero sequel blockbuster of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iron Man films might be my fourth favorite superhero franchise, behind Nolan's revision of Batman, the X-Men series, and the Spiderman trilogy. I enjoyed Iron Man 2 for three reasons: the strong cast, the special effects, and Robert Downey Jr. Reprising his role as Tony Stark, Downey uses his natural wittiness to maximum effect. At times though, he just comes across as a pompous asshole. His nonchalant approach to acting is entertaining to watch and makes me think he's just being himself in the roles he chooses. That being said, there's a lot of flaws and clichés in this film. Unfortunately, with these big budget blockbusters, the studio puts too many constraints on the director. Too much time is allocated to action scenes and there's way too many characters for the audience to have to care about. As with the latest Batman movies, an important supporting character had to be replaced by a similar and more talented actor than the first installment. I really hate when that happens! Iron Man 2's cast is the best I've seen in a superhero movie. Aside from Downey, the rest of thecast includes: Mickey Rourke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell, and Samuel L. Jackson. Since none of them get enough screen-time and are given nothing to really work with here,their talents go to waste. The plot is basically just more of the same from the first. Instead of showing how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, we now get to see how he maintains being Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow returns to her role of Stark's primary love interest and Scarlett Johansson plays Stark's new personal assistant. It's a shame that Scarlett is only in this movie for her sex appeal. She deserves more screen-time and a better script to work with. The two most fascinating characters are the antagonists played by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell. Rourke plays a crazed Russian hellbent on revenge against Stark. He's a very intimidating and interesting character. Too bad the only things we know about him is that he has a genuine love for his father and pet bird. Rockwell, playing Stark's rival Justin Hammer, is very entertaining to watch. He has perfected the art of being a douche and the results are quite convincing.Recently, one of my favorite actors has been Don Cheadle. He replaces actor Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, Lt. Colonel James Rhodes. This role is so meaningless that they could have found any African-American actor to play it. As with all big-budget films, a recognizable face is all that matters. For Iron Man 2, they just happened to get the popular actors who actually do have talent. That brings me to Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Why is he in this movie? The answer comes in 2012, in the form of another big-budget superhero movie titled "The Avengers." Iron Man 2 is merely the platform for introducing another huge blockbuster to the masses. These Hollywood producers and executives are smart. They don't care about bringing down the quality of one film in order to create awareness for the next. Iron Man 2 will rake in tons of money regardless of how convoluted the story becomes. More time should have been devoted toward the central plot instead of wandering off into subplots. This film would have been stronger without the additions of Scarlett's and Sam's characters. The overkill doesn't go unnoticed by everyone.I thought the first half of Iron Man 2 picked up where the first one left off. The second half got a little sloppy. The end battle scene was anticlimactic and somewhat of a letdown. It's almost like the writer ran out of ideas and settled for a disappointingly lazy climax. The first confrontation was more exciting than the last. Don't get me started on how laughable a certain (over-choreographed) fight scene is near the end of the film. It's unbelievably unconvincing and feels like it was just thrown in there to let it be known that this certain character is a bad-ass.Even with all of the negatives involved with Iron Man 2, the pros still outweigh the cons. This is a solid popcorn film that aims to entertain. The stingy film critics who don't recommend Iron Man 2 would be lying if they said there's nothing to enjoy here. It's entertaining the whole way through and provides a few laughs. The talented lead actor and director, Jon Favreau, understand that Iron Man is much more engaging without his mask on. For fun and entertainment, Iron Man is your superhero.</fullReview>

The film does have it's shortcomings though.Like the first film,it does go all Transformers towards the end and it doesn't take long for CGI to bore but the chemistry of the cast and the fun being had does go a long way to paper over those particular cracks. Scarlet Johansson is introduced for no other reason than she looks great in a tight leather outfit. Gwyneth Paltrow also turns up without offering much more. Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard as Col Rhodes which is a shame for the continuity but on the whole the film fizzes with fun and thus delivers the very thing its target audience pay for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very first thing that bothered me about this show was...In Ironman 2008, they could not build the mini arc reactor. In 2010 some Russian could without any help from anyone.I have been a avid fan of Ironman since the late '60s and what I have seen in both movies is plain and simple garbage.1) Tony still has his normal heart and does not need a electromagnet to keep pieces of metal from entering his heart! Point and fact is, if anyone is really interested sooner or later all the metal pieces would have been picked up very soon IF he had a magnet within his chest cavity.2) Ironmans' armour is run on SOLAR ENERGY..not ARC energy, tho he does have a reserve (backup) in case of trouble 3) There is a Pepper Potts in Tonys' life....but not as a lover or a possible lover 4) Warmachine was not even a glint in Ironmans eye until Ironman #118 5) The movie would have been acceptable but too many scene cuts happened. The "memoriesof Vanko" just didn't help us at all. I read what the plot was suppose to be, unfortunately the producers didn't think it was worthy. Too bad,because as far as I am concerned it would have made a mediocre movie into a plausible oneAll in all I found this movie to be less than satisfactory the main reason being the film was trying to get us to believe Tony Stark was dying and a alcoholic retard (which he proved on his birthday) With great power comes great responsibility, a quote from Incle Ben (spiderman) Btw Ironman was one of the original Avengers for a reason...and the Avengers fought S.H.I.E.L.D. tooth and nail. The Avengers had no agenda S.H.I.E.L.D. did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original entry in this Marvel Comics-derived superhero franchise was one of the best and most enjoyable among the myriad such adaptations to have emerged in recent years. Consequently, I had great expectations for its follow-up (especially since this was afforded a considerably bigger budget) but, while certainly not a bad film per se, it proved by and large a disappointment!To be fair to it, the jaded nature of the whole was actually inherent in the plot ? but sometimes it was still taken too far: for instance, Robert Downey Jr.'s alcohol-fueled dance to the disco-beat in full 'Iron Man' attire; similarly, why on Earth would a Scientific Expo necessitate the speaker (in this case, geeky Sam Rockwell) to arrive on stage to the rhythm of pop music?! And what is up with that anti-climactically brief and unimaginative final confrontation between heroes and villain? Other aspects of the storyline, then, were unconvincing (Mickey Rourke's technological prowess or, for that matter, Don Cheadle's ? who is able to take on the guise of 'Iron Man 2' {sic} at the bat of an eye-lid!), messy (all of the hero's various complexes ? personal, physical and emotional) or otherwise drew unwarranted attention to themselves (Scarlett Johansson's apparently effortless expertise at aerial martial-arts ? which, ever since THE MATRIX series, has come to be a prerequisite of action movies). Besides, while I know Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury subplot, which here overlaps into the main narrative rather than being relegated to the after-credits sequence ? incidentally, a good part of the audience stayed behind for it this time around! ? is intended as a transition between the various superhero flicks already released or else are in the pipeline, I cannot help feeling it stretched out the proceedings unnecessarily!As for the rest, it was pretty much par for the course: a plethora of effects-laden mayhem (at their best during the Monaco Grand Prix, where the grudge-bearing and electricity-charged whip-wielding Rourke first confronts Tony Stark/'Iron Man'; the one-on-one between Downey Jr. and Cheadle at the former's mansion; and the climax in which they combat an army of similar robots ? which the power-hungry Rockwell has built ? as well as the 'geared-up' Rourke himself) and cynical wisecracks (with the hero lashing self-destructively as much at overbearing authority figures as his own most intimate collaborators, including a returning Gwyneth Paltrow).In the end, my lukewarm reaction to the film has not dulled my interest in an eventual second sequel as such: after all, the third SPIDER-MAN and fourth X-MEN entries in each respective franchise were, likewise, definite come-downs from their predecessors?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor Spoilers Follow After witnessing Iron Man back 2008, Iron Man 2 was met with lots of high hopes and people got what you usually get to MOST sequels of superhero movies (The Dark Knight and X2 are exceptions); a very entertaining follow-up but with story sacrificed for more action.From the battles between Iron Man and his new villain to scenes meant for showcasing Tony Stark's uber-awesome tech, pretty much everything in the original Iron Man that involved special effects was increased in the sequel. The movie does not fail to entertain with its well executed action scenes that end with explosions blowing scrap metal all over the scenery. Word of advise about those action scenes; while very cool, be prepared if you're not used to heavy gunfire and the crunching of metal. This movie is VERY NOISY. But metal suits, bullets and lasers aside, not much is left. The script is still as funny and witty as the original but in terms of depth, Iron Man 2 loses the substance that made the first Iron Man more than just a superhero film.New characters like a well played Whiplash and Black Widow (who was more of a waste of time and eye candy) are introduced but without much character in them, rendering them forgettable. Hammers and Nick Fury are cool but a little more screen time would've helped. The recurring characters don't do much in the sequel either; Pepper Potts' and Rhodes' roles have both been shrunk to almost irrelevant until the final parts of the film. Actually, the entire movie seems to be more of a one man show for Robert Downey Jr. Majority of the story involves him talking to or talking back at people or doing some bad-ass fighting while doing all those mentioned before. While RDJ does another great job as Stark, everyone else has been pretty much forgotten, which isn't fair.The story, on the other hand is a bit of a mess. Characters are introduced with little to no concrete motive at all, especially on the part of the villains. While they have the usual motives (revenge, greed, etc.), these are too simple or badly explained to be able to relate with. Speaking about motive, Tony Stark's motive has got to be the most messed up one of all in the movie. While in part one, the whole "Iron Man" thing was Tony Stark's redemption as an arms dealer, in part two, well, I don't really know what he was fighting for. You've got daddy issues, Tony's coming death, redeeming himself for going wild on his party, fixing a busted reputation, stopping Hammers because he's a complete idiot and stopping Whiplash's revenge scheme. Really, it was such a mess that you wouldn't really remember what Tony really was fighting for. So yeah, Iron Man 2 is definitely more shallow and messed up compared to its predecessor but unlike most summer films, it's still worth watching.Just don't go in expecting it to be the sequel that everyone wants; this is just a simpler version of part one with a LOT of special effects thrown in. And if you want to know, keep watching as there is a very interesting scene after the credits roll. And a minor complaint about Hammers from my friends and I: How could a nerdy arms dealer named Hammers not use any references to MC Hammer after acting like a retard on the stage of the Stark Expo (the dancing entrance)?? Seriously, it would've been kinda funny if he was yelling "HAMMER TIME" or something when showcasing his Hammer-Drones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cool genre cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Russia, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) grieves when his father dies but he is left with a blueprint to the arc reactor from Stark Industries. Given his father's dispute with Howard Stark, Ivan decides to build his own reactor that will empower his to take down Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and his Iron Man suit. Back in the USA Tony is being pressured by the US Government to hand over the suit, even though it is being used as a means of holding a truce between America and its adversaries. Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is a rival arms dealer who is also intent on getting his hands on Tony's invention too as he has failed regularly to replicate the machine's design. Yet Tony is more concerned about how is heart is being poisoned by the device in his chest, placing further strains on his relationships with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle). Tony is further intrigued by the arrival of the mysterious Natalie (Scarlett Johansson), who is helping Tony with the legal assignment of handing over his CEO position to Pepper.The first Iron Man stands as one of the very best superhero films because of its emphasis on character, in developing a highly unconventional protagonist, rather than simply relying on the limited appeal of visual effects. Director Jon Favreau has returned to this sequel, which offers more of the same fun and action but with some slightly bloated results too. What is missing at the heart of this film is the subtext and political undertones that made the first movie a lot smarter and more sophisticated than cynics may have been expecting. The criticism of America's arms trading policies allowed for the growth of Tony Stark, in realising the destruction his company was responsible for. Thematically, Iron Man 2 is weaker than its predecessor because it clings to thin ideas of legacy and competition to support its narrative. There are moments in this film which do not make a lot of sense, but for the sake of most fans, exist to provide the spectacle. Tony's random entry into the Grand Prix race for example is simply to have a showdown with Ivan and it remains a silly but still intense match-up. There are also too many subplots here, most specifically the inclusion of a secret organisation called S.H.I.E.L.D, and several twists and turns, highlighting how the first film said so much more with a far tighter narrative and less characters.For some of the flaws in the narrative, there is no shortage of style here, courtesy of the sheer cool factor provided by Tony Stark himself. Stark, surrounded by his fast cars and futuristic gadgetry, is as cheeky, funny and likable as ever. Downey Jr. overshadows all of his co-stars with the sheer amount of charisma and charm that he possesses. He really holds this film together with his belief in the confidence and slickness of this unique character he has created. His chemistry with Pepper also continues to be one of the film's most endearing elements as they exchange fire, word for word, with some witty banter and precise timing. Yet given that their emotional entanglement is largely unmentioned for much of the film this is not as romantic as the first instalment. Mickey Rourke also impresses here and through the attention to detail in the look of his character, like his matted hair and tattoos, he creates a highly sinister villain. Rourke not only learnt Russian for this role but it has also been reported that he also spent time in a Russian prison to gain a greater feel for his character. Rockwell is slightly disappointing as Hammer because although he is as wordy as ever, with charisma to burn, his flamboyance is less endearing as it has been in the past. The weakest links in the cast are Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson simply because they do not have enough to do in the film. The latter is so luminous and successfully fills her eye candy quotient but her character really only comes to the foray in a rather stupid scene at the end. The talents of these two actors could have been used a lot more efficiently.There is a lot of fun to be had with Iron Man 2 because of its slickness, in particular the intensity of the action sequences, and Downey Jr. who continues to transcend one's image of the typical hero through his wit, charm and mischief. The narrative here is bloated with too many plot points and characters and does not provide the same level of substance as the first movie. Regardless, those who have been anticipating this picture the most are still likely to be engaged by the spectacle and will relish what is essentially very cool genre cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good sequel though not as good as its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark is back at it again, adjusting to life in the fast lane after disclosing his Iron Man alter ego to the public. In addition to dealing with various personal problems, he's also feeling pressure from a domineering U.S. government that feels entitled to his technology, a second-rate rival who wants to usurp him (Rockwell), and a deadly Russian rogue who has a personal score to settle (Rourke). The issue is whether Stark can get it together in time to preserve his reputation, protect those around him, and protect himself as well. Action scenes are a blast, special effects are first-rate, and Downey adds plenty of panache, but there are too many characters, too many subplots, not many surprises, and it's just not quite as much fun to watch as its predecessor. Entertaining, just seems to be lacking that extra punch. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is just... good. Wasn't as good as I thought it would be and it sure as hell isn't as good as the first one but it was FUN and that's all that matters because... you get what you pay for. Just good, mindless fun.Now, I won't give away the ending or anything, but I will say that the plot is much better in the first one which was, to me, one of the better superhero movies made along with "The Dark Knight" and the R rated modern classic "Kick-Ass".' If you have a bit of money and friends that have nothing to do, I highly suggest that you check this out, but when you go in, don't compare it to the first one at all, because it's not worth it, movies are fun, have it.--Alex Parker, film critic Another film to watch is "Inglourious Basterds" if you haven't seen it yet, but be prepared for subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as good as the first or maybe even a little better. What I love about the Iron Man movies is that they focus on story as much as they do action. They are perfectly balanced. An unlike other superhero movies it has a lot of humor. They got a new writer who should have written the first one. Jon Favreau is good director(not to mention a decent actor) and I wish he would direct more superhero movies. I enjoyed how it explored further into Tony Stark's alcohol addiction. Now what I love about Tony Stark is that he's not some brooding millionaire or whiny some teen who keeps trying to figure out if he should be a superhero or not. Can you guess who I'm talking about? Stark is the kind of guy who loves being a superhero and likes to have a good time. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow are as amazing as they were in the first one. I loved Don Cheadle's performance even though I'm a little pi***d that Terrence Howard decided to not to return as Rhodes. It throws it off when you use a different actor as the same character. Mickey Rourke was the perfect choice for the movie's villain. Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell are great additions to the series.There's only one problem that involves a plot hole but that's only one small part. I can't wait for Iron Man 3 and The Avengers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far too much character interaction and not enough Iron Man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin...Even though all the characters are decent, it just felt like the movie was constantly building up and the payoffs never satisfied relatively.The final battle just peters out after a pretty explosive opening, which was really disappointing. Oh, and there are so many moments I rolled my eyes with this one. The first film covered the use of tech really well and made it either outlandishly cartoonish in keeping with the source so it was never a question of the real world breaking immersion or used just enough actual technospeak to satisfy. It did this without ever feeling like it was dumbing anything down, more that it was purposely skirting /just/ enough to avoid it.In this one we have a dude walking up to a console and breaking through the firewall by tapping on the keys for a few seconds and guessing the password (standard Hollywood "hacker" fare) and the creation of a new element with the kind of deus ex machina that makes you wonder if they even bothered to screen the initial story ideas at all.Oh, and Don Cheadle's Rohodey doesn't come alive until the last few minutes of the film. Up until that point he's far too serious and there's no chemistry at all between him and Stark. The final battle is really great, they communicate like a couple of kids playing a video game (congratulating each other on well executed kills and such) and they suddenly feel connected. The very final scene between them on the roof sees some excellent banter that was missing from the entirety of the film before it and makes his character seem like a massively missed opportunity.Overall it suffers in the only way (imo) TDK suffered, that they tried to introduce too much in an effort to up the excitement. The first Iron Man (watched it again last night) is really well balanced in this regard while the new film muddles itself slightly in its efforts.Overall, it's a fun movie, and I'd definitely recommend it. I just wouldn't expect the same kind of gloss the first film so effortlessly achieved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing against plot-heavy movies. Heck, Crash is one of my favorite movies out there! But what makes Iron Man 2 hard to swallow is utter lack of skill, to be honest. It appears as though halfway through the film the writer realized that there were so many loose ends to tie up that he resorted to utterly unrealistic (even within the Marvel realm) plot devices. I mean, come on! In one scene, Lt. Rhodes steals an Iron Man suit and learns to use it in three seconds! Did the filmmakers forget that it took Tony a whole chunk of the first movie to learn how to use his?Another thing that drags the movie down is the sheer waste of interesting characters. Mickey Rourke's portrayal of Ivan Vanko was potentially the most interesting character in the movie, yet his screen time is so disappointing, and his overall influence so minuscule. Honestly, the Whiplash character had great potential to be a memorable movie villain, but alas, he suffered the same dreaded fate as Darth Maul.Aside from the waste of characters, the movie also suffers from the inclusion of useless characters. I understand that the filmmakers are trying to build up to the Avengers movie, but the inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow seemed a complete waste of time! No offense, but save it for the after-the-credits clip. Had those characters been taken out, there would've been more time for valuable character development.Surprisingly, the most interesting character is Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer. As would be expected from Rockwell, the actor became the character, but it is a shame that such valuable character development should be used for such an expendable character.Other commendable performances include, as expected, Robert Downey, Jr's Tony Stark. Either the role is tailor-made for him, or he's tailor-made for it. Regardless, when Tony Stark is on-screen, you believe that he's real, and he evokes empathy. Additionally, Don Cheadle's James Rhodes is flawless, and I only wish they'd cast him instead of Terrence Howard from the beginning. I must admit, I do enjoy his introduction at the Senate hearing scene. "I'm here, it's me, deal with it."Now, bottom line, the movie isn't bad. Not by a long shot. It's fun, but that's just it. The pacing is questionable, but it slides by. Unlike its predecessor, however, it lacks that depth that made me fall in love with the franchise. It seems like a common case of "let's dumb this puppy down so audiences will like it!"Regardless, it's just witty enough, and the dialog entertaining enough to where the movie isn't a dumb movie. It's just dumbed down.Does the movie stand on its own? Not necessarily. While it doesn't rely too much on the first, new audiences will find themselves lost at certain parts. Is that a bad thing? Again, not necessarily. Does it suffer from sequelitis? Definitely.My advice for anyone going to see the movie: expect to be entertained, but don't expect too much. And if you're thrown off by the clip after the credits, don't worry. It'll all make sense in due time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel in every sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron man 2 follows the typical modern conventions of a sequel, bigger explosions, more bad guys, and much more spectacle. Unfortunately it falls prey to all the bad things about a sequel as well, namely the idea that "more is better".The Good: Robert Downey JR, Emma Thompson, Don Cheadle, and the newly added Scarlett Johansen all do a great job of fleshing out their characters and providing enough witty banter to entertain us (Director Jon Faverau's little fight scenes were great fun to watch).We learn a bit more about the Avengers of course and there are plenty of nods to the comic book community throughout the film (most notably the last scene after the credits).The special effects as is typical for today's films are top notch.The bad: The story meanders. Tony faces off against Ivan Vanko/Whiplash and while the battles are entertaining the motivation for Whiplash is somewhat muddled. He seems more like one of those no name wrestlers that Tier 1 stars toss about the ring than a truly evil antagonist. I never really felt like Tony was going to lose. Nothing truly felt at stake.Iron Man 2 tries to also address Tony's own failing health (tied to his power source and creating a new gizmo-power source for his suit) which is also somewhat hastily explained, bring about a redemptive father/son subplot that ultimately doesn't amount to much, and move along the Pots/Stark romance (which had its cute moment near the end).The story seems to want to hit about a dozen different nails on the head and does, but not totally effectively; going for width in the story arc instead of depth.My friend and I left the theater liking certain moments of the film but ultimately feeling it was bloated and could have had about 10 minutes shaved off and the stakes raised.Perhaps the I.M. 3 will put some real "iron" back into the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, "Iron Man II" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me.Given the fact that the first was sensational, I just knew this would be excellent, and maybe better than the first.Well, that's what I thought.I have good news and bad news for this movie.The good news is that "Iron Man II" is a solid movie, no doubt.I enjoyed it.There's no reason to not see it.It's a solid piece of 2-hour entertainment.The bad news is that it was too talkative.I really hate to tell this to people going into this movie looking for non-stop action, but there's only 3, count em 3, major action sequences in the entire movie.2 are serious and quite effective while one is played mostly for comic relief, and I enjoyed it for it's sheer goofiness.The problem with it is that there is too much talking between the action.If I could estimate, I'd say there's about 20 to 25 minutes of action through out the whole movie.The other 90 minutes are nothing bu talk, talk, talk.I'm not saying I was bored, I'm just saying that there could've been more cool action sequences.Maybe 2 more wouldn't have hurt.Those looking for the same level of entertainment as the first might be a little disappointed.So I would recommend that you don't see it with high expectations.But I am recommending "Iron Man 2" for the cool special effects, the iron man suits, and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.A solid, but not excellent, sequel.</fullReview>

I was pretty happy with the movie in general but it was definitely a shadow of the first movie which I gave a 9. The plot was typical and the increase of the arrogant side of Tony Stark character was a little much for my liking. Even still it was a good movie with great visual effects and worth the cash to see it. If you are going to see it, get there early!

This simply just did not deliver, as I have heard it best it was a good story told poorly. I would happily recommend the armor wars comics before I would ever thing to recommend this piece of cinema. But though incredibly flawed, I still can find many treats, such as the beautiful fights between Whiplash and Iron man, as well as the ending scene. I won't go to far into detail but if wish to see fun fight scenes with a poor story this is the movie for you. Also I did enjoy seeing War Machine march into the franchise, hopefully becoming a permanent resident. I give this a 6.5 out of 10.

The story was boring but it still doesn't make me hate it though.Before, I thought Crimson Dynamo would make an appearance but no. We only get Whiplash. Also, in the final fight, Whiplash actually made himself an armor which is odd because he never had a full armor on the comics. Only a mask and some metal parts. I guess they should have chosen a better villain than Whiplash in this movie. In conclusion, Iron Man 2 was pretty much okay.

		<fullReview>It's actually pretty good. I LOVED the first Iron Man movie, it became my favorite comic-book movie after its release in 2008 (Even Dark Knight didn't beat it. I know, but my opinion, yo.)When I saw this for the first time, I remember it having a lot of flaws, and overall wasn't as up to the mark as the stellar, fast, fun, and clever first movie. But now that I look back at it, it's actually kinda good. Nothing to write home about, but it is a solid piece of entertainment, and a pretty good sequel.Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was more comic in this one, but actually better than the first (Then again, his performance as Tony Stark always gets better with more films). However, the supporting cast does not disappoint as well. Mickey Rourke's villain Whiplash IS kinda pointless, but Rourke plays it well, and is a good villain with a neat grudge.Sam Rockwell especially stood out as Stark's rival in business, Justin Hammer. He's a very underrated actor, and played this character flawlessly. I don't really know why Rhodes was recast by Don Cheadle from this movie on, but he's really good in his role as well. Sam Jackson is awesome in this movie as Nick Fury, in my opinion a bit better than in The Avengers.This movie was supposed to introduce the Avengers initiative, and does it, never straying from the main plot of Stark trying to save himself from dying, and defeating Whiplash and his army of drones. The whole Black Widow/Stark's assistant thing was kinda lame and pointless though.Overall, this is a neat sequel to Iron Man. It's not the BEST of the Marvel films, but hey, if you like Iron Man, like me, you can definitely enjoy this flick.</fullReview>

Both of these things are certainly true, but they're ultimately not tragic flaws.Though the villains and the stakes feel inconsequential, 'IM2' zips along at a fast clip, and fueled by great performances and a far more exciting and satisfying finale than its predecessor, it manages to entertain while also laying the foundation that the entire MCU is built upon.Flaws and all, 'Iron Man 2' is still a worthwhile entry into the MCU, and well worth revisiting for those who may not have liked it the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the tour de force that was Iron Man, a sequel was always going to be hard pressed to live up to the expectation. The writers and director of Iron Man 2 apparently decided to go in a totally different direction and create a movie that does nothing and goes no where. Tony's alcoholism is given a sorry turn in the film, there is little build up to this. Black Widow is introduced ...her Avengers introduction is much better. Whiplash is great, as is Justin Hammer but both villains are poorly used in a film that stumbles from one set piece, through a series of sitcom gags, to the next set piece. The film culminates in a giant special effects sprawl and at the end it pretty much resets the ongoing plot to the end of Iron Man. It does the job as a blockbuster popcorn movie but is far below the standards set by Marvel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in the theatre and I should have known better to set any expectations, but since Downey, Favreau, and the previous installment doing Shellhead some justice, I relented and set those expectations. Not high, but they were set optimistically. OK, so I know Cheadle replaced Howard and that was a decision that wasn't for the best. Cheadle is usually dependable in his own way. But Howard was actually plausible and sold you that they were friends. Cheadle didn't bring that to his role. Rourke, In my opinion took the dramatic, emotional stake that should have been Stark's with an ever increasing personal stake or investment with each sequel that doesn't have to always be Pepper Potts. I mean, is that all he actually cares about ? I know she's the unattainable love interest and the one person whom Stark can't get into the sack. But she was bait for Stane in the first, and now for Anton Vanko's droid attack. Come on Justin Theroux. This is why you make the big bucks. This isn't a plot driven movie since it just unfolds as it comes to Stark's realization. But it doesn't offer much for character driven either. When Stark starts gets drunk at his party, you feel they're gonna do an homage to the "Demon in a Bottle" storyline. But nope. Perfect chance to dive into a moment in Stark's fallibility and character development outside the seemingly "Uh, gotta fight the Mandarin again." I felt the action scenes were treated with less reverence than the first and added to satiate action fans. But the fight scene at Monaco was over before it really began, the battle with Cheadle during the party was trying to be funny while also adding humor, and the face-off with Vanko was too un-fulfilling. I felt it was all over waaay too quick. You know it isn't that good of a "movie" when even Downey is quoted as saying how much of a letdown it is. Furthermore, there wasn't much if any, semblance of an arc for Stark like his realization in the first that he was irresponsible and went about to rectify that character defect. In short, too little of everything in this "movie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Ironman movie was a joyous revelation. This is unfortunately full of hateful depressing rubbish. Nobody understands Ironman and they would rather dislike that understand. The movie is annoying and predictable. Much potential is there in this - to quote Yoda the the movie reviewer, but wasted it is. Too much time is wasted on substance abuse, mood swings and hateful surroundings. You can find enough of that in reality. The beautiful chemistry between Pepper and Tony Stark in the first movie has been totally laid waste here - now its just unpleasant antagonism in most of the movie. Even Sam Jackson. Even he. When he turns up is annoying. They are making a third one - lets hope if finds the fun again.</fullReview>

Let me just say that I beg to differ with your review...I pretty much checked out of this mess during the 'drunk party scene' and kept out. (Oh drunk people, they're so funny, but you know when they're REALLY funny? When they destroy stuff. Yeah. Let's put that in the movie.) And then there was the something or other about facing one's own mortality. (Don't you see? Tony Stark is dying!! He's getting all veiny and stuff.) And then there was the VERY BAD industrialist who must be exposed...And the love interest you have to hide YOUR BIG SECRET from...And the bad guys that can't shoot straight...And the 90 pound supposedly hot chick who kicks the ass of guys three times her size...Etc etc.... I've already seen this movie a hundred times before and so have you. It's just boring at this point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame follow-up to mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of this series..... the first film started out exceptionally poor with horrible racial stereotypes and ridiculous effects, then entered an interesting and entertaining middle stage that dealt with anti-hero issues, and concluded in a predictable underwhelming confrontation. The sequel has a more exciting battle at the end, but very little before it to really keep me interested. From its first moments it presents a cliché landscape of cgi robot action, PG-13 level exploitation values, and absurd character relationships.The new writer, Justin Theroux, has produced a film that plays even more to the lowest common denominator, which is quite surprising considering his public persona as a fringe badboy in terms of acting (he's appeared in many David Lynch films, among others). The film lacks any sense that there's a larger structure hanging over the proceedings. About the only ongoing plot is the idea that Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is sick/dying and that Pepper Potts (Paltrow) doesn't know about it. Everything about the film is designed not to exceed the capacity or appetite of 14 year old boys. Theroux is clearly primarily a comedy writer, as evidenced by his only previous credit on "Tropic Thunder" (a much more entertaining Downey Jr. film and performance).The worst thing about films such as this, and the Pirates of the Caribbean films with Johnny Depp, is that they have proved that the best actors of our generation can be debased and turned into engines for boring action franchises. There was a time when serious actors wouldn't go near a kiddie movie like this. While Downey Jr. provides much of the film's humor, you have to feel like he's wasting his own time as much as ours. Mickey Rourke, after a nice performance in "The Wrestler", reminds us once again of why he lost popularity in the first place: his performance is all smug and self-satisfied, as if it's enough to be a villain to speak in an awful Russian accent and walk around with a smirk. And what was with the bird? It was like he complained to the scriptwriter and they gave him that as a "character quirk" even though it has no meaning and does nothing for the film.Very poorly written film executed in a highly predictable way</fullReview>

If you're 12 years old, if you have an IQ of 80, or if you otherwise still read comic books, then I guess you may derive some buzz from the glamorised violence, the hot chicks, the flawless special effects, or the rocking soundtrack. If, on the other hand, you would prefer something with a little more depth to it, something that fully exploited the acting talents of the (very fine) cast, something with genuine character development in which you might become emotionally invested, then keep looking. Overall, a waste of absolutely world-class talent, but I guess everybody needs to get paid.

		<fullReview>Watchable, but not close to the greatness that the first one was. sure Favreau has put in all the cool gadgetry that incorporates the world of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) however if you are going to make sequels at least don't follow suit of the Spiderman series and start making them less enjoyable as they go along! One thing i will give Favreau on this one was his brilliant decision making on casting, Mickey Rourke, Scarlett Johansson,Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell etc. etc. However the storyline is sorta ...meh! Mickey Rourke plays our villain here Ivan Vanko aka Whiplash sporting a very poor Russian accent throughout. Now that Stark has revealed he is in fact Iron Man and suffering from new health issues due to the suit, is put under a lot of stress as the government want him to share his blueprints and technology information with the military. Major problem here is when you have so much on screen talent what to do with them all and sometimes like this it turns into one giant cluster ..... However if you are a fan of cgi and an action film that packs a pretty good wallop! You should be impressed with this latest instalment to the saga. I personally hope they don't mess up the Avengers as it could be , if done right one of the all time great Marvel comics adaptations!</fullReview>

No thrills, but barely watchable blockbuster, even enjoyable sometimes, as you have to satisfy with that these days.But this is totally useless sequel. Action is little and even those end quickly. Some are even unexploited enough like one in Monaco. Stark's main competitor is terrible to say the least. For the one bad ass weapon maker he is totally childish. Gwyneth is again total waste of movie tape in this movie and many other supporting roles. Director should have concentrated more on the relation between Ivan and Stark and should added more interaction between them for further story development. That would present much better watching experience.Do not waste time watching this piece of bad movie making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like comparing very much, every movie is a new world for itself, but in this case I have to mourn this sequel. Of course it is a decent piece of Hollywood popcorn cinema, this kind of pictures always succeeds in the western world, like Bollywood movies in India. You have to leave your brain outside (if you own one) and you know what you have to expect. I for myself tend to celebrate this expend as a therapy to escape the real and dull world, and my children have phun. But Iron Man 2 left me quite disappointed. If I wouldn't have known the first part, that maybe wouldn't be the case. But now I missed - a good and fresh new story instead of an hours-filling struggle to entertain me with the obvious - tension and dramatic highlights instead of those simplistic chases and fights- more dimensional characters and especially charm like in Iron Man 1 - actors and a director who really enjoy their work - the begun love story at a somewhere noticeable level continuedIron man 2 isn't much more than a rehash of its predecessor. Number one mostly successfully tried to keep me interested, say, with Tony Stark's imprisonment, with the love story (remember the scene where she have to fix the power unit in his chest ? - nothing like this in here !), the machination of his father's friend, and so on.The present sequel is far too clean and free of any obstacles for the Hero's final victory. It has no highlights except the presence of Mickey Rourke, whom I wish that his career now may have taken a new start. To say that the most impressing things in this movie were his old-style glasses and his big fingernails, may sound weird but that's it. Although I found especially his character not as delightful as he could be with a better script or a better direction.But always looking for the box office eradicates seemingly every creativity, since the rules say 'take no risk, but always the money'.The most ridiculous appearance was for me one-eyed Nick Fury's with his Avenger organization. That Avenger thing may be a part of America's comic culture, but it did nothing good for the story except giving an explanation why a former model (Scarlett Johanssen, beautiful and seductive, outperforming bland Gwyneth Paltrow at every scene they commonly have) should work at a department of Stark Industries. Samuel L. Jackson's and Scarlett Johanssens's talents are both wasted at most of their screen time, which is, in his case, fortunately, not for long.My conclusion is that this is a ready-to-wear movie not made by caring authors or artists but concept creators and financial analysts. There is no dirt, no danger. There is no chemistry between anybody, because there is no scene for it. There are no highlights, no risky scenes, no surprises. Nothing to remember, but the box office performance.</fullReview>

Otherwise, not so much.And yes Hollywood, 13-year old boys will like tight, solid movies with a simple compelling plot. They don't have to be tantalized with Scarlett in tight leather for a two-minute martial arts session that leads to absolutely nothing plot-wise in the middle of the climactic showdown.Screen-writing by demographic. I've seen worse, for instance the remake of Mighty Joe Young (everyone should see the original then the remake as a case study in how to ruin a simple, compelling storyline) but this one's pretty obvious.Not to scare you off, I enjoyed the movie for the most part. But the obvious button pushes, Hollywood insider humor and gonad-targeting stifled much of it. That's from me, who's beyond the demographic, and my much younger cousins who are smack dab in the center.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike some of the other recent Marvel titles, this sequel clearly failed to deliver on the promise of the first in the series. Which is not unusual in the least, Hollywood sequels being almost always trash (but not necessarily so with Marvel sequels).Downey is back as the tired, flaky billionaire weapons magnate, only this time around tired really is tired. Paltrow and Cheadle are thrown supporting roles which use none of their considerable talents (the guy who had Cheadle's role in the original is actually better for the part). The whole production seems entirely uninspired, much of the movie is endless talk talk talk leading up to two techno-fight scenes. Which leads us to the other problem, the fight scenes when they do occur are so computer-generated they are almost impossible to follow (like in Transformers II, another movie which bears more than casual resemblance to this one). And the "climatic" fight is almost over before it begins, like nobody cared at the end of this. The stuffing of this movie is just sort of crammed meaninglessly together, including the SHIELD angle. I find Iron Man 2 so uninspired it's difficult to write an inspired review for it. As with Transformers 2 it was work getting my 5 year old to sit through it. Highly unrecommended.Post-script: Iron Man 3 was almost as good as this was bad, so skip this one and go directly to 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Iron Man 2 last week. Not impressed. Of course, I didn't like the first one that much either. Iron Man 2 left me with a lot of questions. The plot line was confusing at first, then towards the middle of the movie I began to understand better what was going on. Mickey Rourke didn't do much, as usual. I am happy they replaced Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle as "Rhodey", Tony's best friend. I am confused as to why Rhodey ditched him though. Why would you beat up your best friend with his own invention, then take off and have his top competitor gain the rights to it? Doesn't seem like something the character would do. Also, the secret organization that Tony's new assistant and Samuel L. Jackson (never caught his character's name, sorry!) are a part of made absolutely no sense to me either.Overall, 2/5 stars. Not impressed. Had some cool action sequences, and there were funny parts, but no real strong performances from any actors involved.

		<fullReview>This film actually deserves a seven, but I subtracted an additional two points to cater for my disappointment. This film, in contrast to most other good superhero movies I've seen (such as Watchmen, Dark Knight, Unbreakable) is almost a disaster, saved by good acting and distracting action sequences.Now, I'm not a fan of the comics or the character in any incarnation whatsoever, but I was pleasantly surprised by the last outing. It broke some rules, had pretty decent character development, was funny in places and had a worthy showdown. I admire Iron Man 2 for picking up exactly where the last film left us, but....The first issue I have is with the characters. We all know that our main man likes to talk and quip and all that, but in this film, he talks too much, and doesn't have that much to say either. The co-stars inject a presence into the movie - in a bad way. In an effort to stay out of the shadows they have all become larger than life. There is no subtlety in this film at all. The worst culprit of this is the rich bad guy (not going to bother remembering his name) who is constantly plastered on our screen with no meaningful buildup and no real purpose.I did like the lightning striking meanie. Though I thought he was a bit "too" human. I say this because he blunders at certain points and then switches to a mastermind in others. I don't like that.The soundtrack is acceptable, the acting is very good and action sequences and CGI are well put together, I suppose. But everything else, the script, character development, humour, chemistry, etc is not very impressive at all.Not a film I would want to have in my collection and I feel so disappointed that I am contemplating removing the first Iron Man from my collection as I know now that it is not a film that can be give added value by its sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Stark' contrast to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the first 'Iron Man' movie with low expectations, but came out pleasantly surprised at how good the flick was.The opposite can be said for 'Iron Man 2'.Unlike its predecessor, the narrative of the sequel was flat and Dull, trying desperately at times to cram in sub plots of little interest, seemingly for the benefit of future 'Marvel' films (Avengers). The movie was disappointing overall but not without its good points. The look of the film is superb, with stunning visual effect put to good use in many creative and innovative set pieces.Great performances once again from returning cast members Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow, with Mickey Rouke stealing the show as Ivan Vanko. However, the characters of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) added nothing of any interest, with their screen time slowing down an already tedious storyline. Two characters inserted only to serve as a tie in to the aforementioned Avengers movie.I would sum up Iron Man 2 as a dazzling piece of eye candy with little substance. Not a complete mess, but a disappointment none the less, as it never hovered anywhere near the high standard set by the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much cheaper it could have been without the first 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The surprising thing about the initial movie release of Iron Man was that not only was there action, but thought and intrigue. There was almost something in the movie for everyone simply because wading through the scenes you didn't find interesting were blocked well and didn't run on and get you impatient. Not so with this new entry. I was hoping that it would have gone more the way Spider Man II went: More plot for morons, more build to romance, enough head on action to appease the geek. This for me did not happen. Now granted, I don't claim to be an expert in movies. I don't know the intimate histories of all the stars and starlets out there, or the screen writers, nor the directors or producers much more than the average Joe but I'm not all that willing to accept less than what was offered in a preceding film. Even though the same constellation was involved with this production it just didn't quite do it for me. I was disappointed. Here's why: The first 90 minutes of this film were vague and uninvolved. You may argue the fact, but to this reviewer it seemed that the entire movie was during the last 30 minutes when good versus evil clashed in a way we hope it would. I have seen it twice, and the second viewing confirmed what I couldn't pinpoint in my first watch: The movie was boring for the most part. Nick Fury was a "meh" (though Jackson still is just right for this part); Scarlett at her best was image happy. The whole sequence with her kicking her way through the Hammer corporation I couldn't decide was her stand in, or CGI, or just the actress. I saw this in a DLP theater and the way her hair flew around the screen just didn't look justifiable (even though the leather suit did justice to her makeover); Pepper seemed almost borderline personality disorder - mood-swings were almost menopausal. Even the Iron Man seemed a little over the top even at his worst. The one thing that was almost perfect was Rourke's portrayal of Ivan. He is the perfect ugly bad guy as we have come to expect since his role in Sin City. For the most part to me, the whole thing seemed like it was over acted. Hence, when action commenced, it all seemed to fall in place. Still, there are redeeming graces that occur. The filming and coloration are up to par, the enhanced Iron Man effects appreciated. Thanks to CGI, it was still a great theater experience. I don't know how it will fare on DVD. I think over the coming weeks, the viewing of this movie will drop significantly from opening day, just the opposite of "How To Train Your Dragon", which is doing really well still. It's not that this movie was a total waste, it is just expectations were not met in this reviewers opinion. Sorry guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As sequels go, some can be better or just as good. In the case of Iron Man 2, it was not as good as the first. There are a few good action scenes but at times it can drag. There are very few scenes with Downey and O'Rourke. Perhaps the best scene is with them on the race track when O's villain, Whiplash, comes out on the track with his handmade suit and electrical whips.(you saw it in the preview). Whiplash is from Russia. He helps the owner of a weapons company called Hammer build an army of robotic iron men to help beat the competition of Tony Stark's(Iron Man) weapons company.Gwyneth Paltrow just looks tired in this movie and is only doing it for the money. I have a feeling she may not be back for part 3 unless she needs the money to buy the latest expensive phone. Scarlett Johanson is a welcome addition as Black Widow, the newest employee of Stark. She can definitely kick ass in this movie. She may have had a stunt double but I couldn't tell. And she looks even better than Gwyn. Mickey O was okay but he has done better films that are not so big budget. He is better than just playing a comic book character. One of his best besides Wrestler is Angel Heart with Deniro, one of my all time favorite movies.Iron Man 2 is of course number one in the movies but it may not be for much longer. The summer movie season has only begun. And so far it is not that impressive. A movie with a lower budget is sometimes if not all the time better than the blockbusters. I'll be looking to see what the hit sleeper is. Iron Man 2 will rust in peace soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps because he is primarily an actor, director Jon Favreau graciously gives actor Robert Downey Jr room to run wild in "Iron Man 2". Favreau, who even plays Downey's servant within the film, turns the reigns almost entirely over to his leading man, every sequence designed to both make him look good, and submit us to his iron will.Indeed, Downey isn't just "Iron Man" in this film, he's a manic God, manipulating machines, computers, TV screens, existing 3 steps above the rest of his cast and outsmarting everyone, either physically or via witty comments. And when Iron Man's not dancing on stages, applauded by audiences or wooing women, he's taking part in action sequences which first require him to order disc jockey's to fire up some music. Every thing Downey does here is self-consciously a theatrical performance. Ironic meta-acting taken to the extreme, no longer does the action hero merely wink at the audience ("Indiana Jones", "Die Hard" etc). No, meta has gone one step more meta, the actor now playing the god, playing the god, playing the god in the machine. It's not only a question of super-reflexivity, of postmodern irony squared, but rather, a kind of contempt for all material. With plot pastiched to hell, reinvigoration has nowhere else to go but inward, the actor now as fragmented and cut-and-pasted as the film he's in.Compensating for this fragmentation is Downey's own need to dominate. His need to be the deity outside the character playing the character playing the character. Compare this to the straight faced Joker in "Dark Knight" who, despite supposedly being an anarchist, looks completely old-school next to the freewheeling Downey (or Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow).Interestingly, unlike most superheroes, "Iron Man" has no need for anonymity. He's pure ego, allowed to be a celebrity, a public figure, a playboy, a rich kid, a toy maker, an invincible muscle man, a billionaire industrialist and a one man military industrial complex. While most superheroes function as power fantasies, "Iron Man" goes several steps beyond. He's a very white, Western, 21st century fantasy. A celebrity superhero for the reality TV generation; everyone must know his name.Whilst Favreau is gracious to Downey, submitting the film to the actor's improvisational talents, he also provides space for his film's other heavyweights ? Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke - to run wild. Rockwell hams things up, Rourke goes to Brando lengths to internalise his character and Don Cheadle projects his usual air of noble earnestness. Beyond this, all three characters are poorly written.Surprisingly, the film rectifies the big mistake of the first "Iron" film in that it mercilessly removes much of its dull action scenes. Aside from one surprisingly good sequence in which actress Scarlett Johansen engages in a bit of martial artistry ? the best pop-corn wire-work since the Nightcrawler sequence which opens "X-Men 2" ? the film downplays action in favour for sitcom level rapid fire banter. This has ticked off audiences, but spectacle is largely dead. Most recent films praised for their action ("Avatar" et al) are completely inept, turgid and/or outdated.Of course, thematically the film is horrendous. At times it looks as though Faverau wants to use Rourke as a tool to highlight Western blow-back, the hypocrisy of peacekeepers like Iron Man and their dark pasts, but the film steers clear of these things. It knows that treating the Rourke character seriously would take things in a direction audiences can't handle, so Rourke is repeatedly pushed off into the sidelines. The result is the usual Hollywood fascism: a message of anti-militarism married to gleeful explosions, hardware and mayhem.7.5/10 ? "Iron Man 2" is all about Robert Downey's iron penis. About performance. About a kind of self-conscious, actorly domination, Downey dazzling us as he goes off on his insane jazz rifts. Now all the franchise needs is Shane Black and an R rating ala "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang".Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review of The Avengers....I mean Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I'm all for movies being loyal to their origins (in this case the original Marvel comics), but at some point, there has to be a little bit more of the "human elements" that create the fine line between the two in this film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the ego driven technology typhoon, whose cocky humor gets annoying at times, has a problem. His power supply is running low and he is slowly dying. This film takes a more serious look into what Iron Man is truly composed of, but unfortunately the characters don't seem to understand the situation as much as we do. If Tony Stark cannot take himself seriously, then why should we as an audience? Wipelash (Mickey Rourke), Iron Man's new enemy in this film, is a very dark, interesting character. Sadly though, is given about 15-20 minutes of screen time, majority of which he is either building something or hacking computers. Even his on screen presence is often interrupted by the annoying and uninteresting Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). His actual action scenes where he is actual causing destruction may total 3 minutes.Iron Man and Whiplash share a minuscule amount of time on screen together. They meet near the beginning and again near the end. Everything that the two characters were doing in between were totally unrelated to the other (This may be the one part of the film that actually frustrated me).Later in the film, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) discusses Iron Man's health with Stark. Now for a fan of the Avenger series (like myself), you would probably recognize him, but for anyone else, you wouldn't have a clue what his relevance is. Same goes to Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) her appearance seems to build slowly up to one scene where she beats up like 10 guys.Much of the film I felt like I was watching an extended trailer for The Avengers. Another portion was like I was watching an Audi commercial. Another portion was like watching a married couple bicker at each other (Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Tony Stark showed no chemistry at all). Many scenes were so unrelated, I don't know how they weren't cut out. The small portion remaining was what I had hoped much of the film was about, more action, and less boring, totally random dialogue.Overall this film is no doubt a "filler film". It's just a tiny piece of the big picture that Marvel is working towards. It's one thing to hype a movie with news and trailers and other things. But, it is a totally other thing to hype up A MOVIE WITH ACTUAL MOVIES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man Shows Rusts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire weapons designer/superhero/stand-up comedian Tony Stark. Unwilling to mass-produce his Iron Man suit, the race is on to replicate it. Justin Hammer played (Sam Rockwell) is the Bill Gates to Tony's Steve Jobs, evidenced by the stress on their competing arms expos. When Stark's showboating at a racetrack leads to a curiously well-timed showdown with a mysterious Russian named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), Hammer sees an opportunity to fund a project to surpass Tony's and win a lucrative military contract. Ivan has other ideas in mind, wanting to make Tony pay for the betrayal his father was dealt. Can Tony stop them? Will Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) finally accuse him of sexual harassment?Truth be told there are some funny lines and a couple of quality moments of comic book style action. There's also a ton of falsified marketing. Iron Man 2 is going to get your hopes up, then disappoint you with a ridiculous subplot. There is a tremendous lull in the action because Tony is forced to discover a cure for a blood-polluting toxin found in his arch reactor. It's not terribly interesting and it's brought in for what I like to call the "Batman Effect": the altering of a hero's costume for the purpose of merchandising.I know the first movie wasn't action heavy. It was the origin story explaining how Tony Stark became Iron Man and it was filled with witty jokes and banter between Tony and his secretary Pepper. Well for some reason it was decided to take out those sincere moments and throw in interloping arguments. Many conversations in Iron Man 2 can't be recalled because they consist of characters talking over one another.Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as Stark's go-to guy Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. Though Rhodes physically does more in this sequel, he seems to have less face time because Tony needs to talk to just about everyone else in the world. Now Tony is to meeting with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who you may not remember if you left Iron Man prior to the completion of the credits. Scarlett Johansson is brought on board for a role that equates to eye candy. Rather than see her emote like an android, I'd prefer some more time with Stark's robots. In the original, Stark's lab was a fun set where he tinkered with his suit while being assisted by his inventions. It was Frankenstein meets Pee-wee's Playhouse and it was one of the many strong points of Iron Man. I suppose that since he has his suit now he doesn't need to spend time in the lab, but the subplot that has him making adjustments is a tough pill to swallow. It's not unreasonable to say that his arch reactor is poisoning his blood, sure it's not a story line worth spending half the film on, but it's not unreasonable.Then Rhodes willingly, and stupidly, betrays his better judgment. I understand that there is a plan in place to make Rhodes into the hero known off-camera as War Machine, it just bothers me that they would take the already powerful Iron Man suit and find it necessary to add a minigun. I'm sure if they used some thought, someone could have found a more reasonable method to create the character.By this time, I'm not certain that anyone actually directed this movie. These Marvel sequels look so much alike and play the same numbers for an encore, it's movie making by committee. Some scenes really could have been trimmed down, take the protracted Senate hearing for example. Action scenes were few for comic book hero film with it's protagonist in his post-origin stage. In the first film Tony was a charismatic guy who was bit of a jerk but made up for it with redeeming actions and humor, ultimately changing his character over the course of the film. In Iron Man 2, he's taken a step back in all regards as though Iron Man rusts. In fact, the only good laughs I found in the film came from the timing of Sam Rockwell. There's even a S.H.I.E.L.D agent whose sole purpose makes him the harbinger of movie titles. Since when was it considered okay to load a feature length film with promos? These are not decisions made with the guidance of an "artistic vision".Iron Man 2 isn't the worst sequel from Marvel (I think Spider-Man 3 will carry that moniker till the day I'm placed in the cryogenic chamber). At its best you will be entertained by parts and not offended by the rest. It's not terribly juvenile, nor is it loaded with kitsch. The saving grace of this par treatment is its cast, who put in as much effort as the licensing factory will allow? minus Scarlett.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you could make God bleed, people will cease to believe in Him." Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke)It's apt to say Iron Man 2 is bleeding, but we know it won't be money. Rather it is that lifeblood of originality in story and dialogue characteristic of the original Marvel comic adaptation absent here. Remaining are pyrotechnics and gymnastics worthy of straight-to-video productions. I'm being sardonic. Obviously, the effects are going to be first-rate; it's just that the story is so burdened with sub plots that the original story seems now to be minimalist with its dramatic emphasis on character development and relationships rather than quips and effects.It is mostly visual mayhem while Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) keeps the government at bay as it tries to co-opt his invention and Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) challenges Iron Man with some very electric strategy. No less a threat is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), an industrialist wimp with the old domination ambitions accompanied by an unhealthy dislike for the likable Stark.The limitations are plentiful: very few lines for Rourke, an Oscar winner who deserves more than a few Russian words, several grunts, and silver teeth. The plot has too many strands and too few appearances of Iron Man. Perhaps just as disappointing is the underuse of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, whose Catwoman-like costume demands more eye time and whose acting chops, like Rourke's, probably lie in the editing trash bin.The relationship between Stark and talented assistant Pepper Potts goes to a new level, not a welcome development for this minimalist reviewer who prefers the cool of a professional relationship to a second-rate passion. And that feeling is pretty much my take on this first summer blockbuster: easy on the eyes but starvation for the brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Downey acts as good as always, Bad acting from Russians makes the storyline seem flatter than it had to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Iron Man was a success and Robert Downey Jr is really the perfect actor to play this character. Hence i had expected much more out of this one. It began with quite a flat storyline being drawn, the storyline itself wasn't all that flat, but the bad acting of the Russian characters really made the storyline seem very flat in the beginning. And more could have been done to improve the beginning of the storyline. Actually the first scenes sucked all together. Then somewhere in the movie it feels like the government has stepped in and ordered it to be more boring so that no one would consider to build these suits themselves. Well guess what.. Japan's already there.. well.. anyway. Another thing that really disturbs me is that the agents in the first movie at least seemed cool. The only agent that seems like a bad-ass here is that girl agent. That's not OK.. you can't start by letting the agent end the first movie with a comment like "just call us Shield", and then proceed with making that character more lame in the upcoming movie.. Again.. not OK..In favor of the movie i must admit that the graphical effects are as stunning as ever, i was expecting the silver suit to be used by that other guy in this movie and was enjoying their little fight and Roberts snappy comment to the DJ right before the start of the fight. I don't want to spoil to much so you have to look into what he said. The technology that Stark is using and the fact that he actually creates a whole new "matter", sort of speaking, is nothing less of amazing.What i'd love to see more of if there ever would be a third movie.. Which i really really hope.. Is that the storyline begins more professionally and that Stark shows more of his confident self centered personality. It's really amazingly eye catching. Almost like watching Jason Statham in Transporter.. Never EVER try to change Starks personality, it will fail..That's all folks.. Bring on the next one!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel pretty well follows the well trodden path of balancing entertaining action sequences with equally (or maybe even more) entertaining crackling dialogues, such as:To Tony Stark, "We owe you a lot" (something to that effect) Tony Stark, "More than you know". Rejoinder, "Not that much".Maximum mileage was gotten out of Stark's narcissism, laughs that might have gone stale but for Robert Downey Jr's inimitable performance. But there is also a trace of pathos, as Stark is in a sense a dying man trying to live out his last days to the full. There Downey also did a great job with just the right touch.The plot is a little unnecessarily convoluted, and may be best described through an array of characters, both old and new.In Downey and Mickey Rourke we have the best pair of born-again stars, and finally thrown together in this movie. Rourke is Russian physicist (he actually speaks some Russian as best I can surmise) Ivan Vanko out there to destroy Stark in revenge for his father. His potential is quickly recognized by Starks's arch business rival Justin Hammer (superbly delightful Sam Rockwell) and recruited to create a human weapon that beats Iron Man. Vanko double crosses Hammer and turns the project into his own, creating instead an military force of much mechanical clones. But the ultimate attention grabber is Vanko's own alter-ego, cracking two electric whips that are arguably the best direct-combat devices since light sabres 4 decades ago. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, more or less a sidekick in the first movie, has made the expected, logically elevation to Stark's equal, in more ways than one. The other sidekick Terrence Howard reportedly asked for too much of a pay hike and got replaced by Don Cheadle. The character Col. Rhodes too got a elevation of sorts, as another human weapon (he steps into one of Stark's other suits) with which the government hopes to control Iron Man. The two ends up reconciling and joins force against the common enemy Vanko'Added to the parade of stars is a pair of behind-the-scene movers and shaker of events. Scarlett Johanssen's Natalie starts out as a legal adviser working for Pepper Pot but is later revealed as the assistant to Nick Fury, Natalie Samuel L Jackson's eye-patched godfather-type character who seems to run everything. One review playfully describes this growler character as "like a refugee from another comic". Johanssen effortlessly is the most pleasing eye candy. Her action sequences are remarkably like those of Trinity, perfected and immortalized by Carrie-Anne Moss, particularly the iconic landing pose (stooped low, hand on ground in front, one leg bend, one leg stretched straight to one side). But coming from Johanssen, there is a fresh, delicious flavour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I enjoyed Iron Man 2 marginally more than the first movie, albeit with some reservations.My main reason for liking it was that there was more story to it which was not simply origin. While one accepts that the first movie had to have origin in it, it was good for that not to need to be addressed here.Mickey Rourke was an excellent villain, Sam Jackson had a little more room to play with Nick Fury, Scarlet Johanson finally got to kick some butt after demure décolletage and a couple of good moments through most of the film, and Downey and Paltrow reprised their characters pleasingly enough. Cheadle was fine as Rhodes, and Garry Shandling played an oily senator in what, to me, was one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie - a Congressional Hearing towards the start which is held with the intention of forcing Stark Industries to hand over the Iron Man tech to the US government.Oh, and THAT shield (not S.H.I.E.L.D.) makes another appearance.The only wrong note performance-wise was Sam Rockwell - his Justin Hammer never for a second convinced me that he could be CEO of any major company despite the fact that it was a highly entertaining performance.On the action side, I have three comments. One, I wasn't sure what effect they employed during the Scarlet Johanson combat sequences, but it made them appear very jerky. Two, I felt the flying sequences were really difficult to follow (in contrast with the first movie, where I thought they were excellent). And, three, in common with the first movie, I thought the ending to the climactic action sequence was rather perfunctory.But there was enough going on to keep me entertained without the action sequences being critical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much-anticipated sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 gives things a damn good go nonetheless...The film kicks off at quite a tempered pace. Freed of the need to set up the character of Tony Stark and, as a consequence, Iron Man, it opens up the beginning of Iron Man 2 for director Jon Favreau to spend some time with his characters. It's time quite well spent too: the first act of Iron Man 2 manages to introduce Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko and set him quickly on the path to becoming Whiplash, while it also begins to examine and nibble at the character that Tony Stark has become. Significantly, it digs into Stark's background and the relationship with his father, explaining some of the vulnerabilities in the character that the film subsequently explores.As we join the film though, Stark is on top of the world. He's boasting that he's privatized world peace, while resisting attempts by the government ? led by the brilliant, scene-stealing Garry Shandling as Senator Stern - to procure the Iron Man suit for itself as a weapon. The moment arrives with the film's finest action sequence, the one that's been heavily pushed in the trailers. Rourke's Whiplash, driven by a hatred of the Starks passed down by his own father, makes his entrance in a grand racing scene in Monaco, and it's one hell of a way to say hello.Rourke is clearly having a ball here, putting across a very still villain at times, whose actions look simply spectacular on the big screen. He's not a perfect movie foe: his mumblings are often hard to hear, and Whiplash is kept locked away for too much of the film's running time. But when he's unleashed, he's a sight to behold.Here's where Favreau deserves immense credit, too. For he directs here an action sequence that you can both see and appreciate, freed of the desire for over-fussy cuts and too much use of the cam. Instead, he fills the screen with a scale you'd expect and demand from a massive summer blockbuster, and Whiplash's prowling around the track at Monaco is an outstanding piece of controlled action cinema. By contrast, the third act action that he melds together can't measure up to the same standard: it's still exciting, but there's little sense of the threat about it that permeates Whiplash's big entrance.Worthy of note too is Sam Rockwell's turn as Stark's rival, Justin Hammer. While Tony Stark is reviving his father's Stark Expo project, Hammer is keen to ingratiate himself with the defense department to snap up some of their business. It doesn't take much to put Hammer and Stark at loggerheads, and nor does it take much selling that Hammer quickly becomes so interested in the carnage that Whiplash brings down.All the while, Rockwell sells us a character that's a little uneasy, once or twice a little over the top, but pretty much always compelling. Arguably he's too much of a focal point for the ongoing story though, which is a problem for a film with so much to cram in.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts (in a beefier role than first time round), and James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, now played perfectly well by Don Cheadle.It's hard to knock a film for wanting to flesh out side characters as well as developing the main faces, but there are moments where you can't help thinking this is a luxury that Iron Man 2 can't always afford. Because on top of all of this, it also has to squeeze in the introduction of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman and deal with her character's progression, too. And there's the small matter of a meatier, more pivotal role for Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury as well. It's as if an admittedly-intriguing trailer for 2012's The Avengers movie has been wedged into the ingredients of a movie that already has too much in the mix.Favreau and Theroux do, to their credit, get through a lot of storytelling in this part of the film, but the mid-story still slows things noticeably, before things are lifted again for the final act.And, to be fair, Iron Man 2 does catch fire again. It packages in an exciting final third, which at times has you sitting back and simply appreciating the joys of a big, expensive, well-made blockbuster movie. It's hard too to sniff at Robert Downey Jr, who once more turns in fine work in the leading role.Yet there's no getting away from it: Iron Man 2 is a film that can't quite recapture the magic of the first. You can't fault the fact that it tries: it throws as much as it can at you, admittedly stretching elements a little too thinly, but it's doggedly determined to give you your money's worth. There's little doubt that you get it, too.You also get confirmation that Jon Favreau is a director who can genuinely handle action and special effects with real skill (as was, of course, originally proved in the brilliant, under-appreciated Zathura).What you don't get however, which may just have been a little unrealistic to expect, is perhaps what you most wanted: a comic book movie that can be mentioned in the same breath as The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2 or X2. Instead, by generous compensation, you do get a fun two hours, thanks to an ambitious movie that feels top to bottom like it was made by people who seem to love films such as these as much as you and I.It might not be quite the Iron Man sequel that you were hoping for, but it's still a fine way to kick off the summer blockbuster season, and a happily entertaining night out at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Noisey Sequel Long On Action Short on Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I tried to watch this on cable channel FX which blew it up to a 3 hr. presentation with far too many "extras" and commercials. (It's only a 2 hour movie.) Tony Stark believes he has achieved "World Peace" thru the creation of "Iron Man" so naturally there has to be a loose cannon; crazy Russian "Vanko" (played to the hilt by Mickey O'Rourke) who thinks Stark's dad stole the design from his dad. So the motive is revenge. Are you confused yet? So many things going on. Stark is dying from radioactive poisoning. The government wants to create the ultimate drone soldier and a competing corporation wants to steal the contract from Stark Industries. It plays a little like "Short Circuit" meets "Robocop 2" with a dash of tin-can "Cylons" mixed in. Very cartoonish, which, of course, leads to a wonderful mindless climax with dozens of exploding evil drones and tons of action. (Kids ages 6 to 12 will love it.) People running for their lives from a set that looks like Epcot's "World Showcase" but isn't. The best sequence occurs far earlier in the film at a Monte Carlo race from Hell with race cars sliced in two by "Vanko" with his pulsating "laser whip". It all left me with a big headache. Scarlett Johansson, as "Black Widow/Natasha" "kicks butt" and she has better moves than the Iron Men. (Yes, there are 2 Iron Men plus villain makes 3.) Like all the bad sequels after the original "Superman", it's overblown and sort of a waste of time. In general, I didn't like it, but "Natasha" is amazing in her beyond skin-tight cat suit. Wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Tony Stark: Mass appeal, but ultimately shallow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this highly anticipated sequel to acclaimed pseudo-hero film Iron Man, director Jon Favreau flaunts an all-star cast including Downey Jnr., Rourke, Paltrow, Johansson, Cheadle, Rockwell and Jackson in a part-blockbuster, part-dramedy romp that ultimately delivers what it promises, but isn't without its faults. We follow the life of Tony Stark, and how he deals with the pressure and responsibilities of being Iron Man, apparently the world's only saviour and the only man who can claim to have 'successfully privatised world peace.' Tony is a troubled superhero, a far cry from the typically one-dimensional characters we're used to seeing in this genre, and on that front, there is some depth to this film. On the flipside, we are introduced to Ivan 'Whiplash' Vanko, the token evil Russian physicist intent on taking down Iron Man for reasons that (unfortunately) are not entirely clear or motive-driven.Despite this, each main actor in this film delivers at least a satisfactory performance. With each film he stars in, RDJ flirts dangerously with the line of being typecast as the smart-ass anti-hero, and Iron Man 2 is yet another example of that. However, it is obvious he enjoys being Tony Stark and his sharp delivery compliments his excessive flow of off-the-cuff one- liners nicely. While Paltrow, Johansson, Jackson and Rockwell do just what is expected of them in their respective roles, it is Rourke who makes a thoroughly pleasing turn as Vanko. Although a motive and backstory is all but non-existent in the context of his character, his commitment to the Russian accent and anti-social tendencies of a man who has just spent the last quarter of a century in prison just goes to show that, somewhere between his personal problems and willingness to put down others in the profession, we forgot that Rourke is, simply, a good actor.This film actually suffers from too much star power in more than a few instances. Favreau is obviously working a multitude of angles here (some significant and some very minor) but it is apparent he hasn't quite mastered the art of ensemble filmmaking. While RDJ gets the screen time he deserves, other characters (including Vanko) just seem to fall by the wayside as the climax approaches, and are all thrown together in the concluding scenes to wrap up the film in a neat little package. Plot holes appear occasionally from both a scientific and political perspective. Usually, the realism factor in a superhero movie would be a non-issue, but because Favreau goes to such great lengths to recreate our world in its modern context, one cannot help but point out physical and technical impossibilities; the kind likely to make cinema-goers sit back, roll their eyes, and assure their friend that 'there's no way he could have possibly survived that in real life.'Ultimately, Iron Man 2 does keep the viewer entertained for its duration with adequate performances all round and tight, magnetic pacing, but never advances beyond the level of being a mere stepping stone for The Avengers (2012), and Mr. Stark, instead of being the self-assured individual he was in the original Iron Man, ends up being nothing more than just another piece of the puzzle.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an intelligent movie that actually works way above the level set up by a lot of previous comic adaptations. Without question, the makers of this movie went all the way in making it a remarkable experience for everyone. To their credit, they never assumed that the hype or good will of the first film was good enough to put butts in the seats. They really respect the source material but they've accentuated the believable and realistic angles of a great story. This is a story about great characters first. The action stemming from that is amazing and only serves to add to a great story. Tony Stark is about a hero's journey of internal struggle. He's a complicated character and he represents the dark side in all of us and the hope that we can overcome those demons. Everything was juggled perfectly but I expected no less from this crew.

		<fullReview>First of all, people watch this movie for the same reason like i do;it is an anticipating sequel every iron man 1 movie fans has been waiting patiently for and of course, a sci-fi cgi action filled movie for summers. People who watched and like the first film will get entertained by this sequel like the first. Additional humors, extended actions, sufficient war machine scene time, usual Robert Downey Jr. charisma running wild, sexy but deadly black widow kicking butts and outstanding Mickey Rourke performance as whiplash tearing up iron man apart added into iron man 2 are fun enough to keep u watching without yawning!!!It has a good story regarding the character development of Tony Stark that also contributes to the main plot of the movie and also equal character build-up of other characters as well. I love whiplash in the movie for his armor,pretty cool deadly plasma whips and his recklessness and obsession in defeating Tony Stark but this is also a problem in the movie. What I'm trying to say is that being reckless doesn't mean he can ignore the explosive car collision occurred just right behind him or walking to the race track without 'safety' consideration. He's not putting on any armor that time and if isn't for his whip he's dead already. The exploded cars flew behind him and bursting to the ground coincidencely apart from whiplash position was ridiculous as if he thought that he's invincible with his exposed armor. Please, that isn't logic; that scene was made just to make him look bad ass!!!!Furthermore, the armored Whiplash screen time was little too short and unsatisfied as i felt that it could be prolonged like making iron man, war machine and whiplash continue fighting in the air until whiplash fall to the ground and knock out or sort. In addition, happy horgan driving into the race track was ridiculous as well for the same reason being on whiplash mentality. All i can say is that this movie lack logic like the first movie, will you stand still when u look at something that beeps like a time bomb in front of you, run dude!! If u watch analytically, u could also spot that some screen from the trailer are not added onto the actual screen, and hey, wait till the end of credit,as a marvel fan u will be pleased by the ending screen!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that made the first Iron Man film so good is attempted in this sequel but for the most part, falls short - the film looks lazy - as if it is simply living off the first film's success.Despite this the film still has merit. I particularly liked the part of the story that included the Howard Stark flashback and that tie-in to the story. Robert Downey Jr. is still good in most of his scenes - especially the quiet, calm moments where he is in a way being re-introduced to his late father - these scenes are good - but the scene where he is intoxicated and entertaining a bunch of party animals is ridiculous and no doubt, rolled several pairs of eyes in the cinema, including mine. Anyone who read the Iron Man stories, knows full well that Tony Stark had his inner-demons and had a drinking problem for a while but this part of the character could have been handled in a much more effective way in the film. The Pepper Potts character is already getting stale. Nick Fury scenes are intriguing but pretty much just set up material for the up-coming Avengers movie and though the post credits cameo of a certain thunder god's hammer found in the NM desert tantalizes the Marvelites, so many of the performances simply looked uninspired.The film is still entertaining and the action scenes do not disappoint - especially the scene at the race track involving Whiplash and the final scene where Iron Man and War Machine are facing off against the deadly drones. Scarlett Johannson did a commendable job as Black Widow her scenes are good but they are rushed - hope to see more of this character's development in The Avengers movie. The Justin Hammer character brought a few laughs as well as Happy Hogan, but if there is to be another Iron Man film - they need to inject it with the same elements that made the first film such a hit and then take it to the next level as we saw in X-Men 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: Tony Stark is back, and loving it. Iron Man has singlehandedly brought peace to the world, and Stark is reaping in the rewards, fame and endless parties. But behind the happy façade there is dark clouds. The government is pressuring him to hand over the suits so they can equip the army, but Tony can deftly handle that. What is worse is that his power core is slowly poisoning him with palladium. He don't want to alarm Pepper, but does a poor job of hiding it. And SHIELD has planted an agent with him. And suddenly a man, Vanko, appears with the same technology as Stark. And he is not about to play nice.Comments: There is no way about it, the first half is just ridiculous. As sequels go, this is about as bad you can go. The first movie was really good, set a good tone and provided impressive action. But the first half of this sequel, intended to show Stark struggle, but it really made me doubt the entire franchise. No action, and Stark acting stupidly and being drunk most of the time, is not entertaining at all, in the same way that watching drunk people in a bar making a fool of them self is not entertaining either. The only way that could have been fun, if I were drunk myself? Fortunately, the second half improves drastically and rescues the entire movie. Then, finally, the action starts and we get something that resembles the first movie. It isn't good enough to make the movie more than decent on average, more than that is impossible. But it left me with some good thoughts and a little hope for the future of the franchise.Once again Rourke impresses, and Downey is good as Stark, once he gets his act together. It is always hard when an actor is replaced, but Cheadle does it well. And Johansson's efforts promises more. Paltrow is always good, as is Jackson in his limited role. Jackson's appearance does mark the turnaround point for the movie though. And most the characters are good as well, they got promise. And I do like the hints at the other Marvel heroes. But the character of Justin Hammer was a mistake, he was just annoying. But to tell the truth, the franchise got a good foundation, some real good characters and a real good cast. It does got real good potential. This was, hopefully, just a bad day at work.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly this film is no where near as good as the first, but worth a look.Too many cheesy lines, and not enough thought put into the battle scenes. Robert Downy Jnr plays it well again, and Mickey Rourke is a good baddie. Even the weapons concept for Mikey's character is decent.There is definitely something missing.Scarlett Johannson was only added for her looks during acrobats. Unlike Paltrow in the first who had substance. Don Cheadle added the only natural humour that was there in the first film.The main thing that detached me from the film was the fact I couldn't understand who half the people were, and why they were there. I think they have aimed the sequel and comic book readers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously, what were you expecting???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a great deal of panning going on, from viewers and critics who quite frankly have their heads squarely up their own backsides. What the hell were you expecting?? ? Citizen Kane?People have made much of the fact that there are a lot of special effects sequences, well umm, they are right, but to do down the film because of it, wtf? IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE!! Of course there are going to be special effects! Have you read a comic book? Even just once? And I'm not talking Peanuts or Calvin and frikkin Hobbs, but a REAL comic book? One with superheroes in it? There is this thing that happens in comic books, it's called ACTION. Yes, ACTION. You see that? That six letter word? That's what you are bitching about. The fact that a superhero movie has action in it.There's too much CGI, you whine. Well of course there is! Whilst Batman can be managed using practical, albeit outstanding, but practical effects. A guy in a metal suit that flies and shoots energy blasts is going to require CGI!!! Get a grip!!If you are not a stuck up cinephile, you will enjoy this movie. If you don't have unreasonable expectations about "where they should have taken the franchise" you will enjoy this movie.If you were expecting a highly nuanced tale of personal sacrifice or much moral hand- wringing then you went to see the wrong film. You should have extracted your head from your colon for five seconds and paid attention to what you were going to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more character driven Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first "Iron Man" because it was just a great action flick with interesting plot and characters. This "Iron Man" is very much like "Spiderman 2" (though better) in that the film focuses on the main character and his problems, as well as his flaws. Tony Stark is still egotistical, selfish, and loves hitting the booze, but he faces worse challenges than before. Though unofficially bringing world peace, power hungry senators and his competitor, a weapons man whose way over his head wants Stark's technology. A crazed Russian wants to kill Stark for he claims that his family was responsible for ruining his. On top of that, the power circuit, or whatever you call it, he uses to keep himself alive is intoxicating his blood, killing him. Needless to say, Stark is under a lot of pressure and is in a midlife crisis. Rather a near death crisis. This film shows us a darker and weaker side to the main character, which humanizes him from the invulnerable, stereotypical super hero. In addition, more of Stark's past as well his father's past is revealed in this film, which opens some skeletons in the closet, as well as making the film all the more interesting. The movie also contains some thoroughly decent roles from all the actors. Robert Downey Jr. once again illuminates as Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow brings some comic relief to the table as Pepper Potts. Scarlett Johansen shines with beauty and fierceness as the Black Widow. Sam Rockwell makes up as the annoying, whiny little pipsqueak Justin Hammer, in which we all love to shut up. Mickey Rourke is perfect as Ivan Vanko, with his tattoos and wicked grin. Even Don Cheadle as Terrence Howard's replacement of Colonel Rhodes wasn't a bad pick (though I do prefer Howard in the role).As I mentioned earlier, there's a unique story and secrets are revealed about Tony Stark. There isn't as much as action as there was in the first film, but that isn't a negative. I will add that the effects have seemed to improve from the previous film. How so? I don't know. I thought the first one was impeccable in that department, but this almost makes it seamless, blending into the film perfectly. It's almost hard to know what's CGI and what isn't. Though I enjoy this film, it's not the greatest thing I have seen. Unfortunately the movie drags, particularly in the middle section of the film. A couple of times I had to look at my watch, wondering when the film was going to wrap up. Overall though, it's something you viewers who love superhero films shouldn't miss.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways to me at least is better than the first one to the cast, acting, pace, thrills and definitely more witty and entertaining. Robert Downey Jr. is on the top of his game here as Tony Stark he was cool, funny, brilliant and bad@ss but maybe a bit too cocky but that's his character I guess. The supporting cast was great and Scarlett Johansson though hot as always looks better than ever and she really impressed me here, Mickey Rourke made an effective villain but I could hardly understand him most of the time or bought the accent, Samuel Jackson is cool as always but the standout person here was Sam Rockwell but Gwyneth Paltrows and Don Cheadles character really didn't do much for me this time around sorry to say. I really had a fun time watching this flick from beginning to end and it really surpassed my expectations and it's definitely what a summer blockbuster should be, an escape. The final act wasn't as thrilling or effective as the final act in the first one but it was definitely exciting but it kind of left me wanting more still just like in the first one but just like what Spider Man did for me this will probably get better and better with each sequel and I can't wait! Overall it has solid performances, action, laughs, thrills and it was just brilliantly done, an improvement but there is still some flaws to be tinkered with but I still recommend it for the fun of it all. More of a 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

As for the film, I found it pretty good, actually. A lot of funny lines, Downey Jr. is good, so is Johannsen, Jackson and the rest. Scarlett looks sexier than ever and her fighting sequence is VERY hot and well made. The action sequences are well made and not overdone, only the Monaco race was for me unnecessary and pretty stupid (even for a film like this): where was the race security and why didn't the organizers stop all the bolids immediately after the attack (so that the car driven by Favreau would not have to go among them, in the opposite direction)????

		<shortDescription>Loses its way in the middle, but brings it back in style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Iron Man 2 Tony Stark is dealing with high pressure from the government to turn over his technology to make weapons, however he feels that the technology should stay with him, however another physics prodigy has other ideas?The reason that the original Iron Man was so good for me, besides the fact that marvel had finally taken creative control over their own characters, was that Robert Downey Jr. was able to completely personify the character of Tony Stark. In Iron Man 2 he is back again doing all of the things which made the original so great. However in my opinion it was Mickey Rourke who stole the show. With a combination of excellent script writing and an actor who has really found his form again, Rourke was able to take a Marvel character who isn't particularly strong or developed, and give him an amazing screen presence, every scene he is in you feel uneasy, with his appearance intimidating, and his lines delivered to perfection to give the audience the feeling that this guy knows exactly what he is doing.Sam Rockwell is also typically brilliant as the Tony Stark wannabe, with all of the one liners, but none of the charm, every time he is on screen, you can't wait to see him get his comeuppance.I do feel that after the first big action sequence the film begins to let off the pace a little too much, where I personally was left slightly bored waiting for what I was sure to be a big finale. One positive in the middle section for Marvel fans however is that the middle section is full of fan service, look out for a famous piece of memorabilia in Tony's lab?This brings me to my next biggest complaint. Nick Fury, Samuel Jackson and the writers have managed to take one of Marvel's greatest heroes and turn him into what I can only describe as a non-character. Nothing he says in this film captures the comic book character, and some of the one liners are painful. I feel that fans of Marvel will like him purely because they know who he is supposed to be, however people who are unfamiliar with the comics I imagine will not understand this character. However the ending of this film is so utterly well done that it reduces all of my complaints to knit picks, with a showdown of epic proportions that is sure to have you leaving the cinema feeling completely satisfied.P.S. Marvel fans don't forget to wait until after the credits, no matter how much of a fool you feel waiting?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just going to get this out of the way. Iron Man 2 does not exceed it's predecessor in any way. The plot is beyond predictable, the acting is great with solid performances coming from all of the leads, and the special effects are good.The plot is simple enough. Jon Favreau clearly played it safe, which at least is better then the disaster that Spider-Man 3 was, but everyone was expecting much more from him this time around. The motivations for almost all the characters don't really make sense (I'm looking at Ivan Yenko and Rhodey here), but it still is enough to move the plot forward at a fairly brisk pace.Unfortuneatly this movie seemed pretty determined to show off all the new gizmos and gadgets Tony had developed in the slight time period between the two movies. As cool as it may have been, that "oooh ahhh" effect does not carry a movie.The acting was great, with an absolutely amazing cast giving exceptional performances. Don Cheadle did a great job taking over for Terence Howard, Robert Downey Jr was as amazing as usual and Mickey Rourke was a perfect choice for the antagonist.Strangely enough, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L Jackson had absolutely tiny roles in the movie, more serving as part of a prelude to "The Avengers". Why they felt they needed to blow their budget on some big name actors/actresses that they hardly used over a bolder writer I don't know.The effects were good, but still nothing special. I thought they nailed Whiplash (Thank god they avoided the leather outfit that was seen in the comic books), and some of the better action scenes had some great destruction, which we all love of course.If you REALLY liked Iron Man 1, you will like this. If you thought the first was okay, then this is probably a renter for you. Overall this was a passive move by marvel entertainment after a few hits (by the way could you please make another hulk movie?).Oh well, don't come expecting too too much.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IronMan 2 was a missed opportunity. The spark, the magic that made the first movie so special, was all but lost here. The inclusion of Sam L Jackson as Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was completely unnecessary in terms of plot ... what one earth where they doing there? Talk about blatantly setting up the Avengers franchise. But on the strength of IronMan 2, I can't say I'm excited by the prospect. The big flaw for me was that Mickey Rourke as Whiplash was hardly in the movie, and as for how Don Cheadle becomes WarMachine ... sheesh! His motivation for grabbing an IronMan suit as Tony's party gets out of hand was totally unrealistic. As is often the case in franchise flicks, No.2 was bigger but by no means better. And, crazily, there seemed to be a severe lack of action until the very end of the movie.Number three has a lot to do ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NB: Check my profile for my blog address, where I have more film/society reviews.I hoped that Iron Man 2 would at least be hilariously bad: I was under no illusions - I did not expect that it would be of any credit or worth to mankind, or even the lower species - but I did think that those guilty would have at least managed the bare minimum: acting that gave the impression the actor gave a damn about being there; character development; meaningful (in the context of the film) events and characters; and so forth.What was delivered made me think that an eight year old boy had conceived and directed the film - or was at least a much-utilised consultant to such an extent that they broke child-labour laws: at one point, believe it or not, two men in metal suits - not robots, mind - had a fight while the Daft Punk song 'Robot Rock' played...is the population full of retards not under the care of the State? Or are their carers actually permitted or encouraged to allow their meagre mental faculties to be abused and atrophied yet further with idiocy such as Iron Man 2, for some abstract reason i'm ignorant of?The crux of the film was meant to be that main idiot (Robert Downy jr..) was dying, and there was no way to stop it - but there was nothing at all done by the film-makers to convey any sort of tension with regards this critical part of the plot. Alongside this was meant to be some sort of adversarial relationship with Mickey Rourke - but Rourke had about five minutes of screen time in the two-hours this insult to the human race debased existence - including a final showdown with Downy which was as tense as the rest of the film - that is, as tense as a used condom sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Which is where all these criminals should be, really - for the good of us all, including themselves: i'm sure they don't wish to continue hurting their loved ones and society by creating such abhorrence as this.And if they do: then we have all the justification we need to do away with them.(Check my profile for my blog address, where I have more film/society reviews.)</fullReview>

I enjoyed the fact that the main character was brought down to earth with a big nasty bump, confronted by the reality that he sponsors, and that sponsors his reprehensible lifestyle.That the sequel should suggest that this lifestyle he 'enjoys' is to be endorsed and aspired to, automatically places it into the category of artless social propaganda. It is, essentially a tale of unlikable people with the power of life and death over others, battling it out for the right for that power. Yes, Starks realises his dad loved him really, and that he really ought to cut back on the partying, knuckle down and join the 'team America' and and fight the 'bad guys'. Those bad guys? Well, we'll see who they are in Iron Man 3. Probably some other desperately impoverished group who are misled into believing that they can actually fight against the obscenely rich and powerful of this world. The fools.

		<shortDescription>A good trashy fun sequel, but quite disappointing on the whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I though the first Iron Man was really great, with a new idea and great story, superb action and great acting with enough in depth about the characters to make you care and give the story substance, but I'm afraid Iron Man 2 just falls into the typical sequel trap of just trashy fun wanting to cash in on the first. It is great fun. Downey Junior is still excellent as Stark and very funny. The action sequences were fun and the special effects were amazing. Not to mention there was some good music and Downey Jr gave the script in parts wit.But the script was mostly awful with thin characters. I could see the director Jon Favreau try to flesh them out but the multiple stories didn't work, which loses that in depth of the characters and why we care for them. He tries to do the multiple narrative like Sam Raimi in Spiderman 2 who successfully had the main story with there sub-plots that blended seamlessly together beautifully with the depth of the characters understanding the motivations behind there choices and decisions and making you care about them but Favreau fails in this respect. Micky Rourke dosen't make a lasting impression as villain Whiplash and Scarlet Johansson though pretty was extremely underused. There is not motivation for her character. Also there are some gaping plot holes like why when Whiplash escapes from prison is it not reported by the media? And he goes to the grand prix track to kill Stark whose one of the drivers but he didn't even know he was there because he arrives before he sees him and we're not made aware Whiplash knows he's there making the character and film a bit dumb and forfeiting credibility as a result. Saying that there was plenty of action sequences, which were done really well and were exciting to watch as a result. But on the flip side, it leaves too little room for story and character development (whereas Batman Begins and Spiderman 2 balanced out the action and story perfectly).Good trashy fun yes, which I enjoyed but it's not as amazing as people make out. I really was expecting much more and I was quite disappointed on the whole. This had potential and I could tell Favreau tries with the multi-plots but it just fails. This dosen't live up to the hype it's received but it's still worth seeing. I hope the third shows improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Downey Jr continues his smirky role as the playboy and laissez-faire persona of Tony Stark (no Downey Jr, no Tony Stark I'd say!), now facing a life-threatening intoxication situation, and constantly having to deflect the US military's interest in and compelling him to turn over the Iron Man suit. Then of course there's the romantic angle with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts who gets expanded screen time here, to whom he hands over Stark Industries to by appointing her CEO. I had enjoyed all the scenes between Paltrow and Downey Jr as they shared great chemistry, and didn't mind that the film took the pause from the action to throw the spotlight on this. In fact, Stark is pretty much the Santa Claus in giving away things, having to face his mortality and to put some business continuity plans into motion. A little too bad that the scene in the teaser trailer highlighting the banter in the plane didn't make it to the final cut.But all work and no play makes him a grumpy soul, so enter Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman, his new sexy private secretary from the legal department who is more than meets the eye. Johansson has now proved that she's got it in her to be in an action film, and her limited action scenes here will surprise and leave you breathless. Mickey Rourke seem to have picked off from his Wrestler role in playing the Russian villain Ivan Vanko, riding on the parallel and theme of Fathers and Sons, whose father was seemingly played out by Howard Stark, and is finding it apt to finally take it out on Stark Industries using similar technology the earlier generation developed, and now backed by sugar daddy industrialist Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays the classic business rival bitterly humiliated by Tony, and from observing Ivan's potential, decided to bankroll the Russian's capability for the US military. Hating a man in common make for strange bedfellows indeed.Cameo wise, there's Stan Lee if you can spot him in a brief moment, probably his easiest and non event-filled one to date given he's just standing around, Samuel L. Jackson continuing his role as Nick Fury of SHIELD, now assessing Tony Stark to determine if he's indeed the man they need for his top secret boy band, Gary Shandling as the senator pursuing the weaponization of the Iron Man suit for the military, and of course, director Jon Favreau himself who continues his role as Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan, and you can tell his acting itch from his expanded role in getting in on the fun rather than just solely standing behind the camera.But of course the tongues will wag whether Don Cheadle can pick up from where Terrence Howard left off. Whatever the reason may be for the latter's departure, he will likely be kicking his behind now for leaving the project. That anticipatory look Rhodes had in the first film at the metal suit worn would bring a smile to any fanboy in the know of what would be the next logical step, and frankly speaking I would have enjoyed some continuity here. But having a different actor in a role done by someone else in a preceding film isn't something new, and Cheadle stepped in confidently from the start, helped by the script which puts it in point blank terms that he's there now, and they should move on. Well said, and great job on being War Machine, in a best-friends-temporal fallout subplot which accounted for the action at the midway mark.Justin Theroux, who wrote the screenplay for Tropic Thunder, took over the scriptwriting for this film, doing the narrative justice with plenty of fan-moments, and oh-not-so subtle merchandising opportunities that Tony Stark would be proud of. The excellent casting has the brilliance of Theroux's story to thank for in keeping the many subplots in check, making Marvel fans happy through the plenty of easter eggs peppered around, coming up with an intoxication of a different sort for Tony Stark to deal with and a chance for him to go back to the drawing board, getting his hands dirty with the building of something. Action-wise, yes there is only a handful of them, but each of them brought something to the table in terms of excitement, thrills and spills. The special effects and graphics here were one up against the previous film, and it was a definite visual feast especially when suits got up against suits, warranting a second look at the film just to catch everything that's happening at the same time. The finale was a full 30 minutes worth of action end to end and features the Iron Man-War Machine tag team up, which served up a lot more than what we've all glimpsed from clips here and there. Singapore, this is yet another opportunity to be proud of with our compatriots also involved in the visual effects department, ala Kick-Ass.Iron Man 2 is set to convert the non-fan, and is crafted so that newcomers to the hero could jump right into the fun without needing to watch the first one (why haven't you!). For Marvel fans though, you have Jon Favreau to thank for whetting all our appetites in making this film the teaser to the other upcoming Marvel films such as Captain America, Thor, and I will be right there to holler Avengers Assemble! when the time comes. Stay until the end of the credits for a scene which will make you salivate. A-One!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic, exciting but overall disappointing. (Minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what you have here is exceptional special effects, however some of the fight sequences are blurry and its hard to keep track of the action at times, but its all still enjoyable. The plot is predictable and very archetypal. The acting is specifically good from Scarlet and Don Cheadle. Mickey Rourke's accent is pretty good and his acting is OK and as usual Robert Downey Jr is pretty good. I think there are so many more entertaining ways for the plot to have gone and this seems like a lazy effort. The humour in this film was 10x more from the first and there were a lot of good one liners.The scenes in Monaco were very entertaining however things seemed to slow down once they were back in America. Don Cheadle played the role that once belonged to Terrance Howard even better then his predecessor. Scarlett's character was very entertaining to watch and the choreography on some of her fight scenes were fantastic.To summarise, your going into a film with a lot of explosions, mostly likable characters, humour, expensive sets (Tony's house is amazing) but a predictable plot. There were just none of those "WOW" scenes in it and for that reason I feel this is the summer's first blockbuster disappointment.Hope you enjoyed reading.</fullReview>

Whole first impressions were great and I thought that I will again watch one masterpiece . This movie is something what I can't miss . There are maybe few things which made this movie a bit worse but I don't mind it .Jon Favreau directed this movie and he acted Happy Hogan . His directing is always full of imagination and great sense for entertainment . His funny appearance entertained me . I can still say that he didn't screw this serial . I can also say that his directing was completely different from first one because from one simple movie we got one big astonishment . I knew that i can't be disappointed with his directing . I can still say that his connecting of every part was on higher level and he got the best from whole cast .Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was again excellent . Looks like he is enjoying in acting of this superhero . I can see that he isn't missing chance of his life because now he showed how he can be so good . Actually I like his performance from Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man . His sense for fun and great action made this movie great . I couldn't believe that from one I can say boring acting to great relaxed acting . He is again showing simplicity of one superhero . He was so realistic .Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko was great . No matter what I liked performance by Jeff Bridges but Rourke was definitely better . He made this movie great . His damn good performance deserved award "The Best Villain in 2010" . I can say that every his appearance was superb . If someone made this movie more amusing than first that was him . I think that he is definitely great choice by Jon Favreau . His convincing acting and something what is called sense for acting was great . I can see that he was on level .Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was again in one difficult role and she acted her role the best that she could . I can see that she was on level maybe sometimes she had some failures but again something what we could see in first part . Her role was difficult but she found herself in it . Maybe she wasn't the best part of movie but I can't say that her performance is bad . She sometimes was in some her world but good performance .Don Cheadle as War Machine or Rhody was pretty convincing . His acting was in some cool style and I was fond of it . He surprised me so much because I didn't expect strong performance by him . There were so much parts when he was on level . I was surprised because he made big progress because of weak performance by Terrence Howard in first part . He was also great choice by Jon Favreau . I think that this movie is really better made .Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman was pretty good . She had good performance no matter what her appearance was based on her beauty what is definitely truth . Maybe sometimes she had some downs but many times she had her ups . I was very surprised because she was in some hand entertaining . Her movements were good and every scene was delighted with some her sense for appearance . I think that she is so good actress .Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury wasn't so good but he had a style . He is definitely valuable actor and you can see how his sense for acting .I think that this movie was the best of superhero movies .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johansson and Jackson indicted for scene stealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Java Man Reviews "Iron Man 2" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2010.OVERVIEW: While the identity of most super heroes remains shrouded in mystery, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) has been publicly revealed as the breast-plated bad-boy known as Iron Man. Unlike Batman or Spiderman, Stark has to deal with things like Senate hearings, jealous G-Men and rival CEOs. Everyone wants the Iron Man technology. Meanwhile, over in Russia, a metallic mastermind named Ivan (Rourke) is steeling himself to challenge Stark for world supremacy. Returning from the original Iron Man are Stark's trusted assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and army liaison "Rhodey" Rhodes (Cheadle). New characters are Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) and Nick Fury (Jackson) both of whom add a big dose of scene-stealing appeal. REVIEW: 3 of 4 Java Mugs Sequels are inevitably compared to their originals and more often than not they don't measure up. Because of the cast, this one could have been an exception: Downey is still a marvel to watch and Paltrow may be even better in this version; Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard, is also fine. Rourke and Rockwell as villains and Jackson and Johansson as intriguing spy types are all fascinating; and Shandling as the chairman of a Senate investigating committee is hilarious. But the screenplay is very much by-the-numbers, and it just doesn't add up. The captivating characters and stimulating situations which distinguished the original have given way to long and loud action sequences. But if it's action you want, you've got it; these scenes are very well done and are accompanied by lots of heavy metal music (what else?). The cinematography is also noticeably sharp with a lots of excellent aerial views. Great location work in and around California, and in Monaco during the principality's Grand Prix, also adds to the film's visual vitality. I waited in a long line to see this movie, but it was worth it because of the enthusiastic audience that surrounded me. Come early to get a good seat--and stay late through the end credits for a big hint at what may be coming next from the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me put it in a very simple way, This film is a disgrace to it's predecessor. There's some eye dazzling effects in the first and the end part of this movie and that's all there's to it. Gets very boring after first couple of minutes and then there's the end part where Iron Man and his partner Rhodes fight hundreds of robots and that's it. If you have seen the trailer you have seen the whole action part there is in the movie. The movie has completely lost its plot and made people less interested to see the next Iron Man (If there's going to be any).Waste of time, Waste of money but still gave 4/10 just for the special effects!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a disgrace to it's predecessor- Fact. The word redundant scenes takes on new meaning. If you were teaching a class in redundant scenes (i.e. scenes that tell you nothing, contribute nothing to the story or the plot, but just help to get the film to its status of two hours of a waste of people's time).How many scenes have no direction and could be dropped in anyplace, or to any film. What about the silly dialog? The emergence of characters based solely on their personalities, Jackson for example. You have quality actors in this film looking like very bad actors. The roles given to them and the motives of the characters are paper thin. The only person that looked mean and meant it was Rouke. How many times have we seen the Sam Jackson character. I swore he looked like Shaft returned. Anyone giving this film a rating higher than 4 has no idea about quality. It sounds bold but it is how serious I feel about this zero (if i could) rating. Last film I saw was Titans, and that was at least marginally engaging with a obvious plot, but it followed a plot - at least. Was it asking too much to have a believable story from start to end?Another film which pulls steals peoples money, and the Hollywood industry is so poor these days that people are forced to watch nonsense like this and then say it was "fun".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overcrowded, But Doesn't Deserve All the Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Don't get me wrong, there's plenty wrong with Iron Man 2. But after re-watching for about the 3rd or 4th time, I couldn't help but enjoy the hell out of the film. It's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. It's action packed, filled with timely humor, and great character development, even if it does have a pretty weak villain.In the next line of villains with the same abilities as the hero, Mickey Rourke stars as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, a man with his mind set on vengeance for what the Starks did to his family. It's hard to ever get truly invested in Vanko as a character. Marvel really struggles with its villains, and Whiplash is another example of that. However, it may be more of a case in which Rourke simply didn't care about giving the character any depth at all.It's even more frustrating because Sam Rockwell is so good as Justin Hammer. He fit the witty humor of the Iron Man films impeccably, and doesn't take himself too seriously. If only the focus would have been on Hammer instead of Rourke.The Pepper and Tony relationship is better than ever in Iron Man 2 as Pepper is introduced as the new CEO of Stark Industries with Tony sidelined with other issues. I've said it before but I'll say it again, Pepper and Tony are one of the only superhero relationships that actually work, and it's once again handled extremely well in this sequel.Rhodey is back as the reluctant best friend to Tony, though this time, Don Cheadle suits up as War Machine. I didn't mind Terrence Howard's portrayal, but I think at this point, I couldn't see anyone fitting more nicely alongside Downey Jr. Their pairing make for some of the best action of the film.One of the film's few problems lies with the inclusion of so many different story lines, and a few shoehorned in characters. Scarlett Johansson makes a grand first impression as Black Widow, but she didn't really need to be there. However, her scenes alongside Jon Favreau are very memorable.Sure, there are quite a few unnecessary elements of the film's plot, but Iron Man 2 is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film. I can watch Downey Jr as Tony Stark any day.+Action+Cheadle is an upgrade+Rockwell+Pepper and Tony-Overcrowded plot-Whiplash is a throw away villain7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you appreciated Jon Favreau's Iron Man, then you'll love IM2. There's not much new on show, but once had a taste of what Tony Stark has to offer, you'll know what to expect. Although Robert Downey Jr.'s character thrives as a philanthropist and making the world a better place, unrest broods in the background. Two villains occupy Stark's attention. The maniacal Ivan Vanko (Rourke), who disproves Stark's theory that every country in the world is far behind his technology, and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of a competing weapons/defence manufacturer. The one that sways heads is Scarlet Johansson, the Marvel Universe's much needed heroine (sorry Pepper).Ultimately IM2 is only as strong as its hero, so pretty damn strong then. Having less superhero smash-ups and more human character development is attractive to comic- book fans and movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sequel but it's not on the same level as the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good sequel but it is not on the same level as either the first film or "The Incredible Hulk". The script by Justin Theroux is quite strong, if not without its flaws, and Jay Favreau's direction is assured but the film loses its momentum in its last half an hour or so, which is when superhero films should be at their most exciting.The ever charismatic Robert Downey, Jr. is once again excellent as Tony Stark, delivering a quirky and engrossing performance as the unlikely superhero. Tony's characterisation is perhaps the strongest asset of the "Iron Man" films and I liked the fact that becoming Iron Man did not solve all of his problems or wipe away his personality defects. He is still a very conflicted character, something which is further explored on this occasion through his relationship with his long dead father Howard. The fact that he is slowly dying of palladium poisoning adds an interesting dimension to the film as his erratic and reckless behaviour causes both his closest friends and the US government in lose faith in him. It also serves to illustrate that he is far from perfect. Like the rest of us, he just does the best that he can. I loved the fact that he was able to keep his sense of humour throughout. The scene in which he testifies in front of the Senate Committee is one of my favourites.I had never seen Mickey Rourke in a film before but I was extremely impressed with his performance as Ivan Vanko, a brilliant Russian scientist who was raised to despise the Stark family by his father Anton in a Soviet-era Siberian prison camp. Not exactly the best environment for children. Vanko is in many ways a dark reflection to Tony, which makes him a very interesting character. He is also quite a frightening one, not least because he is very physically imposing. Sam Rockwell is a laugh riot as Tony's affably evil corporate competitor Justin Hammer. He reminded me of the fictionalised version of Salieri from "Amadeus" who is extremely resentful of Mozart's genius and success. Hammer, who has a massive inferiority complex, believes that he would be the top dog if it wasn't for Tony and is not content to simply be a member of the pack. In some respects, he is likewise a dark reflection to Tony and, as such, he and Vanko complement each other very well.As in the first film, I did not particularly like the depiction of the major female characters. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts but she has zero chemistry with Downey. The character is as dull as dishwater and contributes even less to the plot on this occasion. Scarlett Johansson is likewise perfectly fine as Natasha Romanoff but that's about it. Natasha is clearly a very skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and she can kick ass and all that but it's hard to care about a character, male or female, who can do all that if they don't have a personality. Neither actress has a chance to excel as they are lumbered with not particularly interesting characters, which stands out as all of the male characters (except maybe Agent Coulson) have clearly defined personalities. For instance, Samuel L. Jackson has very little screen time but he makes a much stronger impression as Nick Fury is such a great character, though this is certainly helped by his considerable screen presence. Favreau has more to do in front of the camera in this film than in the first and has some great moments as Happy Hogan. Don Cheadle is okay as Colonel James Rhodes but I much preferred the more charismatic and likable Terrence Howard in the role and I wish that he had returned. The film features nice appearances in smaller roles from John Slattery as Howard Stark and Garry Shandling as the utterly obnoxious Senator Stern and I really liked the cameos from Stan Lee (again mistaken for someone else!), Elon Musk, Christiane Amanpour and Bill O'Reilly, who behaves in exactly the way that you expect him to do if Iron Man was a real person. However, Paul Bettany didn't have the same chance to shine as J.A.R.V.I.S. in this film.The film looks fantastic and most of the action scenes are generally exciting, the best being the initial fight scene between Tony and Vanko on the Monaco racetrack. However, their supposedly climactic fight scene is decidedly anti-climactic as it was over so quickly. I assumed that they would do the standard, though almost always entertaining, thing where the hero thinks that the villain has been defeated but it turns out that he hasn't. Even after this did not happen, I expected the film to reveal that Vanko was still alive and would one day return to seek his revenge. The fact that his defeat was comparatively easy meant that it was a little underwhelming and the same holds true for Hammer. All I could think was, "Is that it?" I like the hero to get a good run for his money but I don't think that it was quite good enough in the film. Ah, well. Can't win 'em all.Overall, this is a good, fun superhero film but it could have benefited from stronger female characters and sharper writing towards the end. Still, it is a worthy entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It Wasn't going to Top the Original, few Sequels Have, but is is an expected Fun Film although it does Suffer from the "More is Better" Delusion. The Intimacy and Intense Personality of the First Film has Evaporated somewhat but there remains enough remnants to Satisfy.Robert Downey Jr. is once again a Force on Screen and is aided by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell delivering Interesting Characters. Actually the only "Name" Actor the Sequel should have Avoided is Garry Shandling as a Neo-Con Senator. It's a Distraction and would have worked Better with an Unknown. Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard is OK.Many other "Faces" show up Again, Like Nick Fury, Black Widow, and Pepper Potts to add to the Adventure. Tony's Father is an Important Backstory Role. However, the Movie is Undeniably Overstuffed with Characters, Plot, and Busy, Busy, Action.Overall, it is a Solid Sequel. Nothing Special, Just a continuation of Spectacle and Comic-Book reflection to Satisfy the simplistic Fanboy expectations and Popcorn Audiences Throughout the Universe. Churning Out these things has become Corporate and the Soul of the Source Material isn't Gone as much as it is Glossed and has acquired an Obesity of Obsessive Compulsive Countenance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good enough sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is back declaring that he has created world peace. The problem is that his arc reactor heart is killing him as fast as saving his life. And then there's Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who is on a mission to avenge his father with superior arc technology.It's a good continuation sequel. I like Mickey Rourke as the new bad guy. He has the look and the menacing demeanor. I even like the accent. Sam Rockwell is normally a special actor, but his sleazy weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer feels very generic. And Garry Shandling is stupid as a Senator.Overall, it does feel a little bit bloat with the vast number of characters and the complicated history in this movie. There are a few characters they introduce that payoff in later movies. For example, Scarlett Johansson seems like nothing more than a simple T&amp;A show. If not for the later movies, I would say she's a bad distraction.The fact is that it does two things all at once. It's Iron Man 2, but also pre-Avengers. And it does them both well enough. But like a ship with two masters, it can veer off at times. It could have been a great movie that is strictly Iron Man 2. But this is a good enough movie that advances both goals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just your average film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not the biggest fan of marvel film adaptations, but I did like Sam Raimi's spider man trilogy. I didn't have to high expectations coming into this film, so I wasn't disappointed with the results. I'm just going to say it, this film was average at best and I always forget I've even watched this film.Let's start with the characters. Tony stark still has his over confident personality, which is still better than all these other wooden characters from marvel films lately. I thought whip-lash( if thats even his name) was going to be a bad-ass after seeing the trailers. He had his moments, but in the end he was never a threat, his fight scenes were short and he was easily beaten. Black widow served no purpose in my opinion, just a woman in tight clothing, big whoop. Hammer was just another annoying and useless villain.The action scenes were poorly done, I can only seem to remember the short one at the race track and the one at the stark expo thing. The end fight scene was horrible, left on a bad note. It was mildly amusing to see war machine and iron man destroy stark's house. At least this film wasn't completely mindless like most movies targeted at the general audience.To summarize, this film is not as good as the first one, and didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I was left unsatisfied, but thats just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining watch, mediocre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Iron Man was well-received and paved the way for future instalments. Director Jon Favreau and most of the original cast return to create a film aiming to fix the flaws of the original, attempting to create a genuinely superior sequel and a great Iron Man movie. Whilst I walked out of the movie feeling thoroughly entertained, I was somewhat underwhelmed by the film itself. Despite its attempt to fix the original's flaws, Iron Man 2 is a heavily flawed film. I criticised the first film for its lack of a coherent story to drive the film itself. The sequel aimed to fix this problem by introducing a new multi-layered plot, wiling to tread into darker territory whilst remaining true to the film's fundamentally light tone. This was undoubtedly a great direction to take the sequel, but ironically enough it becomes the films biggest flaw. The problem with the story is that there isn't one. Instead we are given far too many sub-plots without an actual main plot to drive the film. When trying to consider what the main plot is, consider the sub-plots. The story begins with the concept, following on from the ending of the first film that the world knows Tony Stark is Iron Man, and he has subsequently been drowned in fame and glory. On the other hand, the government wants to take the Iron Man armour, which they refer to as a weapon and Tony refers to as a suit, in a court scene which is entertaining but takes its toll. During this time, Tony is aware that the 'arc-reactor' in his chest is killing him, and as a result of this the film is given an excuse to turn our leading character back into an egotistical, arrogant playboy, touching on the theme of alcoholism and taking an unexpectedly darker tone, practically defeating the purpose of the first film. This is also fuelled by Tony's past returning to haunt him, in the shape of his father, and Tony coming to terms with the fact that he never had a loving relationship with his father (this giving the film further excuse to go into unwanted dark territory) as well as the film's central villain, Ivan Vanko, played by Mickey Rourke. Vanko is a Russian physicist with a personal vendetta against Tony, blaming the Stark family and Tony's father for betraying his father and leaving the Vanko family in extreme poverty. On top of this, we are introduced to rival businessman Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell, who is essentially a 'Stark-Wannabe', and is intent on helping the government take Tony's suit. The film simply struggles to make sense of all these sub-plots, and while none of them are bad, it's the fact that there are simply too many sub-plots for the film to handle. As the film progresses, these sub-plots peak at the mid-point and the film crashes under its own weight, unsure what direction it is going in. It was at this point I actually felt bored and quickly began to lose faith in the film, especially when it decided to introduce Nick Fury and Shield, bringing even more characters and storyline to an already overly-complicated plot. It was during this time the film turned into advertisement for the Avengers movie, making several deliberately-placed nods towards Captain America and Thor. Fortunately the film finds its footing, and picks up during the last twenty minutes, presenting us with an entertaining final battle sequence, though it did just feel like an extended improved version of the original movie's finale. Not only does it get lost in too many sub-plots, the film also treads into the same mistaken territory of so many sequels and introduces far too many new characters than necessary. One of the aspects of the first film I loved was the chemistry between Tony and Pepper; however Pepper is given a lot less screen time and very few scenes with Mr. Stark, and Scarlet Johansen's 'Black Widow' character seems, at points, to replace Gwyneth Paltrow on-screen, with a pointless and boring character serving no real purpose in the film other than to look hot and fight. This also gives Mickey Rourke's character, one of the few genuinely interesting characters in the movie, the bare minimal of screen time, spending the majority of the second half of the film sat in a warehouse building robots. If the makers of the film had taken a more mature approach and focused on the genuine points of interest, i.e. fleshing out the central villain Ivan Vanko, and sticking with the concept that the government wants to take Tony's suit, it would have been a much better film than it currently is, however they insisted on taking the overly-ambitious route, desperate to make the film a superior to the first, and as a result it is no way near as special. On a more positive note, all the performances were just as impressive as the first film (save for Scarlett Johansen), though even Robert Downey Jr. was not able to stop Tony Stark being a rather unlikeable character in parts of the film. Personally, I felt the villains of the film to be the most impressive aspect, Mickey Rourke giving a subtle and realistic portrayal as Tony's nemesis and Sam Rockwell stealing the show as an naive, whimsical and utterly irritating (but in a good way) business-rival Justin Hammer.There is nothing 'bad' in this movie so much as the fact it is far too ambitious and becomes drowned in far too many sub-plots and characters. Nonetheless it was an entertaining ride, feeling a lot more like a blockbuster superhero movie, contrasting the gritty tone of the original. It's not as special as the original, and a less-is-more approach would have been a better direction, but as it stands it is an entertaining sequel and well-worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good continuation of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even while I can understand some of the people's disappointments with this movie, the movie in itself is not a bad one at all. It's pretty good and entertaining for what it is, it just isn't ever up to par really with its predecessor.Basically the thing that this movie offers is some good, simple entertainment. And there really is nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't expect a very clever or well written story, with plenty of surprises and originality to it. It of course is still a shame that this movie didn't featured a better and more compelling story in it. The movie does in fact feels rushed, as if the studios were in a hurry to shoot and release it, after the surprising big financial and critical success of the first "Iron Man" movie. It's a good continuation of the series but not one that is offering much new stuff. In fact, it's a bit of a more poorly done rehash, without all of the great wittiness and spectacle of the first movie. But perhaps this is also due to it that this movie feels less fresh, since we already are familiar with all of the characters and its universe.But still, the one thing that mostly was disappointing about this movie was its poor handling of the villain's story lines. But in all honesty, this also was the biggest problem of the first movie. It's a shame that this was something they didn't managed to do right this time around. The villains often aren't featured prominently enough and it's not always exactly clear who the main villain is supposed to be. Besides, their plot lines just aren't the most interesting ones and definitely also not original at all.Nothing wrong with the actors playing the characters though. Robert Downey Jr. once again returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is being sort of less likable this time, even while you are supposed to be sympathizing even more with him in this movie but hey, he is still being an awesome character and Robert Downey Jr., as always, did a more than good job. But there of course also are some additions to the cast this time. Mickey Rourke was a great villain but didn't always get used well and not enough throughout the entire movie. The one person I in fact was very fond of was Sam Rockwell, as Justin Hammer. This guy is such a great actor and lets hope he will get to reprise this role in future movies. I even wasn't all that bothered with Scarlett Johansson, as Black Widow. I actually thought she got incorporated into the story pretty well and wasn't distracting at all, as most other people seem to think.And really, this is not a bad movie at all. Even while it does plenty of stuff wrong, the movie still manages to bring some decent entertainment and also some good action. It's never boring to watch, since the story is always kept going and as far as big budget superhero flicks go, this still is being one of the better ones to watch out there.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire weapons designer/superhero/stand-up comedian Tony Stark. Unwilling to mass-produce his Iron Man suit, the race is on to replicate it. Justin Hammer played (Sam Rockwell) is the Bill Gates to Tony's Steve Jobs, evidenced by the stress on their competing arms expos. When Stark's showboating at a racetrack leads to a curiously well-timed showdown with a mysterious Russian named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), Hammer sees an opportunity to fund a project to surpass Tony's and win a lucrative military contract. Ivan has other ideas in mind, wanting to make Tony pay for the betrayal his father was dealt. Can Tony stop them? Will Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) finally accuse him of sexual harassment? Truth be told there are some funny lines and a couple of quality moments of comic book style action. There's also a ton of falsified marketing. Iron Man 2 is going to get your hopes up, then disappoint you with a ridiculous subplot. There is a tremendous lull in the action because Tony is forced to discover a cure for a blood-polluting toxin found in his arch reactor. It's not terribly interesting and it's brought in for what I like to call the "Batman Effect": the altering of a hero's costume for the purpose of merchandising.I know the first movie wasn't action heavy. It was the origin story explaining how Tony Stark became Iron Man and it was filled with witty jokes and banter between Tony and his secretary Pepper. Well for some reason it was decided to take out those sincere moments and throw in interloping arguments. Many conversations in Iron Man 2 can't be recalled because they consist of characters talking over one another.Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as Stark's go-to guy Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. Though Rhodes physically does more in this sequel, he seems to have less face time because Tony needs to talk to just about everyone else in the world. Now Tony is to meeting with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who you may not remember if you left Iron Man prior to the completion of the credits. Scarlett Johansson is brought on board for a role that equates to eye candy. Rather than see her emote like an android, I'd prefer some more time with Stark's robots. In the original, Stark's lab was a fun set where he tinkered with his suit while being assisted by his inventions. It was Frankenstein meets Pee-wee's Playhouse and it was one of the many strong points of Iron Man. I suppose that since he has his suit now he doesn't need to spend time in the lab, but the subplot that has him making adjustments is a tough pill to swallow. It's not unreasonable to say that his arch reactor is poisoning his blood, sure it's not a story line worth spending half the film on, but it's not unreasonable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as the first one. Then again, that'd be hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I watched this title straight after the terrible 2008 Iron Man out of some sort of masochistic instinct of mine. Luckily, the story in this second part is relatively better (or not as bad as). You will find the same excellent CGI and even more action. You will also find the same nonsense (such as how Tony Starks' friend in the military -he lost a bit of weight after the first part...- is able to pilot another "Iron Man" and steal it after winning a fight against Tony's Iron Man without apparently any training in the mechanics of the suit. Oh, yeah, Tony was drunk, so I guess that explains why he lost. And why his friend is able to control the other suit perfectly (?)). They tried to put a bit of more depth into the story and Tony's relation with his late father, which is something that goes in the right direction, regardless how shallow it still looks. Nevertheless, this is just another Hollywood super-production for teenagers and die-hard Iron Man fans I guess (if they liked the horrible first movie, I'm sure they'd love this one). Don't expect much apart from action and supposedly hot babes behaving badly. Special mention to Samuel "SnakesOnThePlane" Jackson for his role as Nick Fury. Another reason to forget this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2: A Few More Suits, No Additional Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2, much like the original, does a lot of things right. The special effects, the charisma, the characters, and the technology are all top notch. Watching Tony Stark play around in his massive, billion-dollar man cave makes every man/boy reconsider what he's doing with his life and why he didn't get into weaponry. So what's the problem? All the good stuff happens in the first 60-minutes, with the following 60 leaving not just a little, but a lot to be desired.This film opens up with the it's new villain, Ivan Vanko, played by Mickey Rourke, a Russian physicist hell bent on not only destroying Tony Stark, but also his reputation and his enterprise. By creating a device that sends electric volts through cable whips attached to his back and arms, he not only gives this film a boost of fresh air, but he also creates one of the most unique villains to date. CGI aside, this dude looks completely crazy, completely frightening, and the most impressive part: completely real.The rest of the story contains all the key characteristics of the original Iron Man, but makes them bigger, more exciting, and more out of control. The cars, the women, the style, the suits; it's all there. It doesn't feel old, per say, but it does feel a little outdated. My biggest concern, lies not in the fact that the film isn't innovative, it's that the film doesn't quite innovate enough. They start with an interesting villain, and turn him into something that's been done previously in Iron Man before; a man who creates another suit. They create Iron Man clones that don't do anything other than die at the push of a button or the shot of a gun. Iron Man and Tony Stark are still pushing boundaries, but everything around them is stuck in place. Where can the series go next? That's the exciting part.There's a lot of talk in this film about the Avengers, the future installment of the Marvel franchise that features Ant Man, Wasp, Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. Now whether or not these characters make it into the film of the same name is TBD, but it's safe to say that Iron Man is definitely going to play some part in piecing this film together and it might be exactly what this franchise needs to bring back the action and the energy we once thought that it had.If you're a guy, you're going to check out Iron Man 2 no matter what I say. To that, I say go ahead, see it for yourself. It's a high budget action adventure film about a man in an iron suit. It can't be that bad right? Correct. It's not that bad, it's just not quite what it could be for the feature length, only about one half.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a sequel or a prequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr's performance as the billionaire industrialist Tony Stark might actually be better than the original. He seems comfortable with his role and a lot of time is spent on his character development as Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts also delivers a better performance as Tony's assistant and love interest. The interaction between these two is better than ever. This is a much faster-paced superhero film than the original. The introduction of Stark as Iron Man is over and we are in the middle of his growing up. Throw into this mix Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) suiting up as War Machine for the first time and Mickey Rourke playing the vengeful villain Ivan Vanko, hell-bent on destroying Tony Stark, and you might think you have a better film than the original. A rarity in the film business. Unfortunately, the writers did not stop there. Much of this movie is spent on setting up an upcoming Avengers movie. This turned Iron Man from a sequel into an combination sequel/prequel. Samuel L. Jackson is brought in as Nick Fury, a name you will know if you are an Avengers fan. He first played this role in the Incredible Hulk. Now you must see two movies and have some concept of the Avengers before you can follow this movie. Fury's scenes are few and confusing. They break up the rhythm of the film and make the film incoherent. Introduce into this equation Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff and your Avengers prequel is complete. There is no doubt this movie is talent packed.They do not go seamlessly from one story concept to the other. A lot of focus seems to be on trying to force some cohesion between the two. The writing seems more focused on making sure we all know that there will be an Avengers movie. Tony Stark, however, has much worse lines in this movie than in the first. Instead of being self-confident and smooth with the ladies and press, he lacks any real social skill that would lead us to believe he's capable of impressing anybody. His character is really obnoxious at times in this movie. The action scenes show Romanoff as an incredible martial artist with what might be considered superhuman butt-kicking capabilities. Iron Man's fight scenes were rather anti-climatic. Iron Man has a power source more powerful than nuclear energy and the 100 pound girl is the tough one?They had a great sequel for Iron Man and then destroyed it. Oddly enough, this movie is still worth watching. This proves that, with enough talent and money, Hollywood can polish a turd. Wait for the DVD. I rate this six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came back from Iron Man 2 and it is a movie to be enjoyed. One feels like a young child watching this movie as it plays out like a comic book in front of the viewer. The pace and action of the movie are terrific. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting and presence in the movie carries it with charm and charisma and you like the Tony Starke character who unlike other comic book hero alter egos actually is not nebbish. Gwyneth Paltrow is good in this movie though she is more wallpaper in many of the scenes and the Sam Rockwell character was just a joy to watch. Mickey Rourke rocks in his role as he eats scenery with panache and yet his acting is so natural. If I had any problem with this movie was the presence of Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johanssen they were just draining on the movie. Jackson again plays the same character he has been playing for it seems the last 15-20 years and basically puts me off any movie he appears in while Scarlett may be easy to look at but what is the big deal about her acting she is listless and incredibly charisma free. The director Jon Favreau is superb and his acting is fun and basically grab your popcorn and get ready for the ride and with AC/DC music what else can one ask for. My rating 9 but the Jackson/Johannsen presence you lose 2 for a 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a comedy or an action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie just last night. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, I did, but for me this should be an action movie but there's a little too much comedy for my liking. I laughed a few times during the movie but my fellow movie-goers where laughing a lot more. The acting is not great. The first Iron man had better acting. Gwyneth Paltrow did a poor job this time around, Jon Favreau, you're the director stay in the director's chair, made the mistake of putting himself too much in the movie, Scarlett Johansson was a disappointment in this one but that may be do to the fact that she is using looking amazing in the movie and that may makeup for her inferior skills (she looked terrible, stay blonde), Don Cheadle is horrible in comedies and pretty great in drama/suspense unfortunately Iron man is not either of those, RDJr does fine as Tony just like the first movie, Mickey Rourke doesn't get much screen time in this one but does a nice job as one of the villains in the movie, never been much of a Samuel Jackson hater but in this movie he is not the right guy for the role. After seeing all this it's a wonder I rated the movie so high but it's the story and the action scenes that help this movie. If you like action and the comic book genre then this movie will satisfy your needs. If you don't like it then skip this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy but imperfect sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makers of Iron Man 2 should be commended for preserving most of the things that made part I so successful, without overdoing anything. Robert Downey Junior is wonderful as ever (though his playboy antics walk a very fine line between amusing and over-the-top). And Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely and charismatic as Pepper Pots, a rare superhero love interest who is attractive, intelligent and dignified in an understated way, which is something you don't often see in action pictures where women's independence is acceptable as an over-the-top novelty.Unfortunately, the goodwill generated by Paltrow's performance as an effortlessly worthy woman is squandered a bit on Scarlett Johanson, who is physically beautiful, but subscribes to the female-in-an-action-movie norm. She is too skinny to be a viable action hero, and dressed so slinkily that her sole function is clearly that of a sex object.The biggest problem with this movie is Samel L. Jackson, who has played the same role so many times he kills your suspension of disbelief. The man on screen is clearly Samuel L. Jackson wearing an eyepatch. His presence serves only as a distraction. Don Cheadle is a fine actor, but no better than Terrence Howard, and its a shame the filmmakers couldn't have brought him back.Otherwise, the film has some problems with logical plotting and characters' motivations aren't always clear (i.e. the brawl between Iron Men at Tony's birthday party). However, it is funny, entertaining, exciting, and subtly thoughtful, with implications about world peace and arms dealing which feels like a breath of fresh air amidst all the current action pictures' assumption that their audiences have a 2nd grade comprehension level.The bottom line is, if you liked part I, you'll enjoy part II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not compare to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw Iron Man 2 over the weekend at the local drive-in. Sadly I think I would have preferred to wait for the DVD. Not that the movie is awful, but it really is lacking some cohesion. The film seems to jump from scene to scene without a lot of background explanation. For example: Stark and company travel to Monaco for a corporate event where a Formula I race is taking place. Stark steps away to get a drink and reappears a minute later on the track itself, dressed in a racing suit. He makes a quick public statement about racing his own race car and jumps in to his Formula I racer. We are left wondering just where did the car come from and just how did he make this quick change? Rourke's, "Whiplash" suffers horribly from character development. This is a true disappointment, because he was convincingly maniacal in all of his scenes. I would have loved to see and learn more about him. He is supposed to be Iron Man's equal adversary and his screen time reduces him to an annoying thorn in Iron Man's side. The climatic fight scene is totally unsatisfying and just hammers that point home more. It ended too abruptly.ScarJo's "Natalie," seems like an after thought. She transforms from a mild-mannered pretty secretary - with very few lines - to a near superhero fighting what seems like an endless array of security guards and we're not even informed as to who she is and where gets her butt-kicking talent from. A few minor hints to the fact that was more than just a pretty face might have made her shine more than just for her looks.Robert Downey, Jr. is the only real bright light here. His portrayal of Tony Stark is lively and amusing and is on par with the original film. The downside is that we don't get to see as much of Tony Stark being Iron Man as we want. It seems that he's in the suit more for parties and promos than he is for actual superhero work. A serious flaw here.As for Don Cheadle, he is good as Rhodes, but his character needs A LOT of explanation. It is the biggest flaw in the film. I think anybody who has seen IM2 is wondering the same thing: Just how was Rhodes able to operate an Iron Man suit like a pro in a manner of minutes when we were told that the suits were calibrated just to Stark thus rendering it impossible for anyone else to run them? Not to mention the fact that it took Stark weeks to learn how to operate it himself? There are other open-ended questions that are posed by the film that I could write about. But these are the main points that stood out for me. Regardless, it is still entertaining. Just not nearly as much as the original. It's still worthy of a look if only to see RDJ's performance as Stark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man made of Iron!? Are they MAD!? Frankly, I would have just used a giant magnet to beat him in the first instalment. But alas! They didn't listen, now Downey is suited up in CGI again to return in this sequel. At first look at the opening of the film, seeing Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash (Rourke), give an unconvincing, whimpering shout as his dad peacefully dies; immediately, 'don't laugh, it's supposed to be serious' is the first thought that crosses the mind. But then away from that hideous piece of acting, and after the long, long, ever so long title sequence, the film really starts to begin. The plot isn't a surprising one, as Vanko coincidentally is a super villain physicist (that old chestnut) who knows how to create the palladium energy source and tries to sell it to Hammer (Rockwell). Meanwhile, Stark has some trouble's of his own, and has to find a new element to stop the palladium's toxicity from killing him. Besides the fact he has an army of droids coming to kick his metal American ass. The narrative is relatively easy to follow and most people will understand it, except the one person with the east London accent who always says, "I don't get it" to any film that wasn't created by Disney. Downey does give another sublime, cheeky performance, saying his cute one liners and woman-wooing ways that makes you giggle. Apart from his comedy; everything else is pretty much dark and serious which isn't always the best road to go down when making a film about a super hero, for example, Spider Man 3. Oh dear. But Favreau does manage to dodge the bullet with putting Downey and his light hearted ways on camera nearly all of the time. No pressure Robert! As for the rest of the cast, pretty average and almost shadowed behind the lead. The action sequences are much more complex in this film, which is more eye pornography than meaningful. As there is more talking and witty banter between characters in this film, the fighting scenes are neglected and only a few are shown, which makes you savour them, like it's the last Fruit Pastel in a tube. The special effects are typical of a tent pole movie; well constructed with a perfect shine to make you believe they're real which overall adds to quite an intense effect. If you really want the full experience of this film's fighting sequences, you have to see it at an IMAX. Overall, Iron Man 2 is a watchable sequel with a few moments that have to be seriously tweaked, but definitely worth the price of an admission ticket with the friends. Plus the soundtrack is awesome, AC/DC and SugarHill Gang in the same movie!? Count me in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbalanced: too much talking, and not enough tension, action, or excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of being called "Iron Man 2," the title of this film should read, "Iron Man's Day Off" because we spend so little time with Iron Man and more time with endless scenes of boring conversation and arguing. When you actually find yourself genuinely annoyed at fictional characters for, frankly, just talking too much, it's a clear sign of a film with flaws. Remember that feeling when you've just begun your 40 minute commute to work, and the radio-show you're listening to is about to do an interesting bit? Instead, 40 minutes later, the over-talkative DJ is still stuck on the same silly rant from the beginning of your commute and because of a 9 o'clock meeting you never get to hear the bit. This is Iron Man 2 the longer it played out. Example - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Warhammer (Don Cheadle) are planning for the final showdown we've been waiting for at the film's climax. In my head, this scene still has not ended: "You stand there, because if I stand there I (insert sarcastic comment). Okay, deal!" Great, now we're finally getting down to business, as both characters then go off for battle. But one of them stops. "Wait, I don't like this, what if you..." as they suddenly walk back to argue some more. Well by this point in the film, only a lobotomy-patient would not want to yell "Just go fight the bleeding robots! Stop proving to the audience how funny and sarcastic you are and go do something cool! We've been waiting 90 boring minutes since the racetrack battle for something else remotely exciting to happen!" The first 20-30 minutes of IM2 are easily the best as the introduction of Ivan Vanko character, played effortlessly by Mickey Rourke, sets up what you think will be an interesting story. The opening action at the racetrack was well-executed, exciting, and is the highlight of the film. This is also the point where the film lost its steam. The next 90 minutes is constant chatter ? most of it uninteresting - and moments of interaction that almost over-emphasize the quirkiness of the characters as opposed to providing any real tension. These quirks and imperfections to the characters were positive qualities of the first film but are overdone here. Apart from the story, the character interactions by themselves are well written and very funny at times. But at @ 1:15 into the film I remember thinking, enough of the humor, enough of the tedium, when is something of tension, interest, or action going to happen? More of these boring scenes serve no other purpose than linking themselves to a 10-second gag in the film's final moments. By the time the grand finale arrives, you feel like you've just walked out of a tax seminar and really don't care to see any action because you just want to sleep. If you are still awake by the time the action arrives you'll get something that falls far short of any reward for surviving 90 minutes of sheer boredom. The finale is a 5 minute fight with the drones as the Iron Men return fire while flying through the air, which was nothing too innovative or blow-you-away exciting. The only great moment following the flying-around involved Rourke's character making a final appearance, but it is over in almost 30 seconds. And when I say "30 seconds" I don't mean it as hyperbole, it really is this short. Ivan Vanko repeats the words "drone better!" during the middle of the film. The filmmakers must have said the same, in favoring a story which drones on and on like a robot with little humanity inside ? despite a semi-moving back-story involving Stark's father (played straightforwardly by Mad Men's John Slattery). Still, pacing is what killed this film. This is an Iron Man film but we get so few moments of him in action, or anything in the way of excitement. The action in the first film felt far more personal and well-conceived. I do though place strong exception on the racetrack scene ? the golden egg of the sequel. Still, the rest of the constant conversation in IM2 wasn't interesting enough to be enjoyable, and because of this you'll just want to see action if you aren't asleep yet. This is the clearest symptom of story and pacing issues. I'll also mention that Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) was a hard character to read - was he a villain, or was he just a feeble and tragic figure? I never quite knew what to feel for him. I kept waiting for him to shed the sideshow act and show a genuine and serious tone with serious resolve, but this never happens and ultimately he goes out with a whimper instead of a bang. The other addition, Scarlett Johansen's Black Widow, provided great eye-candy but her character really wasn't given much to do in the film's 2 hours.Overall this is a comedy/drama film with a couple stops for action - which to me translates for an incredibly uneven film for this genre, especially for something as potentially through-the-roof entertaining as Iron Man can be! Talking doesn't necessarily mean boring, but the story wasn't nearly gripping enough for the constant yapping to be an interesting listen. Of all the stories which could have been told, this was the best they had for us? By itself this film is not a bad one, but compared to the first it was a disappointment. The name of the game was "unbalanced." The lack of tension and panache to the story (after the 30 minute mark) made the action feel like an afterthought when it finally arrived, and made even the humor feel as tedious as a trip to the DMV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed this even more than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this superhero sequel. I wonder, if I had seen the original in a better theater, would I have liked it as much as I did this one? I don't know. I've never had a desire to rewatch it and, as much as I enjoyed part 2, I'm not sure I'd ever rewatch it, either. But I'll be there for part 3. What most impressed me about this one is that they added a whole host of new elements, but didn't let them drag the film down by making it overlong or overcomplicated. The whole Avengers thing is deftly handled. I actually find that whole concept pretty funny, because it banks on the fact that all the other Marvel franchises are going to be just as successful as this one when we already know that they won't be (see the last Hulk movie - are they going to have to reboot it again in order to work it into the Avengers movie?). The Iron Man movies just have a lot of things going for them. First off, the cast is just amazing. Robert Downey Jr. is a big part of the success here. Gwyneth Paltrow, while not as good an actress as she was a decade ago, holds her own nicely opposite Downey. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Lt. Col. James Rhodes. Both are strong performers, but, for sentimental reasons (i.e., Boogie Nights), I prefer Cheadle. The sequel adds Sam Rockwell as Tony Stark's chief rival. Mickey Rourke is a Russian physicist/gangster who comes after Stark. Sam Jackson is in the sequel a lot more (his only appearance in the original was post-credits). Scarlett Johansson plays a mysterious intern hired by Paltrow. She clearly has some secrets. And Jon Favreau himself is great as Stark's bodyguard (well, Iron Man doesn't really need a bodyguard, I suppose; maybe Happy Hogan is his assistant?). Favreau is a pretty good director. I especially like the way he integrates humor into the film without going overboard with it. Downey's subtle hilarity helps a lot in that respect, but there's a spirit of improv to a lot of the dialogue that's just a lot of fun. Justin Theroux, whom you may remember as an actor in Mulholland Dr., actually wrote the screenplay for the sequel (his only previous screenplay being Tropic Thunder, which netted Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination), so he gets a lot of credit for keeping it all together. The film doesn't actually contain a ton of action sequences - only three really big ones (and they all deliver), so it's quite impressive how entertaining the film is from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel that is on par with its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not quite the pinnacle of its genre that some people make it out to be, the first Iron Man was a ton of fun. It was further proof that comic book movies could successfully be made for both fans and those unfamiliar with the source material. Iron Man 2, while not the surprise hit that the original was, is ? for the most part ? on par with its predecessor.First off, one of the primary complaints that I've heard from many people is that there is too much of a focus on S.H.I.E.L.D. members Nick Fury and Black Widow, and that their mere inclusion in the film only bog the movie down. To that, I wholeheartedly disagree. I found that there were enough hints throughout that subplot to get the audience excited about The Avengers, but not so many that the film lost sight of what its goal was. The focus of this movie is indeed on Tony Stark, and while it's true that there are a few subplots that occur throughout the film, I never felt that they interfered with the coherence of the storytelling.Even those who absolutely loved the first Iron Man will admit that the action was somewhat lacking, particularly the battle with Iron Monger at the end of the film, and this is where Iron Man 2 outdoes its predecessor the most. Not only is there quantitatively a bit more action to be found in this sequel, but also in terms of quality, I think it's a step up. The climax of this film, especially, is exhilarating from beginning to end.The performances and characters in Iron Man 2 are also very solid. Robert Downey Jr. is as charming and witty as he was last time around, further solidifying himself as the most spot-on comic book movie hero. The banter between him and Gwyneth Paltrow is also just as endearing, and the scenes that do focus on their relationship is time well spent. Don Cheadle is also great as Rhodey, as I bought him more as a military man than I did Terrence Howard in the first film. That being said, there is one scene involving his character that's just baffling (and you'll know it when you see it).Mickey Rourke, surprisingly, does a fine job as Whiplash, and while I think just a bit more time could've been spent developing his character, I'm starting to believe that the Iron Man villains aren't really important to the series in the same way that the ones from most other comic book movie franchises are. It's a pretty good thing, too, considering that I found the character of Justin Hammer to be, well, awful. To me, he just came across as a cartoon character, and I never once bought him as an intelligent multibillionaire.Iron Man 2 is a worthy successor to a great comic book film, and an excellent start to the summer movie season. Despite a few too many moments that ask the audience to suspend their disbelief, as well as one pretty pitiful villain, the film succeeds with its endearing characters, solid action, and engaging story. Also, stay after the credits?again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 is a blast (sort of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first Iron Man hit the theaters, it surprised both critics and the general audience, eventually acquiring enough acclaim and, more importantly, box office revenue to turn this once-unknown comic book hero into a major franchise. The crisp, witty dialogue and smart casting transformed what could have been a generic origin story into something that felt original and fun. In this era of dark, brooding antiheroes, the wisecracking, irreverent Tony Stark was a breath of fresh air. For the sequel, Jon Favreau and co. have made something bigger, flashier but, unfortunately, not better. To their credit, it is clear that they paid enough attention when the original was released to know exactly what made it work, but almost everything that felt so effortless before became more forced and tired in the sequel.Iron Man 2's promotion has touted it, not wrongly, as the first major blockbuster of the season and as one of the most highly-anticipated movies of 2010. In hopes of living up to this hype, Favreau assembled an impressive ensemble cast that includes new additions Don Cheadle, a replacement for Terrence Howard after the latter had a much-publicized dispute with Marvel Studios; Mickey Rourke, who, like lead Robert Downey Jr., has been making a comeback in recent years; Scarlett Johannson; the generally under-appreciated Sam Rockwell; Samuel L. Jackson, whose character serves little purpose beyond setting up and shamelessly promoting the upcoming Avengers movie; and, of course, Favreau himself. While that is no doubt an eye-popping cast list, few of them really bring anything new to the film. Don Cheadle fails to bring his natural charisma to the fairly bland role of Rhodey, while Mickey Rourke sports an imposing Russian accent and body tattoos but is not given enough by the script to turn Ivan Vanko/Whiplash into the great villain he should have been. Likewise, Johannson is given little to do aside from being a sexy (naturally) blank slate, though she does shine in the one scene where she gets to show off the martial arts and hand-to-hand combat she learned for the role. In a performance reminiscent of Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge in last year's Avatar or of Gary Oldman in pretty much any of his villainous roles, Sam Rockwell is delightfully campy at times, but his character is irritatingly sleazy where he should have been suave and cunning. Like Vanko, Justin Hammer is woefully underdeveloped, becoming little more than your average, slimy but ultimately asinine and clueless baddie. In short, they all satisfy without wowing.As for the Iron Man veterans, there are really only two: Gwyneth Paltrow and, of course, Robert Downey Jr. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts in the first movie. She was professional without being a shrew, coy and charming but not flirtatious. In the sequel, however, Paltrow is, to but it bluntly, grating. It's not all her fault. Recently appointed CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper has become shrill and uptight, and she seems to spend the majority of her days chastising someone, usually Tony Stark, but also the press, Scarlett Johannson's Natascha and pretty much anyone that gets in her way even briefly. On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr. is almost as wonderful as he was when he first donned Iron Man's suit. I say "almost" because fame has made Stark a slightly bigger jerk than he was before (i.e. a party scene that goes cringingly awry), and the self-professed "textbook narcissism" and sarcasm are a little less charming; some of his quips feel less organic and off-the-cuff, and more as though screenwriter Justin Theroux felt pressured to just throw them in there. Still, Robert Downey Jr. brings so much magnetic charisma, energy and, at times, even vulnerability to the screen that we continue to root for Tony Stark after he exposes his most glaring flaws.In addition, something must be said about the Tony Stark-Pepper Potts romance. Before, Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow sizzled together, and, aside from undeniable chemistry, the main reason their romance was so alluring was that it was hardly a romance at all. It was a big mistake to have them kiss so soon, especially in a scene as hackneyed as this one, as, though the scene does not actually occur until the end, merely knowing about it beforehand, as I did, somehow makes their relationship lose much of its appeal.Don't get me wrong, though. Iron Man 2 has made some improvements from its predecessor, namely the action sequences. In the first one, Favreau's inexperience with the action/thriller genre was apparent, particularly in the lame showdown at the climax. In the sequel, the fight scenes are loud, over-the-top and riddled with clichés - from a scene where each bad guy conveniently approaches on his own to at least three instances of "guy walks away while something explodes behind him" - but they are still more impressive than those in the original, perhaps thanks to an upgraded budget. There is just something so amusing and enjoyable about seeing cars flipping over whilst bursting into flames or seeing a giant, metal globe exploding. I particularly enjoyed both Scarlett Johannson's kicking-ass moment and the climatic battle where Stark and Rhodes confront dozens of drone robots controlled by Vanko while bickering about whose suit is better.The combination of fun action scenes, dazzling visuals, moments of inspired dialogue and some good acting almost, but does not quite, redeem the script, which has a rather thin, sometimes confusing plot further muddled by the inclusion of at least one too many subplots and poor development of the characters and relationships. But perhaps, I'm being overly critical. After all, Iron Man exists largely to entertain and, for the most part, it succeeds in that goal. If you're looking to kick back with friends while watching a breezy blockbuster, then Iron Man 2 is probably just the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 lacks Mettle - Original whips Sequel by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shrek 2, Spider-Man 2 and Superman 2 are a few examples where the return was better then the debut. Sorry to say Iron Man 2 is just a bridge to prepare folk for both Avengers and Thor from Marvel's line-up.Stan Lee made his usual cameo as one of the well-wishers when Tony Stark was exiting from his year-long Expo. However, the real scene stealer was Scarlett Johanssen as Natasha Romanov/Natalie Rushman as the Black Widow she kicked everyone's butt including Director Jon Favreau as 'Happy' Hogan, Stark's bodyguard &amp; coach (sic).Mickey Rourke was made to appear highly intelligent as a physicist/hacker gone way wrong - Ivan Vanko son of a Howard Stark collaborator. If you're a comics purist you know that "Whiplash" (never called so in the picture) was an American by name of Scarlotti.Don Cheadle as James "Rhodey" Rhodes/War Machine was a poor man's Terence Howard. The interaction of not Batman and Robin so much as the interaction of Robert Downey's excellent "Sherlock Holmes" where he sparred verbally and even physically with Jude Law as Dr Watson.Marvel, wishing to appear Politically Correct, have transformed Colonel Nick Fury (once portrayed by Caucasian David Hassellhoff, admittedly God knows why he was picked) into Afro-American Samuel L. Jackson, who's role as Director of S*H*I*E*L*D seems now to be a sop for the fact that both Cheadle and Howard were second fiddles to Robert Downey Jr's title role.Some highpoints included when Tony Stark though he was dying and got blasted on booze and was treating Champagne bottles like clay skeets; the initial War Machine and Iron Man conflict in Stark's Malibu Mansion and of course, what happens after the credits at the very end of the film - Odin forbid me revealing!While an acceptable li'l pot-boiler, the reality is you're better off watching the first Iron Man twice, since the thrill in the current flick will rust out fast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man was awesome but Iron Man 2 falls into the just good category. The main reasons for that is because of small loop holes in the script and not very good action sequences . In Iron Man 1 in the scene where Iron Man goes to save a village he launches a mini missile to destroy a tank and slowly walks away from the tank as its blown up in the background that was the first time that I actually shouted "wohoo" in a movie theater for an English movie. The action sequences in Iron Man 2 just did'nt have the "wohoo" factor. When comes to performances there is no need to say anything about the cast they are just so apt and perfect for their roles . But sadly an actor with talent like Mickey Rourke is left out as he has very less screen time but he surely does make his presence felt. In the end Iron Man 2 is a good but its former was much better in every aspect. Final verdict watch it for Robert Downey Jr. and the climax ( not becuz it's awesome but if you are a fan of Avengers this is where it begins ).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pewter Man -- Not quite Iron Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost: go see this movie while it is in the theaters. It's a great "big screen" movie: lots of special effects, big sound and big scenery. Lots of reasons to see it in the theater. Mickey Rourke STEALS THE SHOW, in my opinion. I didn't detect a hint of fakery in his Russian accent (and I'm pretty sensitive to stuff like that), his acting was flawless and he was perfectly cast in this role.Another reason to see this movie is that it's pretty hilarious. It's almost a comedy, it's so damn funny. There are inside jokes and outside jokes and side-side jokes. Just enough humor to make it funny, but not so much that it turns into a farce.Now the bad news. I won't go as far as to say that I was disappointed in this movie, but two things occurred to me in the middle of it. First, as usual with superhero movies, this movie looks and feels like an advertisement to sell a video game of the movie. Scenes where Iron Man weaves his way through pylons under a bridge, or when he breaks out of a geodesic dome with Oracle's name inexplicably on the side, or when he mows down twenty drones with a new secret weapon on the suit, have you imagining a pimply-faced teenager (or not-so-teenager) sitting in his parents' basement manipulating his Wii controller. Second, as with the first Iron Man, there is a TON of product placement in this movie. Audi, Oracle -- they even had a product placement on his water bottle after the boxing scene (although the sponsor is escaping me at the moment).One of the biggest complaints I have with superhero movies is they feel compelled after the first movie (especially if it's wildly successful like Iron Man was) to show the main character as a flawed or dependent or as a tragic character. This drives me crazy. If you're a fan of the comic books, you will see that these characters have pasts (most of the time) and they have secrets, but there's no overriding FLAWS in their character -- that's why they're superheroes! Hollywood INSISTS on bringing the tortured angst of the character forward to try to get us to connect with his (or her) human element. I don't want them to be human. I want my superheroes to be superheroes, even if they are human. Spiderman did this in the second and third movies (the third one was a disaster) in my opinion), the Hulk has done it (twice), and I'm sure there are others.Another problem I had with this movie was Gwyneth Paltrow. She is UNBELIEVABLY ANNOYING throughout this entire movie. She was so charming in the first movie and the writers simply spoiled her character by turning her into a SHREW. I wanted to punch her in the face. I also wanted to see more of Scarlett Johansson. She is BEYOND yummy. I would eat her liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.All-in-all this is a good movie. It's not a great movie, but the success of the original was going to be difficult to duplicate. It will do well in the theaters and it will likely break box office records in the first weekend. The DVD will sell at Christmas and the Wii video game will sell out. It could have been a better movie, but it isn't and we can look forward to Iron Man 3. The good news is that sequels usually suck, but they seem to learn their lessons, get the garbage all out of their systems and the third one is usually better for it. Maybe they feel they don't really have anything to prove at that point.One final note: MAKE SURE YOU STAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE CREDITS!!! There's a vignette at the end that gives you a hint of what's to come. It's very short, but you don't want to miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie enough. Aside from feeling burned by my theater's new $11 ticket price, ouch, I had a good time. But I give most credit to the audience with whom I watched this movie at 12:01am on the eve of the opening. The theater was quite full and those people are fanatic, laughing louder and making more whooping noises, clapping often, at stuff that most audiences would let pass in silence.The story was a bit simple, incomplete. Left me really unsatisfied. But if you want all the same stuff from the original: Tony Stark's ego, hot chick diversions, an evil dude and some government red tape as antagonists, then this basic rehash of the original is good for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say it straight ? Iron Man 2 is good, not great. I definitely liked it but nowhere as much as the first film.Specifically, Iron Man 2's plot does not seem that interesting and as such the narrative relied on special effects for impact in certain scenes. No matter how fantastic or bombastic action and effects could get, they just don't help the storytelling very much. The new antagonists ? Justin Hammer and Whiplash ? are both weak and not compelling. They both pale in comparison to Obadiah Stane (brilliantly played by Jeff Bridges) in terms of personality and antagonism. Don Cheadle as Col. Rhodes/War Machine never felt like he belonged in the film and the more he appeared on screen, the more I wished Terence Howard was back.I also felt that the comedy in this film seemed forced. While the first flick made me laugh or smile, the sequel did not amuse me very much. While Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance as Tony Stark is worth praise, I find it weird that Stark now seemed more psychotic?a far change from the conflicted man he was before.Aside from Downey's stellar performance, the other big redeeming value was the film's adaptation of character elements from the critically acclaimed Iron Man comic storyline Demon in a Bottle. In that storyline, Stark was portrayed with an addiction to liquor and this concept was nicely portrayed in Iron Man 2. Expect to see Robert Downey, Jr. drink and drink a lot.Having waited two years for Iron Man 2, I felt a bit disappointed. I tried to like the film. It is not a bad movie, but more of a less compelling continuation. The distraction scenes (leading to the Avengers) and the improved action scenes simply could not lift the film's weak story. Adding insult to injury, the final battle with Whiplash is totally unsatisfying to watch.As long as you don't set your expectations very high, Iron Man 2 can be enjoyable. Clearly its presentation is different from the first film, and that made it less enjoyable for me. While you watch Iron Man 2 in the theater, I'll just replay Iron Man on my DVD player.Score: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to love this sequel as I loved the original, and yes, it is pretty good. It just could have been so much better without it's one major flaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering it had such big iron shoes to fill, I thought this sequel didn't exactly disappoint. Scarlett and Sam were nice additions. Mickey was OK even though he wasn't as good as the other two. The Cheadle replacement was a pretty weird change but it didn't F things up. RDJ had some pretty good banter with everybody, as ought to be expected nowadays in a movie with him in it. Gwyneth was nice to see again even though they cut out her best scene, the helmet-tossing from the original trailer.Speaking of the trailer, after seeing it I was worried that the movie might be watered down like Spiderman 3 with too many villains, but while SM3 shouldn't have included both Venom and Sandman, IM2 works well enough adding Whiplash and Justin Hammer. Like SM3, it also had an unnecessary dancing scene, but RDJ's wasn't the deal-breakingly dumb dance that Tobey's was.Overall, was it worth seeing? Absolutely, it was worth seeing. I certainly don't think I'm going to feel as bad liking it down the road as I do when I think about what a mess both Pirates 2 &amp; 3 were. IM2 didn't screw up the franchise, and it's definitely still sequel-worthy.But unfortunately RDJ worries about dying through much of the film, and that is the sequel's major flaw. While his issues were made to make sense in the context of the film, I've got to admit that having RDJ secretly mope around by himself worrying about his own mortality wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It dampens the movie's spirit, and I wished the filmmakers had gone in another direction with the character instead. It's like you can hear the pre-movie round-table discussion, "Iron Man had depth in the first one because he made the decision to stop making weapons...But how do we try and add some depth this time around?...I know, we'll make him sick from his suit...he'll struggle with dying most of the film" It's too bad that decision didn't end up on the cutting room floor because that whole story arc, leading up to his father having the chance to save him from the grave, just didn't feel necessary. It was subtraction by addition. They didn't need to try to add any more depth to Tony Stark, face it, he s enough of an admirable icon as it is. He's rich, cool, funny, and has always has especially hot and interesting women populating his world. Not only does manage to pull off all of that but he also has a conscience and flies around in one of the best tech gadgets ever -- enough already, they should have left it at that. Just have him show up and do it again, let's hang out with Tony Stark one more time, that's all the IM2 crew needed to do.But by making "Will he or won't he survive?" Tony's central conflict, it had at least a minor buzzkill effect on everything else too. By threatening to kill off Tony with the story arc they chose, IM2's crew tried just a little too hard to add unnecessary depth to a character we already liked. In a lesser movie this flaw of having a popular character suffer through a life-threatening circumstance might have killed the film, but luckily it pulls off some new twists and retains enough of the original's familiar virtues to still be able to recommend the new effort. RDJ's Tony Stark is still rich, cool and funny, and even though it took him most of this sequel, he now seems to have recovered his health, too. With any luck his poisoned suit issues are now behind him and he'll be back to his regular self in Iron Man 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Worst Sequels Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that made Iron Man such a refreshing, entertaining &amp; thrilling ride is completely lost in this sequel as the third instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is possibly their worst film to date, is a pathetic follow-up to what was &amp; still remains a fascinating action- adventure, and even Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma is unable to conceal its poor narrative &amp; shoddy execution.Set six months after the events of the first film, Iron Man 2 continues the story of Tony Stark and covers the intense media attention he's been enjoying after revealing his identity as Iron Man to the whole world while resisting the US government who covets his technology &amp; battling his own personal health as well for his arc reactor is poisoning him. And we also have a new enemy in town pursuing a personal vendetta against Stark.Directed by Jon Favreau, it's hard to believe that it's the same guy who helmed the last feature for he seems to have forgotten everything that made the previous film work. The screenplay is terrible from the start for the concept looks clear but it lacks refinement on deeper levels. Cinematography is fine, Editing makes sure every irrelevant scene makes its way into the final print &amp; there's nothing new to add about its score.Coming to the performances, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke &amp; Sam Rockwell join the reprising cast while Don Cheadle takes over Terrence Howard's role but not even one of them is good enough. Downey Jr. retains his charm n wit but even he fails to bring back the magic that was there the last time, Rourke started well but is then completely sidelined until the end, Johansson fails to make a big impression while Rockwell is surprisingly forgettable.On an overall scale, Iron Man 2 is a major step down when compared to its predecessor, is a massive downgrade in quality in all filmmaking aspects &amp; a definite loss of opportunity to build something spectacular after such a brilliant platform was provided to it by the first film. Even the action is pretty boring &amp; is over way too quick, the villain isn't intimidating enough &amp; majority of its characters are treated as caricatures. One of the worst sequels ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sequel, though not as bad as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My least favourite Iron Man film, and for a good reason. Whereas the first Iron Man film was a great origins film, this film had the burden of answering the question "then what?". And it drops the ball, completely.Well, okay, perhaps that's not exactly fair. It's not a bad film, no sir. For one, the villain (played by Mickey Rourke) is very good. Rourke is a great actor, though he has a tendency to always play the exact some role of a grizzly badass, and that doesn't change, but he always throws in a little variety to keep it interesting. Ivan Vanko in this film always has this look on his face, like he's internally grinning at you, because you fail to impress him. A man always in charge, even while in chains, frighteningly brilliant and at times even unstoppable. In short, an excellent villain.Furthermore, Robert Downey Jr. is still an amazing Tony Stark. His few opening scenes are pure gold, especially the hearing, and when he acts out the vulnerability of the character, I believe it. The problem here isn't the acting, it's the writing. I've enjoyed the fact that Tony Stark always fights villains that he has created himself. Likewise in this case, which is fine, but otherwise they took a huge step backwards with the character of Tony. And this is a common sequel mistake where the main character seems to have learned nothing from the events of the first film. Tony Stark in this film seems to recess back to that egoistical jerk that we saw at the beginning of the first film. Granted, they at least try to justify it by pointing out that Tony is the sort of man to do things like that, but it still feels wrong somehow. We expected more from you, Tony.And it doesn't help that the film tries to force in a subplot about Tony's dead father and all the usual clichés that go along with that storyline. It's tedious, it's boring, it's not needed and the film really should have focused on the villain and the newly-found responsibilities of being a superhero maintaining world peace. Not this unconvincing emotional busywork.This film has its ups and downs. I love the action, the visuals and the music. I like the villain very much and I like the returning actors. But the story just isn't that strong and the film lacks focus. If you're a fan of the superhero genre and you liked the first film, you're not going to hate this one. It's not great, like the original, but it's decent.</fullReview>

"So I'm told."Whoa! Zip! Bam! Bing! Move over Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn! Honestly, was anyone really laughing at dialog that lame? The deeper problem isn't just that the dialog is bad, it's that the makers of the movie didn't care! Everything would be forgiven, they felt, because of the wonderful special effects.I pray that Hollywood soon moves beyond our current "can you top this?" phase and returns to the basics of good film making: Plot, characters, dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without decent writing, movies don't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no story in this movie, and that makes it deathly dull to sit through. All the action sequences are emotionally dead, because there's nothing really at stake. The actors find things to do but they're killing time without any real goals. It's all just an exercise in cashing in on a guaranteed huge paycheck by doing a sequel to a successful action movie. Producer Kevin Feige at Marvel Studios is the primary person I blame. His movies are crap. All the X-Men movies, The Incredible Hulk, Spider Man 2, the first Iron Man, and a bunch of others: all garbage in my opinion. If you saw 'em and loved 'em then I guess you're the intended audience for this stuff. It's tragic that he makes so many movies. I love a good effects movie with a strong story. Great effects support action, science fiction, fantasy, all of which have the potential to be great films. In the last couple of years I loved Inception by producer/director Chris Nolan, and Ninja Assassin and Speed Racer both produced by Joel Silver. Or the older films produced by Buzz Feitshans (Conan, Total Recall) or James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2). These films had strong stories supported by gorgeous visual effects. But they are in the minority. More commonly today we see emotionally dead special effects movies. These films are costly and control is put in the hands of cautious, lowbrow producers who don't seem to know what a good screenplay is. People like Basil Iwanyk (Clash of the Titans, Firewall), Micheal Bay (Transformers, Armageddon), Jerry Bruckheimer (Prince of Persia, Pirates of the Caribbean). Again, if those are films you love, ignore my review.I realize these guys make most of Hollywood's dollars, but I think their stuff is crap. Once in a while a pig of a producer finds a truffle like Bruckheimer's Black Hawk Down, but Bruckheimer doesn't then wait for years for the next great project to come along. These guys are in the business of making product. There's a Nick Cage vehicle to crank out.Meanwhile in the low budget world, directors and actors have much more clout and they also tend to have much better taste. I don't believe we will ever be rescued from this torrent of big budget crap. The audience does not read reviews. They go on the basis of buzz and trailers--basically marketing, plus some word of mouth. And they follow stars much more than directors or producers. The focus on a big marketing push to get a huge opening weekend shows no sign of weakening. 3D is making matters worse as well by driving costs even higher, causing execs to be even more cautious. I will take the good stories where I can get them. I prefer a good story to be backed up by lavish production values. Pixar seems to keep their artistic integrity even with Disney over their shouldr. I'm excited to see Enter The Void, an effects heavy French production. But it's the low budget and indie world that cares more about story, so those will be the movies that get most of my dollars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the first Iron Man and rather enjoyed it. I did hear they made this one and saw the trailer. I must say, trailers are very deceiving.The story started off OK, but then we saw the main villain (Roark, who didn't have much dialogue through out the movie). We sort of knew why he was being the villain, but we didn't know anything else about him.The action scenes just ended way too quickly and the rest of the film seemed it was just about Stark acting like an arrogant prat, which I thought got very slow.The acting performances were pretty good, but Scarlett Johansen performance just kept saying to me "look how beautiful I am". But the rest of the cast did well.There is also this big commotion about the ACDC soundtrack released, I only counted 1 or 2 songs played in the film, that was it. They didn't even play Black Sabbath's Iron Man at all, which I thought was annoying because it's a great song.All in all, it was average and nowhere near as good as the first movie. I did hear people liked this because of the comic, so to the people who liked it, I'm sorry if being a bit too strong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It does not feel like a whole thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is simple no point of comparison between The Dark Knight and IM2 and if we could all see what each one is you can see why IM2 ends up failing.For starters Iron Man2 tries to be at the same time a teaser of Avengers. a decent sequel, a funny summertime movie. Within these three responsibilities Iron Man2 has to be taken within a bigger cannon, and as such it is not a whole thing in itself.That could be good as it happened with The Incredible Hulk (As it managed to homage the 70s series, felt much more like a sequel (Even if it wasn't) to Hulk than this is to IM, and delivering both a complete story yet full of natural hints as teaser of the Iniciative) But Favreau or rather the whole production team decided to spent money paying a more than famous artist to do the storyboard rather than keep an actor who performed well enough in the first one. I am by no means doubting the talent of Cheadle and I know that Katie Holmes was successfully replaced in The Dark Knight (But Maggie not only does not jump that obviously to the sight, no, she has few scenes and the importance of the character comes from the memories, significance of her appearance rather than the character actions in themselves) Don simply makes the whole thing does not feel like an aesthetic unity anymore.This comes as the biggest problem for me if only because no one else is giving it importance, but this is the kind of thing that would get attention if it happened to Ron Weasley. But it is not the only one. Iron Man 2 feels overstuffed, it has cool characters that feel a little forced into the mix (The SHIELD agents Natasha and Fury) Certainly Mickey Rourke could have done much more, and Sam Rockwell delivers greatly that much I can tell you.Some people will see the "Element" creation as something a little over the top, but it is not except for the Captn reference, not subtle and cool like in the first one.Iron Man2 is fun, yes, and the special effects are a la pair with the first movie, but it tries to be a cannon piece to much and fails in such an obvious way that I could not give it any better status than X3:Last Stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigger, Faster, Dumber, and Way Way Louder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 (2:05, PG-13, Imax) ? Fantasy: Comics &amp; Pulps, biggie, sequelThis film suffered from what I'm calling Transformers 2 syndrome: It's bigger, faster, dumber, and way way louder than the original.I like Marvel's Iron Man. He's one of the few comic-book characters who doesn't fetishize his secret identity. Quite the contrary, in fact. It's billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) who's the larger-than-life personality. He revels in his role as world savior, but he's clear right up front that it's all about him; Iron Man is just a suit of armor he wears when it, um, suits him.Like DC's Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman, Stark doesn't have any innate superpowers. He's just genius-level smart; really good with gadgets; and blessed with scads and scads of money, which gives him free time, independence, access to the world's best technology, and not much need for accountability. But, whereas Wayne is constantly plagued by self-doubt, Stark is supremely self-confident. Indeed, in this sequel he doesn't even blink when owning up to a psychiatric evaluation of narcissism.Sigmund Freud would have had a field day with the daddy issues on display between Stark, villain Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), and their respective fathers, Howard and Anton. The dads were both genius inventors themselves, but Howard went on to fame, glory, and wealth, while native Russian Anton was driven from the country in disgrace during the McCarthy era. Howard is long dead, and Tony remembers him as aloof and distant, but early in the movie Anton is shown dying in penury and misery in Siberia as Ivan looks on. With his dying breath, Anton blames the entire Stark family for his misfortune, and Ivan sets out to settle old family scores.Here's where things start to get ... well, unbelievable is too strong a word for a premise that has already stretched believability to a fine sheen, but let's say sloppy. We're asked to buy into plot premises that frankly don't bear close examination.Right off the bat, we're supposed to believe that the 2 dads, back in the Cold War era, came up with brilliant weapon designs that nobody in the intervening half-century has even thot of, let alone tried to build. Anton's take the form of weathered blueprints, while Howard's were disguised as the landscape architecture for the Stark Expo Plaza (a roman a clef version of the 1965 New York World's Fair grounds).Then we're supposed to accept that Ivan knows exactly where to find Tony: driving a Formula 1 car at the Monaco Grand Prix. Ivan makes his 1st public appearance as Whiplash, wielding 2 powerful sparky electronic whips that can shear an engine block in half. Except that we just saw Tony take the driver's seat at the last possible minute, claiming that it wasn't any fun owning a race car unless he could drive it himself. His hypercompetent, loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) looks on aghast as this scene plays out on live TV. We see the regular driver throwing down his helmet in disgust and stalking off. So how did Ivan know this was going to happen? As I said, sloppy.Similarly, screenwriter Justin Theroux makes a big deal about Ivan's love of birds. Rival military industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) tries to ingratiate himself with Ivan by promising to fetch his birds from the old country, but then tries to pass off a replacement cockatoo as the original. Ivan makes a huge fuss over this. We're convinced that this bird will eventually play some kind of significant role in the film's resolution, but no. So why spend all the screen time setting it up?Conversely, we get almost no screen time explaining the relationship between Lt. Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes and Tony. Indeed, on the 1st 3 occasions where we encounter them together, they seem to be working at cross purposes, and Rhodey's primary allegiance is clearly to his employers at the Pentagon, as he absconds with one of Tony's spare suits of armor to turn over to Hammer. Rhodey didn't get much play in the 1st movie, where he was portrayed by Terrence Howard, and so people who attended the sequel needed more of a clue that he was supposed to be Tony's boon companion and trusted confidant, especially since switching actors to Don Cheadle further undermined the continuity.And there are 3 characters ? Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannsson), and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) ? who are agents of SHIELD, but absolutely no effort whatsoever is expended explaining what SHIELD is, what it's relationship is to the Pentagon, or why Tony Stark is giving them the time of day.In short, while director Jon Favreau does a fine job with all the slam-bang action/adventure stuff that most viewers probably signed up for, we were evidently expected to check our brains at the door. And it's not as if they couldn't have made this stuff more believable; they just didn't try!The "surprise" at the end consisted of a car driving aaaaccccrrrroosssss ttthhheee dddeesssseerrrt, finally arriving at a big circular excavation; the viewpoint tilts down, and we get a brief glimpse of Mjolnir. Now, if you're wondering "What the heck is Mjolnir?", it's the magical war hammer of the mighty Thor, Norse god of thunder, who will be featured in an upcoming film also from Marvel Studios. In other words, you just stuck around for a particularly boring trailer for a movie that hasn't even been made yet. Y'know, Paramount, you just ruin the Easter-egg hunt if you hand out maps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed almost all of this. It does have things that the first lacks, such as a villain presence, grander battles(and more armored participants in them, without getting excessive; some will argue that it's chasing first, combat second), and a greater amount of action(if a little of it is merely showing off) which, again, puts you right in the situation, as well as during flight(not as spectacular or breathtaking, not sure why). There is not a lot of tension in this, certain things don't pay off(this forgets that it's its own thing, not only a setup for Avengers) or have consequences, and there's not enough sense of "danger". The score, with a handful of exceptions, is a wallflower. I barely noticed it. This is missing the constant energy that its predecessor had, albeit it relatively seldom really slows down. There is not sufficient development for the plot(that never really grabs us) or the characters(of whom there are too many and they are not all granted motives, nor do they always make sense in what they do), and so much occurs in merely one film. Next to nothing moves ahead from where it was left off last time. The Black Widow gets to do a bit of awesome fighting(a little of it looks odd somehow, perhaps because of the angles), Johansson nails the femme fatale thing(looking *stunning* all the while) and if you think catsuits can't get any hotter, you *need* to see her in hers... but she(and a rockin' Jackson) serve no purpose, and they are not used for *anything* in this. Dialog can get a tad annoying, especially that of the overly dorky and awkward Rockwell(why is it popular to put weird roles in American flicks?). With that said, the humor is of the same tone and typically works, the lines are(often) as fast and as sharp, the acting is great, the FX are photo-realistic(thank you, ILM) and beautiful(without getting terribly indulgent), it is exciting and the editing and cinematography are excellent, this time, as well. If you want to be entertained, this will do the trick, if you expect a similar approach as what we got from Favreau before. This is not as good, however. There is plenty of mild violence, several instances of suggestive/skin-laden material and infrequent moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan(and if you like the comics and the tying together of the franchise, stay after the credits). 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less sparks reveal the metal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six months after Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) unveiled to the world that he was Iron Man, Stark has created an era of peace between the super powers of the world but he is faced with increasing pressure from the government to allow the military use of the Iron Man suit for military application. This does not come at a good time for Stark as competition from a rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), is continued by the strange appearance of Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke). Vanko poses a threat to Stark as he shares the same knowledge on how to build the arc rector on which the Iron Man suit works.Iron Man 2's story shares a little too much similarity to that of the original. Like the first, Iron Man 2 is not aggressive as it bathes itself in some quick humour and a rather silly middle-arc. This keeps the comic book feel of the source material unlike The Dark Knight, for instance, which attempted to rework Batman into a more real world setting. That said, Iron Man 2 does a great job of seeming real with some potentially viable politics occurring: the US government wanting the Iron Man suit for military application makes sense. In addition to this, Iron Man 2 does a decent job of setting in motion the upcoming Avengers film. Nevertheless, the film's narrative falters in two distinct ways: familiarity and lack of focus. The problem this time around is that the villains, and their motivations, are too familiar to that of the villain in the first film. Both Hammer and Danko appear as two parts of Obadiah Stane from the first film, and like Stane before they want the technology behind the Iron Man suit. Granted, Danko is able to make the arc reactor himself due to an interesting sub-plot, which plays less into the story than expected, but the villains ultimately come down to just wanting what Tony Stark has. Consequently, the arrival of two villains also brings along a few more heroes including Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and the arrival of War Machine. While it is great to see the Avengers plot moving ahead, it results in less glory time for Iron Man himself. By the film's closure, it feels as if Iron Man had not done enough with so many different characters getting perhaps a little more screen-time then they ought to. There was talk of re-shoots having to take place for the film and it shows at times: with so many characters and villains, the films pacing can feel offish on the odd occasion because there is just a little too much for what the story is trying to convey. Perhaps if structured a little more like The Dark Knight, in terms of villains and heroes, Iron Man 2 would have been a bit more coherent, but I suppose it just was not 'part of the plan'. Nevertheless, it is a workable story that keeps things going but it could be a lot tighter.On the acting front there is a lot more to be desired, but there are still some slight issues. Downey Jr. and Paltrow slide back into their respective Iron Man characters with relative ease. It is also great to see how both build upon their characters as the character development allows them to: Downey Jr. is able to emphasise the despair and narcissist feeling he has about his own individual mortality, whereas Paltrow's gives Pepper Potts the more assertive nature she needs to keep Tony Stark in check. While their romantic relationship is not as strong as it could be, it is noticeable from their scenes together. Don Cheadle replaces Terence Howard from the first film and does a respectable enough job. The rest of the cast are adequate to a point with Rockwell overacting his role with decent results, Johansson being a little dull with hers, and Rourke not having nearly enough screen time to be a menacing villain.The computer graphics are nice to look at but are never overly convincing. While they work there are odd occasions where the texturing on the Iron Man suits appears too cartoon-like. That said they look great in action scenes, of which there should have been more, while the special effects only prove to enhance the overall graphics.Much like the first film, there is little in terms of swearing and no nudity beyond revealing outfits. Sex is merely referred to in passing while the violence, with some mild blood in the odd scene, is pretty similar to the first film with explosions, gunfire and hand-to-hand combat taking place.Iron man 2 is a fun film but it is just not as good as its predecessor. While the basic plot resembles that of the original, Iron Man 2 is far too ambitious for its own good. The new heroes do not develop strongly enough and take away vital screen time from Iron Man. Likewise, the new villains feel underused and ultimately never pose any real threat, especially when they are easily outnumbered and outmatched by the heroes. The narrative is not focused enough and the action sequences are never as spectacular as they should be. Nevertheless, the narrative introduces some interesting developments and gets the basic ideas across to the audience, while the actors do a good job. Like Quantum of Solace, Iron Man 2 feels like a weak middle ground for a possible satisfying conclusion: the potential is there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRON MAN 2 might not be quite the cohesive whole that its predecessor is (it can meander a bit), but there are plenty of things in the plus column. For one thing, Sam Rockwell is, next to Robert Downey Jr., the greatest performer in these movies. He's just as conceited as Tony Stark, but he's also got the ample comic charm to keep things light in between effects showcases. I love that Howard Stark is Walt Disney, and the glorious injection of kick-ass that is redhead Scarlett Johansson (mama!). The Grand Prix is a great set piece (I've always been fond of the silver-and red suitcase armor) and my favorite scene in the whole movie - just like last time - is Stark going to work in the lab. But this movie was tasked with both building on the first movie and setting up THE AVENGERS. No easy feat, and as such, you could do a lot worse with your huge summer comic book movies.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking compared to the first film but still a thoroughly decent sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Iron Man was a great film, smart, exciting and classy with a powerhouse performance from Robert Downey Jnr. Iron Man 2 is not as good and is lacking in places, being not as classy, irreverent or exciting though it is not devoid of those qualities. The characters are not as interesting or as well-realised, Vanko is a little one-dimensional for a villain, Pepper's character is so reduced that what made her so endearing in the first is lost here and Natasha/Natalie's motivations are not as clear as they could have been. The story at times is over-familiar and cluttered with parts of the film that would have benefited from not trying to do too much and it could have had a tighter paced beginning. The script is certainly not bad with some amusing moments and one that make you think, but that of the first film has smarter humour and more intelligently structured, the film could have been longer perhaps with some subplots being explored more, the characters better developed and a little less time on some scenes, Gwyneth Paltrow was fun in the first but because of how Pepper was written she isn't anywhere near as much here and Jon Favreau's performance is rather annoying and unnecessary. Like the first film though the film looks great, with very stylish cinematography and editing, vivid location work and special effects that show a lot of time and effort and don't feel like over-load. The gadgets are also great fun and the Iron Man suit is still awesome. The music works very well, not quite as good as that of the first but it adds to the action without over-powering or bogging the pace down. The story while having a little too much going on and being over-familiar still does compel, is not too convoluted and it flows smoothly pacing-wise, and has a couple of note-worthy set pieces. There isn't a lot of action but what there is has thrills and fun aplenty, Vanko's entrance at the Grand Prix race is very dramatic and what follows is equally as thrilling and the climax while not as long as it could have been still outdoes that of the first. Favreau's direction still continues to be clever, with a mix of nostalgia for comic book fans and themes and such that would be currant by today's standard. The acting is fine, excepting Paltrow and Favreau, and there is great chemistry between them all. Robert Downey Jnr's performance is not quite a power-house but he still has the zany comic timing and the ability to give off the emotional depth needed for one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters. Mickey Rourke is menacing and a lot of fun as Vanko, Scarlett Johansson shows how well she can play fearless and Sam Rockwell plays a real weasel and does so to hilarious and sleazy perfection. Don Cheadle also performs with authority. In conclusion, not as good as the wonderful first film but is still a thoroughly decent sequel that gets most things right. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Iron Man movies are still all about RDJ. What he's done with Tony Stark is comparable to what Johnny Depp did with Jack Sparrow: he's made an iconic character for the ages entirely out of his unique performance. It would be nice if this sequel had some interesting character development and smart plotting, but it didn't really matter much. It looked good, there were great performances, and the writing was adequate enough. It ended up being pretty fun. Justin Hammer is a villain you hope to see again. Whiplash deserved better; they should have made changes to the script once they realized what Mickey was on to. I liked the story with Tony finding a new battery for his heart light. I liked the Black Widow fight scene. Good action and good humor--better than I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They missed the point to some extent, but it works well enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Favreau missed, I think, the point of the first film. Although not really (unlike what he often suggests) like Nolan's Batman films with regard to realism (for instance, when Batman needs to jump out and, later, back into a plane in Dark Knight, we learn there was a CIA project in the 70's with that goal), the first one gave the impression that its tech was functional by not pushing anything too far. Its sequel does not, going so far as to introduce a new element! And the electromagnet in Stark's chest, it turns out on this one, leaks metal inside of him (for all his genius he couldn't figure out to wrap a plastic bag around the metal).There is also a party scene which will no doubt appeal to 11-year olds, but which was painful to watch, in which Stark parties, drunk, in his Iron Man suit.I wish we had gotten more of Stark working in his house (without government interference) by himself, and less of his public persona. They dropped the ball in that regard, because a big part of the appeal of the first film is that even though he was like a kid who keeps himself entertained, he is also incredibly successful professionally, and all-around respected for his great intellect. He got (and deserved) a lot less respect on this one, and that hurt my overall experience. Finally, the senate scene was a little much (yet better than I had thought from the trailer), but they should've toned it down a little.</fullReview>

The plot of the film is a bit uneven and it does not seamlessly blend to make it a gripping entertainer. Robert Downey Jr is excellent as ever but did not have many wise-cracks in his dialogue delivery as in the prequel. Also some of the sequences around Robery getting drunk in the iron man suit and him sitting in the middle of the large do-nut seemed a bit un-necessary. I loved Micky Rourke in his role but Don Cheadle does not come anywhere close to Terrence Howard in his role. Insptie of some of the flaws in the storyline of the film the movie will not at all bore anyone and is a fast paced, action packed and a highly watchable comic-hero popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Action Scenes With a Lot of Talky Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is not too easy to describe. When there are explosive action sequences, it was very very good. The first appearance of Whiplash at the Monaco race track, the confrontation of the two Iron Men at Stark's birthday, and of course the spectacular finale fight sequence at the Expo. However, the rest of the film was beset with a lot of talk! This actually surprised and disappointed me.Robert Downey Jr.' Tony Stark goes from a very haughty showoff to a depressed man wallowing in self-pity. No one plays cocky like Downey. No one plays drunk like Downey. While this may be a good acting vehicle for Downey, unfortunately, it also dragged down the middle portion of the movie quite a bit. I felt this part was quite prolonged for a cartoon-based action movie, and may be boring for young audiences. The time could have been used to develop the new characters some more.Mickey Rourke as Whiplash seemed to be an extension of his Oscar-nominated role in "The Wrestler." His character has an arresting presence, such that the simplistic way he was neutralized was a major letdown for me. Sam Rockwell was appropriately annoying as Hammer, the business arch-nemesis of Stark. Scarlett Johannsson was smart and sexy in her role as the Black Widow. Her scene infiltrating the Hammer compound was truly great kick-ass action.Overall, it was a very entertaining film, a good second installment in this franchise. The script can be very funny (anything with Pepper Potts), as it can also be quite serious (anything with Stark's dad). Enough hints are dropped about the coming Avengers sequel, including a funny scene with Captain America's shield. There was a scene at the end of the credits (which I failed to see because my kids wanted to go already). This was supposed to have involved Thor's hammer. The next film in this trilogy promises to be a bigger action blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Stark still has the Spark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The waiting and wondering have finally paid off. It's here, and handsomely boasts a cast ready to do justice to the unforeseen successor that is Iron Man.Tony Stark - quirky Downey Jr. who makes the role seem unplayable by anyone else, is full of his usual cocky charisma in this second outing along with the return of Pepper Pots and Rhodey whose character is welcomely replaced by Don Cheadle, who as fans will know by the trailer, gets his fair share of action in this sequel.Set straight after the memorable ending of Iron Man, numero two doesn't hesitate to have a crazy Russian plotting to end dear Tony's life within the first few minutes. Which isn't at all helped by jealous weapons specialist Hammer played by Sam Rockwell, who proves to be a dangerous foe indeed. At least like most people Tony can always depend on a one eyed Samuel L Jackson or a silver sidekick to help him out in these tough times.Thankfully director Jon Favreau hasn't made the same mistake Michael Bay and Co. did with Transformers 2 by trying to build on the same ideas as the original and add so many characters you forget what film you are watching. But that doesn't mean Iron Man 2 is without its flaws.The main downside - like almost every sequel made, is the story and characters don't seem to have half the impact they had the first time round and you find yourself praying the film will start to be everything you ever hoped for. With the finished result feeling like an unassembled but still quite appealing mess. And since the first Iron Man had such success you'd think it might have easily been one of the rare exceptions. Still, if it is like the first one this will definitely be a film that grows on you the more you watch it.Now since that proved very 'I'm not persuaded to watch this yet.' let's compensate by the fact that there is still plenty of fun to be found as well as lots of action sequences in this sequel; Whiplash (Rourke)'s sequence in particular will probably put off anyone hoping to be Formula One drivers for life, but it's often these most barmy scene's that make you forget about why the plot is so simple.To not leave any readers of this review feeling too heartbroken; the following four words are likely to seal the deal for any man/lesbian to still feel up to watching this, which they should since this is far from terrible. Scarlett. Johansson. In. Leather. Tissues recommended for uncontrollable drooling.</fullReview>

So, i went into the cinema with low expectations. I was blown away. The movie has better pacing then first, better action and better, well, everything. In my opinion, Don Cheadle puts Terrence Howard to shame. And Scarlett Johansson is amazing, acting and stunt wise. The villains, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell are also very good, but i do find Rockwell better, as he seems to have more commitment to his role. The returning cast are, as always, are brilliant. So with better action, pacing, and characters, why is it still so good? The story. The villains have more of a motive this time, and the explosive final is very well built up. So in my opinion, to all the people who loved the firsts low action and heavy dialogue, you will be disappointed. To everyone who likes superhero movies, you will love it.P.S stay after the credits ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had colossal expectations for this movie. That was a bad mistake. I expected to relive "The Dark Knight" moment. A perfect sequel. I expected Mickey Rourke to give a performance worthy of Heath Ledgers Joker and I hoped for a deep and intriguing story. Alas none of my hopes and dreams came true. But it was still a pretty good movie.No need to waste words on the visuals. They are everything you expect them to be in a modern Marvel movie - marvelous.The acting is pretty solid. Robert Downey Jr. was cool, funny, egocentric and everything you expect Tony Stark to be. I though I would miss Terrence Howard but Don Cheadle did a good job as a recast Rhodes. I was a little disappointed at Rourke, he did a pretty swell job but still it was not one of his best performances. Maybe I got that impression because of the lack of depth the writers gave the character, or maybe the very little dialog he had.The action was nice and entertaining and as its predecessor it had a few very funny moments nicely and delicately put in place. Also there was a few details that made the whole experience a little more special like Don Cheadles opening line that went something like "It's me, I'm here, get used to it.", and can be understood as a response to the recast from Terrence Howard.All in all it's a very entertaining and visually beautiful movie, but it falls a little short from Iron Man (2008). The story maybe has the depth but the presentation of it felt a little rushed. It also felt like the movie should be at least 20 minutes longer or so. Also the soundtrack hasn't got the power of the first movie.If you love Marvel you will probably like this movie. If you like action you will probably like this movie. If you liked Iron Man from 2008 you will probably like this movie. And if you see Iron Man 2 levelheaded and not bearing sky high expectations you will probably love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate this movie. I enjoyed Iron Man, but this one is horrible. Tony Stark/Iron Man is just egocentric in this movie. Sure, that's because he thinks that he will die. But why base a whole superhero movie around it nonetheless a movie based on a popular Marvel Comics superhero? People say that there is a lot of action, but there is pretty much none. There is only three major fights. The second major battle just happens to be between a drunken Tony Stark and his buddy, both in battle suits. The main antagonist is horrible. The villain gets defeated with one blow from both Tony Stark and his friend. One blow not for a henchman, but for the main antagonist. How would people like it if Joker got defeated in one hit in The Dark Knight? It's crazy. Three dumb action scenes, an egocentric Iron Man that acts like a total jerk, and the fact that they can't even mention that the woman spy's code name is Black Widow. Why not mention her code name. In the comics, she's a part of a superhero group called the Ultimate Avengers. I also hate that dumb guy that hired the antagonist. How could he possibly think that an evil mastermind would follow his orders? That's like Joker or Lex Luthor being bossed around by someone who isn't powerful in any way. When the opening started with Iron Man dancing with a bunch of women in front of a crowd, I was like oh no, this movie will be horrible.</fullReview>

Robert Downey, Jr. knows just how to play the superhero/playboy. Mickey Rourke is brilliant as the villain but underused. Sam Rockwell is really annoying as Tony's rival. However the character Black Widow is just wasted and Rhodes is left undeveloped. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Tony's maybe love interest. Samuel L. Jackson is Nick Fury.The main problem is the story which is just uninteresting, weak and sometimes even poorly told. The part with Howard Stark is so thin, I was just what the hell? The action scenes are surprisingly blank, the one at the racetrack is good but the ending is just a big anticlimax and over in a rush. The film contains a lot more humor than the first sometimes coming close to the ridiculous. It has the same problem as Spider-man 3 containing way to many characters with different plot lines making the story crowded and even more uninteresting.Overall an entertaining sequel, but still uninspired and childish action-comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a few scattered visual scenes which are amazing, as well as the usual Iron Man/Robert Downey Jr. Comedy which are brilliant - but these make up about 30mins running time of the movie - the rest is fluf and plot-less. I wanted to love IM2 - I really really did - but i found myself checking the time for when it was over a few times. The action was really condensed into the final 15mins, which by then, was too late. The introduction of "The Avengers" was a frustrating distraction to the overall plot, and I felt sorry for Samuel L. Jackson who deserved better than 10min of screen time which makes little sense to the plot. I'm going to rewatch the first Iron Man at home to restore my faith in the franchise. Hope Iron Man 2 doesn't kill the franchise and they pick things up with a better plot and a more even spread of action in Iron Man 3.</fullReview>

That said I may be a bit on the generous side regarding my score, but it contains some of my favorite actors and the performances to go along with it. Downey Jr performance is excellent and Rourke(!) is still a hero, though my Russian is much better. ;) The incredibly beautiful ladies in this movie are as stated. One thing I thought was a pity was that Scarlett Johansson could've been given more time on the big screen, but maybe next movie will sort that out. I'm not one to criticize the directors vision and I won't, seeing as it's like the last movie, but more fun stuff. The Stark character has some funny moments that you don't want to end. Cheadle and Downey seems to have a chemistry that really works, but it may be good performances (what acting is all about). Marvel action at its best and yes... I'm easily amused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Continuation of the Franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came back from the mid night premier of the new Iron Man movie. And i have to say it lives up to all the hype that is has created.I'll try not to add any spoilers but please take note that it may contain just a few small ones.Firstly this movie doesn't feel like a second chapter in the Iron Man franchise, it feels more like a continuation of the first movie. Unlike the batman movies where begins and TDK feel like two complete different chapters of the same book, this feels more like chapter 1 part 2 of the first iron man movie.Secondly, Don Cheadle made a brilliant James Rhodes. His performance captured the character much better than Howards' did. I really wish they could have cast Cheadle from the get go. The rest of the performances were excellent as well Scarlett made a very good Black Widow for her first time i think it was very good, hopefully if she is in the third movie she will work on improving the character a bit more.Overall the movie is a great balance between the action, the comedy and the more serious points of the overall plot. Jon Favreau and his team of writers perfectly balanced all the wonderful and sometimes heavy plot lines that have been enjoyed in the comics and brought them all together in this movie. Its brilliant. I give it a 10 out 10, i left the movie feeling very satisfied and i think most fans of the comics and the movies so far will too. Oh just a tip. If your a real fan stay till after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about Tony Stark's fight against the US government and a man who wants revenge for what the Stark family did to his father forty years ago.I found "Iron Man 2" very entertaining! It alternates between adrenaline and mischievous scenes. Scarlett Johansson is a great addition to the story, I was impressed by the way she pulled her character off. Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke also gave amazing performances.I was particularly impressed by the fights at the end. The fighting sequences are cool, and all the action happens against a visually spectacular expo. I think "Iron Man 2" is worth watching just for the ending alone. I think "Iron Man 2" is great entertainment, and it's even better than "Iron Man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was enjoyable but not quite as much as the first. It all felt a bit rushed, especially towards the end. And the CGI at times was blatantly... well... CGI... (The iron man suit especially)I understand this is a comic book movie and the first movie isn't realistic by any means, but I felt that this one went a bit too far. It is however, very funny.The acting was good for the most part, Sam Rockwell as "Justin Hammer" was a bit annoying though, and I didn't feel that he did a good job. Everyone else is pretty good though. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was promised- and more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To classify Iron Man 2 as an archetypal sequel wouldn't justify the effortlessness in which it flows seamlessly from the original Iron Man's story; the film takes pride in picking up straight from where its predecessor left off, and in beautiful fashion. As a whole, IM2 feels more of an add-on to its predecessor and focuses on tackling the issues arising from the fallout incurred from the ending of original Iron Man.Having said that, audiences shouldn't just expect a hollow romp of recurring Stark-isms, repetitive action sequences and a predictable storyline. IM2 definitely has an edge over the original in its case of moral dilemmas and intertwining relationships between old and new characters, and to top this off the plot line of IM2 has so many unexpected and original turns that the film is so engaging it makes most other comic book adaptations appear sheepishly predictable.Having less opportunity to rely on Stark's antics to dazzle audiences, Robert Downey Jr. succeeds in adding a realistic amount of depth to Stark's character, and as such, the issues of alcoholism, sickness, mortality and the international weapons race can be tackled with a believable attitude by both the actor and the director. Thanks to a touch of genius from the writers, actors and director, these serious issues are tackled without compromising the fun, super-savvy feel of the Iron Man franchise.As a film, Iron Man 2 wasn't simply a carbon copy of Iron Man, and as such it wasn't what I expected. The film was approached in a much different way by those who made it and I think this is a very good thing. They've kept life in the Iron Man/Avengers franchise, introduced new characters without feeling like they are forcing Marvel memorabilia down your throat, and closed a dark episode in the Iron Man saga without changing the pace or tone of the franchise.For me, this movie marks a fantastic achievement for Favreau and Marvel Studios. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original Iron Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Caliber On Every Level (Story, FX &amp; Especially Acting)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone will rave about the action but Iron Man 2 delivers a beguiling character study behind and above the special effects. You do not leave your I.Q. at the door with this summer movie as you too often need to do. The award winning cast doesn't back down and delivers up to their talent. They're rising to the material, and even elevating it to levels rarely seen in a comic adaptation film. Robert Downey Jr delivers another remarkable performance. Giving one of our generation's greatest actors such a cool character to bring to life happens once in a lifetime. Watching him draw on ALL emotions is as good as it gets. Not to give any spoilers but there's a dark side to Tony Stark because of his impending death and that aspect of the film makes Downey shine. Add the flair and superhero text and we may be talking Oscar. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also bring their top stuff.Aided by those great performances, the writing delivers genuine wit and is strong across the board. I think a lot of summer films are lost in pre-production when they decide to shoot a dumb script or make it up as they go along. Clearly, Iron Man 2 must have had a strong script and great writers. They avoid a lot of the mistakes other films like this make. The story is as good as any comic book adaptation I've ever seen. The plot actually tugs at the heart strings, makes you think and still hits the funny bone more then once. The story and epic battles make perfect sense. What I liked about the first Iron Man is that it was somewhat grounded in reality. No teenage boys or small girls as superheroes or men dressing up as rodents, not that there's inherently anything wrong with those turns. I simply like fantasy grounded in reality. The effects really did surpass what they did before and I actually thought the last time out they deserved FX Oscar consideration. These are some of the best scenes out of any action film ever. Best of all, I couldn't tell what was Computer Generated Images and what was practical.Yes, that's twice I mentioned Oscar so I might as well do it a third time. A nomination for best picture wouldn't surprise me at all at this point. I really loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hype for Iron Man 2 to be great was pretty big, by me anyway. But i was let down considerably. Sequels are usually the ones that are much harder to get right and pull of, and Iron Man 2 nearly falls flat. The last thirty minutes are diabolically bad compared to the rest of the film, which, whilst it lasted, was pretty damn good. Things that could have certainly been improved upon were; Mickey Rourke as Whiplash, who i didn't think had enough screen time, and could have been fleshed out slightly better. The introduction of War Machine fighting alongside his ally Iron Man, was completely inappropriate as it made the climactic fight sequence corny and stupid. His fight with Iron Man at Starks home was also un called for, as if the director was adding the sequence just for the sake for a longer running time. Also, Starks witty personality died out pretty quickly, so we are left annoyed and pleading him to stop by the credits.</fullReview>

I found myself giving a "go Tony!" cheer (which I never came close to feeling in The Incredible Hulk) more than once. This movie gets a lot of flack for not being as awesome as the first Iron Man or any of the more developed movies later in the Universe, but it is a fun romp that continues to develop the landscape.

		<shortDescription>Solid follow-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 was certainly a film that had a lot to live up to. The first film was a major success with both audiences and critics, helping to continue the surge in popularity over comic book films. The film tries to continue the development and issues faced by Tony Stark along with adding interesting characters, yet it also suffers from feeling like it is setting up for something down the line and it does feel like there are too many characters vying for adequate screen time. So while I don't think the film holds up to the original and does have some problems, it manages to provide sufficient excitement and delivers much of what it promises.Story: With the world now aware that Tony Stark is Iron Man and the government pressuring him to reveal his technology, Stark faces a threat from a Russian with ties to his father and a weapons rival trying to recreate his technology. He also learns more about his past and is informed of a proposed superhero team by Shield. I think the basic story is good and the individual story strands are gripping, but I don't think it is executed that well. It gets very convoluted and not enough characters get screen time with so much happening. We have Stark struggle with his new life, the government on his back, his technology being copied, a falling out with Rhodes, learning about his purpose and having issues with Shield. That is a lot going on and none of it gets enough attention as a result. Hero: Robert Downey Jr. continues where he left of by successfully making Stark a sarcastic and brash yet funny and lovable rogue. He gets a little more to do this film, doing a solid job at capturing the characters increasing struggles though a minor issue is that he might spend too much of the film moping around. However he certainly provides energy and laughs in abundance.Villains: Technically Sam Rockwell as weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer is the main adversary. Rockwell always plays smug characters well and it's more of the same here, making Hammer arrogant and slimy in all the right ways. Maybe he's a little one-dimensional but it works fine. Mickey Rourke as Russian ex-con Ivan Vanko gets shafted somewhat. Rourke succeeds in making the character mysterious and tough along with a believable accent, but he simply doesn't get much to do and his role ends up feeling tacked on in the grand scheme of things.Support: Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes and he does a fantastic job. Cheadle brings a lot of class to the role and has great chemistry with Downey Jr. as well as being believable in the action scenes. I still find Gwyneth Paltrow to be a little bland, though she does a passable job. Scarlett Johansson gets little to do as Romanoff and doesn't do much with the part except look good, but that may be down to the script. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as always as Shield head Nick Fury.Action: The action sequences are rather similar to the first film with plenty of impressive and exciting spectacle. It's always fun to see Iron Man in mid-flight whilst it's no different here and as always it is shot excellently. The fight with Vanko at the F1 arena is a lot of fun, though you could argue the action is too widely spread out. The climax is just an ever increasing battle against drones, but it is thrilling and is as massive an ending as you could want.Music: John Debney's score suffers from being very bland. It's difficult to recall any interesting compositions and the heavy guitar sound that stood out so much in the first film is badly missed here. The pieces during the action scenes blend into the background and there is little from the score in the way of atmosphere as a result.Production: For the most part the script flows well and most of the character motivations are made clear, with only a few out of place lines here and there. I think they could have played out Stark's struggles a little better and you could argue that it takes away the fact that he is such an upbeat hero, but I'm still glad that they tried to tackle such an issue. The film looks as stylish as the original and some of the ultra-modern technology used adds a nice touch, while Favreau once again shows that he is equally at ease when handling action or drama. The CGI looks fantastic and is used appropriately. The comedic moments are played down a little more here and that works during the more serious moments, yet it does take away some of the uniqueness and some of jokes are a little overblown too. As said the film did feel like a set-up with a lot of talk about Shield's plans and how Stark father had a purpose for him, which gets in the way of the story it's trying to tell. Conclusion: Iron Man 2 certainly offers all the excitement and fun that you would want it to, but it doesn't compare to the original and its problems come from too much going on. When it focuses on its own plot it works fine with Downey Jr. enjoyable, most of the cast good and the action being very entertaining. However none of the side characters or villains get enough screen time and fail to make any impact as a result, whilst the film certainly feels as if its building up to something more instead of standing on its own. Having said that, when it concentrates it is a blast and shows that Marvel know how to provide enjoyment for its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film to an original super action flick but not a bad film either!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 (2010) is not a great sequel to an original superhero Action films from 2008 portrayed on a comic books of Jon Favreau's Iron Man film from 2008. This film still delivers and is not that bad either. It is a good Action comic book superhero film but it is a lackluster sequel film. I am sorry Iron Man fans but it try's to be a good film, but it fails in some points. Robert Downey Jr. gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story. The general excellence of the casting trumps the inarguable excellence of the technology. This is a forgettable follow up to Iron Man and falls short on Part I in every way from its awful plot to its short action sequences, it is an awful movie but in some was it is still a good film. Iron Man 2 was a HUGE disappointment, it's the worst movie out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in my opinion and this sequel is rushed out. Iron Man 2 has lot's of problems I thought the last half got torn apart like it does.The best scenes are still the ones with Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Stark's charm-resistant assistant, Pepper Potts), or just Downey alone. The rest feels like padding, which is something a sleek-suited superhero shouldn't need. Not only that This film was rushed out and it was really too long. This film shouldn't have Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in it, making a prequel in it. Terrence Howard been replaced by Don Cheadle. Tony acting like a jerk again. On his birthday party been all drunk in an Iron Man Suit, not caring about his company beside Pepper. Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes stealing his suit and getting in to a fight with Tony was the worst idea and scene ever. Than they building weapons in the armor "War Machine" that JUST WASN'T RIGHT. This film isn't the best portraying film ever by a comic book, which the original is way better than this film is. Natasha Romanoff lying and spying on Tony was wrong and judging Tony was wrong. Romanoff beats all Justin Hamme's bodyguards while Happy fights in a boxing fight with one bodyguard and barely beats him. While Natasha Romanoff is John Rambo one woman army, kills everyone. Come on guys she knows martial arts but she is not a super invincible woman. She is a human been vulnerable like me and you. In my opinion she stole Iron Man's scenes, Tony should have saved Pepper again and stop the bad guys alone. He had a help "War Machine "on the end of the film. I still prefer Iron Man (2008) to this film, sorry. Lame one liners, non stop explosions but no one ever gets hurt (especially not the innocent civilians), and a very predictable story line makes for a dull movie. Iron Man 2 with a lot of problems isn't the worst sequel and it isn't bad at all. It does have scene ways that turn's in to good. It has a good things too in it. Iron Man showed the world just how much energy, rhythm, humor, sincerity, and quality filmmaking and storytelling could be crammed into a Superhero movie that managed to satisfy both longtime series fans and newcomers in search not of the perfect comic book adaptation but merely a well-crafted Summer blockbuster that delivered the goods without sacrificing story. I like Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash I thought he did a perfect job portraying a super villain and arch enemy of Iron Man in this film! Which I personally, think he did a better acting than the rest of the crew did. He is a professional and he can act the way he was told too. The fights between Iron Man and Whiplash on the track race were cool. I really love that. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is a combination of Iron Man's enemy the Crimson Dynamo (Dr Vanko, who wears weaponry/armour that can control electricity) and the supervillain Whiplash (who possesses a specially-designed razor/acid whip). That was awesome of making one of the most memorable super villains portraying by comic book even if it does have a little changes it is still good.I love the songs portrayed by AC/DC, the scores of the soundtrack a perfect to film. Even tough the film was not that good, I still did enjoyed in some scenes. Awesome cast, overpowering budget, &amp; state of the art technology could do so much more, but by looking at the other reviews I'm certainly in the minority. The fights on the end of the film with CGI battling Iron Man with War Machine and successfully destroying the drones were terrific and I enjoyed with that. But that was all.Tough It was a A disappointing sequel and a disaster film I still like it and It was on a way still a good film, but the original was the best. I will still watch watch this film, even though it is a little let down but still watchable. Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.7/10 Score: C Studio : Marvel Studios, Paramount Pictures Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L.

		<fullReview>Don't listen to current reviews of this being boring in the middle and not as fun as the first. True its slower than the first and hasn't got as much action yes but that's not a bad thing. These films don't have to be moronic overblown CGI messes and this isn't...surprisingly. Secondly and even more surprisingly is the fact that this comicbook franchise is clearly the best yet, far superior to the X-Men nonsense and much better looking. Thirdly is how much of a great director Jon Favreau is!!! this guy is a pretty average comedic actor and just lingered about in Hollywood until BLAMMO!! he makes the best comicbook superhero adaptation there is!! take that Spidershite.This is a solid film with brilliant CGI and a very likable main hero in Downey Jr. I can't fault it really, the lack of action wasn't a problem for me in the slightest plus the slow paced intro and use of Rourke really works well making him a much better character instead of the fast n easy cheese fest he could well of been (not sure why you'd make whips for weapons though, seems a bit ineffective no?). All the metal suits just look fantastic, never have I seen such coolness since Star Wars armour based suits. The characters all blend well and don't jostle for screen time plus they are all quite believable as is the entire film really, its well created and nicely grounded...to a degree.There are good performances from a few people here too, of course Downey Jr. is amusing and a well rounded guy, Rockwell is actually pretty likable too as the baddie industrialist. Rourke, as said, is great as the low key Whiplash and Don Cheadle is calm and collected instead of a possible over the top military type. Only let downs for me were Paltrow of whom I can't stand, terrible actress, and Scarlett Johansson who didn't quite pull off her hardass character for me (I can't get 'Lost in Translation' out of my mind). Finally the use of Jackson as Nick Fury which I never understood seeing as he's black and in my opinion HIGHLY overrated. Lastly I thought the ending of Whiplash was over too quick and a little cheap, he is too good a character to just finish off that easy. I also liked that they used a character who (like Stark) is just a regular guy in a suit, not some supernatural powered all CGI character. Giving him the bird was also a nice touch to emphasise the fact he was just a normal guy, he actually had feelings and maybe not as bad as we think...despite the fact he does go supernova with the villainy at the end.But what about War Machine huh...now that was some badassery right there. I loved that suit with the guns on his shoulders and the matte grey/black/gunmetal colour palette. Really wanted to see more of that character as he looks like the cool ass evil darker doppelganger of Iron Man. The finale where the pair face off against lots of robotic drones is pretty damn fantastic looking, one of the best sequences in all the Marvel films so far and really boosts this film.Don't be put off by the lack of action, its a solid film and shows how you can make a sensible comicbook film. Watch out for little tit bits of 'The Avengers', that film should be awesome if they can get it right. Also stay till the end of the credits for a big hint at the next upcoming superhero member of the future Avengers team. Although I don't like that particular character myself.'Fury I don't wanna join your superhero boyband'7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first portion of this "review" I will be going over the theme of the Film, or from what I have gathered what I believe it to be. I believe that the theme of this movie was Tony Starks own Legacy and that of his fathers. There is the legacy that he is continuing to follow with Iron Man and then his own personal legacy as Tony Stark the Business Man. He has to find a way to make the two co-exist. This is shown throughout the film when he is going through the crisis of trying to find a replacement mineral for his "pacemaker" before it kills him from poisoning in his blood stream (Favreo, 2010).I will now begin to go into detail on the plot of the film and then follow up with mentioning some of the characters and their roles. The plot starts out telling about the story of where it left off from the first movie. That is that Tony Stark and Iron Man are the same being. One of the personas is being a superhero, while the other is a rich playboy billionaire. In this film he is consistently being harassed by the government to give up his suit but he is reluctant to do so (Favreo, 2010). This brings the upcoming of new enemies to Iron Man rather than your typical villain, now it's the United States Government. Unwilling to give up his suit and due to his inexcusable actions at the time, his best friend and government official is forced to take the Mark 2 protocol and steal it (Favreo, 2010). This is where the character War Machine is created. Amongst his search for a new element, he has also put peppers in control of Stark Enterprises.The next portion of this paper will be in regards to the Characters. I will briefly describe each important one and the role that they played. First we have Tony Stark, who is played by Robert Downey Jr. and he is of course Iron Man as well. Then we have Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Plots, and that is Tony Stark's assistant/secret love. Then there is Tony's best friend, Rhodey Rhodes who also plays War Machine. Then Down the list is Samuel Jackson who plays Nick Fury and as well as Scarlett Johanson who plays a spy for Shield. Sam Rockwell plays as Justin Hammer and Mickey Rourke plays as the main villain Ivan Vanko (Favreo, 2010).In Iron Man one and two the transitions and editorial cutting that are used allow the movie to flow smoothly. It allows for certain action scenes to go to the next one or next level. For example, when Tony Stark first arrives at the expo center at the begging of the film it transitions into action (Iron Man flying to expo) then into moderation (where he is in his tuxedo and is hosting and portrays his father's segment) (Favreo, 2010). There are many other areas in the film but this is what came to mind first. Transition played a huge effect in the making of this movie and it allowed it to run smoothly from scene to scene.The sound effects that came to mind that made me feel like I was actually there was in the middle of the movie when Tony was having his birthday party. His friend Rhode was upset and took the Mark 2 protocol suit (Favreo, 2010). The music along with the sound effects from the fight made it seem as if you were really there. Another scene was towards the end when it was an all out battle. When he was flying under the highway and the robots were blowing up, it brought the viewer in and seemed so realistic that one may have thought that the pieces would come flying at them from the blown up robots (Favreo, 2010).In conclusion, I have described an overall summary and review of the film Iron Man 2.I have provided all the information that was required for this assignment as well. I have described how the character plays two roles and what the issue at hand is during the film. Overall I thought that it was a Blast of excitement and was put together very well. I would recommend this movie to any action or comic buff. I am one of those, so that is why my decision may be influenced to some degree. Overall I would give the film the rating of an A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But still enjoyable.The plot line is that Iron Man has brought world peace and security, but the US Government wants the suit. Meanwhile, Tony Stark is slowly dying from palladium cores in the ARC generator that powers the suit and keeps him alive.Meanwhile in Russia, Ivan Vanko designs a version of the Iron Man suit based on plans his father gave him. After a showdown with Stark in Monaco, he is recruited by rival industrialist Justin Hammer to make more suits.So why does this movie kind of work? Well, it's largely faithful to the mythos. Fans get to see the characters that have been part of the Iron Man storyline. Downey is once again great in the role of Iron Man, probably because you can see this guy as someone who gets into trouble.The movie does drag in places, and probably could have benefited from some tighter editing. Beyond that, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the movie in a press screening here are my humble thoughts: for first you can watch hd trailer on http://geckomovies.com/cinema/now-playing/item/259-iron-man-2.htmlBefore I start with my short review of Iron Man 2, I have to say two words about Iron Man 1. I really dug the first one despite of being a little disappointed by the grand finale. Robert Downey Jr. kills it, action, humor, pacing... loved it. I'm not a big comic geek, and not that familiar with the original Iron Man comics, so please excuse if some of the stuff I thought was weird, was actually accurate adapted.So while the opening credits where rolling and I saw all the big names of actors that I happen to love, I really thought that it might be hard to give all of them a fair amount of stuff to do in the movie. And as it happened to turn out, I was right. I was especially disappointed by Mickey Rourke's part as Whiplash. Don't get me wrong, Rourke was great. He looks mean as usual and I loved every scene he's in. Unfortunately Favreau really pulled a Darth Maul on him. After the last fight I honestly sat in my chair and was like "that's it? you can't be serious?!". Rourke's Character had almost the same potential (at least from his talent as an actor and his looks in the movie) as Heath Ledger's Joker in Dark Knight. But he never lived up to that expectation due to the lack of screen time and, well... a purpose.But the main problem I had with Iron Man 2 was the lack of a meaningful story and motivation for almost all of the characters. We are introduced to Scarlett Johansson's "Black Widow", and blame it on my lack of knowledge of the graphic novels, but I had no Idea what her purpose in the movie was. The first part of the movie she's just the hot secretary with almost no lines. Eventually she puts on a tight super hero costume and tries to find Whiplash. There is a brief action-sequence, where she kicks some ass, but truth be told, Hit-Girl would wipe the floor with Black Widow. What I really liked though, was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. He totally killed it and you can tell he enjoyed his part as the sleazy scumbag pulling the strings in the background.I also liked Don Cheadle as James Rhodes (he was on par with Terrence Howard on this one), but I felt his character suffered from the lack of time for character development. There is this scene, where Tony Stark is seriously messed up, partying at his home in his Iron Man suit and randomly shooting stuff. Rhodes is tired of the situation and grabs himself another one of the Iron Man suits, battles Stark and than leaves. With the suit. I don't know if that's the way it was done in the comics, but I didn't like it at all. In the first movie we witness how Stark becomes Iron Man, how he needs to learn to use the suit and become one with it, how he builds it and we can understand, that he is the only one, who could use it that way. Apparently we're wrong, because all you need, is the suit. It's like anyone could be Batman, if he just could get a hold of his cape. There is no explanation as to why Rhodes can fly this suit like he owns it, there isn't anything told about the relationship between Stark and Rhodes. I just felt this part was incredible weak.The whole movie felt like a setup for another movie. Characters are introduced, stuff happens, but nothing really matters, at best it hints, that there COULD be happening something in the future.Another big problem I had though, was the lack of 'magic moments' and thrilling action, like in the first flick (I still get goosebumps, thinking about how Tony Stark flew in his suit for the first time). Everything just runs too smooth, there is almost no tension, you never think anything could harm Tony Stark, you never feel something bad is about to happen. If I compare this with the incredible Dark Knight, it feels like a kids movie, something like the ranks of Sky High. Plus, there was just to little Iron Man in Iron Man, to little I care about. Iron Man 2 was made to prepare us for The Avengers and Thor, but by being that, it kinda forgot to be something in it's own. That's the biggest difference to the first flick, who was original, fresh and smart.Sounds pretty much like a bash, but all that being said, I was fairly entertained. The performances of the main characters each were pretty good. The cast was perfect. Of course all the special effects are amazing, with a lot attention to detail. I loved all the 'augmented reality" stuff going on in Starks garage. The movie is funny (actually it felt more like a comedy than an action flick) and when the action happens, it's looking great. The biggest let down is the potential this movie and most and for all the characters had, which wasn't used. However this is only the review of someone who's fairly unfamiliar with the graphic novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will get entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is definitely worth the hype it caused. Everything is so fluid and so well implemented that when the movie ends, you will be asking for more. Robert Downey Jr. is as charismatic and funny as he was in the initial movie. Gwyneth Paltrow is sexy and does her part very well. In my opinion, Scarlett Johansson is the weakest link of the cast since you can feel her presence in the movie is only for the hottie-factor. Sam Rockwell steals the show from time to time and is great. Mickey fits the movie really good as the bad guy. The movie will definitely entertain you but it has it's flaws. The anger and hate of Ivan towards Tony Stark is not supported enough by the background story and although I liked all the action scenes, I was expecting more from the final fight between Iron Man and Ivan wearing a giant suit with electrical whiplashes. Overall, the movie is definitely worth seeing. It is worth your every tiny little penny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't care that much for the first Iron Man. I like Robert Downey Jr, think he's a great actor. But in this gig he's just playing himself and most of the time it's not very interesting. The dialog is full the quirky one liners and maybe a little too much comic relief. And that's all fine and good, but the movie is better when Stark is silent, pensive, and not talking so much. The same can be said of Pepper. The banter between her and Stark is just irritating. She's seems to be there in the movie just for window dressing anyway. Now Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssen) could have been an interesting character if she had been allowed to really form a relationship with Stark, but no go. Samuel L. popped in and out to give great wisdom, almost like a Jedi Master. And poor Don Cheadle is given every little to do but look lost.Why did I give this 8 stars, well Downey is Downey and when he's quiet and in the groove the movie is good. And it is almost great when combined with Mickey Rourke (who just keeps getting better, banged up face and all) and Sam Rockwell who hits every note as the rival weapons manufacturer Hammer. Those three are what keeps the movie interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying sequel but No 3 needs to blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost an iron (sorry) law of movie-making that a sequel is not as good as the original, but this one comes close enough to satisfy, aided by the return of the brilliant Robert Downey Jr as the manic Tony Stark/Ironman and Jon Favereau as accomplished director. There's more plot this time; indeed possibly too much, as our metallic and schizophrenic hero faces a whole slew of challenges from his one-time aide Lt Col Rhodes (Don Cheadle), rival arms manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), Russian technocrat and tattoo fanatic Ivan Vanyo (Mickey Rourke as bulked up as in "The Wrestler") with his savagely destructive energy whips, and even his own suit which is slowly killing him.In the face of so many troubles, even a super-hero needs some assistance and much of this comes from female aides Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) who provide superb management and martial skills respectively. In this sequel, there's a lot more ironmen but not quite enough of the Ironman himself. And not enough of the SHIELD's Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson). But there are good special effects and exciting action sequences so that the whole thing flies along like the suit with its jet thrusters permanently on.All of which which makes one look forward immensely to "Iron Man 3" and, as with the original movie, if you sit through all the credits, you'll see a short item setting up the next film in the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was entertaining and i felt like i'd got decent value for my cinema ticket.Downy was great as usual, Rourke was excellent, and Don Cheadle was very good however i would have preferred Howard had reprise his role, he just added that little bit of extra grit to the character.The special effects were amazing, the humour was there, and the action scenes were on the whole excellent.There were two main downsides to the movie that stopped it being an all time great - Scarlett Johansson: a completely pointless role, apart from shots of her in her bra she didn't offer anything to the character, her fight scenes were annoyingly unrealistic and far fetched, and at one point she managed to change her hairstyle for a fight. She was clearly added for sex appeal for the fan boys but surprisingly didn't look as hot as usual.The end fight: the fight between Rourkes character and Ironman lasted about 30 seconds and without spoiling the film for people who haven't scene it had more than a predictable ending.Well worth a watch but it didn't have the wow factor of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first bad movie of MCU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before a bunch of Marvel fans start sending me death threats and Nolanites chant "One of us, one of us" I don't hate MCU, In all honesty, the first phase was actually pretty fun to watch with the exception of this and The Avengers, but the reason I hate this and the later MCU attempts is due to dumb writing, bad characters and overall, they're overrated.Okay the film starts out with Ivan Vankov, better known as Whiplash, watching Tony Stark reveal that he is Iron Man to the world from the first film and this causes Mickey Rourke to attempt to put emotion into the scene...its just as terrifying as it sounds. We cut to 6 months later and Tony has reverted from "noble hero" to "full of myself prick". The character did a complete 180. I actually get the feeling I missed a better movie within that 6 months. Anyway, Tony is called in by the US Government to turn over the Iron Man armor to the American people. He convinces them not to by saying that the suit replicas are nothing to fear by showing test footage, one included with Justin Hammer, one of the new villains.The thing that gets me about this is that...no other engineer on the entire planet is as smart as Tony Stark? Okay, considering that he gave his company to Pepper in this film (why?...I don't know! What does the company do now?...I don't know!) I actually severely doubt that. Then he eventually makes it to the Grand Prix and decides to ride in the race but little does he know that Whiplash was waiting for him...because he somehow has the ability to see into the future and was able to tell that Tony Stark would be riding. Chaos ensues, Whiplash goes to prison and Tony is upset at stealing his mini arc reactor design...there were designs for it? Why weren't there more? So Justin Hammer actually likes what he did...for some reason and asks him to build Iron Man armor for him because he faked Vankov's death. Meanwhile Tony is suffering from the BIG BAD Government and they press him more and more to give him the suit, little does anyone know that the reactor is also killing him. He decides to have his birthday and apparently, his friends don't like that so Rhodey decides "f#ck it, I'm stealing one of his suits", they fight and Rhodey flies away to get it weaponized by Justin Hammer who is suffering problems from Vankov making drones that can only salute for Stark's expo. That's the plan of the villains...why does it pose a threat to Stark again? To cut a long story short, they build up The Avengers, they kill Vankov, cure his blood toxicity (yes thats actually a plot point) and the Government decides to give him a medal.Okay my first complaint...where's the story? Stark has no clear goal to work on for almost 3 quarters of the film. He just gets drunk, pees in his suit and eats in a Product Placement. There is no clear villain, there is no motivation from any of them either and it does feel like that Tony's only beef with the Drones in the expo is "I don't want weapons being made without me"...thats why he backed out an hour into the first Iron Man movie. Justin Hammer's dialogue literally sounds like a 6 year old considering how much he complains. In fact thats what this reminds me of, 6 year olds playing Iron Man in their backyard as a fantasy. It has every single element to that with the exception of the okayish acting and okayish visual effects. Everything else feels like a 6 year old pretending to be Iron Man in a game, even the dialogue has that element.Overall...this is literally just build up to The Avengers, arguably thats what all the MCU Phase 1 movies are but those movies actually had a story, characters beyond cut outs, something that could pass off as a fun time in the cinemas. This film? No. However, considering the other bad movies of the MCU (Iron Man 3 and The Avengers), this one is by far the least awful of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man was such a huge hit that a sequel was obviously on the cards, but the you want avoid making it look or feel the same, but it does, from director Jon Favreau (Elf). Basically the whole world now knows that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is Iron Man, and he faces a lot of concern from the government about the thought that the suit may be considered as a weapon. Strict on keeping his invention, Tony puts his personal secretary, who has a crush on him, Virginia 'Pepper' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) in charge of Stark Industries to keep things afloat. Meanwhile, a new enemy has emerged, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), or Whiplash he is referred (in the comics), with his Stark based technology knowledge and plans to help him. He has created a new weapon based on whips and electricity, and with the help of revenge-seeking rich bastard Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) he is able to build a much more destructive design. The only other stuff going on really is financial difficulties at Stark Industries, something called S.H.I.E.L.D. which Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is a member of who can help Tony cure his failing chest shrapnel cure, and Tony's friend Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) donning another Iron Man suit and becoming War Machine. Also starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Paul Bettany as Jarvis, Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart and and look out for a cameo by Stan Lee. The action is still okay, the special effects are still tip tip, and the performances still have some merit, but it just feels too much like you've seen it all before. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfectly efficient blockbuster, but not a perfect film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is a perfectly efficient blockbuster, but not a perfect film. In the era of Dark Knights and Bourne Ultimatums, it might be more common for fans to expect a sequel to live up to ? or, rather, even surpass -- its predecessor, but let's be frank: most of them don't. Whether it's Rocky or Police Academy, most sequels tend to bury themselves into the ground.Held to this standard, Iron Man 2 is entirely competent ? a fun, mindless blockbuster ? but it's not necessarily superior to the first film, and that might disappoint fans who were expecting more.It's probably better to address the weaknesses first: number one would be Mickey Rourke's role as Ivan "Whiplash" Vanko. When Robert Downey, Jr. campaigned for Rourke to be cast during the 2009 Oscar race, I was ecstatic; I thought he'd knock his role out of the park. And he definitely tries his best, but the character ? as written in Justin Theorux's screenplay ? is curiously minor (and, truth be told, his suit's pretty lame). He has a grand introduction during the pre-credits; then disappears for most of the film. He reappears at the end for what we expect to be a climactic battle, but (without spoiling anything), it's even more underwhelming than Jeff Bridges' battle at the end of the first film, which was one of the few things that some fans seemed to quibble about back then.Some critics have written off Iron Man 2 as being another Spider-Man 3 due to its extraneous subplots and characters, but honestly, it's not nearly that bad. Yet there's no denying it does feature too many characters ? Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) serves no true purpose other than to establish herself for further Avengers-style spin-offs; Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury seems to appear merely because of his purpose in the grand scheme of things rather than because he's necessary for this particular film's narrative. And director Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan character (who showed up briefly in the first film) has waaay too many "cameos" here ? maybe he's setting himself up for future installments (which would assure him a spot in the films he's not directing, I suppose), but the character feels wholly pointless. And Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is largely relegated to the sidelines ? if you took her out of the film you probably wouldn't really notice.Sam Rockwell rocks (I'm surprised Peter Travers didn't try that one in his review) and is one of the strengths of the film; charismatic and funny, he gives Downey, Jr. a run for his money. He was one of the studio's original choices to play Tony Stark during pre-production on the first film, and after seeing him here, as an equally egoistic adversary to Stark, it's easy to see why.Downey, Jr. himself is still great, but ? much like his real-life self ? much of the sudden public adoration has rendered him even more arrogant, and I have to admit that, as a result, I didn't enjoy his role quite as much. It's not so much the performance (Downey's rarely in poor form) as it is the character.These are the negatives. The film does have a lot going for it ? it's pretty fun, goes by rather quickly (despite all the subplots going on) and features enough well-edited action to please the sort of junkies who loathed Transformers 2. (Plus, none of the robots in this one talk jive.) While not quite as impressive as its predecessor, Iron Man 2 is definitely an efficient blockbuster. There's nothing here as complex or challenging as, say, The Dark Knight, but it is what it is, and in spite of some wandering plot lines, it doesn't attempt to overreach. You pretty much know what you're getting going into this flick, which is more than can be said for many pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So if you want see Iron Man 2, go ahead. Just don't join the rest of the stampede to see it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels are tricky. Very rarely is a sequel better than the original movie. Recently, Empire Strikes Back was voted best movie sequel ever by members of an online movie magazine. To me that makes sense, because Empire was a great, great movie. Only a handful of comic book movies, have had great sequels. Spiderman 2, X-Men 2, The Incredible Hulk and even Punisher: War Zone was a far better movie the first one. To honest with you, I began to have doubts as to whether or not this movie would live up to the first film, which was one of my movies of the year in 2008. So after watching Iron Man yesterday evening.WHAT I LIKED:I'll start with performances first. Robert Downey Jr continues to do same job he did in the first movie. If anything he's even funnier in this one. Another good performance from him and it shows that he was made to play Tony Stark/ Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow was also very good as Pepper Potts had great chemistry with Robert Downey Jr and looked very comfortable in her role. Don Cheadle is a welcome change from Terence Howard, his performance made me almost forget how crap he was in Brooklyn's Finest. But he did well to fit in with the other characters. Mickey Rourke made a decent bad guy. Didn't over do it and didn't try too hard either, but I thought he was alright as Tony Starks enemy. A lot of the other reviewers couldn't understand why Rourke's character was so bitter towards Tony Stark to want him dead. But after watching 30 mins of the movie, I thought it was clearly obvious. What I also liked was the 2 min set piece were War Machine and Iron Man destroy 10 robots. Great action and great visual effects make it the most memorable scenes in the movie. War Machine is awesome and I hope he'll feature in the next Iron Man movie.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:This movie drags and drags and drags. Yeah the movie is only 2 hours, but if fill it with pointless scenes, it feels longer than 2 hours. The story was mixed in with all these subplots. Tony Stark battling radiation poisoning from the Iron Man suit, and at the same time trying to reconnect with his dead father. Sorry, wasn't interested in any of that. Also Scarlett Johansson was absolutely rubbish in this. A S.H.I.E.L.D agent moonlighting as Stark's secretary. Just a pointless inclusion and I can't remember her being a great actress in anything she's done. Sam Rockwell is equally poor. He's one of my favourite actors, but his annoying babbling is simply...annoying! His character, should have played by a much older actor, someone who could have taken the role more seriously. I thought he was having a laugh. Not once did I think he was Stark's rival. Scott Glenn, David Strathairn, Kurt Russell maybe even George Clooney wouldn't given the Justin Hammer character a darker edge. Great actor, but had a shocker in this film.All in all, Irom Man 2 is definitely worth the release and is bigger and longer than the original. Sadly, it isn't better. Favreau has done brilliantly as actor/ director in the last 10-15 years. But if churns another Iron Man movie like this one. I'll have have to fit him into the same boat as Stephen Sommers and Michael Bay. Both of whom I cannot stand as directors.So if you want see Iron Man 2, go ahead. Just don't join the rest of the stampede to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man's gone a bit rusty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr returns as Tony Stark in this sequel to the quirky and likable first outing for The Golden Avenger. But while John Favreau's film is reasonably entertaining and watchable it isn't up to the first movie and lacks any real dramatic bite or intensity. The final showdown is, to be frank, a letdown and the movie ends on a feeling of anti-climax. The post credit sequence restores a bit of excitement, however.What we get: Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) seeks revenge on Tony Stark after his father dies, Stark's own father having arranged for his deportation in the 60s when he believed the physicist was after mere personal gain. (Yep, Howard Stark was a billionaire, so how that squares up is anybody's guess).Tony Stark (Downey Jr), under pressure from the Senate to turn over the Iron Man suit to the military, discovers he is slowly dying of blood poisoning due to the chest device that powers the suit and keeps his heart beating. All his efforts to find a substitute element have so far failed. Tony, facing his mortality, is quickly going off the rails.Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is a Stark wannabe with a grudge -Justin has just had his defence contract frozen with the government and Hammer is itching to get even.Meanwhile Director of Shield Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is growing increasingly concerned with Stark's erratic behaviour and plants shield agent Natasha Romanova (Scarlett Johannsen) to watch over him. Stark's best friend James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) shares Fury's concerns and Pepper Potts (Gwnyth Paltrow)finds herself CEO of Stark's company and growing disenchanted at Stark's wild partying, little suspecting the source of his depression.In truth all these lengthy subplots don't gell, the characters are underused and Vanko's revenge motive is just a hoary old cliché. Rourke is underwhelming, Paltrow, annoying, Jackson underused and Cheadle and Johannsen excellent but also underused. While the effects are spectacular there aren't enough of them to distract from the flatness of the film. The quirky humour is largely unfunny until the final 30 minutes or so, when the movie finally springs to life.So Iron Man 2 is reasonable overall, but it's nothing great. Downey Jr. is often reduced to playing against himself, as his character just can't open up about his problems. I'd have much preferred to see Johannsen's Black Widow clash with Stark than Whiplash - she lights up the whole screen and is a far more interesting character; Nick Fury should be much more involved. The climax largely involves Iron Man and War Machine fighting off robot drone attacks, when it SHOULD be about Vanko and Stark squaring off. Their confrontation only lasts about a minute of screen time, and disappoints.Let's hope the Avengers movie and Thor are better....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Iron Man is obviously a hard act to follow; but surprisingly Iron Man 2, just about pulls it off! It revolves around the star ego of Tony Stark, playboy millionaire by day, action hero by night; although this time around he is no longer prone to hiding his identity because he revealed it to the public. This sparks controversy, shocks and outcry through the US government.The acting is superb, Whiplash is very intriguing, when he is actually in it; mostly revolving around his real identity- Ivan Vanko. Robert Downey Jr also delivers a stellar performance as Stark, who's device is not only saving him but killing him also.The special effects are amazing whether it is chopping race-cars in two or Iron Man fighting corrupted robots next to war machine, it is sure to be one of the best visually of the yearOverall, you're in for one hell of a ride, i would give it a seven and a half but it is closer to an eight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Commercial for the UpComing Advengers Movie That Falls Apart in the Face of The DARK KNIGHT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all love films, I too make short films, and know the rigors of making a film of this scope, so here is my review...Story- The most overlooked factor in this Iron Man 2 film is probably its story, because the filmmaker gets caught up in putting their film in someone Else's world, the same is true for many of the Star Wars fan films as well as it film, the premise was certainly good, but the execution was a bit lacking.Sets &amp; Art Design - Other than that, the idea to use fan footage of The Dark Knight inside the film was brilliant idea, as was the failed attempt to topple The Dark Knight from it's mighty throne.Acting- this is were most of the film fails, the casting was okie, but funnyman Downey cannot act to save his life, Whipcord was fine, Don cheekle was sadly miscast and disappoints completely... and made me scream into the ears of the guy sitting next to me! the thugs were good enough, as was ironman, who like the detective he is started in on the clues almost immediately... it helped that the real actor looks like a clooney bruce wayne's younger version.Action- Iron was decent, the suit was too shiny, but the dialogs, gabbing and chattering were good for a superhero film, but it would have been better if the makers had seen Batman-Begins DVD and how they used a new fight style and used some of those moves, I know how fragile the suit was, but the fight moves used in ironman 2 were actually less about movement and more about talkativeness, in fact the action is at a minimum and shown only when the STORY requires it, the is mostly a romantic movie....with some comedy .....the Rolls Royce seemed to be going very fast and made the film feel authentic Overall - 10/10 4 for the film's sets and for making me bicker and shadowbox at the movie screen, trying to interact. 2 for the fights and a semi decent iron batman. + 4 for the directors previous effort, "Elf", with funnyman Will Ferrill.-3 for the horrible acting -1 for the badly done green screen</fullReview>

I'm tired of all these critics bashing this film for too many subplots. This movie is funny, filled with action, and has much more heart than its predecessor. Iron Man 2 is most definitely Iron Man's superior. It ups the comedy and action while simultaneously introducing new "Avengers" characters. The film also delves deeply into Tony and Pepper's relationship with ScarJo adding some dynamic. Overall the film was amazing and is definitely the best film of 2010!

		<fullReview>I love this quote by Robert Downey Jr.: "I can honestly say that Tony Stark is the coolest character I've ever played. If I look at anything, it's the mythology that has grown up around him and how I can use that to raise this movie to a really high order of art." Mission accomplished, Robert. IM1 took the comic book genre to the highest level and IM2 builds perfectly upon the first film. Downey and Favreau again deliver a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. In fact, the action is taken to the next level while sacrificing none of the complexity or heart that made the first film a pure classic. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are praising Iron Man 2.Iron Man 2 does indeed do the near impossible and that's improve on the first film. It really is as fabulous as you've heard and as good as everyone is saying. The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. Nice job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man is a better song than movie franchise. Basically he is a rich guy in a metal suit who gets his ass kicked by the villains and manages to do something sneaky at the end to win. He got his ass kicked in the 1st and he gets his ass kicked in the 2nd. The guy is a loser. He even needed help to win sneaky in this one. In between getting his ass kicked he does some really boring stuff like inventing a new element to save his life and talking to some bloke who was a pirate. The main villain must have stole the pirates parrot at some point in the movie but my attention wandered to a fly crawling up the wall which was more interesting so I am not sure when. The ending sequence stolen from Predator and Terminator was dull and boring and the money spent could have been spent better with perhaps employing someone who knew what the hell they were doing. Nursery school children could come up with a better film than this turd of a movie. None of it made any sense and the actors seemed as bored as I was delivering stupid lines with a look of someone who had just wandered into a a lift after someone else coming out had farted. Some of these people were actually actors once. Gwen Paltry not among them of course. Sad to see them wasting their time with this rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is the worst waste of digital film I've seen all year. I enjoy bad movies, but nobody should have standards this low. I actually walked out of it. Three times. Atomic Twister wasn't this bad. Don't waste your money seeing it in the theatre. If you must, see it secretly at home, after the Rifftrax is out.This is what happens when property holders know people will see a movie anyway, so they don't need to irresponsibly spend investor money on things like a script, soundtrack, or special effects. You might as well see Escape From New York again instead, it has better special effects and more thought and story in it.That chick who was in all the ads, Scarlett Johansson, isn't even in the movie in any significant way. That was just a PR plot to gauge interest in a potential perpetually put-off ripoff spin off. This movie does not contain boobies, and even the curse words are beeped out, gratuitously. It's like watching a low rent Transformers with all the sexy stuff stripped off.They didn't bother trying to make Moscow look authentic. They did keep Mickey Rourke looking authentic. Mickey Rourke is the only good thing in the film, and he's supposed to be the bad thing! If you're a fan of Mickey Rourke, or any other actors in this film, go see any of their other movies again instead of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in Australia, where it opened this weekend. The cinema was full. I left disappointed, and I think that many others did too. The plot was more confused than normal. The U.S. military and the senate started as the bad guys, trying to steal the Ironman suit from Ironman, to weaponise it. Then a Russian got involved, and created a large bunch of clones, supposedly for the U.S. military, to defend America from Ironmen created in North Korea. Ironman decided to go car racing in Europe, where the Russian tried to kill him. Then Ironman had a birthday party in California, where he got into a fight with someone from the U.S. military who then stole one of the Ironman suits, and destroyed half his house. Action moves to Queens, where Ironman fights the clones. Along the way, we find out that Scarlett is not Ironman's in-house attorney but really a marshall arts superhero. Also, some guy with an eye patch, whose role is not really explained, comes and has a chat with Ironman to get him motivated.Gwyneth Paltrow is in many scenes, but her character doesn't really develop. She just walks around with a clip board and pouts at Scarlett. Ironman is sick, but does not tell Gwyneth - instead, his father saves him, after Ironman watches an old home movie that contains a clue to more superpowers.Plenty of action, and a good fight scene with Scarlett chopping down security guards in Queens, but it just doesn't hold together.Seems like they are introducing characters for Ironman 3 or some other Marvel movie. Just like Star Wars 2?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puts the comics on the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony (Iron Man) Stark and supporting cast have been continuously published for up to almost half a century now; there must be something entertaining and appealing about these characters. This movie (unlike some other comicbook adaptions this century - yes, "Azrael Begins", I'm looking at you) actually puts recognisable versions of the published characters on the big screen.If you've been reading Iron Man for decades, as I have, then there are many resonant moments and stirring visuals that will bring a smile to your face. I don't think you can go much more than 5 minutes at a stretch without experiencing some frisson of gleeful recognition.If all you know of the character is the first movie, this will not disappoint. It has the same mix of comicbook physics, great performances and entertaining action in another script smarter than the genre usually supplies. There's a layer of enjoyment accessible to long-time readers that you won't tap into, but you won't miss it.(It was great to see Howard Stark presented as the Walt Disney of the Marvel Universe here! Great cultural shorthand.) Superior popcorn entertainment masterfully done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And Tony Stark did it again and in a better way to take to the leading point of where we are really wanting to see and be part of it, with the help of Robert Downy Jr. to represent a great character that we all admire...Iron Man.Comparing between Iron man 1 &amp; Iron man 2, 2 was actually a lot more like having the same aspects that 1 had, Thriller, Entertainment and a great screenplay with astonishing effects to make you live the targeted experience. There wasn't that much new change or difference in 2 that we didn't catch on 1 except for that there were so many ROBOTS.The conclusion is, Iron man 2 is not one of those movies that will be immortal in your mind, it's not one of those movies that will remain on the talk between people forever, It's just a perfect movie for entertaining that will make you enjoy every second of it, It's a must popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is exactly as you would expect a large budget Marvel film to be, big names, big effects and big fun. You'll leave wanting to don the suit and save the world. Good performance from Mickey Rourke again, he is making the silent type baddie a niche all of his own.The special effects are great, reminiscent of Minority Report in places but version 2.0! Eye candy and some kick ass moves provided by Scarlett Johannsen, some excellent one liners from all the cast, explosions a plenty, far out James Bond gadgetry and the introduction of Mr cool himself, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury, all add up to a fun night out.If you want to "pick holes", go ahead you'll have a field day, however if you want a good night out go and see the movie, you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clash, Bang, Boom! Tony Stark is back.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon Favreau knew exactly what he was doing with this movie. This is a sleek, no-holds barred superhero movie, with great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke. Let's face it, it was almost impossible to top the first one; nevertheless this a good sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made. Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role as the the sexy and cunning agent Natasha Romanoff, and Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts. Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's competitor, and does a pretty good job at it.The only problem I have with this movie is that too many things have been fitted into 124 minutes. I understand that the movie was meant to be a roller-coaster ride, intended to thrill, but a little more character development would certainly have helped the movie. For example Samuel L. Jackson ans Johansson's characters are underused. Also, the ending was a little disoriented and predictable; something just didn't feel right about it.All in all, Jon Favreau has made a movie that would please the fanboys and satisfy the critics. This is a movie that entertains, while still complementing the first movie, and setting up a third movie. If you liked the first movie, just go ahead and watch this movie - you won't see a masterpiece, but you'll have a fun day at the movies.P.S.- Watch out for the after credits scene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest with you , the future audience of this movie, its worth every penny. Of course just like every other movie it has its strengths and weaknesses.Its strengths are it has a well written script and it also has a compelling plot.Robert downy Jr. doesn't hesitate to make you laugh and beats you straight to the punch. Another strength is how well made the CGI effects were. Im honest when I say that I usually look for the most realism and and most bull crap moments in any movie that I watch. I especially look for the "nu-uh that can't happen!?" moments. now here are the weaknesses. The only way you may understand this movie......to fully comprehend where it is coming from is if you watch the first movie. Because the movie doesn't give any character depth or character development. "If you watch this movie you will probably ask yourselves what the heck is going on?" if you don't watch the first movie. Another weakness that was a huge part for me, was that the movie did not mention anything about the AVENGERS only until the end. And don't get your hopes up the only mention about the avengers is on a label on a folder on Tony Starks desk and he doesn't even open it. In conclusion I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and that is already a lot in my reviews. definitely watch this movie if you have seen the first one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not better or worse than the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say that this is better or worse than first one. One thing that Iron Man 2 is better than the first one is the action scenes. There are more robots to robots clashing in this one although they are a bit short and do not provide enough thrills. One thing Iron Man 2 does not have in the first one is the intensity of the story. This time, the story is not so fast, and in the middle, it drags. Jon the director tries to inject drama into this but in the end, it pulls the fast pace into a slower one. I am not saying it is bad but it just does not put justice to the first one which has a fun pace.The story: Like I said, this cannot be compared to the first, in fact. Since, Tony is back and he has bigger problems to deal including a villain. The first third of the movie is energetic including WhipSplash known as Ivan in a car racing scene. The second third of the movie is where the pace goes slower for Tony to deal with his personal problems and that gives time to Ivan to build robots. The last third is where Tony thankfully solves his major problem and prepares to suit up for the climax. It may not have the energy like the first one but it is still fun with new characters. John Debney,who replaces Ramin, creates an epic score for this one.Overall: It still entertains and has a lot of fun. I would say it is certainly a good sequel to the first while it is not comparable. This may be the only movie for your thirst of superheroes movies unless you count Jonah Hex in. This better makes good in box office to have a another sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete Action Package! Excellent and Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always exciting every time we watch Iron Man movie. Complete action package, great characters interest and interlude with effective humor. Tony Starks is an eccentric, self-centered but genius multi-billionaire who builds Iron Man suit. Thiz time, he faces health issue and ready to confront another thread from his business rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and mysterious villain Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). In the first Iron Man two years ago, I said to everyone that Tony Starks in that movie was too humanist, which was so wrong. Starks should appear more arrogant to present his original character (If you ask me thiz kind of stuff. Well, comic is my world. I recall when my dad bought me first Iron Man's issue from overseas). But at thiz sequel, Iron Man character really fills my expectation. Robert Downey Jr. acts amazingly well, improving his first appearance. The most powerful element in Iron Man's movies is simply Robert Downey Jr. himself. Mickey Rourke is our other attention after his breathtaking performance in "The Wrestler" (2008). He plays save for his villain character and it looks just fine. For the fight scene, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is surprisingly kick ass. I don't know whether is the camera angle or the fight choreography that makes it so attractive, Johansson really left behind her girly image. Unfortunately, I don't like Nick Fury's character (Samuel L. Jackson) which is reconstructed from Nick Fury's original character. Other mentionable performances are Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. The movie is directed by former Actor, Jon Favreau. His previous directing credits are "Zathura: A Space Adventure" (2005) and the comedy "Elf" (2003). It's almost very difficult to say thiz movie isn't a good one. Apparently it's an excellent and entertaining movie for everyone. Can't wait for another Starks Expo!

		<shortDescription>Good for the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pleasant surprise, to see that a blockbuster's sequel can be also made in a honorable way. The first "Iron Man" was in itself a pretty good movie in the superhero genre - and the second one stands true to the trend. The conflictual premises of the protagonist are correctly structured, and the general setup, with the political and global background, is way better than in many of the other similar movies.It's true that the antagonist, played by Mickey Rourke, is somewhat sketchy and short-spanned - but the good news is that the character leads to a valid final confrontation, that also deserves laurels for the smart and resourceful ways of combining all the elements - the hacking angle being the most generous of all. Unfortunately, less can be said about Hammer, an improbable caricature, and about the simplistic satire around the politicians. The target is the right one, but the means to touch it, too cheap.The photography and the visual effects, of course, are commendable, although the narrative rhythm might be lacking here and there, mainly in the first third of the story - more precisely, up to the Monaco incident, that is masterfully shot. All in all, it delivers, so it would be unfair to demand more. Good thing that the superhero action movie are also able to offer great entertainment - at least, from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sequel but it doesn't live up to the first...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, yes, it's that time of that month again. Summer is here. The season for school holidays, fun in the sun, and cineplexes filled to the brim with bid-budget, CGI-laden blockbusters, most of them either superhero movies or sequels. "Iron Man 2" is a sequel to the 2008 superhero smash hit and while it delivers in spades action and well-executed CGI, I felt that it was not as great as the first.But first, the pros. Robert Downey, Jr. is still Tony Stark. He has an endless amount of charm, wit, suaveness and one-liners that makes him an extremely like-able whenever he's on the screen. Gwyneth Paltrow also returns as (un)lucky assistant Pepper Potts who again does a good job in contrasting Stark's happy-go-lucky personality with her straightforward behavior. New performers are here as well: Mickey Rourke is, as always, excellent as the villain, as per Sam Rockwell who gives a somewhat hilarious but smart villain, and Samuel L. Jackson just drips coolness whenever he appears.The special effects are very well-rendered and the action sequences are well-directed with high energy by Jon Favreau (also playing Happy Hogan, whom I am glad gets more screen time here). Also the music score by John Debney is suitable for the movie.However, the film has its cons as well. While Don Cheadle does an okay job at playing Rhodes, he just doesn't have that charm that Terrence Howard had in the first movie. To me, it seems as if he feels awkward in that role. Scarlett Johansson proves that she can kick ass if she really wants to (and looks gorgeous doing it at the same time), but her screen time is relatively short and unimportant compared to other characters.Also, the action in this sequel seems somewhat rushed, especially in the third act where it almost falls apart. It's as if screenwriter Justin Theroix doesn't really know how to end this thing, and as such we get quite the muddled ending. Also, I felt like the story took a detour from the realistic setting of the first to a more comic-book/sci-fi-like setting and some pretty cheesy villains if you ask me.Having said that, what was lost in action, was returned in the character exploration of Tony Stark. We see a great deal of character study in this film, more than in the first. Tony Stark is not perfect, he is not exactly an ideal superhero, and this is really proved in the middle of the film during his birthday party. We get to know more about Tony and what motivates his actions. We get to know what makes him tick, what makes him scared.So, overall, it's still fine entertainment, but those looking for it to exceed the original, or have high expectations, will be disappointed. I really wished it had more action as well as the character study (just look at "The Dark Knight"). However, this summer is off to a good start, and I expect more entertaining fluff to come.I still have faith in the series. Bring on "Iron Man 3".Overall value: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do they make these films! 7.4? Really? This movie was so boring! There was about 5 minutes of action - if you can call it that in this 2 hour punishment. I knew it was going to bad, but I didn't think it would be a crime against nature! I have never liked iron man, I always thought of him as a cheap imitation of Batman, but I always give these types of films a go. After seeing the crazy swishy neon arms of the bad guy, I thought this looks good, but boy was I wrong! It was pointless and plot less! Who made this? I hope it was someone who has an illness that can be said as an abbreviation! The best part about this film is the very first fight scene, and then there is a long plot less dialogue. No more action till the last 10 minutes where the drones are sliced apart like butter within seconds by a new and rejuvenated Iron Man! I couldn't make out anything, it was zip of flash here, an explosion there and a courteous computer monitor informing me the drone was dead.The whole part when Stark finds a new element. What in god's name was that all about? Did it make any sense to anyone? Do geeks get wet when they hear words like separate the neutrons and atoms? Then what really topped off the torture was seeing the big bad guy being killed with minutes of his arrival when it took the man almost 2 hours to strengthen himself. Really? Is this what passes for entertainment? What a waste of money, time and effort. Avoid this forever ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me biased if you will, because I admit I was completely taken with the first movie, but I absolutely loved this film. I went into it knowing I would enjoy it either way, but fully prepared to admit it if it wasn't good. There are a lot of people saying this was disappointing. Those people are everywhere, in every board, for every film. Pay them no mind, and I encourage you to go and see this film for yourself, make your own judgement. With amazing effects, and just the perfect balance between character development and action, this movie has it all. It picks up directly where the first one left off, and gives us everything we loved from the first film and then some. The suit got more advanced, the bad guys got badder, and the tension between Tony and Pepper went up a notch. Any loose strings from the first film are tied up nicely, and I'm happy to say that Stark is every bit as egotistical and brilliant as he was in Iron Man. As for Potts, while some complain about her, I really don't see the problem. Pepper is easily the most relatable character, not just in Iron Man, but in every superhero film, as far as female leads go. Comparisons should not influence your decision, because there is no film quite like this one out there, aside from the first installment. A firm ten out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film based on a Marvel comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put simply, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean no movie released this year can be better than Jon Favreau's masterpiece of a comic book film, but I certainly don't think any potential blockbuster this year will be as funny, exciting, well- developed and brilliantly acted. As hard as it may be to imagine, Iron Man 2 is even better than the original movie - and, you know, the first part was, along with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, one of the best comic book films ever made. It does almost nothing wrong, and while it isn't 100% brilliant all the way, it's as good as any "traditional" comic book adaptation can be. (The Dark Knight being a "non-traditional" adaptation.)The story is a little more convoluted than in the first movie, but fortunately director Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) don't make the same mistakes Sam Raimi made with Spider-Man 3. Sure, there is more than one villain, but the only "active" villain is Ivan Vanko; Justin Hummer is more of an instrument, and is not a classic villain in the sense that he is neither intimidating nor particularly dangerous. He only has the "resources."Those who have seen the first installment might have noticed that, while the movie was excellently-written and acted, it kind-of-suffered during its climax because of some weak action. Well, this certainly isn't the problem here, since Iron Man 2 provides with some of the best action you'll see this year. Unlike, you know, a film like Transformers 2, the machine-on- machine battles in Iron Man 2 are actually exciting and tense because we know there are people behind those suits; because those people have been well-developed throughout two movies, and because Favreau, unlike Michael Bay, doesn't feel the need to shake the camera as much as possible and cutting every millisecond while shooting an action sequence.Performances, much like in the previous film, are absolutely perfect. Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, there is no doubt about it, and even in the film's weakest scenes - which are very few -, Downey makes the movie work. This time around, Stark is dying - the substance that makes the suit work and keeps him alive is actually killing him - and Downey Jr. now portrays Stark not only as a charismatic playboy, but also as a somewhat deeper character, who resorts to alcoholism because of all his problems. This alcoholism is not the main point of the film, though - it certainly is addressed, but it's something that gets dismissed rather quickly. This is for the better, I believe - even more problems and another sub-plot would have only hurt the film, and I'm sure the filmmakers will be able to explore this characteristic of Tony Stark in a deeper manner in subsequent films.Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard from the previous movie, is effective as Jim Rhodes. (He's even got some great one-liners.) Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, and her relationship with Tony manages to move forward a little. There's great chemistry between the two of them, and they've got some great scenes together. Mickey Rourke is just great as Ivan Vanko - the majority of his dialogue is in Russian, and although he isn't precisely three- dimensional, we know just enough about the characters for him to remain both (a little) mysterious and intimidating. Sam Rockwell is also delightful as Justin Hammer - a very coward and unlikeable characters, that's for sure, but Rockwell manages not to turn him into a caricature. Scarlett Johansson, on the other hand, is just superb as agent Natasha Romanoff. With this part not only does she prove that she's the sexiest, most beautiful actress alive - one just has to hear men's reaction in the theatre whenever she appeared on- screen -, but also that she may be able to hand an entire action film by herself. She was just... *sigh*... amazing.So is the film perfect? Not really, but its faults are small enough for them not to hurt he overall quality of the picture. Still, while the John Debney's score wasn't particularly awful or bothersome, it simply was... mediocre. There's nothing memorable or outstanding about his music. It's just... there. Completely forgettable. On the other hand, while I certainly was excited about the presence of a couple of AC/DC songs (Shoot to Thrill and Highway to Hell), I expected more of them, at least three or four, not just two! I mean, there's a reason why the film's soundtrack is made up entirely of AC/DC songs right? (I already bought it, by the way, and it's a nice re-collection of classic songs.) For example, if you know AC/DC has a song called War Machine and one of the characters in your movie is called "War Machine"... wouldn't it be logical for you to put that song in the film? Hopefully they're saving it for the next installment or something.Anyway, those faults aren't particularly big, and the film as a whole is just amazing. It had been some time since I last left the theatre so excited. I mean, I am studying film-making, and when I left the theatre after watching Iron Man 2 I just thought "this is the kind of film I want to make." And by that I don't mean a superhero movie necessarily... I mean a film that does so many things correctly: it's laugh-out-loud hilarious at times, but it's also incredibly exciting. It's got some amazing special effects, interesting and believable characters, great performances, a complex but effective plot and it even works as a set up for a bigger universe of superheroes. Once again, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen this year so far, and I just can't imagine any blockbuster being more successful. I'm definitely seeing it again a couple of times in theatres... yes, it's that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You cannot always know what to expect in a sequel but I was blown away by how good this movie is. A perfect blend of a good story line, good acting, action and a touch of humor. Robert Downey Jr is even better in this film.I think after the first film he has just perfected the part of Tony Stark. Don Cheadle as Rhodey was brilliant. I originally did not know what to think when I heard Mickey Rourke would be playing the villain in Iron-Man 2, so i was really happy when he pulled of a stellar performance as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. There were plenty of characters which is good to see in a film, many films have to little characters, but in this film there is many in Tony, Rhodey, Pepper, Nick Fury, Natasha, Whiplash and Justin Hammer. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was amazing but when you think about it what role doesn't Samuel L. play well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boring. Adolescent. Bad enough to be camp if one could stand Downey. It started out disappointing and never looked back and, as people say, it's not the money, it's the wasted time.If you want to see a good action movie, check out Prince of Persia. It's as under-rated as this dud is over-rated.I went to see this because of the high rating. Well, I will think twice about that in the future. This film has the feeling of a straight to video production. If you want to get up or chat during the flick, feel free - you won't miss anything important. Uninspired scenes with dancing girls seem to abound. We are treated to endless depictions of Iron Man's pathos (well beyond Downey's range apparently,even if it was interesting - which it is not). If you want to know how bad, think Will Smith in I Am Legend.It is just amazingly silly to see the Iron Man 'hands down' flight take-off routine. It resembles a Warner Brothers cartoon, funny too.Seriously, I wonder if a lot of these movie reviews are written by adolescents. It would explain much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the dumbest and most painful to watch movies in it's genre today. There is so much potential here, that has masterfully been laid to waste here. Robert Downey Jr. played Tony Stark as the cliché arrogant, spoilt rich-kid in the first movie. In the second add morose, self-destructive dumbass to the list.Half of the movie is wasted on his mood swings and substance abuse. A little ::too close:: to reality.The chemistry between Pepper and Tony Stark --so does not work. The back-n-forth, him grovelling at her feet, is so old and preposterous it makes you cringe and hate both of them!. Scarlett Johansen's character is wholly redundant. It was plainly injected to add sex appeal and as it plays out, chubby Johansen looking up at the camera for 3 seconds, after ever take down, as if she is expecting the audience to cheer for her, is asinine shtick. Very painful.The only silver lining is Mickey Rourke's character. He is the only guy who seems to take this movie-making business seriously. He did full justice to the measly air-time they gave his character. Had he been given as much lines as... Pepper Potts, he would have stolen the movie from everybody.The movie is dull, slow, painful and insulting. Like getting your teeth pulled by a jeering dentist.</fullReview>

Meanwhile Tony is depressed expecting to die sooner and Lieutenant Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) steals an armored suit from Tony and brings it to the army. The high command delivers the technology to Justin Industry to weapon the armor and Ivan builds an army of remote controlled suit of armors. "Iron Man 2" is a festival of special effects and shattered glasses. The hero Tony Stark is an unpleasant and arrogant character and the film is recommended for fans of Transformers and explosions.

Sound Effects, Action and Music added more delight.The Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair.The Beginning was good and the climax was awesome with huge effects.The film goes on creating more interest and we think what happens next.But there were some mediocre and boring scenes. Some of them worsen our interest but doesn't deviate from the motive of the film.The movie's mood was same as the first one but would have been better if it was more thrilling.There are some laughable scenes.The climax is really a visual delight.Action and style was much more better.Overall the movie is made very well and an excellent continuation of the franchise.Really it was more pleasing and i would love to see it again..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first things that Robert Downey Jr says as Tony Stark in this sequel to the first, popular Ironman film, is "I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one." Well, that's certainly true of the actor and character as well - the film struts, shimmies and schmoozes along to Downey Jr's own rock-n-roll sensibility and that's what I enjoyed most about this, just as I enjoyed it about the first one as well. Some perceptive casting has offset his Bruce Wayning with another motormouth in Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer, and Mickey Rourke who manages to trump everyone with his anarcho-cool Russian.Other characters in a well-populated A-list roster can't compete: Don Cheadle's hamstrung as a straight guy, Scarlett Johansson patronised by simply being paraded. Gwyneth Paltrow has more gravitas but only as she is a trope for Tony Stark's more earnest depths. The SFX are OK, although there's inevitably a bliltzkrieg of son et lumi?re (to mix figures of speech internationally) where action is often meant to be. John Debney's music is similarly functional, when one can hear it at all. I had fun but because Robert Downey Jr was still running the show. Just. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was everything that Iron Man 1 was not. Yes, it was terrible, predictable and irritating. I was so mad how they essentially didn't even show any super hero stuff for 90% of the movie. The children in the theater kept asking their mother's: "Mommy, where is Iron Man? I thought this was Iron Man mommy?". The mothers had to calm their children. It was so sad. What was even more irritating was how conceited Tony Stark was. I was kind of amused by how the senator kept harassing him. For 55% of the movie - Tony Stark was pompous and an ass. He was not even remotely amusing. Then of course there is the villain who was played by an obviously uninspired Mickey Roark hoping to cash in on the success of his hit The Wrestler. He basically had a horrible Russian accent and had LIGHT SABER BULL WHIPS as a weapon. This movie was terrible. I want to sue the makers of this movie for the two hours I wasted by watching it. How am I able to get this time back? It was painful to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that much of excitement but entertaining enough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iron Man sequel did not meet in my opinion the expectations, and that probably because we already liked so much the first movie. To be fair it was a great action-movie, not slow-paced, with good visuals and that captured the essence of Iron Man but other than that it just missed something.The storyline is pretty much simple and predictable but since it's an Iron Man movie we couldn't expect of some mind-twisting story but it could have been better. I mean if the story was more complex it would have been more explosive and the character inter-relationship could have been built a little better but since it was not than it's just ... the regular comic book Iron Man movie. Besides that the visuals were NOT that great as people might think. The editing of the scenes was done well but the way some of the scenes were captured especially the ones where is involved flying like in the beginning where you have to really stare at the screen to realize what Iron Man is doing because the scenes are too quickly cut. The visuals are good but not that good I mean for a 2010 movie I was expecting something better, not Avatar type but neither to be a little bit over that G.I. Joe bullsh*t. Besides that the cinematography is good and offers some nice stand-up captures and scenes.The acting of the movie was If I think better than the first one. I mean Robert Downey Jr. played very well the extravagant and cocky Tony Stark, Mickey Rourke offered a very good display as the Russian, Ivan, you have Samuel L Jackson as Nick Furry and a very good performance by Sam Rockwell who plays Justin Hammer.The thing I was 10 minutes cheering for and 10 minutes disappointed about was the music used in this movie. The one composed I liked it but some of it was just used wrong...At the end of the day this is a kick-ass movie, it;s a great action flick, with jokes, explosions, nice ladies, very good acting and with all the douchey scenes (and YES! it has douchy scenes) it was very entertaining. As to say if it was better than the first I don't know... It depends on how you see it and what you expect from an Iron Man movie, I liked the first one much more because the dialogue was more interesting and here it was full of jokes and stuff not to mention the character development which was better in the first than in this one but this one is like I said, a great movie to get me and you entertained and definitely worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This flick swapped all the good and bad points from the first film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another film which as you can see I've given a pretty good score for, and yet I remain frustrated because it so easily could have been great where it was merely quite good. In the first film about forty minutes was dedicated to stark figuring out how to use that suit. But Don chucks the suit on and he's good to go. Even the flying which was demonstrated as a very difficult procedure in the first film, was suddenly child's play. Many would say at this point that features can't go on for 4 hours just to make everything realistic but this film didn't need to. There was enough pointless clutter for it to do everything right and bypass all the films major flaws. Long sequences of scarlet auditioning for the new karate kid movie wasted everyones time and whilst being very entertaining to watch didn't need to be in this particular film. I can assume that her presence as a hard-core beating up men was to give the girls a thrill. That said if Robert downy doesn't thrill you nothing will. Sam jacks'n, and his team of hard-cores could have been wiped out of this movie along with the corny way stark came about the new power source. That would have opened up enough time to develop dons character as another iron man properly, and stark could have upgraded the power source in a way that was not clichéd, far fetched and made us want to skip ahead to the next amazing fight sequence. First film had a poor bad guy and the fighting was mediocre. This film had a wonderful villain and amazing fight scenes but it was over cluttered to the detriment of the central story. 7 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 has all the parts there, but something still seems to be missing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have found it hard to explain what is exactly wrong with this film.The script is a bit lazy and its obvious the studio stayed firmly in the comfort zone when they made this film, but its far from a terrible story or indeed a weak one. It is however fairly predictable for the most part, but with this genre that isn't unique either. It has its moments where it is almost fresh in its approach but then lets itself down by cute coincidences or amazing convenience to help the storyline along. The dialogue in the film is great, and at times it's a credit to the film that some of the best scenes come from non combative periods where Tony is simply interacting in a very human way with one of the other characters.The characters within the film are solid enough, and all acted anywhere between competently and brilliantly. Specific merit must be handed to Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer, the Tony Stark wannabe who is always looking out foe his own interests. Rourke does well with what is essentially a weakly comprised character in whiplash, a character who seemingly is a brilliant scientist but also an immoral muscular killer (the writer having his cake and eating it by the looks of it). Robert Downey Jr is always excellent when slapping us with a witty one liner, but for some reason the makers of the film felt that Stark needed to be filled with daddy issues and have him moping around in self pity rather than being a little bit more close to the bone in areas such as his drinking problem and realisation of mortality (both attempted at but neither really let off the leash in any way).The action sequences are best described as 'efficient'. They have moments of unique ideas, but the strange abruptness of them and a seeming lack of any kind of flow to them makes them almost forgettable as a set piece, only leaving you with a memory of a specific use of a weapon or a one liner Stark might have reeled off during. This interspersed with lulls in the films general flow (on too many occasions unnecessarily to allow us to endure Stark's self pity again) really ends up frustrating since they highlight the dip in the film between the several genuinely great scenes it contains.The nods to avengers related references was great as a fan of the marvel universe, but also served as a reminder that this film had been tainted by the need to promote the franchise it was a part of rather than simply letting the film breathe on its own. And the sense this might have been rushed a little to meet a set timetable for films leading up to the crown jewel avengers film at the end of it all cannot be dismissed lightly.In summary, the characters and dialogue carry what is otherwise an inessential sequel, and although a little jerky throughout and ultimately leaving you a little let down, it's still better than a lot of the more average efforts marvel have recently produced. To try and determine where it exactly went wrong is not easy, as all the parts are there but yet something still feels missing, and that could simply be a bit of a soul. The safe zone marvel and the studio bosses hide inside may have left the film a little sterile ultimately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw first Iron Man back in 08' I was very pleased with the experience. Robert Dwoney Jr was a fresh revelation as a Tony Stark/Iron Man witty,clever,slick pretentious guy with all the money in the world. His relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow's character was full of chemistry and it was joy to see them playing off of each other. Add to this couple of great cgi and sound effects here and there, simple script with plain anti war message, and you have yourself great blockbuster summer flick. This time around, like in majority of sequels we get all the same, but in multiple proportions in different variations, and like in most of the cases there is almost nothing really new here. Downey Jr. is great again, there is no reason of course to improve on that in any way, also we get to see Mickey Rourke as one of the villains, and I'd say that the way he underplays his character, making him very ominous, mysterious man is most intriguing addition to the formula, as we anticipate while watching the movie for him to come up on screen more often. We get also Scarlet Johannson as a sexy counter proposal to Paltrow's character for Tony's affection, Sam Rockwell as Stark's old rival, and even Sam Jackson lands a bigger(yet very cartoonish) part here. Nevertheless the movie feels juvenile, as despite very intense approach from Rourke(who went to Russia for preparation on his part), we see actions that feel like taken out from video game, which will not be very much exciting for anyone above 15 years old mark. When you see Don Cheadle's face(another great actor on the payroll here-taking over Terrence Howard's part)in the Iron Man style suite batteling with Tony Stark dozens of robots, you don't think about how great he was in "Hotel Rwanda", you think Power Rangers.All in all I've seen worse comic book movies(Wolverine,Daredevil), I've seen better comic book movies sequels(The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2). Iron Man 2 is watchable, just don't expect the unexpected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a massive, Die-Hard fan of Iron-Man has enabled me to (I think) walk into these films with a sense of perspective. I haven't obsessed over trailers or watched any pre-release clips on purpose, in order to allow some surprises.Don't get me wrong: I am a huge Superhero fan, and have in the past, watched the iron-Man cartoon, but that's it.My over-all impression of this film is that it's bigger, brighter, bolder and dumber than the first film. That's not a criticism. the first film had a degree of suspensions of disbelief that were contextually acceptable.With the second film, everything has been ramped up. The action is bigger, the plot: bigger, the characters: larger, the threat: larger and this all amplifies what was great about the first film. It also does the same for the bad.With that said: the good far outweighed the bad in the first one and it's still the case with this one. It's just that the weak parts of the film are larger and more obvious this time round.The performances were great, of course, aside from Scarlett Johanson who just looked out of place throughout in my opinion.Go see it. You will like it. But Dark Knight it ain't (despite trying to better the number of cars Batman blew up).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not very fond of superhero movies, but I had to make an exception when I first saw Iron Man. It had everything: action, visuals, great performances (except Gwyneth), comedy and drama. It was also a criticism to the arms industries. After the first movie's success, it was a logical move to make the second part. Now we see Tony Stark, the narcissistic and eccentric millionaire, enjoying his huge fame as Iron Man, the savior, the peacemaker. Everybody loves him, except his commercial rival and Ivan, a Russian physicist who wants revenge from the Stark family. The Government also plays a big role here, they want Stark's technology to be in the hands of the US Army, before anyone else. But Tony is Tony and he will fight for his creation. The first part of the movie seems to go very slowly, adding little to the plot. Because of this, the climatic scenes had to the shortened, giving me the feeling that something was missing. Scarlett Johansson was a good addition, but her role was more decorative than necessary. Again, Gwyneth Paltrow disappointed me, but I recognize that her performance was less plain. Scarlett just stole her thunder. I think the script wasn't surprising enough to keep the audiences guessing what will happen next. Robert Downey's charisma is what saves the entire movie and that's why I recommend it. It's entertaining enough for a popcorn weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Iron Man 2' has been the most anticipated movie of May, and yet the year 2010. So many action scenes have been awaited in this movie including the appearance of 'War Machine', 'Whiplash', 'Black Widow' and not to forget, new armors of 'Iron Man'.Action scenes have been the most anticipated thing in this movie. Too bad, the movie didn't put a lot of fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are only a few and they are pretty short. In around 124 minutes of duration, I have expected around at least 40 minutes of those to be fighting scenes.All the visual effects and the story are not really a problem. The blasts, explosions and damage, they were pretty perfect. The details were also satisfying. Only fighting scenes were the real missing things.The fighting scene at the end was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it especially when they're up against 'Whiplash'. But, the fight was way too short. There were like only a few moves they did and done. It needs more action scenes. In total, there were like only four short fighting scenes.In summary, 'Iron Man 2' was satisfying but needs a lot more fighting scenes. But, the movie was still great. 8 stars for 'Iron Man 2'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed IRON MAN 2. But there are some very minor stuff that sort of bothered me. First off, I did like the character played by Mickey Rourke, which is Ivan Vanko (which seems to be a combination of the comic book characters Whiplash &amp; Crimson Dynamo). But I felt that the details of the character were too underdeveloped. We got to see his some of his quirks and a little bit of back story which we thought was going to be spotlighted later on in the movie. Only to realize that the back story which felt like a teaser was not fully satisfied in the end anyway, and we walk off the movie not really having a full grasp what his character was all about. If the story wanted him to be a mysterious "force of nature" villain, the film should not have heavily teased on a back story in the first place, and should have gone with the fully mysterious psycho all the way. Basically his character was out to have vengeance on Stark, accusing his family of stealing an idea his (Vanko's) father pioneered. But in the end, it really was not clear what that "stealing of idea" was all about, or how Vanko's father was allegedly betrayed by the Stark family.You cannot dismiss the movie as just a superhero movie because like any good superhero movie, the story focuses on the story's characters rather than on just the superhero. The film does not solely rely on action, but much on humor. There were moments in the middle of the movie that made me forget I was watching a superhero movie, or an action movie. Much of the movie centers its focus on Tony Stark's relationship with his friend Rhodes, his assistant Pepper Potts, and his rival Justin Hammer. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow is very sparklingly attractive and fun to watch.Don Cheadle was fine as Rhodes, Tony Stark's friend. But the fact that he is not physically consistent with Terence Howard, the actor he replaced for the role, messes up what should have been a fluid consistency with the previous Iron Man movie. In the end you forget about it (and he is, in comparison, as good as a replacement as Maggie Gyllenhal was in replacing Katie Holmes in the Dark Knight movie).Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent in his role. His Tony Stark is like the new role model; girls throw themselves at him &amp; guys wanna be like him. His humor is always on the spot and his charms are flawless. His screen presence and how he makes a scene come alive is the major battery that makes this an enjoyable film.And then there's Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. Which reminds me of the other nitpick detail that hated about the movie, and that is Nick Fury's first appearance in the movie. For a character which is supposed to have some degree of importance, his first scene looked like it lacked impact. Fury, appearing and having a conversation with Stark, in morning daylight, while wearing that shiny coat, made him look like a joke. And then we see the first costume appearance of Black Widow in the same scene, which also made her appearance have no impact at all. In fact, it was a scene that awkwardly made Nick Fury and Black Widow look silly and indeed looked like two people wearing costumes for some Halloween party. Even though the first line of Fury was indeed very funny, I still stand by the opinion that it was one scene that was just poorly conceptualized.Comedian Garry Shandling also appears in the movie, and although his role is not a major one, I consider him to be a highlight of the movie. He plays a Senator who is very skeptical and critical of Tony Stark and seems to have a shady background. His role was deadpan serious and almost villainous that he instantly feels like an un-ignorable beloved "other villain". From the moment he appears you can tell that he's supposed to be a big A-hole, and he does a great job with it.Jon Favreau who is both a great actor, comedian, and is also the director of the movie did a great job in making this sequel spectacular and continuously fun to watch. Despite its flaws, the movie was very enjoyable. It was well-paced, and designed never to bore its audience. The dialogues are very witty. And its performers do a marvelous job with their lines. It also had interesting non-cliché comedy gold moments. One of the funniest scenes that I enjoyed involve Robert Downey Jr. and one of those office decorations (you will know by the time you watch the movie). Although I felt that there would have been many interesting stunts or refreshingly new action tricks that can be made with the new villains (especially one with a super-powered whip), I cannot disregard the fact that the film invested more on the storyline aspect so to not make this movie just a mere "dumb action flick" that wants to appeal to all audience demographics.All in all, IRON MAN 2 is a High Matinée movie. Although greatly flawed, these flaws are only noticeable from a critical point of view. Even I came out of it with a full-bar fun movie experience, and only realizing its flaws hours later. If you love a movie with witty characters and some cool heavy metal robot action, then this movie is definitely for you. And let me remind you that there is an additional scene after the end credits, so if you don't wanna miss it then you might wanna stay awhile for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>much more action... less story... still great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like movies with more action and less time being wasted in developing a back-story and detailed character build-ups then this movie is definitely for you.Fans of the comics will probably enjoy the movie more than those of us who are not already familiar with the new set of characters. But things fall into place as the movie develops so it doesn't take away too much from the overall enjoyment.The actors are all pretty good, Mickey Rourke does very well and so does Scarlet Johansson. Don Cheadle seems a little out of place in the beginning (not because of his acting, more because I really liked Terrence Howard in the first film) but as the movie develops he starts fitting the role much better. By the end of the film I didn't miss Terrence so much. Samuel L Jackson could have done with some more screen time, but I feel that they are developing him for the next installment in the franchise.Overall, the film was still Great! With a mix of the humor and fantastic special effects that made the first film so good.Go watch this movie with an open mind, expecting lots of action, some good moments of humor (there were lots of ladies sitting near and around us laughing out loud at many parts of the film so they obviously found it to be pretty good, as did the guys).Everyone's going to be talking about Iron Man 2 and everyone will have their opinions about what they liked or disliked about it (compared to the first installment). Don't miss out, watch Iron Man 2, it will not be a waste of time or money, and join-in on the discussions!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 is the only film you must not miss. Simply Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came back from a 12'clock session of this movie, a lot of people were there but i got a good spot so here it goes....Plot: Now that the world knows about the identity of Iron Man, Millionaire Tony Stark denies the governments demands to try to produce more of his iron man suit for the military. Later, he will face even more deadly enemy, Whiplash. Also featuring new heroes: Natalie Rushman and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (who soon becomes War Machine.) I didn't expect much for this to top off the first one, it did well and this movie is more superior than other superhero movies we know today, such as: Spider-Man and X-Men. It just made these two movies look like toy dolls.The running time made me felt like i was watching it for days, but it was a long experience of greatness. Even, the CGI effects have really changed and it was something different to see for movies today.Overall: Iron Man is back in this overloaded Blockbuster full of exploding action, laughs and dazzling CGI.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and honest movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After The Dark Knight, it seems most of people always expect movies being all the same, nothing more than carbon copies of themselves.That said, is important to mention Iron Man 2 was quite a surprise. I was expecting for a movie with silly dialogue and over the top and pointless action.However the movie was way better than I thought and it gave me fun, some good laughs and emotion. Don't expect action throughout the movie. The action IS in the movie and it was WAY better than the first movie.There is a good amount of dialogue, but it's important to make people understanding some stuff that happens in the movie. There is character development, something hard to see nowadays, even in a ordinary flick.We had a cool hero, his lover, his friend, his nemesis, his problems, his fears. That's it, a honest movie with some good action scenes to make things better.Maybe the ending could be longer, and some characters didn't actually add too much. So far, these are my problems with the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why the hell do some critics not give it he praise it deserves? THIS WAS OUTSTANDING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We walked out of the cinema absolutely energized. I was amazed at how great a movie it was and how close it stayed to the source material. I still had some personal problems with the movie (such as i wanted to see more of the characters alcohol addiction to be fleshed out)but i soon thought "thats what sequels are for". I was pumped for Iron Man 2 and even though it didn't go in to the alcohol abuse that much anyway, i still sat through the whole 2 hours and came out wanting to see it again the next day. Iron Man 2 was not only a spectacular movie, but a superior sequel, and a fantastic comic book movie all in one. That is hard to come by. The Dark Knight was a spectacular movie, a mildly superior sequel but in terms of being a good comic book movie.... lets just say that Christopher Nolan seems like he's afraid of the fantasy nature of the source material. This review is going to look over those aspects and it may contain spoilers so i suggest that you should see the movie first before you read on. OK. The Movie opens right where the first film leaves off. Tony's Iron Man identity is now known to the world. His character arc in the first film took him from being an egotistical prick to a thought provoking hero. with the theme of how his actions have affected the world and what he is now going to do to rectify it. But as the film begins, he now is egotistical from soaking up the glory of being a hero, which brings him into social conflict with his aid Pepper Potts and close friend James Rhodes. Tony is also faced with having to deal with pressure to hand over his Iron Man armor to the government. If that wasn't enough, a rival industrialist named Justin Hammer is out to get his cut and a Russian ex-con Ivan Vanko is out with a personal vendetta against tony. It is very clear in this film that the stakes are far higher than they were in the first film. critics have argued that not everything in the film is tied up and the end. but that is simply not true. the film not only ties things up, but leaves possibilities open for not only future Iron Man films, but for future Avengers films. The Film is not a part 2, it is a continuation of the first film, and clearly continues the character arcs of Tony Stark, by bringing in the realization of Futurism to the character, which is one of if not the most important aspect of the Iron Man character. the film goes in to it just enough, so that it have a chance for future films to delve into further Iron man complexities. As well as this, the film continues to explore the social argument of how dangerous technology can be utilized. The Government wants his armor to use as a weapon of defense (of destruction) but Tony does not give it up because he is Iron Man. the suit isn't. Iron Man is the symbol of Futurism and consequence. It is not the gun, it is the arm that is the real hero. and whoever is behind the gun, will leave serious consequences (being the main thrust behind the antagonist) The Character arc that tony goes through, sees him first treat the role of Iron Man as an opportunity for attention, but over the film, he understands that is a symbol for a greater future as his father intended him to be. this is shown clearly in the film through the basic progression, as well as through the plot devises, (such as the arc technology killing him and he replaces it with a new energy source. this serves as a metaphor for the actual progression). Very few would argue that tony leaves this film completely undeveloped. the only reason anyone would not grasp the progression, is the fact that the film has a slightly lighter tone than the first one. Having a darker tone makes is easier for an audience to capture intelligence and maturity. But Iron Man 2 was able to deliver it in spades. There's no reason that you can't greatly develop a story if the tone is light. Iron Man proves it. If someone is arguing that it is stupid to have all the plot points that establish the Avengers and then doesn't use it by the end of the film, i say that they are hypocrites. nobody was nit-picking at The Lord of the Rings trilogy for foreshadowing things in the first films and only using them in the last. Most of the film consists of very enjoyable interactions between characters, much like in the first film. however this film delivers far more than the first, with well written dialog and well written characters. the film uses the witty comedy in such a natural way, that it is easy to digest all of the light and sly moments. every single member of the cast puts on there absolute A game and every character has a powerful screen presence (even Scarlett Johanson who is sadly underused until the 3rd act. this is the on of the only problems that spring to mind). the enjoyment, character interaction and development Makes even the scenes where Iron Man isn't blowing things up just a ball the watch. But there is my segue-way in to the action. the Action direction is miles above the first film. far more exciting, far higher stakes and far more explosive, while still not over blowing the film. I highly recommend this to everyone. I highly recommend that you do not listen to the mild amount of negative reviews. Go see it. go love it!!!!!!! and stay in after the credits :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, i got to catch the film yesterday night and i thought it was truly amazing and magnificent , i am planning it to watch it again but the film was truly remarkable , i mean . The film surely passes it's pressedor. But i thought the last scene battling Whiplash was short. Whiplash uses his electrical string and just flipped it to Iron Man and War Machine, then they used their hand power and blast it in each other making Whiplash die. Acting was nice, visual and actions and good. The action was actually better than the first one quite a lot. But the bad thing that the movie was so short. Around 126=2 hours 6 minutes long. If it was around 130 minutes, it would be betterSo now i gave you my review, i would give this movie a 10.10 I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves Iron Man. If you watch it, Make sure you watch the scene after the credits about Mojab, Thor's Hammer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will definitely be one of the best movies (if not the best) I see in 2010. Robert Downey JR returns to do Tony Stark, better and funnier than ever! Tony Stark is enjoying life as himself and as being the famous Iron Man. A huge threat comes to his attention. A man with whips is trying to kill him! With the help of Don Cheadle as War Machine, the two of them try to bring a man who calls himself Whip Lash to justice! Mickey Rourke plays the part very well! It just goes to show you've never too old to be a badass villain! Scarlet Johanson plays a very hot, but very suspicious lady! The rest of the cast are good as well.My only complaint is the middle half of the movie goes abit too slow and drags on abit. I wont reveal why, but you will see what I mean when you watch it. And Iron Man does reveal how he goes to the bathroom while wearing the Iron Man suit! I'd give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable mess ? but don't expect a lot of action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2 is perfectly adequate good-natured summer entertainment, but it loves its characters so much that it forgets to give them anything much to do.The cast are uniformly excellent, the script is more intelligent than your average blockbuster ? the one big flaw is the complete absence of any real action until the very end. The film could have easily been called "Iron Man's Day Off", there was that little going on for most of it. You get an impressive Grand Prix scene about half an hour in but otherwise its all talk, with Iron Man only doing a few party tricks until the obligatory final reel action overload. That comes a little too late and is somewhat samey ? in the next film (and I do hope they do make one) I'd like to see Iron Man fight something other than robots or guys in robot suits.I must add that I was also very disappointed to see that only two AC/DC songs actually featured in the film, will have to watch Maximum Overdrive again to compensate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many awful movies: "Iron Man 2" is one of them. The story lacks quickness and suspense. The photography is shabby and bleak, with depressing effects on the audience. The action scenes are boring, confused and loaded with useless special effects. Iron Man - Robert Downey Jr. is clumsy and over-weigh: the comparison with Robert Hays is dismaying! Moreover, in one scene we see Tony Stark shirtless, an intrinsically horrible idea. And then... the naked man is a stunt! Are we in a lunatic asylum, or what? Pepper Pott is turned in a sort of female-warrior (to gratify the feminists, I guess). And (sorry) I find her rather unattractive. For the sake of political correctness, Tony Stark has a Muslim mate, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Well, Jackson is a great actor and an extremely nice guy. After all, his presence is the only non-awful side of "Iron Man 2", a highly non-recommended movie.This movie is strictly for those people who have not seen the earlier Iron Man. Because they will compare and this one would fail miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sequel is definitely up on par with The Dark Knight in my book. The story and acting is so believable that it seems as if they are the characters and the graphics are definitely upgraded from the original film!!! Then the armors and weapons all look as if Iron Man and War Machine could be reality. Now don't get me wrong there is a good amount of dialog in this film but it does the film and characters justice. So you'll really understand where the characters come from. Even though I thought Terrence Howard was great as Rhodey, Don Cheadle was just as good like I predicted. Mickey Rourke really shined in this role as he did in Sin City and The Wrestler, his presence gave the me the same reaction as Heathe Ledger did with The Joker just speechless. Bottom line is that if you loved the first Iron Man and are a fan of the actors and director, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IRON MAN 2 - A Colossal Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summer blockbuster season always brings with it at least one big disappointment. This year's comes right up front ? and what a disappointment it is. IRON MAN 2 is a classic sequel in the worst sense: we've got more villains, more heroes, more money in the budget, and none of it amounts to an experience that comes even close to that of its predecessor, which stood out in 2008 as smart, effervescent counter-programming in the summer dominated by the dour DARK KNIGHT.The problems with IRON MAN 2 are bone deep, but they manifest themselves everywhere on the surface. While the first film focused neatly on Tony and his development from careless cad to honorable hero, this sequel gives him nowhere to go, and at some point in the filming/editing, director Jon Favreau must have realized this; hence, his new movie's many secondary characters and subplots receive a disproportionate share of screen time here. Tony is all but discarded as a dynamic character ? and it becomes very clear very early that without the original's central arc (and I ain't talking arc reactor, hiyo,) there's really not much novel about this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair sequel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed the first film in this series and was hoping for more of the same in the sequel. Fortunately I wasn't too disappointed, it lived up to the first one, maybe not quite as good (sequels seldom are), but a fine effort nonetheless. The setting is New York where Tony Stark, having revealed himself as Iron Man and having brought peace to the world, is holding his Stark Expo, an exhibition of technology from all over the world. An idea originated by his father, Howard.In Russia, Ivan Vanko, brooding after the death of his father, Anton, who had worked with Howard Stark on the early prototype of the power source that now drives Iron Man's suit. He was extradited back to Russia for espionage and made to live in Siberia. Ivan, now seeking revenge works on a suit of his own. Meanwhile back in the USA, Tony Stark has been summoned before a Senate committee who are determined to get him to give them the Iron Man suit for military use. One of the experts called to the hearing is Justin Hammer, one of Stark's former competitors when he made weapons for a living. Bringing his friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes to testify backfires on the committee and Stark wins the day, but things are not over between him and Hammer.Stark now decides to hand control of Stark Industries over to Pepper Potts having discovered his health is at risk from wearing the suit. The papers are drawn up and a woman from the legal department, Natalie Rushman, brings them for signing. She impresses Stark and later becomes Pepper's assistant. Heading to Monaco, Stark decides to compete in a motor race. He is surprised when Ivan Vanko turns up and destroys his car with plasma whips. Fortunately, Pepper is there with his Iron Man suit and he manages to subdue the Russian. Vanko goes to jail but is later sprung by someone who is very interested in his work.Returning home, Stark prepares for his birthday party, but with many things praying on his mind he gets drunk wearing the suit and ends up in a fight with Rhodey. Enter Nick Fury who helps put Stark back on the road to recovery and reveal that someone close to him is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Hammer is due to show the work he has been doing at Stark's Expo and he has a few things he wants to surprise him with. Things are brewing up for a big fight at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for you, I'll just say it's pretty spectacular and Vanko isn't finished with Stark just yet.This is a very well made film with plenty of very well designed and executed special effects. The score is great, but if you put AC/DC, The Clash and Queen in there you're always going to get my vote! The performances were all good, special mentions go to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko. Honourable mentions go to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.I must admit I didn't much care for the character of Tony Stark at first, he is egotistic and narcissistic. As the film went on he did show he does have a human side though. Justin Hammer is equally egotistic which I found made for an interesting dynamic to this good versus evil story. I also had a problem with America being the centre of everything, yet again, it's like the rest of the world doesn't exist! (Apart from Monaco). Although I did find it amusing when Stark is standing in front of a giant US flag projected on a screen with an Australian/British rock band providing the music. But enough of these minor niggles, the film is great fun, not as good as the first one, but as sequels go, it's certainly watchable. Over all, recommended.My score: 7.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a must see to any marvel fan, Iron Man fan, film fan, human being, any other sort of life form. Its basically the awesome-ness of giant robots from transformers 1 (not 2 thats fail) and much better action crossed with good character detail and a plot that makes sense. so basically nothing like transformers.As u all must know by now there is a scene after the credits so stick around if your interested in the marvel universe. There are also a couple of obvious links in the film to other films.The cast is amazing I though that Don Cheadle as Rhodey would be a let down but in my eyes he is an upgrade, he really hits the floor running. All the cast are amazing and Mickey Rourke makes an awesome Russian, he really brings his character to life.Basically defiantly go watch it and see for your self, but if u like the first one or anything marvel you will LOVE it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Great as the first, but Still A Good Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE first "Iron Man" was such a well-crafted and fun movie that its sequel would be hard put to keep up the standard. Well, this one, directed by Jon Favreau, tries hard and is nearly there. It has all that one would expect from an "Iron Man" sequel, even if it is unevenly plotted in some places.What's more, there is Mickey Rourke thundering in as the menacing Ivan 'Whiplash' Vanko and the sexy Scarlett Johansson as the ass-kicking Natalie Rushman (a cover for Black Widow?).The narcissistic and egoistic Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) has owned up to being Iron Man. Under pressure from the US government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armour because he fears the information will get into the wrong hands.Meanwhile, Tony's past is coming back to haunt him. A demented Russian inventor named Ivan Vanko (Rourke) seeks revenge for the wrongs that had been done to his father. With Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts the powerful new forces that have ganged up on him.The most nail-biting and inventive sequence of the movie comes about 20 minutes into the movie - at the Grand Prix scene where Ivan causes some spectacular mayhem and destruction. After that, every thing seems to pale beside it. The CGI sequences of the armoured men and droids battles bring a sense of deja vu, especially if you recall the actions of the first film. The other 'villain' of the film, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), remains very much a caricature (even if the film is adapted from a comic book) while Garry Shandling seems to be playing Gary Shandling rather than Senator Stern.There are a few pleasant surprises though. They are Samuel L. Jackson as the hard-talking Nick Fury and of course, Johansson who lights up every scene she is in. Paltrow maintains her charm as Tony Stark's assistant Pepper Potts but she is overshadowed by the nubile and fighting-fit Johansson. At least she helps us forget the 'down' moments of the movie when director Favreau delves into Tony's 'electronic heart' and blood problems.All in all, director Favreau has kept the faith and maintained the thrills and spills of the flying Tin Man. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)</fullReview>

The old story of love, sacrifice and heroism, upgrade for a new audience, and a great gift for the 70' and 80's children.I like the detail that the hero was a man in his 35' old, with a little boy and wife; after all, mostly of the Iron Man fans we have on this age now, still, this is not a fanatic movie, its a fresh story and people of all ages can enjoy it...its funny, this movie has the same elements of R. Emmerich's Godzilla, but without pretensions... and this was made with good taste! Maybe the story is a little slow at the beginning, middle, and ending, and some characters could be more exploited, but nothing that the audience can stand. Half way through the film I realised that I am basically watching a recycled Power Rangers movie by the guy who made "Elf" in 2003 with Will Ferrill! Then the movie ended and you still want actual action! Thanks for bring us Iron Man back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was such a big fan of the original movie and had been looking forward to this sequel for a while. Sadly this effort just didn't live up to expectations.That is not to say the movie is terrible or boring but it just missed something.Downey Jr, Rourke, Rockwell, Paltrow and Johansson performing together should have added up to something great but unfortunately it just added up to something that was OK.Hard to identify a single flaw but I got the impression that the film makers started off with a project that was just too ambitious (a cynic might describe it as a project that was too poorly defined).Some of the plot leaps, clunky dialogue and vanishing characters made me think a lot of material had been cut and gaps had been filled with hasty re-shoots.Go and see this by all means. You will probably enjoy it but it really could have been so much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would put it at the same level of the first movie: entertaining but not highly memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Iron Man because of the solid performances and the good decision to base the movie on Tony Stark's personality, his interaction with Pepper Potts and the origins of the superhero.Howover, by my humble point of view, the supporting story was generic, the villain lacked of a defined motivation, and the battles did not provoke too much suspense or emotion on me.Those elements made me not to be completely satisfied with the movie, but I cannot deny it entertained me, specially due to Robert Downey Jr.'s brilliant work on the leading role.Now, with Iron Man 2, screenwriter Justin Theroux tries to keep the formula untouchable, but he adds so many supplementary elements to the narrative that the film feels badly focused and a bit tiring on a few occasions.However, I think it is a competent sequel which has the same balance of virtues and defects of the first film.Iron Man 2 has enough dramatic points in its screenplay in order to fill two entire movies, so all the dramatic threads do not enjoy of the same attention, and as a consequence, some of them feel too light and hasty.That is a typical mistake of a comic-book adaptation; we saw it in Spider-Man 3, in The Dark Knight and we now see it on Iron Man 2.However, we fortunately back to have Downey Jr. on the leading role, and he rescues many scenes with his sparkling performance.What least worked for me in this movie were the scenes with Nick Fury and his S.H.I.E.L.D. "entourage", something which was a bit frustrating, because I have always liked that character and what it represents in the Marvel Comics universe, not to mention the character was given a limited screen time.Another one of the characters which suffered because of lack of time was Natalia Rushman, which disappointed me for the same reason as Fury.After many years of reading her fascinating adventures on the comics, and knowing her remarkable evolution, I was disappointed to simply see her as a secretary with a mysterious past.Sure, she participates on a good action scene, but that only stressed the fact that the character's potential was not appropriately exploited.However, I have to clear that my complains about the characters of Fury and Rushman do not extend to the actors.On the contrary, Scarlett Johansson feels credible as Rushman, and Samuel L. Jackson brings a perfect balance of gravity, threaten and humor to Fury.Gwyneth Paltrow also brings a competent performance as Stark's romantic interest/confident/helper.Don Cheadle is solid as "Rhodey", but I think I liked Terrence Howard's performance on the previous movie on the same role a bit more.Sam Rockwell is appropriately hateful as Stark's competitor.And finally, the great Mickey Rourke brings a decent development as the mysterious Vanko; however, I think his character is superficially written, with few attention to the details of his personality.In summary, I would put Iron Man 2 on the exact same level of the first film: entertaining but not highly memorable.I can recommend it mainly because the action scenes are well filmed (director Jon Favreau improved on that field in comparison with the first movie), the performances are competent and the film is never boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to the standard the first set, but still one to check out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years ago, the first Iron Man movie was released, becoming a surprise critical and commercial success. So, naturally, a sequel was inevitable. The question was, can the sequel fulfill what seems to be the code for comic book movies, and top the first? The answer: Not quite. But that is not to say it was a bad movie at all. It just falls short of great. One of the main issues of the movie was the pacing. There were many points where it lagged, leaving you simply waiting for the next scene. It just felt a little padded out. It just didn't feel as well put together as the first.Of course, the movie had many good points as well, including Robert Downey Jr pulling out his charisma again as Tony Stark and Mickey Rourke embracing his dark side to play a pretty good villain. Not to mention Don Cheadle doing a fine job stepping into the role of Rhodey that Terrence Howard playing in the first, with this time the character having a much bigger and better role. When the action scenes do finally arrive, they are generally a whole lot of fun, with the exception of the big villain fight, which was sadly very anti-climactic. A big complaint from some people about the first movie was that it had a disappointing villain with a mediocre final fight. Well, Iron Man 2 had a really cool villain, but an even more mediocre final fight. The visual effects were just as good as the first film, but also seemed to be used a lot less.Also joining the cast list was the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and the director Jon Favreau, as Natalie Rushman, Justin Hammer and Happy Hogan respectively. Johansson did a decent job, not bringing a whole lot to the role, but basically all that was needed for the character. Favreau being in the movie was pretty unnecessary, with his character being basically the same sort of offsider that Favreau played in Daredevil. As Justin Hammer, Rockwell did well playing a sleazy Stark competitor.In closing, the movie is worth checking out, but make sure you don't go in expecting the first movie again. I personally enjoyed myself, despite feeling occasionally bored. I feel that it was the sort of movie that will seem better on repeat viewings, when I'm not just waiting to see when they will give us another action scene. Not that I am only interested in action scenes, it's just that as I said before, certain parts of the movie just lagged a little too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this sequel is one of the best sequels i've ever see, along with The Dark Knight,Terminator 2,Star wars episode V and VI and episode III,The Godfather 2 and maybe not a sequel but The Two Towers and The Return Of The King.Great as Iron man 1, and Oscar worthy performance of Robert Downey Jr. and an excellent performance of Mickey Rourke,Sam Rockwell, Gwyneth Pathrow and Don Cheadle.Iron man 2 is a full action packed movie with an excellent story, excellent performance of all the actors, and included parts where the comedy was useful to make the movie one of the best sequels ever made and one of the best superheroes movie of all and stand with the top 5 of marvel movies along with Spider man 2, X-Men 2, Hulk (2008)and Iron Man.In conclusion I highly recommend you to see this movie because is full packed with everything necessary to make a perfect super hero movie and one of the best sequels in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron man - cast iron story: whats with the bad reviews? Fans stay for bonus scene!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunched and full of dread, I went to the preview bracing myself for disappointment and came out grinning and strutting to AC/ DC. IM2 picked up well from where it had left off in stylish form - sexy, and piles of style from Robert Downey Jnr and a commandeering supporting cast: notably Don Cheadle as IM2's ally Rhodey and an award should go to Sam Rockwell's chucklesome performance as a wannabe Stark. The audience were a good crowd, quite a few fans, so there were a number of laugh out loud moments. Whiplash's psychotic drawling character was an admirable antagonist that even the wise cracking chaps at the back mid-heckle (maybe its the shows I go to, but there's always one!)There were a number of bad reviews citing poor/ unnecessary plot, and even "too many baddies" in a Spiderman III esquire way. As far as I could see, the plot points this particular reviewer had listed as frivolous and unnecessary were a good scriptwriters tool to add growing tension. Sound effects were good, rocking the action, but the sound track didn't synch amazingly with certain scenes - had a couple of good choons though (see AC/DC comment above). Johansson plays a tantalising role - but not due to her her acting and witty lines. Catsuit? What catsuit?!Off to go and watch Iron Man 1 again now... my man is convinced it is better than IM2. I am of the opinion that we're spoilt with the concept and style of the first movie, and we're harder to impress with the second. Hope Im right... there a bit of money riding on this...Fans will want to see the bonus scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched yesterday and I'll take my chances and say it that it's even better than the first one! Action packed and a lot of laughing is what you might expect. As a comic book fan as myself it's a dream come true specially all the hints you'll be getting on other marvel superheroes coming to the big screen^^ I can't remember any significant flaws, there wasn't anything that I didn't enjoy. The cast was awesome as always. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer was brilliant along with RDJ it's an explosive combination. Scarllet, Sam Jackson and Gwyneth Paltrow were great. Whiplash could be a little bit more developed but Mickey Rourke did also a fine job. WarMachine was badass!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iron Man 2 Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iron Man 2, arguably one of the most anticipated movies of the summer, opens next week. And with its opening, the summer blockbuster season starts in earnest. And I was so excited, I took a relatively long trip to see this movie early.And what a way to start off the movie season.The first Iron Man movie, I think, came as a surprise to many movie fans. Yes, as a member of the Avengers, Iron Man is important in the Marvel Comics Universe, but usually takes a back seat to the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, the X-Men, and of course, Spider-Man.But the first Iron Man movie was comic book perfection. Short of the Dark Knight and possibly Spider-Man 2, it may have been the best superhero movie ever, depending on who is making the argument. It took a relatively unknown character in Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the self-loathing, narcissistic playboy billionaire Tony Stark, and brought the story t the masses. The introduction story was ideal in every way. And Stark's progression from a selfish genius to a superhero is unlike most we see in movies.And taking that all into consideration, it is incredible that Iron Man 2 out duels its predecessor.More at http://neoavatara.com/blog/?p=10808</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you go into this film expecting Oscar performances then you are in the wrong screen room. however if you go into this film with the same child like excitement that you should have left with from the first then your going to be a happy paying customer! Robert Downey Jnr provides the same brilliant role of arrogance and one liners that allowed the original cartoon TV series fans to love the first film. the addition of new characters thickens may worry some avid fans that this maybe another Spiderman error, but this time round Jon Favreau has done a great job in keeping it simple (and delivering a great supporting role as the driver again)!! the special effects are very good, as expected, creating a well made film which knows exactly what is about and what it should provide in the cinema. for those of you that want to pick holes in the film then you can, but in the most part you are just fooling yourselves. this is hugely enjoyable film and one that fans of the first one should definitely go and see at the cinema.go see it iron man fans!! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then I was expecting but not what I hoped for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me start out by saying that though this movie is good it won't be as good if you haven't seen the 1st movie.The viewers main complaints have been the lack of a solid plot (like transformer 2 except not as bad) and some of the plot holes. After catching an early screening of this movie I had mixed thoughts going in but largely came out generally satisfied. To me the trailers I saw didn't look very impressive and once they got rid of Terrence Howard it just bummed me out even more.The movie generally seemed to take itself less serious than the 1st movie, that irritated me. One of the things I loved so much about the first movie was how well they conveyed it so you didn't feel like it was another cheesy superhero movie. Iron man 2 definitely had some hints of that.On the actors front everything was generally solid besides a few accent slips here and there. The only thing that stuck out to me was the feeling of Don Cheadle being sort of the replacement man,, I honestly couldn't shake that feeling. The plot holes I mainly heard was "why didn't Stark just fly over whiplash and blow his head off?" I generally understand their points but without the dramatized fights the movie would just be boring! :p However, the climactic ending (iron man 1 lacked) and the awesome CGI coupled with cool fight scenes really make this movie go from zero to hero. I would say that this is like a Transformers 2 except without such a big letdown and not as bad.Overall: 7/10 or B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to laugh at the amount of obviously stupid people who ran this film down and only went to it to find something wrong. I really enjoyed the first installment and it was the best kick off Marvel film to date but it presented an all too 'obviously going to be the bad guy' Stane. But little else to complain about. This film portrayed an unstable Stark played by the masterful Downey and showed his battles with drink, technology and public life in a real watchable fashion. Pepper Potts was wonderful and, as always Paltrow delivers a fine performance. Mickey Rourke was spine shiveringly amazing in his portrayal as Whiplash and was secretly deceptive in his intentions and abilities. Justin Hammer provides comic support too. Terrence Howard is forgotten in the blink of an eye and Cheadle is even better as Rhodie. The whole arms race and the military row over the Iron Man weapon is a great story and there is slow points in the middle of the film but when watched in full it's obvious that the entire film cannot be in fast forward. Nick Fury and Black Widow are played in superb form by Jackson and Johansson, providing blistering support and many surprises. The showdown at end is as always fantastic. The dialogue and action are all in true comic book style and I for one am looking forward to many more like this to come!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Loved The first Iron Man but this is by far so much better in every way due to the superior Iron Man's Return as Tony Stark. He has a whole world to entertain with his moves his conversations and especially his saving the world from evil. He however gets into situations where he gets drunk and people get scared of him but his side kick Iron Man 2 is on his side to help him overcome overconfidence. There is however an evil native man trying to get his revenge after the death of his father from the mighty Iron Man. He turns himself into a electrical vaporising machine man where he starts off Tony in the Grand Prix of auto racing and goes head to head with Iron Man in front of a whole crowd and stadium. Later on he experiments on a whole army of ironic machines and sends them to kill Iron Man but Iron Man 2 his sidekick is there to help and in the end defeat the mega electrical native man. Good movie must see for all Iron Man fans !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing follow-up that very nearly matches the brilliant first instalment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequels are the most difficult movies to get right. Fickle audiences are anticipating more of what they loved in the first flick, but don't want it to become repetitive. On the flipside they also expect it to be fresh and innovative without it feeling like an altogether dissimilar movie from the original. Trying to find that balance is an extremely tricky thing and most don't succeed. Where does IM2 fit in? It's not in the higher echelon of action sequels alongside The Dark Knight or X2, which bettered their predecessors, but it's definitely not far off and that's no easy feat.Justin Theroux's screenplay is crammed with a plethora of plot strands and for the most part ? minus a partially neglected Tony / Pepper subplot here and a wasted opportunity with Vanko there ? he manages to juggle them quite effectively. The biting social commentary from the initial film is back in addition to the trademark casual humour not seen in other comic book adaptations, however Theroux has expanded the Iron Man franchise with a slightly more light-hearted approach, undoubtedly due to the burgeoning Marvel movie-universe that is currently being formed. Subsequently there's a much stronger focus on the collective Marvel effort to come in the future, thanks to a larger part for Nick Fury (Jackson) and a couple of teasing moments (make sure you stay until the end of the credits) that hint at other characters looming nearby.Returning in the director's seat is the ever-surprising Jon Favreau, once again helming with confidence and flair. His handle on the action set-pieces increasingly gets better, despite a vaguely underwhelming climactic showdown, with the clash at Monaco's F1 Grand Prix and ruckus at Tony's Malibu mansion the highlights. The special effects team greatly aid Favreau as the CGI is practically faultless; the diverse machinery on show is photo-realistic ensuring the fight and flight sequences look amazing. Sans computer effects, a lithe Johansson rumbling with a handful of Hammer's henchmen will have you in awe, not just because of the outfit worn by Johansson but due to the excellent fight choreography and the fact that most of the stunts were performed by the actress herself.Portraying our uniquely cavalier protagonist, Downey Jr exudes charisma and style yet again. His cocky, eccentric exterior becomes a tad monotonous but never reaches a level that decreases his likability. Unexpectedly the cast member that challenges Downey Jr to best on screen is the equally peculiar and compelling Sam Rockwell. He makes what could have been a smarmy, one-dimensional villain into a humorous and engaging tyrant who even manages to outdo Tony in the comedy stakes. Elsewhere Rourke makes for a suitable tattooed Ruskie, Paltrow and Johannson offer sweet and sexy respectively and Cheadle fills the boots left by Terrence Howard gratifyingly. Kudos to Cheadle and the filmmakers for making the 'new' Rhodey's entrance a memorably quick-witted in-joke too; they swiftly dispel the audiences concern of having a different actor in the role.A rousing follow-up that very nearly matches the brilliant first instalment and will leave you keen for more Iron Man, whether in his own movie or not.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who cares about "It could be better", It already IS the BEST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, if you ask me what is the greatest super hero movie of all time, i can tell you even for 1000 times, it's Iron man 2. Why? Because it's better than Iron Man 1. The better story line of Iron man 2 attracted me right from the first time i've seen the trailer. It is not just a movie for kids like the first one, it's more complicated yet simple enough for us to understand and not making our head hurt like The Dark Knight did when we try to figure out what the real meaning of everything is. In Iron man 2, everything is almost obvious but still, there is something and someone can make you say: Wow! I didn't expect that! The graphic, what can i say, Kick-Ass. All the Marks look better with all those gadgets and weapons. The HUD is cooler and Jarvis, well, he is one of the biggest hits of the movie. I was shocked when the first time i watched the movie, when Tony uses his basement aka laboratory. I was like: WTH? Is that near future? If that is then that really kicks Avatar's future ass. Iron man 2 doesn't need to be 3D. It hits very hard in 2D already. The graphic of Iron man 2 is a real masterpiece that you can not take your eyes off the screen once you started to watch. Mr. Robert Downey Jr. comes back impressively. Together with Gwyneth, they create the funniest couple in a super hero movie. Samuel and Scarlett didn't exceptional job although they didn't really play big parts. Sam Rockwell still rocks with his moves, he may be a bit annoying but that is what we are looking for, an annoying and jealous Justin Hammer. Don Cheadle, yeah, i saw how he managed to be Terrence Howard, not very good but still a great effort. Thanks to the War Machine suit, his face is limited behind the mask and the movie is safe.Phew! Some would say Iron man 2 is boring, he is invincible. Yeah, so? Doesn't the world need a perfect super hero, rather than a man of steel who's scared by Cryptonite, rather than a dark knight who is affected badly by emotions and decisions that never had his real life. Tony Stark is a typical super hero. He showed the world who he is, yeah, he can do that, because he the coolest and the strongest. The world needs him, a perfect hero. It's 100% that he kicks all villains ass, it's not a rated R movie, not a super block buster movie but has a great crew. Whoever you are, just try Iron man 2 for once. It is not disappointing, no it is not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST ADAPTATION EVER! Long live the new king!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 2 is the best comic adaptation movie ever made. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. Now, the sequel advances as well if not better than the previous great "number 2's" in history. Spider-Man 2, X2 and TDK all took the second films of the franchise to new heights. Iron Man 2 does the same and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 2 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle was certainly an upgrade. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. It utilizes great dialogue that's witty, perfect use of humor yet again, advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best sequel of the decade. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. Long live the new king! What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can you say that about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Tony Stark is back with his Narcissist behavior. This movie was great from the beginning to the end. It is a great super hero popcorn flick, but it's not a great film. I thought that it was very entertaining and I love Tony Stark's personality. I think that Jon Favreau's Iron Man movie series is one of the greatest super hero movie series of all time. It has personality, unlike other super hero movies who try to be serious (And copy the dark knight that succeeded with being serious) but in the end fails because you can't take these kind of Super heroes serious.When they made this movie, they didn't try to make it serious, instead they made it funny and entertaining, like a superhero movie should be (Except Nolan's Batman series). This movie has it's flaws, but it's still great. This movie was as great as the first Iron Man, but this contained more action and I thought that Robert Downey JR and Mickey Rourke was Awesome. This movie is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is 111 if you are not using spaces. This movies was without question the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. And, I invited my friend to come with me since he doesn't go to the movies often and now he is mad at me because he hated it also. Now, don't get me wrong, I am thoroughly an Iron Man fan and read the comic most of my young life. But I think the movie was a movie designed to further the franchise. The setup for the Avengers is now strongly in place as they spent a very large part of the movie harping the Avengers. It took almost two hours before we even get to see the suit do anything worth watching. They spent more time showcasing Scarlet fighting than they did with Iron Man. Robert Downey also proves that he just gets more irritating as he gets older. That and whoever said Jon Favreau and Gwynneth Paltrow are stars should be put on trial. The four main characters just do not go together and the fact that they took out the best performer from the first one - Terence, is quite sad. I like Don Cheadle as much as the next guy but he doesn't even come close to making Rhodes believable. This movie has taken a terrible step back and should not be seen by anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.SPOILERS WITHIN. ----------------- Take note, ladies and gentlemen. This is what happens when you rush a sequel into production without first having a quality script...or even a good script. This is simply a poor movie. No doubt that it's fun, but when the fundamentals are not there, you still end up dissatisfied.What is Tony Stark's goal? This is the most important part of any film story and here, it's missing. How does this happen? You can argue that his goal is to stop Whiplash, but Whiplash is never threatening anybody apart from the Monaco scene and the extreme end of the story, which is too few and far between to function as a proper goal for Stark. You can argue that his goal is to find the cure to his blood toxicity to keep himself alive, but he is only actively working toward that goal for less than 5 minutes, most of which is spent on a gag with Captain America's shield. Then he cures himself with such ease, all tension and conflict is completely killed. SO that can't be his goal, either. Hell, he spent more time driving around for the Audi commercial, which ironically meant as much to the remainder of the story as the new power cell - nothing.What is the villain's plan? First of all, who the hell is the villain: Whiplash or Justin Hammer? Hammer simply wants a defense contract, which poses a threat of zero to Stark if he succeeds in getting the contract. Whiplash has a pasted-in motivation that is as weak as a wet noodle. He fights Stark at the racetrack and then spends the remainder of the movie sitting in a room on the other side of the country, not threatening anybody at all (until the very end). It's good that he showed up with a security uniform on the off-chance that Stark would be driving a race car that day. Did anybody see where logic went? So with no villain posing any kind of threat to Stark for the entire second act of the story, and Stark having no goal of his own, we're left with a jumbled mess in the middle of the film. Stark acts out and does nothing remotely interesting or exciting because he simply has nothing else to do. His conflict with Pepper was so manufactured, I could almost hear the clatter of an assembly line every time they were together. It was entirely non-emotional, and because of that, I couldn't care.The hero and villain don't even encounter one another at all in the second act of this movie! They are off on their own doing boring crap instead.Nick Fury shows up and drops information in Stark's lap instead of Stark actually finding out for himself. Then Fury is basically gone for the remainder of the movie. Whatever the hell Scarlett Johansson's character's name was served no purpose at all. Why were these characters even in the movie? I know Scarlett was in because she got to wear tight leather and kick ass, which I personally loved, but I would appreciate it a bit more if it was somewhat story-related. Of course, you need a story first.You can argue that Scarlett had to stop Whiplash from maintaining control of the War Machine suit, but I don't even know how Whiplash gained control of it to begin with! We are never presented with that information. And if he can control War Machine, why not take control of Stark's suit? Hello? Logic? Where did you go? Logic, come back! The climax involves an long fight with drones, which becomes nothing more than robots slugging each other. In the first film, Stark was battling the technology that he created and had to learn to outsmart his opponent because he couldn't outgun him. Here, it's just mindless action. There is no threat of danger. The drones pose a threat as severe as a field mouse. Then Whiplash shows up to a scene where a battle was already fought, and they have another battle that is twice as short as the one with the drones. If you blink, you'll miss it. There is no struggle. No reversals. No tension. No anything.Why can't we have a summer action movie that is both fun and good? You can even site the first Iron Man as an example. What happened here? This movie is a complete joke and a borderline insult.But I think we all know by now that Hollywood only makes sequels because they want money, not because they have a story worth telling...or a story at all.If I didn't see this movie for free, I'd ask for my money back on account of a faulty product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how the story goes... the first movie makes hundreds of millions of dollars &amp; the Hollywood Moguls stand up and take notice. ---- "Must be on to something good, let's see if we can duplicate it...." ---- and thus begins the generally horrific tedium of re-hashed plots, over-paid actors, horribly bad script-writing, and a force-fed public looking to find something worth grabbing on to. It almost never works.Let us for the moment consider: Shrek / Shrek 2. Toy Story / TS 2. Terminator / T2. Batman Begins / Dark Knight. Alien / Aliens. In each of these cases the sequel that followed far surpassed the original, in every sense of the word. John Q Public was treated to that rare case of suspense, drama, comedy or action which built upon the existing story and brought the characters more to life.Now let us consider Batman Forever / Batman &amp; Robin, Terminator 3 &amp; Terminator Salvation. Aliens 3, 4, AvP &amp; AvPr. In all cases, a solid waste of time, money, effort and sadly --- brain cells. In each of these sequels it comes across that someone, somewhere up there in the heights of Hollywood mega-offices, was looking to pay off a third wife's alimony. You could insert here the second Blair Witch Project, A-N-Y horror Genre flick (there's far to many bad sequels here to list), Mission Impossible 2. (3 was OK, but not great) and hundreds more. The fact is, generally speaking, sequels suck. And John Q Public knows it.So why have I spent so much time getting this point across? Because Iron Man 2 rises to the effort flawlessly. It brings us more depth to the existing characters. Introduces more to their back-story which actually makes sense. Brings in new supporting characters who actually add flavor to the overall story. And lastly, gives us a Russian villain with a honest-to-come-by grudge that we can understand and appreciate. (Even if his powers of mastering complex computer languages IN English and typing at seeming hyper-speed is a little bit of a stretch) Top all that off with some solid IN-YOUR-FACE action scenes that show off Tony Stark's collection of cool gadgets &amp; you have the makings of an incredible sequel. (And I, for one, really would love to have some of Scarlett Johansson's uber-cool toys.) That's not to say that the story doesn't have it's flaws. This is not Dark Knight. Then again, it shouldn't be compared to that either. This is Return of the Jedi. This is Lord of the Rings: Two Towers. This is a story in arc with still yet more to tell. And we're given fleeting glimpses of what's to come in different ways throughout the movie. I do hope that the cast / crew / director / writer's can be given another shot with the Iron Man hero.I will not spoil things for you. I know that the movie hasn't come out yet in America --- I live in Taiwan &amp; we're rather privileged to have it before you guys. But I will state up front that the movie gives depth and breadth to the Iron Man Character(s) and allows you to both enjoy yourself and walk away hoping there will be more. As a sequel goes --- they got this one pretty close to perfectly balanced.I will say this --- just in case it doesn't come across elsewhere --- but there is something to watch for AFTER, and I do mean AFTER, all the credits. Stick around, it's a tease you'll not want to miss.</fullReview>

It was basically a lot of talking with a few paltry action sequences that ended too soon and had no real oomph. Had it not been for Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey junior, Iron Man would have been another Hulk. And by Hulk, I do not mean The Incredile. The improvement shown in Iron Man 2, by comparison, is like the improvement between X-Men and X2, only five times over. The difference being that X-Men had been 98 percent awesome to begin with. Maybe if this trajectory of improvement continues with the inevitable third Iron Man film (which in itself would be an awesome feat), it will be in the same ballpark as X2, or maybe even as awe-inspiringly brilliant as RoboCop, the exercise in suffering for the most wonderful art that the comic book Iron Man helped inspire. But I digress. The point I am trying to make here is that anyone who uses words like "less fun" as a put-down in context of reviewing a story like Iron Man 2 should be shot in order to lessen the pollution of our gene pool. I happen to find stories that deal with serious concepts like revenge and hatred far more fun than catchphrase fluff, Brian and Kirk.You cannot have a superhero film without a good actor to play the titular superhero. Whereas Christian Bale is hampered by his director's ego and an inability to be intelligible, and Hugh Jackman is currently chained down by some of the worst superhero film scripts since Batman &amp; Robin, Robert Downey junior and his script are at the top of their game here. Originally when I heard that the story in this film would show Stark descending into alcoholism, I thought they at least picked the right man for the job. But the script provides something more in giving Stark a very credible motive for it. Downey is very convincing when pretending that he is dying and deciding to destroy himself as a result, but the arc of how an archival message from Howard Stark causes Tony Stark to lift himself out of the hole and fix the problem that is killing him is touching in multiple senses. And I speak as someone who has dealt with multiple addictions and compensatory life destructions here.But the real star of the show is Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, the real villain of the piece. Ivan is to Tony what Khan was to Kirk, only more so. Whereas Khan had the eventually-fatal flaw of not having as much experience in where he engaged his enemy, Ivan if anything knows quite a bit more about the world he is taking on than Tony. The desperate poverty we see him in at the beginning lends itself to that. When he goes out onto that racetrack and starts to chop up cars, he knows to expect no quarter, and thus tries to not give any. Lengthy speeches are also a tricky thing to pull off in any kind of film, lending themselves to ridicule or contradiction. But in a ten-second speech, Mickey Rourke gives the audience every reason to believe that his character has a right to feel hard done by. There is a reason why Rourke is experiencing a minor new surge of interest, and it is on display in every frame that features him. It is a credit to Robert Downey junior that he can stay credible whilst sharing the screen with Rourke.One of the most controversial aspects of Iron Man 2 was Marvel's choice to replace Terence Howard with Don Cheadle, their original choice to play Rhodes. Howard made much noise about it, but Marvel made the right decision here. Cheadle is far more credible as the Colonel despite being noticeably physically smaller. During one scene in which Cheadle dons the suit and acts in a fight with Downey, his delivery of the dialogue ("you are not fit to wear this suit!") is much more credible to boot. Also holding up their end of the platform are Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson in some of the best support roles thus far seen in a superhero film. Paltrow in particular scores top points for performing as a responsible woman trying to hold up a boss she cares for like a husband but is psychologically disintegrating into a mess before her very eyes. Jackson, for his part, plays the same Jackson he plays in every other film he is in, but it works well with the role of Nick Fury, so why not.The story itself is fairly simple and linear, without any extra layers or references for the viewer to take something out of. But instead of seemingly endless dialogue that has very little linguistic verve interspersed with the aforementioned so restrained it feels like a dog collar action sequences, Iron Man 2 has mostly very riveting dialogue and action sequences that, although nowhere near the standard set by the likes of Verhoeven, are at least entertaining to watch and contribute something to the plot. In fact the only aspect of the original that I prefer over this film is the score music. Whereas the Iron Man score had powerful themes that lifted certain shots well above the drudgery of the rest of the film, Iron Man 2's score is almost non-existent and remarkably tame. And while we are on the subject of music, whilst the Iron Man of the Black Sabbath song and Iron Man would not recognise each other if they met, can we please get something better than AC/DC? They have not released a single good record since I was born.Iron Man 2 is a ten out of ten film. To paraphrase a line from an early sequence: **** you, Brian and Kirk, **** you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Metal clash watered with chatter, occasional loss of control, with your every-day cute hi-tech villains, deadly high-heel chicks, plus a healthy portion of jokes failed on most. Add to it some allegedly going on sense of love during and after the explosions, and you get Iron Man, dubbed 2.It is unfortunate that the movie fell behind on 3D in making, which is the de-facto expectation today from any high-budget action movie, so it came out flat on a few things, figuratively speaking :) Also, contrary to the expectation of a longer movie, it came out even shorter than the original: 1:52m vs 1:56m, so it does feel short, especially after watching a 2:35m Avatar spectacle.Still, I enjoyed it, but not sure if I'd see it again, unless it is re-released in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as the film was over, my friends I just cracked up- it was awful! This was just another extremely predictable, clichéd, completely ridiculous and badly scripted movie. At many points during it you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a spoof of bad films, but no, this is a REAL film, not a joke.The only good bits were all the action scenes; fortunately, although Hollywood churns out lots of terrible stuff most of its films have great special effects! Apart from that, there's nothing else of merit I can say really so I'll just say some more negative stuff. The plot was just so stupid and so many of the characters were just SO obvious (as in you get pretty much the same character in other films). Some of the acting was straight out of primary school drama class- as in, VERY BAD!! There was also some very irritating product placement; some parts of the film looked like an Audi advert.</fullReview>
