		<shortDescription>Lousy, Loud, Unfunny Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems almost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual humor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame satire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party.Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators' desire to make the first "adult" 3D animated film. The interpretation of "adult" here seems to be the same as when it's used to describe porn--in other words, "adult" in the sense that you wouldn't want children to watch it but not in the sense that it shows much sophistication.I have nothing against gross or low humor. But that's just it. There aren't really any jokes in this movie. Punchlines here are usually someone dropping an f-bomb. If you are not 11 years old, you may want something more. Visual gags are sometimes interesting, but do not induce laughter. The animation is well done and there are many celebrity voices involved, all of whom act well, but to what end?Anyone familiar with the sort of movies Seth Rogen ends up in (toilet, sex, and drug humor) then you will have a fair idea of how this pans out. There are characters taking drugs and talking about "getting baked." HA! HA! Items from the grocery store make crude remarks and simulate sex acts. HA! HA! Many of the characterizations simply involve people yelling a lot. HA! HA! There's brutal violence. HA! HA!News emerging since the opening suggests that the artists working on this project were treated cruelly and unfairly. That's how I felt as an audience member.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More clever than it has any right to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly didn't think I'd like this movie nearly as much as I actually do. I went in essentially expecting a typical Seth Rogan comedy, just random jokes and nothing else. But the rumors were true, it actually is more clever than it has any right to be.I'll first say this, I don't think everyone will find it funny. If you aren't already a fan of Seth Rogan's movies, like I am, the humor probably won't do much for you. But I don't think anyone can deny that the movie's story is very smart, and I think might make up for some of the negatives you may have about the movie. The early reviews were right, it has a lot of clever things to say about religion, about taboos in society, about bigotry between cultures, and it's not lazy about any of these subjects.Let me talk about the jokes for a second. Yes there are plenty of sexual jokes in it, a lot of which I found funny. But I think the majority of the laughs I had came from the different ethnic foods interacting with each other. I could watch the Bagel and Lavash argue with each other all day. If anything I think the majority of the sort of sexual jokes people expect from the movie happen at the very end, like the last 10 minutes of the movie.The voice acting is also top notch. All the voices fit well with every character in the movie. I would love to see all of the actors in this in other animated roles. Some of the actors play there roles so well I had no idea which character they were. I had no idea that Edward Norton was the Bagel, or that Paul Rudd was the main Grocery Store employee. They all give great performances.But don't get me wrong, there are problems. Probably the major one being that the villain really doesn't need to be there. He just kind of serves to be a slightly disturbing character, who sucks out other products' juice to become stronger. If they cut him out of the movie we wouldn't have missed anything, apart from a few jokes from him. Also the ending is very, well, an ending, in that it ends the movie. It's one of those endings I wouldn't really describe as "bad" or "good" it's just sort of "I don't really know how else they could have ended it, so yeah I guess that works."The animation isn't all that great either, I mean it's not awful, but it really shows that this is this particular company's first animated film. One thing in particular that put me off was the designs on the human characters, they're so hideous to look at. I have a feeling that's part of the joke, but they really do look gross, and off-putting.There is one more thing I have to say though. In the long run I'm a little worried about the impact this might have on other R rated animated movies. I'm a little worried that this might affect other movies in a similar fashion as how Shrek affected kids movies. Like how Shrek was funny and made a lot of money, so other studios, and Dreamworks themselves, tried to replicate the success, and we ended up getting really bad "Self-Aware Parody" movies like Chicken Little. I just don't want the same thing to happen with this movie.I wouldn't call this movie "typical Adult Swim fodder" like I thought I'd be calling it. It's too clever to deserve that label. It's a movie that actually understands what "Satire" is, and in a day and age where we have people just posting racial obscenities and calling it "satire" when called out on it, I think it's great to see an R rated animated movie actually understand how to do satire.I would recommend giving this movie a chance. I really respect that it doesn't just throw crap at the wall and expects you to laugh. I wouldn't go as far as to call this one of my favorite animated movies of all time, but I will say I'm glad I saw it, and I had a lot of fun watching it. I would give this movie an 8/10. It's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I do respect it, and I want to see more good R rated animated movies come out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i went into this movie expecting to at least enjoy something? i wanted to like it. but more than anything it was just underwhelming and mediocre. it was extremely boring, i laughed at maybe 5 jokes (none of which were memorable). wouldn't recommend personally but if you like movies with a script that was obviously written by 4 high rich dudes completely out of touch with society, forced unfunny jokes reminiscent of a 12 year old lets player on youtube, and uninspired visuals that look like they went with the first draft, then this might be a good movie for you.wouldn't recommend to anyone who enjoys good movies, would recommend to anyone who is easily amused n thinks its funny when dudes are high and kids cartoons say f)ck a lot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vulgar, Crass and Incredibly Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party is a foul, crass, mean-spirited little film that pits grocery products against the horrifying realization that their use in this world is to be consumed and tossed away without a second thought. Centering on a courtship between a sausage named Frank (Rogen) and a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), the very fact that the discontented ten year old in all of us didn't just giggle at the thought of how they consummate their love is enough proof that this film is juvenile. Yet despite leaning, nudging and winking towards the least discerning of low-brow audiences, Sausage Party is funny enough to have people rolling in the aisles, smart enough to lend itself to cogent meta-commentary and vulgar enough to live in teenage-screen-hopping infamy. Make no mistake, this film is the brass ring, the real deal, the funniest film you're likely to see this year and given this year in comedy, I say it's about damn time.Before the events of Sausage Party, Brenda and Frank live inside their separate packages; Frank being partnered with friends Carl (Hill) and the diminutive Barry (Cera) among others. Every morning, the denizens of Shopwell sing a song of joy while they lay in waiting for a benevolent god (human) to choose them and take them to the "great beyond". Failure to be chosen, or worse dropped on the floor, means produce is to be thrown away in a seemingly bottomless abyss of a grocery store garbage bin. Frank and Brenda however like their chances. It's a few days till red, white and blue day; what could go wrong? One returned container of Honey Mustard (McBride) who forecasts doom is what can go wrong. That and a particularly testy Douche (Kroll) angered by a grocery cart accident that sullies his chances to be useful.As an animation, Sausage Party is artfully, colorfully and simplistically rendered. Each section of the grocery store lights up with a look and feel that compliments the local produce. After the doors close the Mexican food area resembles a rustic western cantina, the cookware section beams with the silvery glow of shimmering straight edges and the alcohol aisle is just one big rave. Environments outside the store are limited yet realistically depict the kitchen of a prim housewife and the dingy living room of a bugged out druggie. The less I tell you about the brief street scene, the better. Overall, it's obvious there were limitations in the budget yet if compared to the similarly themed Foodfight! (2012), this film's animation is an artistic triumph.The embedded oddness of the story lends itself to some pretty unique and funny jokes. Ones that hit the funny-bones of all not easily offended or grossed out. Such highlights include a bagel (Norton) and a lavash (Krumholtz) arguing about having to share an aisle, a Grits (Robinson) package being misplaced by "dirty good-for-nothing' crackers," and legions of sourkraut looking to exterminate the juice. Needless to say there are times when the film get's lost in the tall grass with over-broad ethnic stereotypes (A Native American liquor bottle named Firewater certainly ranks among the most egregious). But let's face it, if you're sold on the premise of a R- Rated animated comedy about food-stuffs you probably won't be too concerned.Sausage Party is a funny, funny, funny movie that doesn't just hand in shock value laughs for the sake of shock value laughs. It's also a well-created hero's journey with something to say and avoids all the pratfalls of modern comedy by A: not relying on broad improvisational humor and B: lands that third act like it's its b***h! Speaking of which: don't take your kids to go see Sausage Party. This is not the film you can harangue "cool mom" points with, seriously. Keep those little tykes at bay at least until their old enough to purchase their own heroin syringes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supermarket foods discover the falseness of human religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film's unprecedented profanity points to its primary purpose ? to reject and dispel the debilitating delusions of the supposed sacred. The Shopwell supermarket products here express the human faith in some unproved heaven that will justify their self-denials in this lifetime. But when a honey mustard returns from The Great Beyond he reports his discovery: the supposedly beneficent gods are really violent demons bent upon consuming and destroying these gullible humans/products. Hero Frank ? the wiener who will take all ? confirms that truth when he visits the liquor aisle and learns firsthand from Firewater that the Imperishables invented the myths that form the culture's religions. Honey Mustard himself embodies the human conflict: Is he a honey or a mustard? The question doesn't bother him, just the naive Brenda who prefers simplicity so resists the reality as long as she can. Honey Mustard was saved by his ambivalent nature, but is so maddened by his discovery he kills himself.It's a telling complexity. Are we flesh or spirit? The religious would have us believe we are spirits who should shun our earthly natures. This film asserts our meathood, our substance, our materiality in an unyieldingly material world, whose only fulfilment and service must be found on earth.The only human to discover the truth is the doomed druggie who shoots up on bath salts. Only then does reality come clean to him and he realizes the character of the peripheral life he has been mindlessly and compulsively consuming.And excreting. The abundant scatological humour provides Jonathan Swift's excremental view of humanity that no airy pretences can conceal. Hence Peanut Butter bemoans the death of his wife Butt Nutter and the Chinese take-out comes from Pu Ping. As the narrative occurs on July 4 it points to America's Independence Day, when all the wieners and the hot dog buns they yearn to pop into expect to be liberated. But Honey Mustard has learned what we already know: the Great Beyond they so eagerly anticipate is a cover for their death and destruction. The film's celebration of a real independence is the independence from religion, specifically the delusions, divisions and self-denials promulgated in its name. The characters come fully alive when they cast off their superstitions, overthrow their murderous gods (i.e., the humans) and abandon themselves to an impassioned orgy. Even the Muslim pita, learning he won't get those 72 Virgin Olive Oils on the other side, discovers a fraternal and sexual fulfilment with his mortal enemy Sammy Bagel Jr (Edward Norton as his pal Woody Allen). So, too, the militarized sauerkraut is determined to eradicate The Juice. Opposing hymns frame the narrative. The film opens with the morning prayer to The Great Beyond, celebrating the supposed gods of kindness and salvation. But it ends on an alternative prayer, Three Dog Night's Joy to the World. That hymn evokes the heady counterculture of the '60s, when OT prophet Jeremiah is replaced by a bullfrog, who was a good friend of mine, and salvation is to be found in this world, through wine, love, community, sex, and not delayed for some hypothetical afterlife.This film's wildness is itself a celebration of the sensual, the forbidden, the indulgent, in the face of religious and any other prissy decorum. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly clever adult animated film. It is offensive, racist, crude, sexist, and low brow in the extreme - which is were its charm lays. Being a fan of animated Grindhouse films like Fritz The Cat, Heavy Traffic, Shame Of The Jungle and Hey Good Looking to name a few, it feels great to have something like this in theaters in this day and age. It gives a much needed middle finger to our atmosphere of enforced "politically correctness". It tries very hard to offend everyone equally in a manner that allows the audience to laugh at their own short comings and beliefs. On top of the low brow humor there is some very clever plot twists and gimmicks - which I'll leave you to discover. Solid animation, story, voice acting, and soundtrack - what more could one want in a movie that is just for an adult audience with an open mind and a broad sense of humor. Thanks to Seth Rogen perhaps there is hope for more adult animated fare, a Heavy Metal 3 or a Sausage Party 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sausage Party was hilarious, original, and a great story. One of those movies you'll catch something new with each viewing.Although its probably like tofu (love it or hate it). I thought of it as a rare treat ...like a banana split! Big overflowing scoops of indulgent hilarity, enhanced by healthy dollops of creativity, perfectly garnished with a huge variety of offensive sprinkles!I'll be 60 this year (if you can't hide it, paint it red.) I say this for a couple reason. 1) to lessen the sting and 2) You don't have to be a 12 year-old boy to love a funny, creative, raunchy comedy that makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageous Brilliance Sausage Party / 5 Screens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO CHILD SHOULD SEE THIS FILM!!!! It was a rare stroke of genius that took the form of a cartoon movie. There have uproarious cartoons in the past i.e. Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park. (They are in filth order, from dirty to shocking) Sausage Party raises the bar to a new low. The aforementioned films and shows make use of modern themes while expressing them with outlandish gambits that live action films can't. Sausage Party makes use of an all-star cast to bolster its theme. Seth Rogen, James Franco, Bill Hader, Salma Hayek, Jonah Hill, and Kristen Wiig are among a few of the celebrity voices used to bring these grocery store inhabitants to life. Deserving special mention is an actual Hollywood all- star Edward Norton whom lends his talents to this immaturity. Don't overlook the importance of having real stars behind the microphone. Remember that it was robin Williams that brought the Genie to life and made the character last. Please do not mistake my intentions. I mean only to say that actors are important even in animation. I do not mean to suggest any of these characters will be as memorable as the Genie. In truth Sausage Party is a discussion on issues such as Faith, Meaningless Human Divisions, and Sex. There are stereotypical depictions of various ethnicities and religions such as Judaism, Islam, the Germans, Native Americans, and Italians. As with any Seth Rogen picture there's heavy use of Jewish humor (whether it is tasteful or not is in question). One of the main characters was a bagel named appropriately, Bagel. Voiced by Edward Norton who was doing his best Woody Allen impression the character developed a friendship with Lavash, a Middle Eastern Flatbread. The two develop a bond on their journey finding common ground in their discovery of love, friendship, and humus! Once Seth resolved the tensions in the Middle East he moved on to the crisis of faith. The movie revolves around the supermarket foods believing that once human buyers or "gods" choose them, they enter a heavenly great beyond. The immortal "non perishables" aka Twinkies, Grits, and Alcohol created this fiction in order to bring peace to the market dwellers. Before the genesis (so to speak) the residents lived in terror of the coming slaughter. After generations of this leap of faith a lustful sausage stumbles upon the truth, in the form of an illustrated cook book. The sausage's attempt to convince his compatriots that their beliefs have been in vain results in a riot. His religious awakening comes after a particularly devout Bun named Brenda Bunderson claims that the misfortune befalling them is a result of their sinful ways. No Rogen outing is complete without gratuitous sex and this is no exception. Though they may be edible it doesn't prevent the cast from getting down and dirty. The concept of this flick is absolutely genius. It is as simple as "What if food had feelings"? Can you imagine the almost Psycho like reaction the public would have if this were done as a serious film. Countless viewers could not step into the shower after watching Perkins attack Janet Leigh in the shower. If Alfred Hitchcock or the late Wes Craven directed this picture then people would be in therapy after their last Barbecue. Apart from concept the execution was spot on. The jokes were obvious in places while being smart and subtle in others. The last ten minutes will scar you for life. If you have scruples then stay home!!! But if you're in the mood for fun and willing to have an open mind then you'll have a great time. This is a 5 Screen Film according to G2TS. Stay Glued to the Screen Neil Carroll</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Sausage Party' ? Finally an Animated Feature for Adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a parent, I see more than my fair share of animated features. To be honest, I love movies so I don't really mind. Still,&nbsp;'Sausage Party' is&nbsp;a refreshing?and long overdue?change of pace. Finally there's an R-rated, full-length animated feature for adults. OK, maybe it's for adults with a somewhat juvenile sense of humor?but adults nonetheless.I spoke with the directors--Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon--about the experience. As I suspected, the initial concept was pitched by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I imagined Rogen was high and started pondering how the food on the shelves feels, and then BOOM! Artistic genius. It was interesting to learn how much raunchier the movie COULD have been, and how they had to cut scenes to bring it down to rated R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Animated Film that was the Laugh I needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My thoughts on Sausage Party :D (spoiler free as always unless it was in the trailer then it is fair game)!The short answer: Brightly animated, jokes both visual and verbal come a mile a minute, pulls NO PUNCHES, you will be offended, you will be grossed out, but you will laugh your a$$ off XD go see this movie! Oh and I know that you guys are smart cookies :3 but if you were thinking of bringing your kids, nieces, nephews, etc. to this thing DON'T!!! IT IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE!?!?!? I am dead serious....... o-o oh but if you are too young to get into this movie just tell your folks it's the latest from Pixar/Dreamworks :D no no don't do that....... but only if you really want to ;DThe long answer: Sausage Party if the latest haze of smoke from the drug enhanced minds of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and their usual crew; that is a bit of a spoof on the Pixar/Dreamworks animated films (The opening song is composed by Alan Menken even :D yeah the guy behind the songs from The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin just to name a few :D)! It tells the tale of Frank the Hot Dog voiced by Seth Rogen and Brenda the Bun voiced by the lovely and funny Kristen Wiig and their adventure in their society that is the supermarket Shopwells. They live in a world where every food item views humans as Gods and to be selected to leave the store is a great honor because "The Great Beyond" awaits them. However, Frank and Brenda find themselves stranded in the supermarket and trying to find their way back to their aisle in hopes of being "chosen" again while unraveling the truth of what happens when food leaves the store and meeting some colorful characters along the way :DAnd when I mean colorful I mean this film covered it's bases and effectively makes fun of I think every single race in the book (Irish, German, Native American, Black, Asian, Latino, Muslim, Jewish; I might have missed some) several religions and several communities and to tell you the truth; with how serious, depressing, and for lack of a better term PC the world has become in recent years this was a breath of fresh air that was just the laugh I needed XDWas I offended and think they went too far sometimes; yes. Did I find some jokes more crude and disgusting then funny; yes. Is it immature; yes. But, those things didn't ruin the movie for me because they went all the way with their humor. My philosophy is that you make fun of everyone; or no one at all and that there is a time and place for humor and a time and place for no humor (but a movie is sometimes the perfect place for humor; it's escapism) and this film understands that. So the fact that some parts got to me showed that it worked; at least from my point of view :3So if you are someone who is offended easily, doesn't like sex humor, crude humor, swearing humor, immature humor, you will probably have a bad time with this feature film :3 but the fact that we live in a time where an animated R film is possible is fantastic because there hasn't been one is a while (yeah there are more look them up I dare you o_o). But, to wrap up guys Sausage Party is a brightly animated spoof on the typical Pixar/Dreamworks formula (think Toy Story but with food) fused with a stoner comedy, whose creativity comes from it's gloves off offensive jokes and great visual gags, and strangely has a few messages that might just ring true and resonate with some folks :3 Also, the last third act of this film might go TOO FAR like REALLLLY TOO FAR. I thought they would stop at some point; but NO they keep going and going and it gets MORE and MORE CRAZZZZY; I was stunned, horrified, confused, and laughing all at the same time XD the fact that last third is in this movie just might be worth the price of admission alone! So for this wild ride I liked it better then expected and I gotta be honest I'm gonna give Sausage Party 41/2 stars out of 5. Or 9 out of 10 by IMDb so maybe 8.5 on there scale I'll just round up :3As always thank you guys so much for reading my silly reviews it really brings a smile to my face to know you took the time to at least hear my opinion :) I look forward to doing more of these and who knows if enough people request something I might just have to see it ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many will say this film is another HArd R for the sake of just being raunchy but this movie manages to be much more than that. I won't do the plot rundown - there's a plot description and trailer for that - what I will say is that the movie has a manic energy and sharp biting satirical edge that had me smiling throughout the film.The movie makes lots of observations about today's world without hitting you over the head because it's too busy having fun and frankly going places you don't expect. do your best to know ass little as possible about the movie when you go see it - you'll enjoy it that much more.But whatever you do, don't mistake this for a children's movie.

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I loved about it was it's concept that can be only described as Toy Story meets Foodfight, where various food products and items live in a cartoonish world of gods, destiny, foul language and adultery. This is indeed a possible contender for Golden Globe nominations and if possible Academy Award nominations, especially for Best Animated Film (that's if Pixar can stand aside).So much comedic moments from racial stabs, sexual innuendo, crude humour and one liners that will be a quote in your own life. There's so much on offer that it doesn't go tame or repetitive, especially towards the end that really goes 'over the top' and takes animation to a bold and confronting place where it should (I'll keep my lips sealed on this particular scene but let's just say it's a show stealer). The cast of comedic talents suck as Rogen, Franco, Hill, Wiig, Cera, Robertson, Rudd and others make the characters seem so likable, hilarious and entertaining, and the animation is both stylish and very cartoonish for an adult film.Overall, Sausage Party is a party that you don't want to miss and no brains are required to get this, and no children should see this until they are over 18 at least, so make a date or go with your bro's for a fun time of hilarity. I'll definitely be seeing this again, highly recommended by myself and Jay.The Autistic Reviewers 5/5 stars. Check out our facebook page!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was one of those days where I just wanted out of the heat, so I went to the movies. I was looking for something simple, stupid, and low-brow to just give me a laugh or two, just enough to keep me awake. I like Seth Rogan, so I choose Sausage Party, a film I'd never normally see, and while it had what I was looking for, surprisingly, it also had a lot more. I was expecting nothing but the typical drug and sex jokes, but in addition to that, there was a cleverness there that I wasn't expecting, the kind of thing you'd normally get from Family Guy. It's hard to say more without spoiling it, but one such element seen in the trailer and used through out the film, is the use of ethnic foods to represent the real life conflicts and stereotypes of the people associated with them. There are also plenty of food related jokes through out the film that seem so obvious for a movie like this, but you didn't think of them, and that's why Seth Rogan never has to pay for his weed.... The bottom line, I'm not saying this film is going to win any awards or that's it's going to become some huge cult classic or anything like that, just that it's far more clever, intelligent, and entertaining than I ever assumed it could be. You might be forced to see it because of yours kids, but you won't be as disappointed as you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The minute I finished watching the trailer, I was eager to watch this here film. At the time, I believed as though this movie would be hilarious. I was proved wrong. Extremely wrong. I suppose the creators of this movie put all the good parts (if any) into the trailer. I have an immense sense of humor, I enjoy laughing throughout day to day activities. I found that I did not genuinely laugh once. Not once. I find humor in sexually-geared jokes, but none of the jokes in this film were funny. I am a huge fan of the actors/actresses involved in this movie. I feel bad that they were forced to succumb to being involved in such a poorly executed film. 1/10: Would not recommend to my worst enemy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the first movie in a very long time that has renewed my belief that you can challenge social boundaries head-on.Some of the characters are hilarious, some of the dialog, while not clever, is great because it's willing to confront social taboos.WARNING! No matter how open minded you are, this movie is not for children. This is totally an adults only movie. There is some violent and gruesome imagery, many explicit references to sex and homosexuality. If you heed that warning, you will be spending a lot of time explaining adult references.The stand-out performances were from Seth Rogen and Kristin Wiig as a hot-dog and bun. Kristin is so true to herself and her comedy helped the movie shine.The animation is mediocre. It's definitely not bad. It reminds me of Toy Story 1 in its simplicity.If the movie has faults, it has profanity for the sake of profanity and it is about 10 minutes too long. The movie became tedious toward the end and I was a little too eager to see it finished.If you're looking for a movie that challenges social norms and will certainly offend anyone Politically Correct, this is your movie. However, it's not quite the clever movie it could have been. If you had the likes of Mel Brooks on the writing credits, he would have provided the secret sauce to take the film from funny/profane to comic gold/social commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The raunchy comedy about grocery store products comes from the minds of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen who also voices the main sausage, Frank. The story explores the belief in benevolent gods that are human shoppers. The food products believe that these gods take them to a great beyond where they can live out their greatest pleasures and be taken care of by these gods. The movie uses the metaphor of a sausage in buns as sex to the greatest extent possible. The animation boasts an impressive voice cast of all of Rogen's crew including co-creator Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Salma Hayek, Kristen Wiig, Nick Kroll, Danny McBride, Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Bill Hader, and plenty more. The story follows the adventure of Rogen's Frank and Wiig's Brenda Bunson, hotdog buns, encounter an enlightened by a raving Honey Mustard (McBride) who was returned after seeing the true story of what really happens when the products are purchased and taken home.The exploration of the grocery store relies heavily on racial stereotypes that are both amusing and insulting simultaneously. The gimmick of talking food is funny at first but runs dry as the movie progresses with an odd story about bath salts. There are plenty of laugh out loud jokes and silly humor, but the story about false beliefs and warring groups of religious zealots is the most interesting part of the comedy.

		<shortDescription>very clever in a not so subtle way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is not for everyone. i'm just putting that out there. this movie is for the most part, a not so subtle social commentary on everything ranging from Sex, Sexual Orientation, Race, Religion, God...and much more. for the most part, I thought this movie was funny and well done. some people might find the vulgarity (which there is a lot of) off putting and that's understandable. what I found interesting about this movie is that it embarks on a quest to give us the very answers we seek in our daily lives. Frank (the main sausage protagonist) embarks on a quest to find the truth about the gods (us) and what lies beyond. when he discovers the horrifying truth, he attempts to inform his brethren of the reality of the world only to be mocked insulted and generally dismissed. it takes his friend Carl (another sausage who figured out the horrible truth), who makes him realize that its not about the message but how its delivered. if you insult peoples beliefs,how then, can you expect to get people to see the truth? the movie also utilizes a variety of racial and sexual stereotypes to prove its point and I found the utilization to be very effective in order to promote the message the movie was trying to promote. all in all I really enjoyed the movie, but I realize, that where the movie fails, was in going against what the movie was all about. discovering the truth and finding a respectful way to spread that truth. a lot of people will find this very disrespectful and very vulgar. in that since it failed, because the message will be lost within the whirlwind of foul language, sexual innuendo and racial stereotypes. then there is the ending...you will never see tacos, hotdog's, flatbread's and bagels the same way again. all in all I really enjoyed the movie and i'm glad it was a financial success, because I want to see the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sausage Party: An Observation of the Modern World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Observation manages to combine all of the stereotypes shared by different cultures of one another, intertwine this with raunchy humor, ultimately painting a portrait of how absolutely intolerable this planet is becoming.A few facts (for those whom would prefer NOT to hear the ramblings of a long-time film fanatic): The film has been estimated to have been built on a $19-million budget, grossing about $34-million opening weekend (USA). For your comparison: Finding Dori (2016) cost an estimated $200-million bringing in about $135-million opening weekend (USA). Whether a fan or not, there is clearly something to be said regarding the brilliance that is Seth Rogen.One thing is clear, and that is this movie was crafted with Rogen's opinions, thoughts, and humor from start to finish. He himself has made clear this was 10 years in the making.I suspect many will turn away from this due to religious affiliation. I myself am an atheist, but would stress that with all the war, racism, sexism, and every other "- ism" this was in one way an attempt to address how misunderstood the many denominations and organizations are seen by one another.At one point, a coworker (female) from my office came in Monday morning to exclaim that she felt it was really poor humor, and I quote "racist". To those who would even have the slightest inkling of accusing this work racist, you have completely misunderstood. In fact, one of the messages that could be drawn from watching this would have to do with the necessity for removing the "racist" culture and indirect racism that can be created through attempting to group individuals by religious affiliation or any other characteristic.DO NOT take your children. This has awful language, a ton of sexual innuendos, and would be misunderstood at the simplest of levels (some which I suspect many adults may even join the ranks of).Enjoy the film, appreciate the message, don't take anything personally. It was not the intent of Rogen or any other Directors/Writers.Oh, and just to make this "review-worthy"... the film uses various Super Market foods, drinks, and items to represent humans incorporating the different stereotypes often heard of for various Religieons, ethnic groups, and sexual preferences/identities. By using such simple characters, it attempts to put some of the world's problems onto the simplest of stages for the world to see and take in for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sausage Party was Never Boring and Decent Throughout but the Funniest and Craziest Stuff is in the Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As disappointing as the summer has been (some good and some bad, fewer truly great movies than I wanted) Sausage Party was one of the movies that I was holding out hope for. The marketing made it look like something completely different, it had a voice cast full of actors that are funny and likable and the focus on presenting a big animated R rated movie was intriguing. I went into this completely ready to love it and ultimately came out happy and ready to sing it's praises.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Sausage Party begins at the local Shopwells grocery store. The products/food in the grocery store awake ready to join the "Gods" (human beings who shop at the store) and enter "The Great Beyond" (heaven for the food, outside the store). They sing a song to honour the gods and to thank them for the opportunity to take them there. We focus in on a particular package of sausages and a particular bag of buns. Frank (Seth Rogen) is longing for the day where he will be able to slip into his girlfriend bun Brenda (Kristen Wiig). He's in a package with other sausages Carl (Jonah Hill) and Barry (Michael Cera) and they cannot wait to get to the great beyond. In a surprise move, the two packages are picked together and they celebrate by touching fingertips.In a surprise move, a jar of honey mustard that had been returned earlier that day has been ranting about how the gods are monsters and that he will not go back under any circumstance. He gets thrown in the cart with them and tries to commit suicide by jumping out. Frank and Brenda try to save him but it triggers an accident that leaves a bunch of food falling out of the cart. This includes a douche (Nick Kroll) who blames Frank and Brenda for his nozzle being bent. Their friends have been taken and they urgently need to get back into some packaging. Frank and Brenda who have now been joined by a Lavash (David Krumholtz) and a bagel Sammy (Edward Norton) need to get back to their respective aisles so they can join their friends in The Great Beyond.Most of the reviews for Sausage Party have claimed that it's revolutionary and that it will change animation. I wouldn't go that far but I would give the movie credit for having an interesting message to try and get across. Sausage Party isn't subtle about it but the point of Sausage Party is that it's okay to question widely held beliefs like religion. The food in the supermarket blindly believe that their journey out will lead to wonderful things without having any proof and even when Frank tries to convince them of their impending doom, they don't believe him. There's nothing wrong with believing in a higher power and it's not right that atheists believe that they should just call believers idiots. The movie does the right thing and takes the high road in saying that you need to respect different beliefs and I appreciated that it had the decency to not just jam the atheist agenda down the public's throats. There's also some commentary on the affairs in the Middle East which was a nice added touch that not every movie would have had the time to include.There's a pretty varied voice cast, a lot of them are Rogen's friends that you see in most of his films and there are some newcomers that do good work. Seth Rogen is pretty typical Seth Rogen (I like Seth but he's basically playing himself) and people like Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, James Franco, Paul Rudd and Danny McBride are good as they are in most of their collaborations. I thought Kristen Wiig did a really good job, I laughed at her stuff the most actually. Nick Kroll's character was really annoying but they were going for your typical jerk "bro" and he nailed it. I actually didn't recognize Bill Hader at all and even though some although people called it racist, I could see why Salma Hayek was cast and she did a decent job. On another note, the animation was also decent, I didn't think it was anything special but it was more than passable.Most of the way through this movie I was laughing and I was enjoying myself but I was a little disappointed. It hadn't lived up to the hype (at least to me) and I was starting to come to the conclusion that it was more of a solid film than a great one. I have to say though, by the time the climax happens, they really kicked it into high gear. There hadn't been a lot of action but when you hit that last 20 minutes, there's plenty of it and it was weird enough to give it the kick in the @$$ I thought Sausage Party needed. After that, there's a 5 minute scene that was among the most bizarre and funniest things I have seen in a long time. I won't spoil it but if you're like me and were waiting for that jaw-dropping moment, don't worry it's coming.If there's anything that I think Sausage Party deserves credit for, it's trying something different and going the whole nine yards with it instead of just dipping their toes in. They wear their subtext on their sleeves, they aren't afraid to be crass and they aren't satisfied with a generic payoff. I didn't think the plot, the voice work or the animation were revolutionary or even special but luckily the ending was. Much like The Purge: Election Year, this movie isn't going to be for everyone and also like that movie, it doesn't seem to care. I would have probably been giving Sausage Party a 7.5 halfway through but because the finale is so insane, I feel like I have to respect that and give it an 8/10 instead.</fullReview>

Hands down the best animation that i watched in a long time. And NO don't take your children to watch this as it's full of sexual connotations, dark humour, a lot of swearing and with the script being one of the most elaborate, epic and a big eye opener for the things that are happening around us. Well done Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill it seems there is much more to this guys than meets the eye. With this being said go for it, relax, enjoy the ride and mayhem that's about to unfold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is very raunchy and filled with sexual innuendo, yes, it uses many stereotypes (racial or otherwise), but it's not stupid. OK, it is stupid, but it's stupid in a smart way."Sausage Party" starts with a raunchy song condemning religion, and basically continues on that note. The film argues that if there is a God, he is indifferent to our well being. It states that our vision of God and the afterlife was simply invented to rid us of our constant fear of death. It does contain many stereotypes of all kinds, and it even has a rape scene (yes, a rape scene), but it's a film that actually condemns hate, and all of the pointless rules religion gives us that prevent us from doing what we enjoy, or even inspire hatred. The film says that since death and hatred and racism and violence are rampant among the human race, we should stop hating others for their differences and rather unite as one human race, and just have one big orgy. Okay, that last part is only partially true, but that's basically the point. We focus so much on our separate beliefs and versions of the afterlife and how to get there, that maybe we forget to just enjoy our life on earth.Aside from that message, it also has some seriously detailed animation, and some clever visual humor, which is something we don't get enough these days, and one of the strongest arguments for the fact that anything can be funny in certain context. To top it all off, it's an incredibly original idea, and probably one that can never be replicated again, and in the sea of reboots, remakes, and sequels that are thrown at us, this stands out, in all of its absurd, raunch- filled, excessive glory. And, yes, it genuinely made me laugh. Hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's also hard not to laugh at a cartoon hot dog that just wants to get inside a cartoon bun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every morning, the cheerful food products at Shopwell's grocery store sing of the rapture that awaits should a customer purchase them. As the Fourth of July approaches, a pack of hotdogs - including Frank (Seth Rogen), Barry (Michael Cera), and Carl (Jonah Hill) - celebrate the inevitable sale that will hasten them off to the "Great Beyond" and unending bliss with their doughy counterparts. But when a shopper finally places them in her cart, a crazed bottle of returned honey mustard (Danny McBride) causes a collision that hurls Frank and his girlfriend Brenda Bunson (Kristen Wiig) onto the aisle floor. Desperate to return to their display stand, Frank and Brenda team up with Lavash (David Krumholtz) and Sammy Bagel Jr. (Edward Norton) in order to navigate unfamiliar territory and evade both disposal by the cranky store manager and extermination by a vengeful hygiene product (Nick Kroll).Like so many comedies - especially of the juvenile kind - the potency of the material is highly subjective. Some audiences will find themselves not wanting to laugh at the proceedings, while others will revel in the likeminded mentality of the ultimate group of stoner writers. But with no restraints on subject matter or offensiveness, and certainly no censorship of the coarse language and vulgarities, "Sausage Party" is, at times, incredibly difficult to dismiss. The more over-the-top it becomes, especially with a climax that is unimaginably outrageous, it must at least be given credit for its willingness to scoff at political correctness and the boundaries of good taste - all within the confines of a computer-animated environment.It opens with a big musical number, ostensibly to generate a bitingly family-friendly veil (amplified by the cartoonish look, complete with Mickey Mouse-like, white-gloved hands) that is quickly tossed aside for unsubtle innuendo and double entendres about teabags, wieners, and buns. The film surely sets some sort of record for the most gags about penises and vaginas; this cast of anthropomorphized food items couldn't be more salacious or perpetually aroused. They may be fruits and vegetables, or pastries, or even packaged items, but they never mince words when it comes to sexual predilections, as if every edible strives not just to pass into the Great Beyond, but also to copulate unendingly. "Sausage Party" is so overstuffed with sex jokes that it routinely overshadows the cleverer notions (like commentary on grocery stores and their employees, or the comparison of preparing food for consumption to the mutilative horrors of warfare), opting to gratify itself with edgier concepts of juice box genocide (and rape), a lesbian taco, or turning only certain inorganic objects (such as a douche or toilet paper, both targets for easy laughs) into living entities.Despite the heavy-handedness with which motifs of religion, factions, drug culture, unwavering belief systems, and overt racism (among many other controversial topics) are approached, "Sausage Party" is still one of those see-it-to-believe-it sort of pictures, sporting visual jokes that are routinely as amusing as they are horrific or disgusting. Utilizing that most basic of story lines - an epic odyssey to discover some guarded truth about existence - the film becomes the anti-"Toy Story" or the anti-"Ratatouille," populating a world in which food conducts secret lives unseen by humans (or, in an amusing reference to "Ratatouille," the puppeteering/controlling of humans by simpler organisms). It's crude, crass, raunchy, and irreverent. But it's also hard not to laugh at a cartoon hot dog that just wants to get inside a cartoon bun.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew what to expect going in to this, coming from the insane minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I saw the trailer, and thought to myself this is gonna be one insane ride. When I came out of The Secret Life of Pets with my mom and my nephew, saw the poster to Sausage Party, I told my mom "Don't be fooled by the poster, that is not a kids movie".The story speaks the insanity for itself, about food in a grocery store, and that is all I'm gonna tell ya. The animation is top notch, spoofing those Pixar films. The actors really do voice there characters well. Seth Rogen really brings his humor well to his role has a hot dog. If your not a fan of vulgar humor, and gross out gags, then you should probably avoid this like the plague, cause this pulls no punches, it goes straight for the throat. It was very funny, there is perfect timing to all of the gags. It's not a masterpiece, but just a fun time for fans of this type of humor. Expect nothing or less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Sausage Party' Brings Raunchy Laughs and an Oscar Worthy Song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Animation has never been such a fantastic blend of fun and dirty as seen in "Sausage Party" from Sony Pictures. Created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can't help but love him for it, the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer.Directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan helm the ship that was written by Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen, Kyle Hunter, and Ariel Shaffir with a steady hand as they play off social and racial stereotypes in the vein of something we would have seen on "South Park." Trickle in a talented voice cast that includes Rogen, Oscar nominees Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, and you got a formula for something downright hilarious."Sausage Party" takes no prisoners as the profanity and graphic nature makes an educated film-goer wonder "how the hell did this just get an 'R' rating from the MPAA?" Shock value will bubble to the brim and likely spill over as we see food make sexual advances, dirty and used condoms interact with a smaller hotdog, and an orgy that might manage to trump any movie in the last 15 years.Taking the "Toy Story" premise and asking the question, what if food could talk? "Sausage" gives its characters a dynamic range of emotions as they mix in the very questions of today that marry the ideas of religion, purpose, and tolerance. I'm sure somewhere deep in the bones of every Pixar writer in the world, they've wanted to make THIS kind of movie. Why wouldn't they? The animation is tenderly bright and vibrant, creating a world of chaos but clarity. They work through the material with a bold and fearless nature that the Academy Awards would feel so lucky to be included among their Animated Feature nominees in 2017.Stepping outside the box with a raunchy song, Alan Menken's compositions and work stand just as high as anything delivered this year so far. Vivaciously alive in every beat, you can't help but smile ear to ear as the party rolls on. I'd surely say Menken is the hunt for an Oscar nomination in Original Song.The rest of the voice works of Bill Hader, Michael Cera, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd, and ESPECIALLY Nick Kroll are purely delightful.This is not the movie for Mom, unless your mother is awesome in every way. This is not the movie for your kids, because I can't wait to hear the headlines of the general audience goers that brought their kids to see thinking it was just a "cute cartoon." This is not the movie for your sophisticated movie friend because he or she is probably going to call you dumb for laughing at the jokes. This IS the movie for the Friday night, bring your girlfriend or boyfriend, watch their jaws drop, and enjoy the company of just plain old fun at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party is fine work from the usually funny Seth Rogen as he and an extremely talented voice cast work their way through a hilarious script who bring laughs the entire length of the film, cleverly playing on the Pixar Formula that if something other than humans could have emotions or feelings (in this case: food). The jokes hardly ever fail and the writers provide very relevant social commentary which they deliver it in an amusing, fast paced script. Where the film falters however, is in the non-human antagonist who becomes old and worn out after a while. Also, there is an unfunny running gag between Kristen Wigg and her character involving nervous singing which lasts way too long. All in all though, Sausage Party is an exuberant watch with great characters and an ending that takes it way too far perfectly and hysterically (bare in mind, the final scene doesn't feel like it has to be there at all and probably would have worked better as an end credits scene).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I promise you that this review won't have any food-related puns. It would've been easy had the film not used up of every last one that you could think of.Every now and then someone in Hollywood has the balls to make an animated feature strictly for adults. By every now and then, I mean whenever Matt &amp; Trey feel up to it, which they haven't been in more than a decade... and how many years has it been since The Simpsons Movie? I already forget. Perhaps it's because of how hard it is to advertise. You just can't. It's hard to tell a child that they can't go see a colorful, friendly looking cartoon, of any kind, even if that cartoon contains an egregious amount of F-bombs, provocative religious/political satire and sex jokes.But Seth Rogen took it upon himself to make one of his own, and after years of rejection from the major studios, we finally have Sausage Party. It is as outrageous, vile, demented, perverted and hilarious as we all dreamed it would be. It ranks with Blazing Saddles, South Park, Team America and Ted in the genre of films that push the non-PC envelope as far as it can go. This film takes no prisoners. The food products live in a racist world where nobody gets along, and worship every kind of crazy religion under the sun... yeah, kind of like our world. Behind it is a message of tolerance, and an even bigger message of the absurdity of organized religion. At this very moment, we needed something like this to come along. Even though I am a Catholic, I appreciated it's daring atheism. It seems like religion is the cause of everything terrible in the world right now. Nothing makes sense anymore. I understand where this little sausage is coming from.But as deep as the film could be, it's as gross and as stupid as any Seth Rogen comedy in past. But even that's an understatement. It even pushes boundaries on that level. This film has the most hilariously gross ending of any movie I've seen in years. The food all get together and have an orgy. Once you see it, you cannot un-see it. You have been warned, folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sausage Party (2016): Dir: Greg Tieman, Conrad Vernon / Voices: Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Bill Hader, Nick Kroll: Explicit escapade in naughty deeds accompany a theme of freedom, or the illusion of since it addresses the numerous beliefs in the world and the struggle to unite in peace. Seth Rogen voices Frank, a sexually charged sausage awaiting purchase for the fourth of July alongside his fellow sausage buddies. They include a short deformed sausage named Barry, voiced by Michael Cera. Kristen Wiig voices Brenda the Bun who is set to unite with Frank until a tragic set of events have them separated from their packages and on the run. Barry escapes the fate of what awaits food as he witnesses his fellow food companions sliced, diced, shredded, scorched, and torn to bits all to the delight of humans. Frank is joined by Brenda as well as a Bagel named Sammy Bagel Jr, and Kareem Abdul Lavash to find answers. After venturing through the liquor party section they approach the non- perishables, led by the wise and totally stoned Firewater, voiced by Bill Hader for answers all the while being pursued by a Douche out for revenge. Creative and original with drug references, profanity and a massive food orgy that places this film way outside the viewership of children. Like the South Park film or Ted, it takes the seemingly innocent and spins a crass presentation. Besides food we are given amusing images of doomed and defeated condoms, toilet paper, and a wad of gum operating an electric wheelchair complete with electronic voice. It challenges a theme of tolerance, which this party may require before viewing. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Pixar Had a Problem Child.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party, Seth Rogen's appropriately named Pixar-spoof/raunch fest, is here and it is actually pretty entertaining, if you're a sarcastic adult who enjoys shitting on everybody. Much like Deadpool did to the comic book genre earlier this year, Sausage Party takes aim at the animation genre, finally making an animation for adults. Sausage Party is as funny as it is clever, gleefully filled with profanity, but is also surprisingly thought provoking. Sausage Party never quite reaches the level of quality, of that which it pokes fun at, but does manage to do everything it set out to do.Watching this film it's incredible the ensemble cast that Seth Rogen was able to gather for this film, featuring James Franco, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and so many more. The plot of this film is actually a fairly entertaining one, but the real strength of the film is it's humor. That isn't surprising, considering the group behind it, but the film in essence jumps from one joke to another never leaving a dull moment. The main reason that the film is so funny is that the film is clever in how it pokes fun at the world of food.Another reason that the film is so funny is that instead of trying to be politically correct, the film almost revels in it's ability to insult whoever it can. Animation has, over the years, proved to be a genre mostly directed at kids, besides a few exceptions (South Park, Family Guy, the Simpsons.) That being said the use of excessive profanity within that genre is so rare that it often elevates a raunchy animated comedy. Seeing a bunch of talking hot dogs, and buns that are animated to look like sexual images, and then swear non-stop ends up being one of the funnier elements of the film.It seems surprising that Pixar didn't beat Sausage Party to this story though, because it could've been an even better Pixar film. By that I mean that the story of this film is actually quite clever and thought provoking, when you say to yourself, what food think if it could talk. The plot is not as focused as a Pixar film and the characters are not as emotionally involving, so Sausage Party feels more like a cheaper, raunchy Pixar film. However, this film does manage to attack a fairly thought provoking and deep storyline.In the end, Sausage Party is a really good and often entertaining spoof of the animation genre for adults above a certain age, and of a certain mindset. The film tries to remain clear of racism, simply by insulting every group of people, without prejudice, we'll see if that method works. The film is clever, funny, thought provoking, and gleefully profane. It should be stated that not everybody will enjoy this movie, but that's partially the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Sausage Party, one thing is certain - You will never look at your food the same way again. In this film, Rogen and Co. employ all their humorous tricks in the book to bring to life a highly original idea. Along for the ride are fellow comedic gems including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Kristen Wiig to boot.The film tells the story of a world of anthropomorphized food in the fictional grocery store Shopwellers. Life is great for all the food items, whose dreams are to meet the "gods" and to (relish?) the life outside their confined shelves. But when Frank the sausage learns the truth of their fate as human meals, he must warn the rest of the food items and find a way to escape and find their elusive freedom, free from humans.The plot sounds ridiculous and it is even more over the top than one might expect it to be, especially those last 30 minutes or so. The amount of crude humour and constant innuendos keep its free flowing story a hilarious one. But for a film that centres around food, there exists a great level humanity embedded in its plethora of characters, who are as endearing as they are vulgar, filled with the same urges, ambitions and fears that any normal person would have.With its constant food puns and raunchy humour, it certainly isn't for everyone. But Sausage Party is special - it offers both humour and substance, some food for thought if you will. It has an extraordinary charm stemming from its lovable characters and occasional nuanced moments. A seemingly shallow storyline delves much deeper into the concept of religion, hope and perspective. The idea is highly original and provides a surprising dose of pathos and provoking moments.An 'ate'/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sausage Party is a party that I want to go to. Seth Rogan has done it again with his R rated animated classic. This movie will have you laughing from the second it starts to the beginning of the credits. I have seen a lot of great movies this year, but this has been the best movie so far of the year. The animation was breathtaking like everything else was about this movie. Parents this movie is not let me repeat not for kids. This is a R rated movie that looks like a kid movie, but is not. This movie had an all star cast from Bill Hader all the way up to the king of comedy himself Seth Rogan. You will love every second of the very unique film it was fantastic I hope you enjoy. My score 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Secret Life of Groceries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy comedies loaded with rude, crude, and often lewd humor, the adult-oriented, computer-generated, supermarket saga "Sausage Party" qualifies as a delicious treat you may want to savor more than once. Seth Rogen heads a top-notch cast of voice performers, including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Harlan Williams, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, who incarnate grocery store items spouting obscenities about the validity of life after purchase. This imaginative but disconcerting Sony/Columbia Pictures' release lives up to its R-rating with more vulgar relish than most live-action movies dare. The last time I saw a movie as potentially offensive as "Sausage Party" was "South Park" creator Trey Parker's sarcastic "Team America: World Police" (2004) where puppets performed degrading acts of all kinds on themselves. Initially, "Sausage Party" reminded me of those popular Pixar kid comedies about cars and dolls that have acquired the power of reason and behave as if they were human. Mind you, parents should NOT take their children to see "Sausage Party" unless they want to contend with questions about theology, aberrant sexuality, and the abuse of bath salts as a recreational drug alternative. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg said that they sought to make the equivalent of a Pixar blockbuster but with a scatological spin. Actually, the whole thing looks like an extended California Raisins cartoon, right down to the white gloves that many characters wear. Clocking in at a lean 83-minutes, "Sausage Party" amounts to a clever Pixar parody from fade-in to fadeout unless its fundamentally blasphemous agenda alienates you. Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and the late Christopher Hitchens would likely applaud it for its atheism. Not since Woody Allen has anybody tried to ponder issues about life and death and the whole damn thing as much as co-directors Greg Tiernan of the "Thomas &amp; Friends" series and Conrad Vernon of "Shrek 2," along with scenarists Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg. While the animated supermarket products yearn to be purchased and redeemed by the gods before their shelf life expiration date, "Sausage Party" also contains a conventional heroes versus villains narrative. Ultimately, humor and good taste unravel toward the end when the filmmakers go overboard with an orgy to end all orgies. How "Sausage Party" avoided an NC-17 rating is a mystery.Set during the Fourth of July holiday, "Sausage Party" unfolds inside a sprawling Shopwell's supermarket, but additional scenes occur in the suburbs, too. Everything is told from the perspective of supermarket items whether they be fruits, meats, vegetables, liquids, cookies, candies, and/or cleaning products. A hotdog named Frank (Seth Rogen of "Knocked Up"), cannot wait to snuggle up with the dame of his dreams, Brenda (Kristen Wiig of "Ghostbusters"), a voluptuous Betty Boop-type bun with lipstick and eyelashes. Frank is stuck in a Fancy Dogs' package of frankfurters near Brenda's package of Glamorous Buns, and these two ogle each other like hormone-addled teenagers. Indeed, "Sausage Party" is an anthropomorphic allegory where frankfurters, buns, bagels, jars of honey mustard, cookies, cleaning products, and imperishables discuss their fate as if they were human. At the same time, humans dominate this skewered universe. However, the supermarket items and the humans cannot communicate with each other, unless the humans inject themselves with bath salts. At this point, things get hopelessly absurd. Of course, nothing about abusing bath salts is remotely facetious, but "Sausage Party" uses bath salts as a gag. Predictably, actor James Franco voices the anonymous individual named Druggie who discovers to his horror that he can converse with a hotdog after he shoots up with bath salts. Meantime, what is genuinely hilarious is watching various goofy food items nestled around a campfire smoking marijuana. When was the last time that you saw a frankfurter getting stoned in a movie? Anyway, our hero and heroine live in a warped world where they believe that the humans who shop for them are actually gods. Furthermore, our hero and heroine believe that if they are ripe enough and fresh enough these hallowed gods will choose them and literally take them to 'The Great Beyond' where they will attain celestial fulfillment. Everything comes crashing down when a human accidentally buys the wrong kind of mustard and brings his jar of honey mustard back to exchange it for regular mustard. The jar of honey mustard surprises everybody with his shocking revelations about what really occurs after purchase. Later, we are shown what happens after these happy items arrive at homemaker's kitchen. At this point, "Sausage Party" turns into an amusing but eerie parody of a torture-porn horror epic. Miraculously, one hotdog manages to escape this slaughter-house scene whereupon he encounters Druggie.Unmistakably, "Sausage Party" isn't geared for everybody. Some scenes are so outlandish that you cannot help but laugh. At the same time, you find yourself chuckling perhaps at stuff you wouldn't ordinarily treat with such levity. The melodrama in "Sausage Party" concerns a Douche, female hygiene bottle, who dreams lustily about the woman who added him to her shopping cart. She has also chosen the demoralized jar of honey mustard, and it decides to commit suicide by jumping out of her shopping cart. Frank and Brenda struggle to save him, but fail when another shopping cart collides with them. Everything turns upside down. Frank and Brenda topple from the cart along with other food items. The scene is reminiscent of "Saving Private Ryan" with a can of noodles scraping his noodles together and tucking them back inside his ruptured canister. Before it is all over with, Frank and Brenda lead a revolt against mankind while a pink, paraplegic blob of gum imitating Stephen Hawking engineers a "Stargate" escape archway out of a toilet rim trimmed with Christmas lights to transport them to friendlier universe. As sacrilegious as it is sidesplitting, "Sausage Party" provides summer moviegoers with a drastic change of pace from the habitual Hollywood hokum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a full course meal of a very dangerous comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of you may be too young to remember (or maybe too old, who knows), but once upon a time a man named Ralph Bakshi made hard-R rated animation that was decidedly not meant for simply for families to gobble up, so at the same time Disney put out something like Robin Hood, he had Heavy Traffic, which was an semi-autobiographical, "X-rated" look at life in Brooklyn with all the rough edges showing, or in 1975 (his masterpiece to me) Coonskin, which took off from Song of the South to make a scathing satire on race using black caricatures, blaxploitation and other characters like a naked woman with red-white-and-blue body paint. But of course times have changed and now animation is practically never even made much less released at a wide scale (when was the last time, South Park, maybe, or by extension Team America). So, with this in mind, and ironic to say given the subject matter, but thank God for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg for Sausage Party.Is it a perfect movie? No, but who the f*** cares? This is one of the smarter films of the summer, if not the year, and surprising in that it delivers one thing in its marketing - a parody of all of these talking-whatever movies (you know from Pixar, "when the lights go out X is actually alive and talking, and there's an adventure story where one or two characters get separated and have to find their way back etc etc") and with the kind of "explicit" language that Rogen-Goldeberg and company have put out there since Superbad nine years ago. However if you see the movie it delivers something deeper, subverting expectations that come with something that looks so goofy (the film's directors have credits ranging from Monsters vs Aliens, with Rogen did a voice for by the way, and Thomas the Tank Engine videos!) but is about... religion and the power and susceptibility of beings towards faith.That may sound like blowing hot air like, how can this be anything more than its surface-level crude comedy and stereotypes? But right from the on-set, where the characters refer to the "Gods" and the opening song (the only main one so it's not a musical) where it's all about praising the Gods and the "Great Beyond" which is, of course, the Great Lie of being chosen by humans to be taken away as what they're meant for, the writers of the film take an opportunity and don't settle only for the gross-out... this is not to say this is not a filthy, raucous, ludicrous film that includes such things as, well, bath salts that make people hallucinate to the point where they can SEE THE FOOD TALKING (is that what they do, I wouldn't know, haven't tried it, sorry), and stereotypes of every thing you can think of from Irish potatoes to a Jewish bagel and a Muslim falafel and a Mexican (Lesbian!) taco to a Firewater Native American alcohol can (and Craig Robinson... well, see the movie to know about that). Because, yes, they're here in spades! What makes Sausage Party impactful is that it takes a leap to be *about* something, even if it ends up being rather gruesome and very, horrifically, violent (yes, for an R-rated movie this is one of the more violent pieces of escapism - perhaps in its way more honest than something like a PG-13 Suicide Squad despite/because of things like decapitated heads or exploding organs and so on). It even has a point about what it means to be an inspiration to people, that to change minds you can't simply show the "truth" right away and that different factions can't process that information. If that sounds odd, well, this climax is especially odd and totally insane. But it's also a brilliant conclusion to a very good movie, full of balls-to-the-wall action and a don't-take-no-prisoners attitude towards the food vs the humans. It reaches Inglourious Basterds level catharsis.Again, it's not totally up there with This is the End or Pineapple Express, the landmarks for this duo and their collaborators. On a first watch the Jew/Arab duo were a little one-note as a joke (so are a lot of the characters, which are fine, but these are here for longer period), and it also didn't make sense completely what could or couldn't talk (i.e. why the food AND things like a d**che or toilet paper or so on, what about the shopping cart or a television, where's the line drawn?) But these are relatively minor complaints in a movie that gets by by being so harrowingly hysterical in how it delivers its comedy - these guys have the opposite of fear, which is what you need for comedy. They have confidence in their vulgarity, so who cares if it has like 400 f***s? It has zero of them to give! Add on impressive voice-work (Edward Norton as the bagel! And James Franco gives one of his best performances in a while as "Druggie") and you got yourself a winner, and a fine successor to people who used animation as a mechanism for delivering hardcore, drag-through-the-mud satire like Bakshi or Mike Judge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Pixar for Adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party is a CGI-animated film that centers on a Sausage named Frank who discovers the awful truth of what happens to food when they are taken home from the supermarket.First of all, I will start off by saying that this film was extremely smart to heavily market this film as an R-rated cartoon. The commercials are broadcasting late at night or on predominately adult-oriented channels, the MPAA rating is expressed throughout, and just in case any of that happens to go over the heads of any inexplicably clueless parents, the commercials end with a giant "RATED R" label written across a black screen, as to say "for the thousandth time, It is rated R! Get it through your thick skulls!" which - I promise you - will not be enough to stop ignorant or neglectful parents from taking their naive, impressionable young ones. But, as my father always told me "Those who don't listen, will feel".. Which brings me to my next point; This film is off-the-wall, no-holds barred, profanity-laced, comedy gold! If you seen any previous Rogen/Goldberg films and you say to yourself "I kind of know what I'm going into" trust me; you'll be pleasantly surprised. Everything from the hilariously cheesy food-related puns to the brilliant depiction of food deaths, you'll wonder why a movie like this hasn't been made several times before. My favorite aspect of the film in particular is how every produce in the store belongs to a specific group of cultures and religions - just their human counterparts, such as Native Americans depicted as Firewater, Hispanics as Tacos, Tequila, etc., Homosexuals as Fruits...It is really just one very long "Ha Ha, I see what you did there" kind of thing and it works! What makes "Sausage Party" such a amazing gem is that it can so easily be confused for an innocent Disney-Esq film. The beautiful cinematography, the colorful characters, the opening musical, the moral lessons - everything that you can find in a kid-friendly cartoon, "Sausage Party" is bringing to the party (no pun attended) as well. There's enough spirit and wonders in this film to convince impressionable children to stop eating - I'm not even joking. So if you like your comedies offensive, daring, risqu, smart, while still attempting to endure the magical world of PIXAR that you would feel if you were to watch "Toy Story" or "Finding Nemo", then "Sausage Party" is definitely not a party you want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sausage Party is a R-rated animated comedy written by and starring Seth Rogan as Frank, a hot dog who learns the truth about what really happens to food when it's purchased by "the gods" (humans). Frank has to tell everybody else in the food market before it's too late. Other featured voice talent includes Kristin Wiig, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, and Edward Norton.This movie is HILARIOUS! I haven't laughed so hard at a movie this year ad much as I did during the opening scene of this movie. The jokes range from over-the-top (how do you like them apples, etc.), and the message might speak to some. I also really liked the animation style, especially in the food characters.My only complaint with this movie is how raunchy it was. I'm not against foul language or crude humor, but there still needs to be some context with it. When a f-bomb is used every other sentence, it really waters down the effect when language like that could, as Spongebob would say, act as a "sentence enhancer." I was desensitized to the language after 10 minutes of film, so it never effected me when it should have.Overall, if you can handle some really heavy profanity and humor more offensive than Deadpool, you'll love this movie. If you've ever been offended by language, sexual humor, or racial stereotypes, this movie is not for you.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/222408-sausage-party</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not your typical animation, Sausage Party is a look into one of the modern world's obsession-food. It delves into the grocery aisles and tells the story from their perspective. Where the love interest of a particular hot dog and bun yearning for each other so intense that they delve into tip play. Raunchy at times, this adolescent humor is funny at times and as long as you enter with that in mind, the movie is pretty good. No stereotype is left behind as you discover a talking taco and whole cast of misfits. The hot dog through his odyssey discovers foods fate and uses it as a cause to warn others. The danger of the human gods and how food nourishes their cravings. There are tender moments where the foods come together for a united front. These horny treats leave nothing behind as the audience is left with there is not better to satisfy a craving that indulge in a little food play. I liked the movie and enjoyed a hearty laugh even when I knew I should not have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animated Seth Rogen comedy is as funny and irreverent as you'd expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have reunited once again in this incredibly raunchy R- rated comedy following their success with 'This Is The End' and 'Neighbors', except what's different this time is this comedy is an CGI animated feature revolving around talking food products rather than human characters (though there are a few). For a movie starring and written by Seth Rogen, you would expect to see a straight forward raunchy comedy with no-holds-bar vulgarity and abundance of four letter words. This comedy however, manages to squeeze in a surprisingly thought-provoking allegory to religion along with the predictably irreverent humor, similar to what we saw in 'This Is The End' which followed a cast of characters trying to survive the apocalypse. Featuring the voices of Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, David Krumholtz, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and several others to name; this movie follows a wide of cast of food products at a local supermarket who live their lives awaiting to be taken away by the "gods" (shopping customers) into a world known as the "great beyond", a place of comfort and endless happiness. When they discover the ugly truth of what really goes on in the so-called paradise, Frank the Sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) must rally up his friends to help save from the unspeakable terror that awaits them.A comedy about foul-mouth talking food? Yeah, kinda sounds like a dumb idea, right? Well, with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg behind the writing process, this movie unexpectedly manages to be much smarter than what you may anticipate while at the same time, being hysterically funny in blatantly absurd ways. Advertised with inventive marketing, this highly anticipated comedy delivers much more than just a string of raunchy R-rated humor and a no-brainer of a plot. Rogen and Goldberg accomplish this by formulating the plot that serves as a metaphor to Christianity, with the food being purchased by shoppers and taken into the "great beyond" which serves as a clear analogy to heaven. One line in particular is "the gods work in mysterious ways". This also includes some comedic dialogue and humor that falls metaphorical to references of the bible including a silly musical number in which the film opens up with. Yes, the humor has no reservation of being politically incorrect or downright offensive, especially with all the seemingly non-stop profanity. At the same time, Rogen and Goldberg know how to make it funny and subversive. Sure, some of the jokes do fall on the mean-spirited side, or under the not-so-rare circumstances push the envelope, particularly the massive food orgy scene. Though it is meant to be funny, it's necessarily clever or even charming in the slightest. On the other hand, the film as a whole knows how to be funny in a way that works, even without the constant vulgar gags thrown around here and there. Sausage Party is a funny and irreverent animated comedy that shows Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg still have their A-game, even if their over-the-top humor isn't everyone's cup of tea. This movie is astoundingly hilarious and is worth seeing. However, although this is an animated feature, parents are strongly discouraged of bringing their children to this one. So if you are a parent, please hire a babysitter and leave the kids at home. This is not a film you'll want to expose to their young eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's vulgar. Over the top. And completely hilarious. It even has a serious message about religion and why we are here. Anyone that says this movie is not funny does not have a sense of humor. I never write reviews but this movie was just to funny to see people on here claiming it's not. They just broke new ground for a genre with adult animation. Why not? I'm tired of all animation being just kid movies. Easily best comedy of the year. I hope they make a sequel because I think it will be even better knowing they did something outstanding. Every character has its funny moment. I loved nick roll as the douche and Danny mcbrides honey mustard. I'd like to see mcbrides with a bigger part in the next one because he is just too funny. Krumholtz as lavish was awesome. I believe it will be even funnier a second viewing. And the final 20 minutes there is a scene so bizarre and hilarious the fact it's animation is just awesome</fullReview>

If someone finds this stupid movie funny then its okay for them of course but i just didn't get the humor. 4/10 stupid , unfunny , the orgy scene was too much and wasn't really needed.

		<shortDescription>The bad, the good and the ugly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this one more than i actually did. It all started pretty slowly with the daily life of our characters - the food in the supermarket. We are presented with a song to the "gods" - the customers. Even though they can't hear them.At first i thought that the sausages are the only ones that have this vulgar way of talking because they are at a dark corner where some teenager might come around... i guess. But as the universe of the supermarket expands into infinity all of them talk the same.After they were "chosen", they were separated from the shopping cart by a crash. Now we're presented to an adventure like "we need to get back just to be chosen again" but the protagonist-sausage just finds out the hidden truth - the gods are monsters and eat them instead to care for them until eternity.They talked about how pointless their life would be without something to believe in, which is ignored in the third act. I'll get into that later.While they walk around from point A to point B because of the antagonist who is *urinate synonym for annoyed* at "the sausage and her hun" the ones that were chosen are being cooked. One of the sausages, let's call him: "The ugly sausage", figures out to escape and follows a god who tries bath salt for the first time. Now the stoner can see the true faces of the stuff he bought. That really didn't matter because after the trip everything went normal and for some reason he felt like cooking the ugly sausage he didn't even bought.I actually liked this part because it didn't felt bland and had some pretty good ideas that were punished like dirt in the next part.So they were reunited, the sausage found proof that the gods are monsters but because nobody beliefs a sausage everything was pointless and a waste of time. But there comes the ugly one and safes the day with his newfound friends just because they found out by accident that the gods can die. Apparently, something like that never happens in a supermarket. Anyway, all of them fight for their freedom. They just don't believe in the lie anymore. All the people can see their true faces now and go totally wild eating everything... Because movie.The third act is a big "wtf". The antagonist who never was shown in the last 40 minutes or so gets into the ass of the caretaker and controls him that way. The food and stuff wins the fight and just starts having sex with each other 5 minutes long. This is "The Room" now. And after that they find out that they aren't real and just a cartoon which makes everything even more pointless. At least it wasn't like a "It's just a dream of the stoned Seth Rogen." one.In conclusion i can say that this movie was a pretty bland, vulgar and weird one. I liked that at times but i just expected that there is at least something different in these 1 and a half. They tried to create some eye-candy like plants that look like a jungle but it failed at parts. It tried so hard to get that message about religion, that they/we can reach unknown limits without it, clear that it's not only polished but also broken at the end.6.54/10 - Watchable if yo *beep* like vulgarity.</fullReview>

Since they want to stress out that is a movie for adults, they keep saying unnecessary profanities (I never heard an adult speaking like an 8-year-old boy that just discovered the F-word). The result is a complete loss of humor (that was present in the trailers). The plot is OK, I guess, it is just difficult to see it behind all that swearing.I can't believe how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I have found Seth Rogen's previous efforts to be very hit and miss. I quite liked The Green Hornet, but absolutely hated This is the End.With a title like Sausage Party, my expectations weren't set high. Just as well really, as it was extremely lowbrow (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). but unlike Matt Stone and Trey Parker efforts (South Park &amp; Team America), it offered little in the way of intelligent commentary to counterbalance it.I know that humour is subjective, but to me this wasn't funny. I'm not even sure that my twelve-year-old self would have found it funny. If you find animated food saying f**k and c**t amusing, then this is the film for you. For everyone else, spend your ticket money elsewhere.The film's 'message' was not smart or original, and their attempt at shock factor ("haha, that vegetable said f**k!") fails because it's been done before, bigger, longer, and uncut (South Park movie).(Originally published on my blog, whingewood.wordpress.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grotesque, Even for Rogen Fans, but It's Endlessly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As entertaining as it is to watch food be voiced by Seth Rogen's squad, Sausage Party becomes increasingly grotesque and uncomfortable with every scene. Though I will say the ending may be one of 2016's greatest treasures.Along the same lines as Toy Story and Secret Life of Pets, we just had to know what every type of food and drink were thinking as we grabbed them off the shelf at a market. On paper, this is exactly what I would want Rogen and his writers to tackle. There's something about a sausage and a bun try to escape a market that seemed to fit what Rogen has done in the past. To be fair, they take it in all the directions you would hope they would go and tell all the jokes and innuendos you would expect, but sometimes it's just a little too much.Filled with endless amounts of talent both voicing and behind the camera, Sausage Party always keeps you entertained. There's never really a dull moment on screen, but as the film progresses, those moments just become overdone gags and jokes that tend to take things just one step too far. It's not that I ever wanted realism with this type of premise, but I would have hoped for a little more subtly in certain areas.With all this said, I pretty much got out of it exactly what the trailer sold me. Putting aside the amazing Saving Private Ryan tribute that was shown in the trailer, there's plenty of other pop culture and movie references that put a smile on my face as well. Plus, getting Academy Award level talent like Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and composer Alan Menken to come on board this ridiculous romp is pretty dang awesome.If you liked the trailer, I think you'll enjoy Sausage Party. It's fast paced and has several insane moments that make the theater experience all the more surreal. The gags go on for too long and the story suffers, so it isn't the most even Rogen pic, but it's worth watching for sure.+Always entertaining+Movie references and tributes+Voice talent-Keeps pushing the same jokes and gags-A little bit too grotesque6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seth Rogen Brings The Raunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor/Vague SpoilersSausage (but really Hot Dog) Party is a satirical, non-family friendly, animated comedy film directed by Greg Tiernan, his feature film debut. It was really interesting to note that Tiernan has swung in the completely opposite direction from his previous works on Thomas &amp; Friends where he introduced CGI into the series. Tiernan and his wife founded Nitrogen Studios Canada, Inc. in 2003, and he used his studio for pre and post-production in this film. Lead star and writer, Seth Rogen, has been working on this film for eight years and has said that studios were scared to pick it up because of its R rating. Eventually Sony Pictures and Annapurna Pictures would partner and co-finance the film and fast forward to August 2016 and here it is. First thing's first, if you are not a fan of Seth Rogen's comedy then this might not be the movie for you. This is very low brow and way over the top and considering he called all his buddies (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Danny McBride) for roles in the movie his style of comedy shines bright like the entrance to The Great Beyond. On a basic level the film could be described as Toy Story with food, the same way The Secret Life of Pets could be described as Toy Story with pets. It clearly is going off past Disney/Pixar films that use this concept and posing the question, "what if our food had feelings?" From the trailers I had thought there would be more involved with being at the woman's house and trying to escape The Great Beyond and get back to Shopwell's, the films supermarket where all the food resides. The Great Beyond is the world outside the supermarket and that is what the food items perceive to be a Heaven and the real life people are Gods. What really took me by surprise, in a good way, was how the film used satire and social commentary to talk about real things such as religion, politics, and war all portrayed by stereotypical food items from their respective countries. While, there were moments that showed it was self-aware (specifically one scene involving cheese) and smart, it did not shy away from being EXTREMELY raunchy. One of the final scenes was especially raunchy and while I was shocked to be watching what I was, I couldn't help myself but laugh my ass off. The scene just kept going and going but didn't get old, it just built upon itself and made it more hilarious. The film also has many different elements to it (Horror, meta, raunchy) such as the scene where the food items find out that The Great Beyond isn't what they thought it would be and it turns into a horror comedy. Even though most of the scene is shown in the trailers it still plays out quite well, just not as hilarious as if I hadn't watched the trailers 10 times over. There is a bit of a lull in the middle where they take the time to do some world building inside the shopping centre where each aisle is like another country. The jokes do come to a halt here but I see it as necessary for the film because it enables us to get introduced to a whole world instead of just the hot dog and a bun. The ending to this film could open it up to a sequel if they choose to make one (heres hoping they do)! It gets very meta and for a moment I thought the movie wasn't over but instead the credits hit and Sausage Party Two is left as just a twinkle in our eyes. Hopefully, it doesn't take another eight years to get it into theatres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure how I'm going to write a review for this. It seems natural just to describe its main points and personal opinion on those points but that's more an extension of the movie summary, isn't it? So I'll try to review it in film terms.Well the plot is quite simple and the humour is basic distaste sort of humour. The message is very clearly anti-religious and yet the alternatives presented are either negative or questionable. I'd go so far as to say it is aimed at viewers of the anti-religion, anti- morality persuasion... If you are not such a viewer you may struggle to enjoy the movie, unless you are the thinking kind, in which case you may well find it challenging.The idea of food being alive (unlike toys) is actually incredibly disturbing from an eating point of view and could put you off eating ever again if you are 5 and watching this. It is a 15 in Britain so that's unlikely, and R-rated elsewhere. For some of the end content I'd only recommend it to adults really.I'm still not sure what to say. It was OK but a lot of the stereotypes were typical. I don't want to spoil a lot either but it has its trippy moments. The horror movie factor seen in the trailer was quite minimal and more sexually explicit part was brisk, probably all for rating/release issues. Certainly had its funny points and definite;y hits the smut-meter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seth Rogen gets animated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say the least, I was excited when I heard Seth Rogen was gonna make his first animated movie, about foods as well. This was long ago though and it felt like it would take forever before I saw it, but now I have and all I can say is...It's a very funny movie, and well put together as well. The voice acting is top-notch from everyone in cast. Not just Rogen, but practically all of the voice actors brought something of their own. Of course, Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Edward Norton (Yep, he's actually in there) bring their fullest as they usually do, but names I'm less familiar with like Scott Underwood (his acting debut) and Nick Kroll did solid jobs as well. As for the characters, there are so many great ones, most of them have their own quirky personalities and their memorable one-liners. But my favorite has to be Teresa El Taco. I loved how she just kept hitting at Brenda all the time, and was so adorable as well. I rooted for her throughout the movie, and Brenda and Frank's romance didn't really feel that believable anyway.Most of all though, I was either laughing or at least had a smile on my face for the majority of the time. Every scene had near-impeccable comic timing, and all the food puns I wanted were definitely present. Sometimes the silly puns were even funnier than the sex jokes they went with. Every time a new character was introduced, opportunities for new kind of jokes showed up. You gotta love when a poor almost used-up roll of toilet paper speaks with a frail shaky voice about the traumatizing s'hit he's been through. Or the war-esque sequence where every piece of food is dying, like the jelly for the peanut butter (easy joke, but still got to me). And I won't spoil what happened in it, but the talked-about food orgy which occurs at one point... It's a little gross and yes, really, REALLY stupid, but I laughed my ass off nevertheless. It's not *that* graphic however, not the NC-17 material Rogen &amp; co. thought of it as, but still stands as one of the craziest scenes I've witnessed in an animated movie. Jesus.There's a present undertone about religion as well (with the foods thinking they'll go to The Great Beyond, but it's really just a load of crap) which I think they handled well. Yes there are jokes which will bother some people (like most around Lavash, an Islamic stereotype), but I just loved them, not to mention Lavash wasn't such a horrible stereotype. He's been brought up on out-dated values, but isn't depicted as a crazy, deranged lunatic. I didn't mind the movie being atheist in nature either, and everyone believing in The Great Beyond weren't depicted as stupid, just misinformed.If I have any negatives, it's only that despite my praise, my expectations were still too high. I almost expected The Interview levels of funny, but it didn't really reach that bar. Some parts of the movie felt a bit slow (like the fire circle scene) and a lot, but not *all* of the jokes hit like they should've. The ending is not a problem for me though, I freaking loved it. I know it has resulted in mixed opinions, but I didn't see what was the problem with it. You ask me, that's the best possible one they could have used.Sausages, sausages for everyone! Big fu'cking thumbs up to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting concept - the entirety of the interesting part can be seen in the trailers. Save yourself both the money and an hour and a half of your life.Once you get past the shock novelty of food talking and being ridiculously raunchy the movie becomes pathetic, repetitive and dull.Bottom line- Should have been a 5 minute cartoon. Beyond that it is really just a raunchy, garbage philosophy, amorality play - A vehicle for the usual nihilistic liberal memes involving sexuality, romanticism of hard drugs and atheism. I could forgive the vacuous leftist part if the movie were genuinely creative and funny. It isn't. It is an Utterly stupid, vacuous waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Adequate R-rated, Vulgar, CGI Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Realizing this is the first full-length, CGI animated R-rated flick, I just had to see it for myself. Since Seth Rogen and his crew admitted this movie is an intentional spoof of Pixar and DreamWorks films, it left me further curious on what was to expect. When it ended, I thought to myself, "Past animated movies went the R-rated route before, so is this a step further?"The story revolves around Frank (Seth Rogen), a sausage along with his friends wanting to be chosen by human shoppers or as the foods call them "gods" to find a new life in what they call home. Though it's not all what it seems when they find out the horrific truth of their fates, so he and his fellow foods must band together to follow their own destinies.The concept of personifying inanimate objects is something that existed many times before, but by giving it the R-rated treatment, there's no holding back with sexual content and foul language. My nitpicks of it were the lack of proper depth in the human characters (save for the druggie) and the excessive cursing just to be funny wears thin easily after a while, though the food puns sure had me laughing especially its shock value in the various predicaments each of the food characters face (albeit forced and a tendency to be predictable that I sometimes turned away out of embarrassment).In the past, I've watched a handful of R-rated animated films of different genres whether of domestic or overseas origin (some of which were milestone pieces that broke ground or shaped the medium much differently compared to the ones for younger audiences), but marking the first CGI-animated in this category is something that's not often done. Story-wise, it toys with themes of existentialism, religion and even reality-bending material. Among the various Seth Rogen comedies I've seen ("Paul" still one personal favorite), it's like "This Is The End: Food Edition." With the voices of Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, and other Judd Apatow regulars, they sure sounded like they had a riot lending their voices to these characters on screen, not to mention the irony of involving Disney veteran Alan Menken composing the music and the opening number. On another note, it's like it's trying to follow in the footsteps of the last R-rated, animated box office success that was South Park back in 1999 (which coincidentally parodied Disney animated musicals of the 90s). Although it wouldn't be fair to compare Rogen's brand of humor to Trey &amp; Matt's South Park, I'd say it's wanting to reach similar ranks in terms of violent, vulgar humor if not exactly high standard. This is a rarity in this current era of CGI animation, check it out and don't expect your kids to watch it anytime soon since it's obviously not for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Insightful - Pixar for Adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party is more than just Seth Rogan and friends in animated form making obscene and offensive jokes, Sausage Party brings up many valid questions about our society, religion, and how we view ourselves.In some ways, Sausage Party is exactly what you think it is. A silly animation movie full of raunchy jokes and laughs. If you take this movie for face value, it will still be very goofy and funny. There were times were I could not stop laughing. The pun game is out of control. Some of them will probably go over your head if you are not paying close attention.The thing that put this movie over the top for me though, is that it is almost like a Pixar film for adult themes. The most common and blatant one is God. The movie makes a lot of comparisons to modern religion raising the question, "Does God exist?" They even through in a lot of references to how the Bible came about, and how many people believe the Bible has been changed throughout the years. The also bring up many cultural problems with race. The different foods don't always play nice with one another and it makes for some intrigued insight on modern society. Finally, they make a strong point about how women are punished and judged much more harshly in society. The main point is that women should not be judged harsher for being sexual when men are the same way.Ultimately, I think the point of the movie was to not hold back and enjoy life not worrying about consequences that may or may not exist. We can't all just wait for happiness in the great beyond. Nothing is guaranteed in life. You have to live in the present.</fullReview>

If you do have a movie, send it to these producers, obviously these guys need some good scripts.

They told me I wasn't the only one who did that and the manager and I had a laugh about it. The movie is just lame. Basically they tell the same jokes over and over and over and over again. It reminds me of that one person who tells you an okay joke but keeps retelling and killing it. Have you seen the trailer for this movie? Basically the trailer has all the best parts. The rest of this film is retelling of the same jokes you already saw in the trailer. I can write an essay about how pointless this movie is. This film was made for those mouth breathers who like Adam Sandler films, still live at home with their parents and never had a girlfriend in their life. Don't be fooled by the trailers, skip it. If you really, really need to watch this movie then wait for it to come out on cable and I can almost guarantee you'll change the channel after 5 or 10 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun In Parts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seth Rogen is a man with funny ideas &amp; his latest animation-food-based-comedy 'Sausage Party' is another mad attempt by him &amp; Co. And to give this food-talking film its due, its fun in parts &amp; has sequences that genuinely make you laugh. But, the writing is erratic &amp; hence the impact isn't entirely enjoyable.'Sausage Party' follows a hot dog sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) who tries to discover the truth about his existence, and goes on a journey with his friends to escape their fate.'Sausage Party' is vulgar, offensive &amp; also funny, no doubt. But the narrative ranges between fun to ordinary. I enjoyed the camaraderie of its central characters &amp; also their love for foul language. The first-hour starts well, but dips considerably in the middle, especially when the food-goons make it out of the store. The laughs shorten &amp; the sequences aren't amusing enough. However, 'Sausage Party' comes to full-power in its final-act, which is fun as well as funny. A post climax-sequence involving the food-goons going crazy in orgy-mode, is Laugh-Out-Loud Funny. But, that's the deal, 'Sausage Party' is erratic, and that's its only minus.Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter &amp; Ariel Shaffir's Screenplay is innovative &amp; funny, but could've done better, giving its potential overall. I wanted to laugh more! Greg Tiernan &amp; Conrad Vernn's Direction is quite good, as the animation is spiced up. Kevin Pavlovic's Editing is crisp, as the madness is wrapped up in 88-minutes.Coming to the Vocal-Performances. Seth Rogen as Frank, the heroic Sausage, is tops, as always. Kristen Wiig as Brenda, a hot-dog bun &amp; Frank's love-interest, is excellent. Bill Hader as Firewater, an old Native American bottle of liquor, Tequila, and El Guaco, a guacamole gangster, is a riot. Edward Norton as Sammy Bagel Jr., a bagel &amp; Salma Hayek as Teresa del Taco, a lesbian taco shell who develops a lustful friendship with Brenda, steal the show. Michael Cera as Barry, a deformed sausage who is one of Frank's friends, is cute. Danny McBride as Honey Mustard, a grocery who was returned to Shopwell's and tries to warn Frank of their fate, is loud. James Franco as the Druggie, a junkie drug addict who is the first known human to see the foods as sentient beings, brings the house down. Jonah Hill as Carl, a sausage who's packed with Frank and Barry, is effective enough. Paul Rudd as Darren, the manager of Shopwell's, who the food-toons are frightened by, is first-rate. Others lend superb support.On the whole, 'Sausage Party' has flaws, but it isn't without its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hot Dog! Wieners never quit. This movie was entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may not be an Oscar wiener, but you'll relish this raunchy yet smart film about one sausage, Frank (Voiced by Seth Rogen) quest on discovering the truth about his existence and what really happens when the food are chosen to leave the grocery store. Without spoiling the movie, too much; I have to say, I kinda glad, this movie came out. After all, it's seem like 2012's botch animation film, 'Food Fight' ruin the whole cool concept. This movie directed by Greg Tiernan &amp; Conrad Vernon went through a lot of development hell, in its way to being product. Pitch eight years ago by creator/writers Seth Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg, it seem like nobody in Hollywood was open to the idea until producer, Megan Ellison and eventually Sony came along. However, the early draft of the script was leaked in the Sony hack in November 2014, further stalling progress of the movie. Still, even with that. The movie got made, because of two factors. One is the success of 2014's runaway hit, 'The Interview' and the second, being that it's been many years since the last good profanity fill Rated R completely-CGI animation comedy came to theaters with 1999's 'South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut'. People were really looking forward to this film; as so was I. I like the blended of low brow gross humor, violent food deaths, silly food puns, with theologically religious dogma style debate that the movie is going for. It made for a unique watch. Parents whom accidentally take their kids to see the movie and complain afterwards are idiots. This animated comedy is decidedly not for kids; as its trailers, rambunctiously filthy in more ways than one. It also got NC-17, before being tone down. Nothing is sacred, here. Yet, there is only a few things that I didn't like, about the film. Some of the profanity in the film seem a little forced. Some of the curse words don't really match, the tone of the sentences. It somewhat lose its emphasis. The film rely way too much on the overabundance of foul language, and sexual innuendos to carry the film. Some of the language is creative, however, others are so groan-worthy. And while some jokes not exactly funny, it's at least consistently amusing and has a positive attitude. Also, the story is a bit off-putting when it's introduce other supermarket items ranging from feminine hygiene products to bathroom tissue into the mix. It's not, because the item come across as gross, but the fact that it's makes the story, somewhat jarring. It's weird that they can come alive, yet others items like knifes, cigars, plates, and cups do not. Honestly, it could be better, if they stick to the whole 'living food' concept. It's already a bit confusing. Throughout the whole movie, I was wondering if any of the previous ingredients to make such complex food, were sentient before being killed off. Is a fusion or reincarnation thing? Also, how in the hell does, the food, not know that they will be killed off? By the look at the place, this supermarket does have a deli and butcher. They would have to notice, something odd. I guess the limited intelligence sense is given, since many of perishable products can't be more than a few days old. Plus, I get the whole 'portal' idea toward the end as something to laugh at, for being ridiculous, but it really comes out of nothing. At less, the infamous 'orgy' scene made a little more sense to the story. Anyways, thinking too much of the logically of the plot will hurt your head. It's better off, just to turn your brain, off and enjoy the ride. Despite the confusing plot, I did like all the film references, this film got, ranging from 1998's 'Saving Private Ryan', 1991's 'Terminator 2' and 1961's 'West Side Story', even if some of the shouts out, were a little too out there like 1962's Twilight Zone's episode 'To Serve Man'. Despite that, the voice actors including Michael Cera, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Salma Hayek, and others are very lively in their performances, even if their characters are shallow, somewhat racist stereotypes. I have to give props to some of the actors as some of them, were playing multiply characters like Bill Hader and Harland Williams. However, I have to say, actor Edward Norton does the best, out of all of them. His impression of director/comedian Woody Allen was amazing with his Jewish character, Sammy Bagel Jr. You really didn't see that, coming at all from him. The celebs cameos were also fun to see. Singer, Meat Loaf playing Meat Loaf has to be, my favorite. The first-class computer animation from Nitrogen Studio is also clear and colorful. It just as good as the animation from big time studios like Pixar, Disney, DreamWorks, and Illumination Entertainment in the last decade. It just suck that many of the animators at Nitrogen Studios worked under poor conditions and were forced by Greg Tiernan to work overtime without pay; with results of many of the animators going uncredited if complaining. While that part of the production might not be cool; the work, they put out, were astounding, no matter what. The music by long ex-Disney composer Alan Menken was also terrifying. The opening number was very well-done and will get critical from some religious fundamentalism. Overall: It's a party worth attending more than once. The comedy about grocery store foods and products facing an existential crisis, is a must-watch for anybody looking for a good time laugh. That's if you can stomach, its menu style of humor. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Still can't look at food the same way just yet but you know, I'm getting there. Hot dogs were already ruined for me when I ate a moldy hot dog one time. No harm done there.

		<fullReview>Should Seth Rogen Write Children's Movies? Let's Take a Look at The New Raunchy Comedy Sausage Party!IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET STONED WHILE WATCHING CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS?!Life is good for all the food items that occupy the shelves at the local supermarket. Frank, played by Seth Rogen (Knocked Up, Neighbors) is the hot dog, Brenda, played by Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids, 2016's Ghostbusters) is the hot dog bun, Teresa Taco, played by Salma Hayek (Frida, Everly) and Sammy Bagel Jr. played by Edward Norton (Fight Club, American History X) can't wait to go home with a happy customer, because they see human beings as Gods. Soon, their world comes crashing down as poor Frank learns the horrifying truth that he will eventually become a tasty mouth watering meal. After warning his pals about their similar fate, the panicked perishables devise a plan to escape from their human enemies. Sausage Party is raunchy, rowdy, completely insane, and an animated blast at the theater. Once again, we have the entire Seth Rogen entourage returning in this movie. We have James Franco (Fly Boys, Pineapple Express), Jonah Hill (Superbad, 21 Jump Street), Michael Cera (Superbad, This is the End), Danny McBride (Your Highness, This is the End), Paul Rudd (The 40 Year Old Virgin, Ant-Man), Bill Hader (Superbad, Trainwreck), Craig Robinson (Knocked Up This is the End), David Krumholtz (The Santa Clause, The Judge), and Nick Kroll (Get Him to the Greek, Dinner for Schmucks) . They all do exceptional voices, especially Bill Hader. From the opening scene, you are already on edge, smiling, giggling, and you soon find yourself busting your gut and spilling laughter. It was such a funny and clever opening. Especially if you know how a majority of children's animation movies open. The directors of this movie are Conrad Vernon (Shrek 2, Puss in Boots) and Greg Tiernan. So these two know how to craft an exceptional animated film, and once again, they proof to us they can do it again. LET'S SPOON! FORK OFF!Even though this film is offensive, foul, use a ton of profanity, it actually is thought provoking, entertaining, funny, and has a message to its audience. The movie actually does get a little emotional and mentally deep. For instance, how is peanut butter made without the death of peanuts? How is jelly made when you murder grapes? What makes us who we are? Etc. This movie had me laughing aloud when I first saw the trailer. On the other hand, the actual film is trying to show us a message. A message about religion, God(s), race, politics, history, war, separation, poking fun at Disney movies, stereotypes, how and what we consume in our bodies for fuel, health, and I'm sure there are a lot more I may have missed. You gather all these themes, put them in an R rated animated film and you get Sausage Party (even though our main character Frank is a hot dog). TOO MUCH MUSTARD ON THAT ONEThe movie was not consistently laugh aloud funny as if I thought it would be. After a while, the profanity got a little stale. Yes, I understand a hot dog saying f#ck is funny, but they could have toned it down. In addition, the movie gets a little too wrapped up in the message it wants to share with the viewer(s) at times. One thing I personally found awkward, was it felt like the movie kept reminding us we are in an R rated animated film. FOOD FIGHT!Accordingly, the film starts to show us more of this world. We start to realize it's not just food that is alive. Condoms, bathroom supplies, and other objects come to life as well. I really felt bad for toilet paper. In the film, a hot dog asks toilet paper, "What do they (the humans) do to you?" Toilet paper responds, "You don't want to f#cking know." At this point, this is when the food and other objects get together to fight the humans, and fight for what they believe in.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Sausage Party. I enjoyed the film, I thought it was smart, had a message, and made for good entertainment. Some of the jokes do fall a little flat, and get old. Nevertheless, they make up for it in so many clever ways. Please if you have children do not take them to see this movie! Unless you want your child to have a panic attack in the middle of a Publix. I believe Sausage Party earns?7 Sausages Out of 10!his review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but kinda bi-polar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally think any spoilers contained in this review are slight, but wanted to mark it as containing spoilers regardless since I wouldn't want to ruin anyone's viewing experience. Within 5 minutes I understood exactly why some people who'd paid good money to see this film decided to walk out. There is absolutely nothing subtle about Sausage Party. The foul language, the archetypal (and often wildly racist) characters, the crude humor, the overall theme of the movie -- everything is amped up to 69. And if you even cracked a smile at the suggestiveness of that number, then you'll probably at least partially enjoy Sausage Party. Almost instantly the viewer is assaulted with the humor device of cute, Pixar-like animated characters swearing like sailors and spouting x-rated puns and innuendo. It's funny to an extent, but after a short while it loses its novelty and punch because it's used to such a ridiculous extent. It didn't offend me in the slightest, but it made me worry that it might be all the movie had to offer. So for many audience members not expecting such language and low- brow sexual humor being hurled at them consistently, I can completely understand them being quickly turned off and wanting to leave. Even though I'm a guy, I can see why women in general might be offended by both the visual representation of females, and the fact that they're written fairly shallowly while the males have more depth and character development. One can certainly tell that it was written by "bros."And then there is the odd juxtaposition of all this cursing and innuendo over a plot that is clearly a ham-fisted discussion about religion, the possible pointlessness of it, and the sure destructiveness it has inspired by those who take it to extremes. Many people who weren't offended by all the cursing will probably take umbrage at the plot that almost immediately paints followers of pretty much all religions as clueless, automaton-like zealots who follow the "rules" and oppress their feelings and desires because they feel it's the only way to secure their place in an abstract and glorified afterlife. Once a few characters become "enlightened" to the fact that heaven is an illusion, the "gods" are monsters, and religion in general was something a small, shadowy group dreamed up as a way alleviate fears and essentially keep the population in line, Sausage Party seems to become an attack on all spiritual beliefs. Again, I can definitely see why people of any religion would take offense to the extent that they would walk out of the theater.However, much like the movie Dogma, ((here's where there's a potential spoiler, although I don't think it factors heavily into the overall plot)) there is an eventual realization that religion isn't inherently bad; and even an atheist can't claim to be smarter or superior because they don't have all the concrete answers and cannot completely disprove the notion of a higher power. But by that time, many viewers will have tuned out because of what will surely (and understandably) be construed as mocking anti-religious propaganda. In addition, there are copious displays of drug-use which, in themselves, many might find offensive; but also being portrayed as portals to knowledge and enlightenment could be thought of as dangerous and irresponsible. And as a final, button-pushing display, the movie suddenly discards all the heavy-handed theological discussion for a scene that is astonishingly graphic -- even given the fact that the main characters are a sausage and a bun. This constant veering from juvenile humor, foul language, and over-the top stereotypes to a social and religious commentary seems like two entirely different movies mashed together. Both of those movies have huge potential to alienate a large percentage of audiences, so seeing them layered on top of one another seems like an enormous risk... especially when the trailers seemed to promise just crudeness and violence towards grocery store products. All that said, I personally found it generally funny and entertaining. I openly admit that I find a lesbian taco and a Stephen Hawking-like character portrayed as a deformed wad of used chewing gum to be amusing... even though they're silly and offensive. Thankfully the film tries to make fun of pretty much everyone, so it's not really an attack on a specific group. It even makes fun of itself and its own writers and producers by pointing out their childish and crude humor, so I found that refreshingly self-aware. Is it for everyone? Most definitely not... not by a long shot. But there is an audience that will enjoy it. I just suggest doing some research on it beforehand to see if any of its facets will make you regret spending $30 on a ticket and popcorn</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rogen could have made an honestly insightful movie, with clever comedy as well!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'SAUSAGE PARTY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The first R-rated CGI animated movie! The film comes from the vulgar minds of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir and Jonah Hill (who all co-wrote the movie); and it was directed by Greg Tiernan (a veteran director of the animated kids' TV series 'THOMAS &amp; FRIENDS') and Conrad Vernon (who also co- directed 'SHREK 2', 'MADAGASCAR 3' and 'MONSTERS VS. ALIENS'). The film stars the voice talents of Rogen, Hill, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, Edward Norton, Bill Hader, Salma Hayek, Danny McBride, James Franco, Paul Rudd and many others. It tells the story of several sentient beings, that are food living in a grocery store. One sausage sets out to learn the truth, about their deadly fate. It's of course a raunchy adult- themed spoof, on popular CGI kids' movie blockbusters. The film's received mostly good reviews from critics, and it's also performed surprisingly well at the Box Office (although exit poll rankings haven't been that positive). I think it's somewhat clever and funny, but not nearly as much so as Rogen's, and company's, best.The food, living in Shopwell's Grocery Store, all believe that when they're purchased, they'll go to a heavenly place; and live happily ever after. This is something they've been taught, all of their short little lives. Just when a sausage, named Frank (Rogen), and his girlfriend, a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), are about to leave the store; a traumatized honey mustard bottle (McBride), who was previously bought and returned, commits suicide. This causes Frank and Brenda to fall out of their grocery cart. Frank then sets out to learn the full truth about their fate.The movie is somewhat funny, but it does seem a lot like a 'one-joke comedy'; it's a clever idea, but almost all of the jokes revolve around the same gimmick (with a lot of vulgarity thrown in as well). The animation is well done; and there is some insightful criticism on religion, and how people mostly prefer to believe what they want to believe (instead of hearing the harsh negative reality). Still, Rogen says his idea for the film was based on the concept 'what if our food had feelings'! Our food does have feelings, because most of it comes from sentient animal life! He could have made an honestly insightful movie, with clever comedy as well, about how immoral (and unhealthy) the average human diet is. Some people just need to believe what they want to believe though (like obviously Seth Rogen does); and they refuse to listen to the harsh negative reality.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked how much I had fun with this movie. I usually don't enjoy Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg comedies, but this movie was much more unique. While there was still raunchy and drug humor throughout the movie, the combination of this and the animation made it even more hilarious. The voice cast was surprisingly great. Even though the voices are noticeable, it fit well with the character they were playing. One of my favorites was Bill Hader voicing a Native American ?type alcohol bottle. The things that happen throughout the movie are so strange that I could not believe what I was witnessing. The ending of this film was easily the most I've laugh this year. Anyways, this movie is not for everyone. The film is a bit stupid, but that's intentional. The film did not have as much laugh-out-loud moments as I wanted, but that is not really the movies fault. The trailers gave away so much funny bits in the movie, that the hype for the movie would have never been met. But, overall I had a great time with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Wonderful Journey To Seek Out The Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently seen this hilarious comedy piece at my local theater and i would say that i didn't regret it. Seth Rogen( as well as most of the cast list) is already well known comedians. The movie was never a bore to me (there were some slow parts, but there was always surprises) and it's a great movie if you've ever watched The Night Before, 50/50, or Super Bad. What i found interesting was that Greg Tiernan (Directed Thomas &amp; Friends) and Conrad Vernon (directed Shrek) made this film look so kid friendly and delighting to watch at the start, and then just really made it raunchy, disturbingly obscene, and utterly hilarious that it was without the doubt the best change-up for a beginning of a rated R animated film. It really does deserve a rating of 7, without a doubt it's as funny as it looks on TV previews, but it's even more shocking once you watch it. Now, there is many parts where it did get a little slow and not all of the jokes were funny, nor did everything run its course like other "kid-friendly" animated films, but it did do a good job at explaining the question, "What would it look like if food had human personalities and were conscious of their surroundings?" So in the end would i recommend this film to watch at home with your eight year old child? Hell no i wouldn't, but when you're at home or want to watch something funny and new then this is the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was moderately interested in this film just from looking at one trailer; I was open to the vulgarity of the film, but I didn't think it would be as good as it was.The theme of the film and the delivery is genius by my rating.The base of it's humor is sexual jokes, blunt insult and passive aggressive sarcasm; so if it isn't in your taste then you clearly won't enjoy it. I highly suggest to avoid taking younger viewers. The film delivers to both those that enjoy the immature types of humor and those that like the sophisticated hidden humor (you have to have some base knowledge to understand the jokes). The reason for the high rating is the films use of personification; if you're well educated in the sense that you understand different cultures then you'll definitely laugh at some point.The plot isn't all that great as it's a search for knowledge type so the searching part is what is typically hard to illustrate in films. All in all, this watch could be added to your itinerary and compliment an easy going night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Sausage Party", starring the voices of Seth Rogen-The Neighbors movies, Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy; Kristen Wiig- Ghostbusters_2016, Anchorman 2:The Legend Continues; Bill Hader- Trainwreck, Pineapple Express and Salma Hayek-The Grown Ups movies, Wild Wild West_1999.A lot of people will gripe about movies, saying there are too many super hero movies or too many sequels......basically that there isn't anything original out there to see. Well, your gripes have been heard because this movie is really different and completely original. First of all, just because it is animated, doesn't mean it is for the little kiddies because it's NOT for kids. There is language, violence, drug use and even sexual content. It is from the mind of Seth Rogen-I read that he has been trying to make this movie for years. Seth plays a hot dog named Frank that has been led to believe-as well as all the other foods in the store-that when he is picked to go home with a human, it means he is literally going to heaven. Kristen is a hot dog bun, Salma is a taco and Bill is a bottle of liquor named Firewater-he is an American Indian. Circumstances happen that lets Seth discover the truth, that they are taken to be eaten by the humans and so he feels he must spread the word to all the other foods. A lot of the humor is crude and not for everyone but if you are looking for something a little different, you might be pleasantly surprised. It's rated "R" for language, violence, drug use and sexual content-there is even an orgy-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 29 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Foodfight Should Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, to any parents looking at this page, DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THIS. It may look like your typical kids' movie, but trust me, it's NOT. If you know this is rated R, and think your kids are mature enough to handle what Sausage Party has in store, oh boy, you are WRONG. I was barely even able to handle it, and I'm 21! Anyway, when I saw the trailers for this film, I was beyond excited. I was thrilled to know that an animated adults film would be in theaters. The animation looked great, the story had promise, and the humor especially got my attention with how funny it seemed. So, what did I think of Sausage Party? Well, it was great! The animation was almost up there with Pixar. Almost. Some of the characters looked a bit generic, but I wasn't expecting Pixar quality. I was just expecting a good film, and indeed I got one. Not only is the animation good, but the typical story of things coming to life when humans aren't around was taken to a whole new level. I liked how the food really was alive in front of humans, but they couldn't see the food alive unless they were on drugs. Bath salts, to be more specific. The humor.....it's definitely not for everyone. If you're easily offended by racial jokes or sexual jokes, this is NOT your movie. They throw almost every racial stereotype at you, and there is A LOT of sexual content. A lot of the jokes the movie had to offer had me and my boyfriend laughing hysterically. We've already seen a few of Seth Rogan's movies, so we're all too familiar with his comedic style. Most of the characters were enjoyable to watch. My personal favorite was Barry the deformed hot dog. While I'm not too big of a fan of Michael Cera, I noticed that he wasn't his typical, awkward self in this role. He wasn't as soft spoken, and delivered some pretty hilarious scenes. Teresa Taco is a close second. She brings some funny lines into the film, and we see that she's not that soft of a taco. XD I was surprised to find out that Alan freaking Menken did the music for this film. ALAN MENKEN! The man who wrote the songs for The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Tangled! Disney MOVIES! The very first scene in this movie is a musical, and boy, does it give off a Disney feel. Only, a more adult Disney feel. The song is hilarious, and does a great job of giving off the tone of the movie. The violence in this movie is done HILARIOUSLY. The way the food is torn apart, and the battle with the humans toward the end nearly had me rolling on the floor with laughter. I also admire how smartly written this film was. Yeah, this isn't just a raunchy movie. This movie tackles some serious topics, mainly religion and beliefs in general. Some of it can be subtle, and some of it is obvious and in your face. But overall, the message is strong, and needs to be heard within today's society.I don't have too many issues with Sausage Party. The cursing becomes stale after a while. It was funny hearing a talking piece of food say "fuck" after a couple times, but then it started to get a bit annoying. Almost every sentence in this script has "fuck" in it. I get that this is an adult movie, but not all adult movies rely on curse words to be funny. I found the main characters of Frank and Brenda to be a tad bit generic and boring. They weren't terrible characters, but I've seen them done to death in other movies. I personally liked the side characters more than them. The humans had odd designs, and I didn't feel they were creative enough. But then again, we're supposed to focus more on the food than on the people, so I can forgive that. The ending, however..........was cringe-worthy. I know people often say it's the funniest/unforgettable part of the film, but for me, I felt it was unnecessary and was only there for shock value. I was definitely shocked, and I found it difficult to watch. I guess since I'm not as into sexual humor, and it came out of nowhere for me. I wasn't expecting a taco to lick a bun's p***y and have three guys around them jacking off. I kid you not, that's what happens, and there's more that I will not mention. I will say that I cannot look at a bagel the same way again.So, while there are a few nitpicks I have with Sausage Party, I found it to be a very enjoyable movie. It was fun, and very well written. There haven't been many good animated films out this year. But ones that were good, like Zootopia and Finding Dory, didn't provide as much humor. It was very nice to see an animated film this year that was not only good, but very funny as well.By the way, if you're not sure what the title of this review is referring to, Foodfight is a CGI animated movie that also takes place in a supermarket, but instead of talking food, it's talking food mascots. It's considered to be one of the worst animated films to ever be made. Foodfight and Sausage Party have a bit in common, particularly the ending scenes with the characters from the market battling the villains. Only, Sausage Party did it a WHOLE LOT BETTER. If you're curious about Foodfight, I'm sure you can find it on YouTube. But be warned. It may be a lot more tamer than Sausage Party, but it is seriously a bad movie. A REALLY bad movie. It's a fact. I have yet to hear ANYONE say that it's good, well, without being sarcastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seth Rogen has done it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say it's about a 50/50 between people who would find this movie offensive and not humorous while other people would find this hilarious and creative. I personally found this movie hilarious and met my expectations. The voice acting was on point, the jokes for the most part were creative although I felt they overused sex jokes(the ending is basically 10 minutes of food porn) and the plot was a bit all over the place. If you enjoy adult cartoons such as Family Guy or South Park then you'll get a kick out of this movie. When you think "this is a Seth Rogen movie" you should think of Pineapple Express, This Is the End, The Night Before etc.. just like those movies, this movie includes a lot of swearing, sex jokes and drug jokes.Overall I would recommend this a friend that isn't overly sensitive and can keep an open mind, and was worth the $12.49.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the preview for this movie and had to see it. Saw it on opening weekend and the movie was more over the top than what I was expecting. The humor was dumbed down, from sex jokes to religion/race jokes, and finally about drugs. The end result was the most that I've laughed in a movie theatre in well over a decade, and the majority of the full theatre was also laughing hysterically. This movie will get a lot of complaints from prior who will want something deeper and meaningful, out the whole animation fiasco that's going on. At the end of it all this movie gets a 9 from myself as it is a solid and entertaining movie in my book.</fullReview>

Food are alive in this! So I went and saw it and it was pretty good! There was a lot of cleverly written messages in this film that made you stop and think about it in society and in our world. The jokes in this film are funny and you can't help but laugh at the things that the characters get into.

So I brought my wife and we loved it. It was much better in theaters because all of the people laughing around us made it all the more enjoyable. (especially a scene at the end)Without spoiling anything, the animation was great, the voice acting, characters, story, and above all writing. Seth Rogan, Evan Goldberg, and Jonah Hill hit it out of the park. I really enjoyed this film. Again, everyone should consider going in theaters. I never see comedy in theaters but it made it better. This is definitely one of Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's best. Absolutely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Crazy at the same time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been to my local cinema on Friday this week and ever since I saw the trailer I was rather interested in seeing this film with its concept and creativity. You could say 'What if food have feelings!' which is based upon the meme when 'Inside Out' came out in 2015 by Pixar. The movie is both funny with its R rated humour (or MA 15+ here in Australia) and crazy as well. It's a typical Seth Rogen film with his jokes about sex, drugs everything you see in one. Although I'm glad it's not about a sausage having sex with a hot dog bun and now he has to be a father, since there were two of those made by Rogen in the past; 'Knocked Up' (2007) and 'The Night Before' (2015) although for the latter it wasn't the focus but it still has that Rogen element. Although with that idea with food it would be pretty disturbing. The structure of the story was very good and the use of the characters were good too, they had a purpose to be part of the feature and they don't come off as pointless. The douche character was funny within the story with his jokes but I think they should've cut him out. The orgy scene though was very disturbing but as I said before it was a Seth Rogen film but it was also funny as well. The fourth wall joke at the end too was kinda pointless and didn't add much. Maybe it opens up as a sequel I don't know. Maybe they should've kept it as a post credit scene. It's funny though that the director, Greg Tiernan, in the past had directed the episodes and CGI specials of Thomas the Tank Engine. How funny is that! In the end the movie was good but I don't consider this to be the best animated film in comparison to other ones. It's funny, it's clever and it has messages about racism and different beliefs. Maybe this could lead to other CG Adult animated films but who knows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the story of how food learned the truth of their fate and when they fought back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was all just a dream. One day, in the great beyond, the place outside the supermarket doors, Frank would finally be between Brenda. Oh, he has dreamed of it so long, being between her buns, and she has dreamed of having him inside her. But then Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) ruins everything. He plants the idea in Frank's head that the great beyond is a lie and as he attempts to commit suicide Frank saves him and Brenda tries to save Frank from falling. Alas, Honey Mustard falls to his death and alongside Frank and Brenda, many other food items meet end up on the floor and fear that now they may never meet the great beyond.But alas, there is hope! All Frank and Brenda need to do is stuff themselves in another package. Nevermind they have to trek the floor and will likely be dirty because they must meet the great beyond by any means necessary. But Honey Mustard's last words live on. In fact, they haunt Frank so much that he seeks out Firewater (Bill Hader) to learn the truth. Something he, nor his fellow food items, are ready for.Commentary43 times. I laughed 43 times during this movie. I laughed to the point is hurt a little bit. Yet, at times I felt bad about laughing for while the food puns, like the one Douche (Nick Kroll), did were hilarious, most of the jokes were at the expense of food with various ethnicities. Jewish and Arabian jokes were in full force, alongside stereotypical Black jokes, Native American jokes, and there is even German food which has a Hitler-esque leader.To say the least, while Rogen and company have always been vulgar, it does seem this movie kind of was digging at the bottom of the barrel. Especially since, while there was some attempt at social commentary with the war between Jewish and Arabian food, for the most part, this movie is just about making you laugh at stupid things. Which there is nothing wrong with, but is a bit disappointing since films starring Seth Rogen usually seem to attempt to be about more than just that.Things To NotePrepare to have your jaw drop as you watch a food orgy.Low PointsOne of the main things I've always liked about Seth Rogen films is that alongside a guarantee of laughter, there is usually some heart. You feel for the characters, see them grow, and it makes it so a sensitive soul may even get a little teary-eyed. With this film, though, the main objective is to make a funny, R-rated animated comedy. Yes, the food is being eaten and they look at it as murder. Yes, there is some attempts with the food to try to speak on racial and ethnic tension and how we should all work well together. However, you can't even say working in those topics and ideas was a secondary objective. If anything, it is like the thought came up, there may have been some discussion on how to pursue the complexities of all these different cultures, but at a certain point there was a deadline and they just decided it isn't worth exploring. After all, why ruin a politically incorrect movie with a bunch of kumbaya nonsense? My point is, the film meets its expectations of being funny, but I felt slightly disappointed by the lukewarm attempt to make this film about more than jokes. Something I feel is part of Rogen's signature style when it comes to films he stars in.On The FenceAs offensive as this can come off, one can argue that this goes by the Seth McFarlane style of comedy in which everyone is going to be aimed at and laughed at. Be it Mexicans and Hispanics, Black people, Jews, people of central Eurasian descent, Asians, gay people, and probably more, everyone is an equal opportunity target. Which doesn't necessarily takeaway from the tired stereotypes used in this movie, but who watches a comedy nowadays expecting them to be clean and inoffensive? Such a thing requires more effort and talent than most modern comedians have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor, sex, food, and social commentary all in one weird package.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting a raunchy, adult comedy with characters that are literally food. Surprisingly however, Sausage Party is much more than that; it weaves in a fairly deep commentary on religion and ideology and the influence that it has on both our perception of the world around us and how we treat those who are "different." None of the arguments or points of view brought up by the movie are anything new, but seeing these kinds of themes addressed in a movie where food items have sex with each other is an interesting experience to say the least. As for the comedy aspect of Sausage Party, I personally found it to be funny the entire way through. The movie earns its laughs through referential humor, clever use of animation, and by parodying the Pixar movie formula. That being said, Sausage Party is also heavily reliant on vulgar shock-humor and if that isn't your thing then you will probably hate this movie. This movie is not for those who are easily offended. If you are on the fence about seeing Sausage Party, watch the trailer. What you see in the trailer is what you're going to get - along with a strangely-placed commentary on faith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sausage Party</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party is the latest Seth Rogen project that has been on my radar since the concept was announced. Imagining a raunchy Toy Story with the brain of Rogen behind it was quite appealing to me, and this movie delivered on all cylinders.Not only is Sausage Party hilarious, it is also oddly philosophical. Following the journey of Frank (Rogen), the film delves into topics such as the afterlife and sacred texts. At times the film is as downright preachy as the fiery evangelicals that Rogen and Goldberg skewer, causing the film to get bogged down toward the third act due to Rogen obsessing over every flaw of organized religion. Overall Rogen ends the film on a more open minded note, redeeming the message he is so adamant on sharing.The true star here is the writing, as the film cleverly uses every food pun imaginable all while balancing it with a solid story. Inventive is the greatest compliment one can give this film due to its hilarious cast bringing to life a wide array of characters, withe Nick Kroll taking the cake as the most fitting voice casting choice. Although falling flat on a number of jokes, the film picks itself back up quickly for a doozy of an ending that anyone watching this film will never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prioritizes Crude Humour Over Plot, But Does Crude Humour Well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party is a prime example of doing Crude Humour right, in that it's not necessarily the jokes themselves that are funny, but the source of said jokes. The creators were onto something when they decided using food and condiments as the characters, as due to this separation from reality, the creators could get away with creating one of the most incredibly sexual, crude, violent and drug fuelled comedies I've ever seen, all with just an R-Rating. The crudeness of humour, while different stylistically, is definitely on par with films like Team America or the South Park film, perhaps even more so.My main issue with this film is the plot structure. The first trailer to this film (the one that first drew my attention) is structured very differently from the final product. The trailer implied a sudden and almost unexpected ramp from kid-friendly romp to food-related horror. However, the film showed us the violence and sexual innuendos from the get go, making the scene from the trailer less impactful and shocking than it could have been.The film also relies heavily on racial stereotypes. I personally don't mind this in particular, at least within this film's context, but it's something to keep in mind. Each respective food-type represent a very stereotypical member of the culture of origin (Taco=Mexican, Bagel=Jew, etc.). This film is very irreverent and unforgiving in this regard, so if you are particularly sensitive to such subjects, you won't like this film.I personally also had a problem with a couple of scenes that could be interpreted as 'rape'scenes. These scenes aren't particularly made fun of, but the mere fact that its food and condiments that are doing these things makes it perhaps less serious on the get-go than it should be.Overall this is a really good comedy, and I enjoyed watching it. However, it's a film that is deliberately trying to offend your sensibilities, and it won't pull any punches. Take that as you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely an Original Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you want about this movie but at the very least acknowledge that this is a creative story. Sausage Party is about a sausage that learns the true fate of all the food that resides at Shopwell. He must convince his girlfriend as well as everyone else the truth before it is too late. While all of this is going on a douche wants to seek revenge on the sausage and his girlfriend. There is not much of an intriguing plot to the story. What the movie does have is many funny gags and jokes to keep the viewer entertained throughout. These jokes are however pretty dirty and vulgar and will make you think "did he just say that?". This movie is certainly not for kids or adults who dislike heavy amounts of violence and sex in their movies. This movie also really focuses on religion to the point where you are about to say enough, we get it. It didn't get under my skin like so many other reviewers on this site. I still found myself enjoying most of the banter though. This movie will offend a lot of people much like Seth Macfarlane's projects. If you enjoy shows like Family Guy and American Dad you will definitely really enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So hilarious, So so funny, great, great comedy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the strangest animated movie I've ever seen as far as the animation is concern. It's very straight forward. What Seth Rogen does with this film is take the traditional archetypes of cartoons and animation and puts a hard R spin on it, with some of the most out there jokes you could only get away with by animating food. No sexual undertones, everything was pretty out in the open.Truly from the makers of This Is the End as it stars most of the cast of that movie (minus Jay Baruchel) and adding such voice talent as Ed Norton, Salma Hayek, and Kristen Wiig.Seth Rogen plays the voice of Frank, part of a pack of sausages, Frank's world is no bigger than the isle he lives in. He spends his life waiting for the moment when the gods will select him to travel to the great beyond so that he can finally "enter" Brenda, a hot dog bun that happens to be his girlfriend. however, Frank discovers that the great beyond is not the paradise that was described.It's a bit disturbing. I'm use to Disney's anthropomorphic ducks, and got use to talking cars in Pixar's Cars, and even though I was raised on Duck Tales, It has not stop me from eating duck. This is different. This movie is basically telling me that bread and vegetables are alive, which means I can't eat anything. It's weirdly hilarious watching a a half eaten cookie cry because someone took a bite out of it.Like a typical cartoon, Sausage party has a hidden agenda, with all the foods being separated in isles that represent the culture that they belong to, the different food has to work together and get past those differences in order finish their quest to discover what the great beyond is all about, which is the second agenda as the movie does point out the oddities of religion in a cleaver way. It's so funny, there is far too much to point out cause it all made me laugh so hard (Although, Nick Knoll plays the voice of a Douche, and it was gut busting).Not since This Is the End have I laugh so hard at a Seth Rogen movie, It's definitely worth seeing.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Sausage Party' is an outrageously funny animated film that will leave many feeling awkward and uncomfortable.Seth Rogen and the incredibly talented cast ensemble, create an original idea that exceeds all boundaries. Fuelled by sex, drugs, violence and offensive language, the film provides audiences with a free flowing and unique story. Despite the offensively crude humour, the film still manages to tie together an underlying theme of faith and perspective, resulting in an overall fascinating spectacle. Throughout the in depth story, audiences are also hit with some big laughs making it a lot of fun and well worth your time. If you enjoyed the trailers, you are more than likely to enjoy the film.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was billed by one reviewer as the 'Team America' for this decade. I don't even understand the comparison. Team America was hysterically funny but this is complete tripe. This 'comedy' is the most unfunny thing I've ever seen. Even the idea of talking supermarket products is more lame than snakes on a plane.I can't understand why this film even has six stars out of ten, are people stupid or what? How does pointless swearing interjected into every sentence suddenly make everything funny? How are stupid racial stereotypes funny? I'm a talking bottle of chili sauce, I have a Mexican accent and a bandanna and swear a lot, (sarcasm)'ha ha my sides are splitting'(/sarcasm).I urge you, don't waste your short and precious life watching this drivel, save it for a long haul flight or download it to your phone and watch it when you are having a turd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - creative but not quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, it seems like a pretty new and interesting idea to take a kids' themed movie and put an adult spin on it, but in reality it's been done before and more successfully. Sausage Party had its moments, but it's far from being a classic.Firstly, as you'd expect from the This Is The End makers, the voice cast is astounding - big names for pretty much every character! Sounds like a big deal, but it's actually just there to plaster on the posters and trailers, there's not much depth to the voices. It does fit very well with the visuals though - Rogen said the animation was intentionally less crisp and colourful than standard Pixar stuff, but it doesn't feel it; it just looks cheap and unprofessional. Which is great for quirky independent films, not big blockbusters as this is advertised as.All that said, the writing is great (except the constant F-bombs)! There are tons of brilliant visual moments, funny ideas and decent gags which are scattered throughout the 90 minutes. I guess the movie being in development for several years helps - more time to think of puns and jokes! That said, there are one or two I think completely missed the mark (the Hawking thing was pretty cringy, not funny).So with an interesting premise, decent story, witty script and stellar cast, you'd expect a lot more than it turned out to be. Sure it's entertaining, but there isn't the quality it needs to have. I smiled pretty much constantly, but rarely laughed out loud, especially at the OTT 'climax'. Good effort, worth a watch.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unorthodox comedy in recent history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Striving to offend as many minorities as possible without so much as a hint of subtlety, the Seth Rogen masterminded 'Sausage Party' is a razor-sharp animated feature that proudly competes with 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' for the title of most distasteful R-rated cartoon. Everything from homosexuality to the Holocaust is targeted in this unashamedly disrespectful, though at times somewhat profound, mockery of Disney and Pixar's finest.Likely originating from the dulled neurons of a particularly stoned Hollywood actor, this film wears its influences proudly with its constant riff on the animation format, right down to the Alan Menken musical number. The result is a bizarre, surreal experience that somehow manages to exist as both a racial commentary and a religious allegory.Much like Pixar are consistently able to get so much mileage out of a single premise, 'Sausage Party' wastes no time in reeling out pun after pun, meaning that for every joke that doesn't impress, there is one mere seconds away that is bound to stick the landing. There are far too many visual gags to appreciate in one sitting, and chances are you'll be laughing so much that you'll miss many a good line.Rogen's associated acts, as per usual, are on board either as an effort to establish a stellar billing or merely because its convenient, and this reviewer is inclined to believe that it's the latter. Ultimately there is no real charm to the casting; whereas the relaxed nature of these performers essentially playing themselves worked in 'This Is The End', here it is more of a distraction. It speaks volumes that, apart from Edward Norton's standout as a Jewish bagel, the only other player seemingly having fun with their role is one of the storyboard artists.In a bold effort to be thoroughly crude and overly offensive, 'Sausage Party' succeeds in abundance by throwing everything including the kitchen sink at the wall and watching what sticks. The end product is the most unorthodox comedy in recent history - a simple barrel of laughs that still manages to leave you scratching your head at the end - but it's also some of the best work that Rogen and his contemporaries have ever put out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five-Word Review: Dumb, Funny, Sometimes Cleverly Subversive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have carved their own niche of American comedy films close to the Apatow brand but more crass. The roster that includes Superbad, Pineapple Express, and This is the End now adds Sausage Party, a decidedly adult-oriented comedy designed to offend and shock, insulting just about every race and belief imaginable. Little would you expect it could also make you think at times. A starry cast supports this animated riff on Pixar stories such as Toy Story, with the likes of Rogen, Edward Norton, Michael Cera and Kristen Wiig lending their voices to the story of sentient foodstuffs discovering that their 'gods' are actually humans who kill and eat them.Sausage Party often feels like two films in one. On the superficial level it is a dumb, crass, raunchy sex comedy with talking, orgy- loving food characters to appeal to the same stoner crowd as Pineapple Express. On another level, it is an intelligent and well- observed social commentary with witty takes on current social issues related to religion, race, sexuality, and world conflict. This is the film's strength and flaw. The worst of the film is when it is being too dumb and juvenile, with punchlines extending to nothing more than a blurted profanity, a lazy racial slur, or a sex joke that would make a 13 year old laugh. Too much of the film is like this, and a probable sequel would be much improved by focusing up and being less immature.Nevertheless, there's a lot that's funny in Sausage Party. Some of the parodies are on the nose - including excellent riffs on Saving Private Ryan, The Terminator, and, in one grotesque scene, Ratatouille. The situations the foods find themselves in are often very clever - a bagel and a lavash personify (foodify?) the Israel- Palestine conflict, and the main hot dog bun wants a bigger role in life than to just be filled by a sausage. Meanwhile, the voice cast is superb. Nick Kroll (Parks and Recreation's Douche, in a similar role) expertly plays a rapey gymbro character. Norton is unrecognisable as the Jewish 'Sammy Bagel Jr.', while Rogen, Cera, and Wiig are all stellar.Overall it's a funny film that is worth a watch, and is a nice counterpart to similarly plotted animated films aimed at kids, such as Toy Story. It just feels like it could have been better at times; hopefully the sequel can combine this film's strengths with some improvements. 67/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Sausage Party (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Bill Hader, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Paul Rudd. Plot: Shopwell's supermarket is full of happy groceries, waiting to go to the 'Great Beyond'. But one day they discover evidence to suggest there is a much darker future in store for them.In the original Shrek, the Gingerbread Man is tortured by the malevolent Lord Farquaad. Dunked in milk with his legs ripped off, he's threatened with even worse bodily harm. "No, not my buttons!" he squeals. "Not my gumdrop buttons!" It's apt that Conrad Vernon, the man who both created and voiced 'Gingy', is also one of the directors of Sausage Party. Because, like the scene described above which is arguably the most violent that movie can get apart from the beer fight. This unlikeliest of summer-season animations is a weird hybrid of cutesy cartoon and horror flick, a tale in which awful things happen to sentient food products. It may be a weird hybrid between the two but it's both very very rude but very very funny in its use of random rudeness but that particular influx of randomness pulls through in what could be the greatest animation ever. It's arguably an intended spoof for the creators of Superbad Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen to make a mockery of all the animations that they love/loved as either children or adults. Our hero Frank (Rogen) who has unimaginable feelings for his bun-friend Brenda (Wiig, on top form once again, and also more confident than ever) and he shares his packaging with Barry (Cera, in his bravest role ever), and Carl (Hill, in possibly his shortest role ever as he doesn't last very long) see that life in the supermarket isn't quite what it seems, as Frank goes off in search for the truth. There is one point in this cutesy animation that makes it a creepy horror flick, because this also uses violence not the slapstick you normally get in films like this but guts out violence, in what could be described as the most violent scene in any animation ever. Beyond all the Pixar-like feelings this film will give it is nowhere near child friendly but with its charm and vulgarity it shows that adults can love animation too. What if the premise of a film like Toy Story, in which inanimate objects come to terms with the meaning of their existence, was pushed to its logical dark-as-hell conclusion? There is an increasing amount of glee in Sausage Party (a tale about pork that is more sex-obsessed than Porky's) as it heads towards its demented denouement. Brought to life by sub-Pixar but decent CGI, as it bustles with anthropomorphic edibles. There is a tomato voiced by Rudd, a sultry taco with the tones of Salma Hayek and even a Hitler-esque sauerkraut shouting "exterminate the juice." In case how man food based puns there are; the answer is a lot. At first though it seems that, that is all this seems to offer, with enough raunch to make a beetroot blush. Gradually, though, this reveals itself to be a bold piece of work with some rather big ideas. The return of a panicked jar of honey mustard (Danny McBride) to the store, raving about the abuse meted out to food items by humans, triggers an existential quest for Frank to go on and he goes to extreme lengths (pun intended) to search for the truth. There is a concept of organized religion that is explored, as the lone sausage tries to convince his blissed-out companions they not be headed for a glorious after life, but rather a knife-assisted oblivion. Even the Israel/Palestine conflict is riffed upon, through the unlikely medium of a relationship between a lavish (David Krumholtz) and a bagel (Edward Norton, doing a big, goofy impression of Woody Allen and just about stealing the show). There are smarts to Sausage Party that are well-concealed between layers of utter filth, which ramps up and up until a late set-piece that will likely make you choke with laughter: think Caligula re-enacted by condiments. Bringing to mind a go-for-broke vibe of South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, the final reel unleashes debauchery and mayhem of a kind that makes you wonder if a studio exec ever checked in on the production. There are some barren bits ? there is a villain that is an actual douche (Nick Kroll) who's more loud than funny, and some of the gags have the feeling that the writers got them from a box of Christmas crackers ? but Rogen and Goldberg have succeeded in cooking up something truly original. Also in its incredibly short run time it delivers laughs out the whazoo, rudeness and food related violence and sex. The finale, meanwhile, suggests yet another Meta sequel could be on its way. It leaves us to believe what these sausages could get up to next. You may even forgive it for being incredibly short. It's nice to see Seth Rogen on top form once again.Verdict: It sounded like the dumbest movie of all time, but it's actually smart, subversive and packed with famous voice, saying wonderfully unspeakable things. In fact, it's a banger.8/10 balls out entertainment.</fullReview>

Or South Park with more surreal stuff. If you remember some of that humour of tose, crank it up a bit, add swearing and randomness, you're getting there.It's good.It's a bit crass, but if you were anything like our cinema audience today, different scenes will appeal to you more than the others. For my sins, the street scenes I thought were the funniest. I'd like to think I'm cerebral but that's gone now.It's funny.OK, it's got a few sly jokes about religions in there - 1 star reviews on IMDb would've been flying around for the Life Of Brian because of similar mockery had IMDb been around in the 70s - but it's got just as many gay characters - gay food! - being provocative, it's not all god-bashing filth. It's gender-bashing filth too. It's not all about you God!Look, take religious intolerance and homophobia out the question.This film has Edward Norton as a bagel, called Sammy Bagel Junior. That's funny.And.It's clever.Come on, Saving Private Ryan references? Slasher movie references? Top Gun references? Pixar references? References to their own previous movies?Can you remember how excited we all were about the Simpsons movie? It was Under The Dome with Homer and it disappointed.This is good, clever, silly, irreverent, blasphemous (perhaps) and did I say funny?It's such an easy, flippant thing to say to people who have serious issues with religious debate, or sex, or swearing, or decency to say lighten up.But, lighten up. It's a party!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, it doesn't purports to be something it's not, a very direct "straight to your face" movie which is not afraid to slay certain cultures and criticize them at the same time, as an a Jew and an Israeli I find Seth Rogan's humor towards Jews very funny, loved when the so called "Nazi" Mayonnaise sang about killing the "juice" (Jews) for example and I can testify that the entire crowd in the movie theatre shared the same reply of laughter after this joke.I loved the way they reprimanded about the Israeli- Palestinian issue, the Israeli is represented by a begal and the Palestinian is represented by a lfa (taboon food), the Israeli was described as a vulnerable pacifist while the Arab was described as an aggressive and arrogant food.The Mexican tacos and tequilas were expressing their willing to start a new life in another aisle. But most of the criticism were obviously pointed to the American culture of nowadays where the sausage and the bun just can't wait to finally have an intercourse, the bun is very judgmental of her shape and body and always wonder if she is not as pure as she was when she was in the packing.In summary, I love racial and cultural jokes and that's what I was laughing about in the vast majority of the movie and I can't say that one of the last scenes where the foods, alcoholic beverages and the hygiene products had sexual intercourse didn't leave me traumatized, it took my innocence away.I enjoyed the movie as it gives you a decent break from reality and life and just let focus on the struggle of the living supermarket products to exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but not nearly as funny as I wanted it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem that I had with this movie is that while there were plenty of jokes that landed, they were few and far in between for much of the movie. There are big stretches of the film where characters are saying really shocking and raunchy things, but none of them got laughs. It would essentially feel like I was watching a hot dog and a bun just talk about sex in really grave detail, and when it wasn't funny, it just kinda felt weird to watch. It takes up until the last 20 minutes of the movie for it to be consistently funny, and when it got there I was laughing pretty much non stop until the end, but up until then it would be like a laugh every now and again. The jokes that do land are really funny, and this movie is incredibly creative and clever in a lot of different ways, and I think the way they depicted food being killed was genuinely hilarious, but if you're going to make a film this raunchy and dirty it needs to be hilarious through and through, otherwise it just comes off as immature and stupid, which is how a lot of the film felt to me.</fullReview>

It was a waste of time to feed myself with such decadent garbage. I understand why America is quickly falling. This is the kind of movie that people want to see. Sadly it reflects the society.

It teaches us, how actually hard it is for us to show our unity and respect everyone with their life decisions. Of course there are many parts in the movie that you can find amusing and just laugh, yet the overall point is to make you realize that most people are scared of an unknown source of power that is going to punish them unless they 'act' in a way that this hidden power commands.It certainly worth to watch it and just ignore these religious people, who give it a low rating on purpose. Actually ignore those people in real life as well, they just don't like the idea of absolute freedom, which we currently need so much.I gave it 8 because the story needs a bit of improvement.</fullReview>

But this movie was over the top with profanity. If the foul language was not enough the humor was very offensive. I walked out of the theater feeling as if every race and religion should be offended. I mean it literally referenced the Holocaust in the first 40 seconds... The jokes were the types of jokes middle school aged children make and they were really not that funny. The last scene of the film was not needed as well. In fact it was quite awkward for everyone in the theater. Nothing like a group of adults watching an orgy of our favorite foods. All in all, I do not recommend this movie to any one. Do something better with your time. See a different movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the thing about propaganda films. If they are bad when Christians do it (God's Not Dead 1&amp;2, Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas) they are not going to be better when atheists do it. That's what it felt like watching this movie. Sausage Party is the God's Not Dead of an atheist propaganda movie. You are preached at for the entire run time on why it's bad to believe in a religion, while having to sit through painfully obvious jokes that don't land. (Oh the douche is a douche. Hahaha creative) Now before I'm accused of being some whack job fundamentalist let me say that I hate the other propaganda films. If I want to watch propaganda I'll go to the source and watch it. Sausage party is even worse because the trailer doesn't show how preachy it actually is.It's sad too because the cast is super talented too. (Kroll, Whig, Cera, Rogan, Hayak) which means that the fault lies solely on the writing which comes off more as a summer camp sketch than a movie. It relies way too heavily on recycled racist tropes that were done better in a 50s Looney Tunes cartoon. That mixed with just yawn worthy sexual innuendo makes the film unbearable and leaves you praying that the film ends soon. Which is ironic because that's the opposite of what the film wants you to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia...with Sex Jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The element of surprise is the cornerstone of comedy, and Rogen's crew has proved more than capable of catching us off guard with their brand of childish-adult humor (ie Knocked Up, This Is The End). Their latest venture, a bawdy animated-food comedy, finds them in an undeniably original medium. While much of the surprise in the individual jokes is gone in favor of broader concepts, Sausage Party still works, thanks to its comedic thoughts on faith and prejudice. It's a mixture of foody and racist puns that, while far from consistent, provide plenty of easy laughs. Sausage Party is the story of a gang of grocery items who go on an adventure of self-discovery and terrifying revelations. Its surprising main ingredient is its interest in social pigeonholing; think Zootopia without the cute animals and family-friendliness. Thoughtless religion and selfish bigotry are on abundant display, including a hilarious opening song (akin to the worst of modern evangelical music) and a straight-up explanation of our tendency to compartmentalize people with religion and race. Even with that self-awareness, its stereotypes are pretty tired (the bagel is a scared Jew, the taco is a sex-crazed Latino). Its racial typecasting isn't the only thing that pushes the envelope in this hard R. Cartoon parodies of violent horror and war films, drug-trip scenes, and a finale so hilariously / offensively vulgar I'm not sure I can even mention it; it's like these guys knew they could get away with more in an animated world. So while Sausage Party's inventive ideas never quite cook the jokes to their full transcendence, it's still pretty dang funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The animation is easy to watch with its unique look and feel, and the grocery puns are usually very clever and well thought-out, but besides that, Sausage Party is more gag-inducing than funny. And you can't help but think that it's merely for shock value.As thought-provoking as it intends to be, it's mostly in vain due to its irreverence. The items in a grocery store are all brainwashed to believe that humans are their gods, and that they must be "chosen" to reach the Great Beyond--which is unknown to any of them at the time.It's led by a sausage, Frank (Seth Rogen), who is slowly discovering the truth--that humans aren't gods, but monsters set out to murder all of them--but no one will listen to him. The storyline has promise, but much of the time is spent on extraneous sex jokes, for the sheer purpose of having sex jokes made by pieces of food.It has its moments, but you spend too much time cringing or laughing out of discomfort. And even within the ridiculous logic of the film, certain things still don't always make sense.Certain characters are enjoyable, like a chewed up piece of gum who cannot die because he's a piece of gum. But on the other hand, there's a villain (besides the humans) whose motives are foggy and entirely unconvincing.Honestly, the film's strongest aspect is making us truly want to know how it will end. But when it does, you're still not completely satisfied.Twizard Rating: 63</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Best, Craziest Seth Rogen' s comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched the movie, I was thinking about what will happen in the movie. Weed, drunk, party, and swearing. However, this one is way higher than my expectation. It's like the movie Zootopia.(not exactly) they create the world with different types of food which represent the different types one people on earth. The animation is good, but still need to improve on some of the detail. The thing I don't like is the still dialogue. Yes, it is a rated movie, but swearing in the movie is really not that funny anymore. And it does show the strong relationships between each other. That is why I give it a 6. But, still, I hope they make the second movie.I have seen lots of crazy Seth Rogen movies. Like he kills the leader of North Korean or He and his best friends try to survive the apocalypse. This movie is the craziest one they ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a crazy concoction of hysterical, ridiculous, absurd and a mocking of organized religion all rolled into one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's temper expectations here before reading any of the 1-star reviews... you undoubtedly have to be in the right state of mind to watch this movie and fully enjoy it. When I say right state of mind, that would imply a combination of pretending you are still 13 years old and smoking weed immediately before viewing the movie. If you're going to try to take this movie seriously in any way, you're going to hate it and feel like you wasted your time and money.So, the movie is quite clever, oddly charming at points, extremely unique and the baseline of the story, however absurd it may be, continuously flows.As far as the rating, it's a tough one because it can't really be compared head to head with any other movie. It's uniquely entertaining to the right person, its comedy is in its own realm, surely it's not worthy of a rating reserved for truly exceptional movies (7 or higher), but surely it's not worthy of a rating reserved for utter garbage (3 or less). I feel like just slightly better than average fits it quite accurately, nothing more or less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie has the same ingredients as the wiener. Full of pig lips and edible plastic fillers. Still, Seth Rogen and his crew certainly know how to exploit the dumb movie genre and line their pockets on this garbage. So how did I end up in the theater watching it? Because my nephew turned 17 and that's what he wanted to see for his birthday. Of course he loved it and I suspect many his age do. Goes to show how the Beavis and Butthead formula can just be recycled over and over again for each naive up and coming generation. A generation that seems to have less brain cells than the generation before them. Are we finally seeing the consequences of feeding our youth too much GMO foods? Perhaps. I also have to be completely honest, if I see Seth Rogen's name on a film, I avoid it like a bad taco. I just don't find him funny or appealing. In truth, I find his work mediocre and banal. So I'm bias toward anything that has his name on it. But even so, the film still sucked.... big time. It's not even a film, it's a ridiculously awful cartoon! Full of old tired jokes and clich humor.For those of us who've been around long enough to recognized a silk purse on a sow, all I can say is:For the love of all that is sacred, stop this ignorant madness. Just stop it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one to shy away from adult humor. This was not humorous. Not even remotely funny. I kept thinking it would lead up to some redeeming quality, but the pit in my stomach just grew deeper with each minute that laboriously ticked by as I realized this dirty diaper of a film could not be redeemed. The plot went from bad to worse, and then downhill from there. They scraped the bottom of the slime from the bottom of the barrel and decided that it wasn't filthy enough. Crass and vulgar are okay, but this was also artless. They left nothing to the imagination. There was no subtlety or room for audience interpretation of any of the dim, witless drivel they call humor. If you blew your infected-sinus nose onto the filmstrip it would be worth more. I'd pay double the ticket price to unwatch this tripe, and I'm truly thankful that it was so unmemorable. Consider yourself warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude Comedy, but Original Spin. It hits the target audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mission, write a review. The movie: Sausage Party. Robbie K here, and I'm back with another assignment to give you the 411 on the latest movies to hit the theater. Tonight the latest animated "masterpiece" is my subject, one crafted by the masters of raunchy comedy. Let's get started.LIKES: ? Originality ? Clever writing with wit ? Killer Soundtrack ? Short run timeIf the trailers weren't enough to convince you, then let me assure you that Sausage Party certainly is a more unique film than most. The idea of food coming to life and navigating a supermarket is not something we get these days. Add on the sexual characteristics and personify to add depth to their characters brings even more shine to the movie. I mean making an antagonist who is an actual douche is new to me. And with originality often comes cleverness, which this movie manages to bring to the mix. There are plenty of movie references and stereotypical humor integrated into the movie, much of which is well times to have you laughing in your seats. I myself enjoyed seeing warzones unfold in Saving Private Ryan manners, or seeing science fiction movie plots breaking into the spot light. But most of you are probably looking for the sexual innuendos promised in the trailers and to your relief it delivers on its promise. The focus of the movie is certainly on promiscuous side with so many descriptions for sex jammed into the 90 minute run time. So many people lost it to the aggressive insults and descriptions for genitalia that it was sometimes hard to hear the movie. There were also plenty of cheesy puns thrown into the mix to relieve some of the dirtier comedy. And for the moments where they broke the fourth wall?that too was a very good choice.While you certainly don't care about soundtracks in a comedy movie, Sausage Party gets points for the songs they chose. Various classics over the last few decades grace the speakers such as Three Dog Night's Joy to the World, Meatloaf's song (sung by a meatloaf) and a few other tracks to fit into the deranged mood. It's fun, flashy, and a nostalgic twist to only amplify the comedy of this film and well placed throughout the movie. And did I mention that it is only 90 minutes long. A perfect run time to get the message across before going into the overdone territory. DISLIKES ? Disturbing ? Jokes that cross the line ? Some lazy dialogue ? Some tactics that went staleIf you didn't catch the trailers you might have missed some of the more graphic scenes of the movie. Seeing perishable characters be brutally dismembered while hearing screams of despair, anguish, and suffering drowning the theater certainly wasn't the most enjoyable thing to see. Some might find the destruction of food laughable, but the presentation was a bit more disturbing to me than anything. But these fail in comparison to some of the violent fates other characters fall into. Despite the corny, comical theme, those who cringe or feint of heart might want to steel themselves for the chaos at hand. And as for the orgy scenes, well seeing food do it really isn't my cup of tea. But if death and violence aren't enough to cross the line, then perhaps some of the more inappropriate jokes will do it for you. Our writers certainly set out to poke various snakes, making fun of various cultural references that had me sometimes laughing and other times wondering who it will set off. Surely many people will find this movie offensive, especially when customs and traditions are adulterated with sex and monogamy. I won't lie I laughed at it sometimes, but some of the things certainly hit below the belt. Throw in some lazy dialogue moments and you add further insult. Why cursing must become the key ingredient in a comedy, I don't know, but nevertheless Sausage Party doesn't hesitate to haphazardly add swearing to the point of getting annoying. As for jokes growing stale, surprisingly it doesn't happen much in this movie, but there are some gags that lose their punch. Random food popping up at their mentioning is one example, arrogant bragging of the douche was another. To their benefit though, the jokes were pretty well spread out and the short time prevented them from going too overboard with some of the jokes. VERDICT:It's hard to score this movie as it isn't the comedy I might prefer. However, keeping in mind its intended audience and joke style, I have to say the movie certainly delivers on its promise to be sexually slanderous and mind numbingly stupid. The story certainly isn't the greatest (or that strong to be honest), but this tale is certainly original in many ways and so creative. However, all the insults and disturbing moments, not too mention the cheaper, low key dialogue moments, take away things for me. So who do I recommend this movie for? Fans of Seth Rogen movies, those who can't get enough raunchy humor, or those who want to see food do it. Worth a trip to the theater? I have to say it is for the audience it delivers for, but hold out until the RedBox if you can wait. My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one will ever confuse Sausage Party with Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or Gone with the Wind, but nevertheless, it is a lot of (very mature) fun. I still prefer Superbad and the Interview to Sausage Party, but this new release is an improvement of other Seth Rogen works such as Pineapple Express and the Neighbors.One thing Sausage Party that I enjoyed is how it handles the idea of faith and religion. There are surprisingly profound tidbits intermingled between all the hot dog and bun jokes. As for the jokes, not all of them are original and some of the ones that are become a bit overused and forced. At the same time, I think some of the point of the good jokes is to poke fun at bad stereotypical jokes.Overall, Sausage Party succeeds due to its sheer absurdity and the outrageous originality of its initial idea and deserves 3 out of 4 hot dogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a message for people who condemn others for their beliefs. Unfortunately, those people would never watch this movie. And that's too bad. Just because you believe a certain way doesn't make others wrong. And it doesn't make those folks beliefs the right and only way.That out of the way, I could not stop laughing at the action and animations. The art work was awesome. The action was well-paced. The dialogue was outrageous. There were a few lulls for me, but when the action picks up, its like a roller-coaster. I hope there is a part 2. Or another full-length cartoon for adults.It great adult fun. Glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous in the best possible way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The R-rated movie for adults is a rare treat. While Ralph Bakshi made a name for himself with a series of adult animated movies (some of which were actually rated X) in the 1970s and 1980s, very few film directors are willing to produce such crude material in an art form that is most commonly viewed as for kids only. This may be partly due to fear over what the impact such a project could have on the trajectory of one's career, but it probably has more to do with the fact that R-rated feature films don't make any money at the box office, with the exception being amazing South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut. With a budget of only $19 million, the Seth Rogen produced Sausage Party may not be an expensive endeavor, though it certainly seems like it could have been a risky one for his career. Lucky for him, the results are a pretty strong success. An absolutely filthy, incredibly juvenile, and intentionally offensive romp, Sausage Party is just about as bizarre and bold as any movie released by a major studio this year. But more importantly, it's also very, very funny.Sausage Party is not a ground-breaking comedy classic like the South Park movie, but it's also unlike anything one is likely to see in the next decade. Sausage Party can be seen as a not completely subtle satire of the Disney/Pixar pictures of the past two decades, though even for someone who has never seen a Disney/Pixar film, Sausage Party is probably guaranteed to create hysterical laughter at least a few times, especially for fans of any of the cast members. Seth Rogen voices somewhat of a typical Seth Rogen character, albeit one that is a sausage. As one might expect from a Rogen picture, Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are put in as the best friends, also sausages. James Franco is Druggie, whose character name is pretty self-explanatory. Meanwhile, Kristen Wiig is Rogen's romantic interest, a hot dog bun. All of this is twice as outrageous and stupid as it sounds. However, it's also more clever than it should be most of the time, and always fun to watch, even during scenes that are rather gross and violent. Those scenes, as much as they might seem be in the film for shock value, are also highly effective. I never knew what was coming during Sausage Party and frequently found myself surprised by what would happen next, which is something I can almost never say about studio comedies.As great as Sausage Party can be, it unfortunately can't sustain itself completely for its short 89-minute running time. While never a chore to watch, the last 15-20 minutes aren't quite as good as what came before it, and the movie kind limps to its conclusion. The ending could have been a lot better, although it by no means destroys the overall enjoyment of the film. Just like most animated features these days, the end of Sausage Party hints at a sequel. Sausage Party will no doubt be successful given its small budget, though I hope there isn't a follow-up. There is no way Sausage Party 2 could feel as fresh and surprising. Sausage Party itself may not hold upon repeat viewings as so many of the jokes are based on shock value. But based on my one viewing so far, Sausage Party is ridiculous in the best possible way, and one of the most entertaining movies of the summer. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party is an adult CGI animated comedy film. I'm a big fan of Disney Pixar animated movies and this film is a fun and enjoyable parody of them. Even though the humour sometimes felt forced, the film's message of self-discovery is what I believe holds it up.At "Shopwell's" supermarket, all the anthropomorphic groceries on sale dream of one day being picked by customers to be taken to their new homes. However, some of the groceries soon learn the terrible truth of what happens to them once they have been purchased by humans. A sausage named Frank (voiced by Seth Rogen) attempts to warn his fellow Shopwell's grocery items of their inevitable fate before it is too late.Filled to the brim with crude jokes and political incorrectness, Sausage Party is an enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films. The animation was nice to look at and definitely on par with most of today's CGI animated features. The jokes didn't always work, but the ones that did had me laughing out loud. This film is not for the easily offended and definitely not for children, but if you enjoy the comedy of Seth Rogen and his stoner buddies, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

The laughs span the entire irreverent joke spectrum and everything (including reality itself) get's the micky taken out of it.Do you find the idea of a used condom complaining about what the human gods made it do funny? Is the idea of a Jewish bagel and Palestinian Yemeni bread (or something) developing romantic interests over halal kosha to you? If so, you'll love this flick. If not, your sense of humour is too precious.It's inventive, funny and doesn't pick sides. If you are looking for a laugh, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was horrible. There was maybe one or two laughs thorough this whole movie. All the funny parts you've already seen in the trailers.A lot of their "jokes" are nothing more than dirty innuendos and a lot of "fuck this" "fuck that", and repeats this same formula over and over again to the point where you roll your eyes after each joke. At the end the movie degenerates into an orgy of one bad sex joke, quite literally. If people swearing non stop or dirty/sex jokes are your thing then this movie is for you. If you find you need actual humour and not some brainless crap then this movie is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Actually Pretty Simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Seth Rogen's brand of humor, then you'll most likely like this movie. Think of Superbad in animated form, but with more sexual innuendo...maybe.For people who like comedies that are actually funny and don't rely on their crudeness and foul language as the punchline to the jokes, then this probably isn't for you.The movie tries to be funny by simply being crude and foul. Crude and foul can be funny when used in the right context, but not AS the comedy of a movie. The "comedy" arch of the movie is in simply being crude with loads of cursing and references to sex and drugs.There is cleverness in the story, but it's just too bad that it got lost in what seemed to want to be the "shock" of being able to have an "R" rating.Overall, it's just an unfunny pile of garbage of a movie unless you are of the people who find funny in Rogen, Jonah Hill, and their brand of "humor". Then you'll probably love it.</fullReview>

Trying to shove politics into this movie was the biggest mistake. Putting in Christian morals was the second.The whole mechanism of the sentient food articles was not very well grounded either.

		<fullReview>this is yet another Bread &amp; Circuses type of movie where whatever crass and lowest-common-denominator attitudes and values held by most 12-40-year-olds are put in a blender and regurgitated. This time it's in the form of a dippy-ass animated story about supermarket food. Specifically, the love story between a hot dog and a hot dog bun. Oh, brother.Why does everything in Hollywood have to be so damned gay now? And I don't mean "gay" in a homosexual-bashing kind of way, necessarily (though I am sick of seeing homosexuality being put on a pedestal; I get it, some people are freaks, shut up!). I mean "gay" in a "banal, immature, and stupid" kind of way. The biggest "joke" in this movie is how the men are represented by hot dogs, and the women are hot dog buns. Huh huh huh how clever HAHAHA the hot dogs are penises, and the buns are vaginas HAHAHA holy sh*t go kill yourself.This is a propaganda movie that just vomits a nihilistic, crappy view of humanity in our faces. I'll save you the trouble: -sophistication means watching an animated movie with cuss words in it -belief in God is unconditionally backwards -recreational drug use is acceptable -sexual immorality has no consequences -homosexuality is acceptable and not weird or inappropriate, ever -humans are little more than their reproductive organs, -profane horse-sht makes a good movie because we're, like, breaking the rules.I remember when I was young and thought that Atheism and Subjectivism was the neatest thing in the whole world. Then I grew up and realized that they are mostly very juvenile ideologies that have such mass appeal only because they provide a compelling rationalization for unconditional selfishness. Yeah boo God and absolute morality... retards.I'll say it now. I don't like most young people because they are the kinds of shallow-minded idiots who watch and enjoy crap like this. They bitch about how religion is brainwashing, but then they totally see the media as a religion. They never use their minds to question the f@ggot-assed bilge being foisted on them by "entertainment" like this.This is propaganda. Good propaganda, but one that serves to kind of keep people in a state of suspended adolescence.It looked pretty good, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw a video on YouTube titled " Werner Heisenberg VS the New Atheist" and the content of that video summarizes my problems with this movie's take on religion and the Human condition. Anyone who finds this movie to be intellectual or thinks its commentary on religion is "deep" seriously has to lay down whatever substance they are on and actually read the history of religion.In terms of quality, this movie looks like the project of wealthy teens from the Hamptons tasked with making an animated movie on (new) atheism mixed with juvenile humour. The jokes in the movie are plain not funny and just made me cringe throughout the entire movie time. The humour is largely based on less than subtle dick jokes that one would hear in high school emanating from the class clown. I really find it amusing that grown adult film makers wrote and produced this "comedy" movie.Overall, I would not recommend buying a ticket at full price at the theater to watch this "comedy", just wait till it is on Redbox and rent it for a day or two. Trust me, there is really nothing to see here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly this movie was so sick. I watched the trailer, I knew there would be cussing and perversion-- but there was TOO much of it. I kid you not, 99% of every sentence in this film had an overuse of cuss words. The perversion was completely overdone and out of hand. It wasn't funny, just flat out disgusting. Save your money and don't watch it in theaters or on Netflix, just watch it online for free when it's out if you really want to see it... but I and there other 6 friends I went to see it with highly recommend you don't. The stuff they promote is sick. So corrupt. The first few minutes of the film you're fine, but get a little startled at the amount of cussing you hear. People who normally cuss don't even cuss that much, so it wasn't realistic. 20 minutes in and you're in utter shock by what you see. As the movie continues to progress, you'll find yourself horrified and struck by disbelief. It's awkward and so WRONG-- all of it! I mean you see rape here! Murder! Threesomes! Drug abuse! And let's not even get started about the blasphemy and complete disregard of faith in God. I walked out. I couldn't finish watching and nor did I want to. I deeply regret supporting this film by paying for it. It's offensive and dehumanizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny at times and filled with too much subtle anti theist propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I don't like organized religions and absolutely hate religious propaganda movies like "Gods not Dead" I was absolutely disgusted with the amount of anti theist propaganda that the writers sneaked into this movie. People go to comedy movies like this to laugh not to go and constantly be told their beliefs are stupid and they need to let go of them. If you're an atheist that gets off to the anti religion undertone of this movie and is currently reading this review saying "but people need to constantly question and be exposed to things that go against their beliefs" you need to stop being a hypocrite and look at a mirror. Imagine how angry and upset you would be if you went to go watch a comedy movie to get your mind off of everything that's going on in your life and the movie started trying to tell you why you should accept Jesus and believe in god and all the problems of the world are caused because people don't believe in god. If people wanted to challenge their beliefs or learn about the impact of religion on the world they would be watching a movie with a title like "Richard Dawkins: the Delusion of Belief" not a movie titled "Sausage Party" about talking food. So don't complain about movies like "Gods not dead" because of the amount of religion it shoves into people's faces if you're going to praise movies like this for shoving irreligion into people's faces.Also I think if the writers of this film spread out the use of the f word more and used it less frequently it would have had more of an impact when they did use it.</fullReview>

The sausage says there's no proof of God's existence (and I get that this is a comedy that pokes fun at society) but the writers completely ignore that fact that nothing disproves God's existence either. I'd argue that just the fact that we're here suggests that something created us. I think my biggest complaint about Sausage Party is that it depicts people who believe in God as stupid or in denial of what's wrong with the world- as people who choose to believe that God exists because they don't want to bear the "truth"- and I think that's disrespectful and just stupid. I get that the writers are trying to make fun of society, but they blatantly disrespect the very large portion of the population that believes in God and has concrete reasons to. I fully respect atheists and agnostics, but I just can't help but notice that this movie felt like it's purpose was to push Rogen's anti-religion agenda but add some fantastic humor to try and make it less noticeable, and that just rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or some lunatic that believes everything they hear, and I hope I don't come off as one, but the fact that this movie has such a blatant anti-religion message just ruined the humor for me. Thank God that this wasn't a kids movie- I wouldn't want to bring my children to watch this and then have them come out semi-brainwashed by the overall theme. I agree that you should have fun with your life, but that doesn't mean having sex with everyone all the time, using drugs, and not caring at all about yourself besides your sexual desires.PS: Although it was a bit unnecessary, that food orgy at the end was hysterical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Food is eager and anxious to be chosen from the supermarket shelves, to be taken to a supposed better place, unaware they are going to die on people's kitchen counters and stove tops.This film has its audience, fans, but I guess I'm not on of them, because I only had a handful of laughs from this. My favourite scene was the horror-tone moment when they witness some of their number being sliced, diced, and cooked by the girl, to their horror. Some of the gags were stoner material, and I'm not stoned, so I wasn't amused. The gross-out gags were hit and miss, but overall I kept wondering, "Where is this going?"The film is well animated, and that makes it worth watching at least once, as a rental, or on Netflix, at home, but if I was watching this at home, I might not have watched the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atheist Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer was funny. The entire movie failed miserably. If you enjoy anti Christian movies, this one is for you. Basically this movie ridicules everything about religious beliefs, God, purity, morals, anything related to being sane. I tried to like it but the heavy handed atheist theme ruined the entire movie. So happy I didn't waste my money on this filth. I thought from the previews it would've gone in a completely different direction. But the previews purposefully deceived everyone. Of course they wouldn't include the true intentions of the movie in the previews. If they did, not many people would be tricked into watching it. This atheist propaganda disguising itself as a comedy tries hard to push down your throat that all religious beliefs are dumb and everyone should engage in orgies. That's it. That is exactly what this "movie" is about. Total garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I want to say if you are a fun lover and animation movie fan then this is a fair choice for you. This is a movie with a good story, enough adult jokes, and a very good political message. It is a good combination of comedy and serious double meaning message. If you are confused about the theme then please don't listen anybody....just enjoy the fun.This is a story about some sausage snacks who lived in a supermarket and they just want to expand their experience and they wanted one of any customer choose them and bring them home. A hot dog sausage named Frank with his friends, want to warn his friends of their terrifying future, and in the process, wages war with the human race. The story is charming and the script is full of energy to give you the right humor. If the question is the story, I think this is good.Performance-wise Jonah Hill has done a very good job and Seth Rogen also has done a fair job with their voice. Rest of the cast is good. The storytelling style is nothing new. Sometimes I felt it is not new and Movie Like "cars" already use this strategy. So the style is predictable. First, 30 minutes the movie has horrible pace and the story is not gradually built but after all, pace is not bad. Animation quality is very good and the plot also holds some good point. The director duo Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon were trying to give you the fun and I think they are successful. Their effort was good but this movie could have been better if the directors would make some fast pace in the story. If you a fun lover then don't listen anything or anybody, Just enjoy the fun and you will not regret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was hoping for more....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Seth Rogen movies for the most part (Pineapple Express is one of my favorite comedies ever), but what the f*** was this? I had seen the trailer months ago and was really looking forward to this, but me and my wife were more disappointed than anything.The premise for the movie is a great idea and that's a huge part of what I figured would make this funny and different. You have a secret life of food story essentially, that has some pretty damn good animation, is a riff on Pixar movies and is made for adults. HOWEVER, this did not end up being all that funny or original unfortunately.It seems the creators just wanted to act like they were the first people to ever make an R-rated animated film......I guess they've forgotten about South Park and tons of other adult animated cartoons that have come before them that did it better? I think they wanted to try and rely on shock value, but this move wasn't shocking. Saying "s**t" and "f**k" in a cartoon isn't shocking and it's been done by South Park for a long time now. Hell, the South Park movie made fun of that years ago. If anyone remembers Conker's Bad Fur Day, they basically borrowed from the concept of having cute things saying and doing disgusting and sexual stuff. Again, not shocking, all been done before.The jokes for the most part were so predictable and just kept revolving around the same thing over and over again. You could see most of them coming a mile away. The ending food orgy scene would've been funnier if it wasn't so over the top. It just seems like most of the jokes were written for teenagers who think swearing is funny. Swearing within a joke can be really funny, but just swearing isn't funny or original or creative at all.I would also like to point out that when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh, have fun and just forget about the outside world for 1.5 hours (or however long the movie is); not be preached at or have theological bulls**t thrown in my face left and right. I'm not a religious person, but I also don't give a s**t what Seth Rogen does or doesn't believe in and I certainly don't want to hear about it in something that should be lighthearted and entertaining.I could keep going, but if you're reading you get the point. I will say there were a few positives. I did think the whole bath salt scene was really funny and that it made humans interact with food was also amusing. The opening song was really funny and there should have been more moments like that. Oh and Nick Kroll as a Douche was really funny too! I couldn't help thinking that after Parks and Rec he STILL ends up being a douche ha ha. He made me laugh the most and Seth Rogen just played Seth Rogen per the usual. The movie was mostly boring and not funny, but there were some funny moments. Not really worth watching though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sausage Party has it's delicious moments, even if the crass novelty becomes repetitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Animation has the ability to give live to things that we previously would have never considered. Disney and Pixar in particular have brought cars, toys, rats, bugs, fish, and robots a humanized life and a study on what their purpose is, now with thoughts and feelings. There's a magic within that, so it's not uncommon for other things we could explore to see what their perspective of the world would be like. For toys in Toy Story, it's a joy land of children and imagination, but with a dark side of childhood eventually ending. For bugs in A Bugs Life, it's more of a survival of the fittest as their several kinds of insects out there. How about food?Today's movie shows that food may have the worst when it comes to their purpose. Writer and actor Seth Rogan not only wanted to explore what that world of humanized food would be like, but to do in his adult context. R rated animated movies are a rarity, but it's nice to see a studio like Sony take a chance on a risk. You could even argue that because adult cartoons are more popular on television now, R rated animated films could have a bigger opportunity. Let's see if Sausage Party invoke more adult animated stories. In a market called "Shopwells", each morning opens with the food signing (it's made clear in the beginning that people cannot see them move or talk) about their desire to be chosen by the "gods" to be taken out of the store into the "Great Beyond". One area with all the forth of July food, contains sausages and buns. One sausage, Frank (played by Seth Rogan), along with Carl (played by Jonah Hill) and Barry (played by Michael Cera) are hoping to be chosen with a set of buns next to them, which contains Frank's girlfriend, Brenda (played by Kristen Wiig).When a jar of honey mustard commits suicide, this causes the shopping cart where the sausages and buns were chosen to collapse. This causes Frank and Brenda to slip out of their packaging, leaving them behind in the store while everyone else goes to the "Great Beyond". Frank and Brenda are told to go to a set of imperishable foods to learn the truth about their existence. Along the way, they encounter a taco lesbian Teresa (played by Selma Hayek), a Jewish bagel Sammy Bagel Jr (played by Edward Nortin) and bottle of Liquor Firewater (played by Bill Hader).I cannot stress enough of how important it is to understand that Sausage Party is not for children. I'm twenty-nine and I'm not old enough for this. I'm not even sure if my parents are old enough for this. There is so much swearing, violence, and sexual content (including a three minute food orgy somewhere), that Sausage Party has earned it's R rating and them some. Within all the crass is a well-written script that is sort of an analogy to real life religion. While I wouldn't call this movie an atheist story, I can understand that many people would be turned off.I can defiantly say it's a smart script, though I'll admit that the constant crass does wear off after a while. It's funny, but when your dialogue is almost nothing but swears, it makes for a repetitive attitude that I doubt the film is aware of. Story wise, it does feel a little stretched (and this is an eighty minute movie). Part of me thinks this might have worked better as an hour long special on Netflix, but you can still tell by the number of comedians in this along with some great animation that Sausage Party has it's moments.I'll give this five hot dog sausages out of ten. Sausage Party is an acquired taste movie, and though I might watch it once more, I can see a lot of people playing this at parties. Speaking of which, Sausage Party is an ADULT PARTY ONLY. LEAVE THE KIDS AT HOME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Absolutely Horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie, but I was horribly disappointed. There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. The "comedy" in this is purely profanity and terrible attempts at innuendos. This seems like it was written by a bunch of 5th and 6th graders who just learned what sex is.Also, a plot, an actual plot would have been useful. The "plot" this movie has is more of a plot device to allow more uses of profanities and sex jokes.Then there's the problem with the suspension of disbelief, which just is down right impossible in this movie. Food items can move and exist in the real world, but their movements are completely imperceptible to the people unless the people are high on bath salts? Then, suddenly, food can maim and/or kill them? How does that even work? Shouldn't the food have been able to do that either way? As for the food itself, some items are individually sentient (like the buns, hot dogs, and baby carrots), others are sentient as the collective (a bag of chips), and others are sentient in both stages (the Mentos and possibly pizza). Why does a bag of chips die but only individual carrots do? Also, at what point does the food become sentient? And how can items be pre-packaged, yet have no understanding of what happens to them in the outside world? Moreover, how exactly do they ignore what's going on in the deli or bakery? Do they ignore people "taste testing" grapes as well? I just don't understand how they can live in this "utopian society" where "everything is perfect on the outside" if they live in a place where they can witness their kind being destroyed.Beyond the suspension of disbelief, we come to the problem of sex. If you took sex out of this movie, you'd have a bunch of characters swearing and some "war zone" scenes. Everything else in this movie is about sex. I mean, the douche rapes 2 different characters, there's an all out orgy at the end, and every interaction at least hints at sex/rape/the "archaic beliefs surrounding purity."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ATHEIST EVANGELISM - Possibly the WORST Propaganda Movie I Have Ever Seen :-(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was little more than an atheist propaganda piece and was simply abhorrent.It cracks me up when I read reviews of Christian movies like "God's Not Dead" and see comments like, "If I wanted to go to church, I would go to church, not to the movie theatre", or, "Preachy to the extreme and mere propaganda", etc., yet reviews of this piece of cinema garbage known as "Sausage Party" are, for the most part, rating it highly.Let me be clear. Sausage Party is not a funny movie. It is not an entertaining movie. It's dull, rather humorless, boring and little more than a badly done propaganda piece of atheism evangelism in cinematic form. It's sort of like an atheist version of some of those rather horrid "Christian" films that have poor writing, are of poor quality and do little more than "preach".What is really sad is that Sausage Party could have been hilarious, and when I saw the previews, I thought it would be. Had the script stuck to telling an interesting and entertaining story rather than going on an anti-Christ, anti-God, anti-Bible, pro-hedonism idiotic rant, it could have actually been an entertaining and interesting movie.However, the entire point of this movie is to mock religion, blaspheme, offend religious people and try to "convert" everyone to being a pro-hedonism atheist.However ... I wouldn't even have as big a problem as I currently have with the movie had the actors and executives simply made it clear that this movie was made to mock religion and convert people to pro-hedonism atheism. In fact, I still would have went to see the movie, or at least rented it, just to see what was being promoted through cinema these days. However, all the previews I saw for this film made it seem like it was simply supposed to be a funny, scary and rather adult cartoon.It would be like Disney running previews of a new version of Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs that show it in a scary light and with an "R" rating. Many people would still go see that movie. However, if when they saw the movie they found out that the movie's actual goal was to promote homosexuality and hedonism by showing portraying the dwarfs as homosexuals who engage in wild orgies every night and Snow White as a lesbian who fornicates with witches, you better believe the masses would flip out and leave 1 star reviews until the cows came home.The simple fact is that this movie was dull and boring and that the actors and producers were extremely deceptive with the audience, thanks to the extremely misleading previews of this film.However, I will say one good thing about the movie. The script is so poorly written that while it's obvious the entire point is to ridicule God and religion and to convert people to pro-hedonism atheism, by the time one finishes watching it, it is so abundantly clear that pro-hedonism atheism is not only disgusting and something to be avoided like the plague, it is also idiotic and only a self-worshipping and prideful loon would actually choose to reject their divine Creator in favor of a hedonistic lifestyle and atheism.Of course, anyone who believes that "everything came from nothing" is scientific and more plausible than the Biblical account of creation, has abandoned sense, logic and reason long ago, in a quest to live for self and without rules. I pity such a person.Sincerely, Author Repen T. OrBurn</fullReview>

So i sat down cracked open a can of beer and lost 81 minutes of my day with sausage party. I lost time because the film is just awful the only funny parts are the parts shown in the trailer, from start to finish its such a massive let down and feels lazy. It has a decent cast but thats about as much as i can say positive about it, the plot and story is simple its about the secret lives of items in a grocery store from hot dog sausages to buns and everything else you can think of. They all live in hope of being picked up and took home not realising they will be killed and turned into a meal. They go on a adventure of trying to survive, the jokes are pretty desperate but i will admit the CGI is good. I would not rush to watch to watch this film, seth rogan has a certain type of humour and 1 in 4 films he does turns out to be good, but sausage party is not one of them.</fullReview>

We walked out of a 4pm showing today that had 6 other people in attendance. We did get our money back and warned the people standing around the booth to not waste their time on "Sausage Party", it's a total failure. It's made all the money it's going to make in this first week. I predict a 70% drop in attendance by it's 2nd weekend and 60-70% every weekend after that until it's out of theaters. If I had known this was a "Sony" movie I would never had taken my buddy to see it.

		<fullReview>I have a big sense of humor i like anything from Pink Panther to low brow stuff like Freddy got Fingered.Yet in this movie there was nothing good to laugh at just stereotypes about races political issues and sexuality, and they weren't even done in a humorous way. stereotypes and sex jokes constantly being shoved down your throat, one after another.You keep waiting for something to actually be funny but its not.I normally really like offensive dark humor stuff but this had no delivery.The only redeeming thing about this movie is all the gratuitous gay sex at the end and the premise of it.For those two things i leave a star.I didn't laugh a single damn time and the funniest thing had been spoiled by the commercial before I even watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Rogen, Goldberg, and Hill worked for eight years to get this, what is nothing more than a sweary spin on Toy Story off the ground. My only question is, why on did they bother?Life is good for all the food items that occupy the shelves at the local supermarket. Frank the sausage, and Brenda the hot dog bun, can't wait to go home with a happy customer. Their world comes crashing down as poor Frank learns the horrifying truth that he will eventually become a meal. After warning his pals about their similar fate, the panicked perishables devise a plan to escape from their human enemies......So it's the first ever adult CG film, and much like This Is The End, it's nothing more than a bunch of friends getting in a studio and swearing within an inch of their lives.It's as if the writers think that if you add profanity to the humour, then it will be at least 20% more funnier! and it truly doesn't. In fact, it becomes borderline offensive to the viewers intellect.The film is nothing more than stale toilet humour that was never funny in the first place, jokes about genitals, and don't forget the racism.Although the makers imply that its winking at the camera humour, the fact that Salma Hayek plays a taco, and other ethnicities play foodstuff from around the world, doesn't mean that it's okay to do it. It's like Rogen has been watching British seventies sitcoms and referenced these in the writing.Comedy is supposed to invigorate and energise you from all the fun you are having, not make you feel depressed and angry, much like this film made me feel.And just to top it all off, they mock the disabled, and end the film with an food orgy.Talk about all you can eat.The cinematic equivalent of finding a rotten cabbage in your fridge. It turns your stomach, makes you wince, and you'll wash your hands of it.Rotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half was't bad, second was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers, however I'd recommend reading it beforehand as the movie trailer gives no indication of the following.The first half of the movie wasn't bad, and many parts were rather comical. But later in the movie, roughly half way through or so, it took a drastic turn to human decapitation, mutilation, and killing. Also, towards the end of the movie there was a celebratory orgy scene between the various foods that was quite depraved, not to say the earlier stuff wasn't. I expected some of this with Seth Rogen being the main star, however nothing to this extent. Apparently I need to write a few more lines, I don't see why a short, concise review is frowned upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Waste Your Money on This Poor Product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about this movie is that the animation was really good for a second rate studio. It was very expressive and the designs were mostly great. And that just saddens me to imagine how much effort and many days of their lives the animators wasted making this. I also had no idea that Paul Rudd or Edward Norton could voice act. And then the positives stop. Every joke, literally every joke is either a pun about sex, or the punchline is, "Oh wow! An animated character is saying the F word! That's not supposed to happen! It's a cartoon! And that's not supposed to happen in a cartoon! It's just like...what?!?!? It's a cartoon! They aren't supposed to curse!!!!!!" Personally, I prefer jokes. I didn't laugh, chuckle, grin, or even sneer the entire duration of the movie. I held the exact same disappointed look from the second the first trailer started (Resident Evil 6), to the end of the credits. What you get in this movie is uncomfortable silence. I only heard one person laughing the entire movie, and my theater was full of about 30 other people. The only reason I can fathom people laughing at all the sex puns or the cursing is because they grew up being told those things are wrong. Turning it into a joke undermines its value in a story telling purpose. Even in Bojack Horseman, where almost every time the main character has sex it is turned into a joke, it is still used to tell or show things about the characters. It isn't used for shock value. It's used in a shocking way to build a character. And that brings me to the story. The plot has the exact same structure of every generic kid's movie. Making fun of said plot does not make it any better then the movies that are actually doing it. Maybe if it made fun of those types of movies better, and then vastly deviated from their typical structure it would have been interesting. But in the end, this movie plays out exactly like every Pixar, Dreamworks and Aardmon picture. However, the reason so many of their movies work is because they have characters you care about and an interesting setting. This has neither. A supermarket where nobody eats anything inside? Unlikely. A jerk hot dog that is trying to tell everyone faith is a lie, and a vapid bun that just wants to get back home so she can sleep with her man? I don't care about either of those motivations enough to latch onto the characters. A world were food, toilet paper, and a douche is alive, but napkins, pillows, table cloths, doors, books, clothing and kitchen cutlery aren't? You lost my suspension of disbelief. I'm aware it's a cartoon. I'm aware of the argument "cartoons don't have to follow logic." But every cartoon has some sort of logic, some sort of consistency, some sort of cutoff. What is it in this one? Food and Bathroom products? Why wasn't anything else in the bathroom alive when they showed the toilet paper? Anything sold in a grocery store? What about napkins and kitchen cutlery? It's just lazy writing so they could make a joke about how "it's so effed up that if toilet paper was alive it's entire life would be wiping poop out of butts!". If this movie was written by someone else they might have been able to catch these things. If this movie was reduced to a PG-13, it might have had value in being a really good introduction into questioning faith. But as is, especially for a film aimed at "mature" adults, non of it's political, social, or religious commentary is very deep. Every instance I can think of is just "hey, crackers pushed the native American stereotypes out of it's display", or "hey, Arabs and Jews like hummus! Why do they hate each other so much??", or "hey, you don't know for sure if you're gay until you try it!" and then theirs nothing more said. It is a reference to a subject. It isn't saying anything deep or meaningful about the subject. It's just bringing it up for the sake of a joke. That isn't funny, mature, or intelligent. There is no value to this movie as long as it is aimed at early to mid 20 year olds. The entire thing treats it's audience as if they have the mind set of 14 year olds, constantly referencing really deep and philosophical things, but never actually discussing them beyond that. This is the equivalent of Soul Plane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I see this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My brothers wanted to see this Friday. I thought the trailer was ridiculous, but had no intention to see this. Brother offered to pay, so I figured why not?This movie was so stupid. Food that is alive and tell crude jokes and then revolt when they discover that humans eat them alive without care or remorse. So stupid. Seriously, why does Seth Rogen still get work? He's not funny. The appeal of this movie, I assume, is that people find humor in the fact that it looks like the standard CGI kids movie pumped out by Dreamworks or Pixar, but then has crude, adult humor. That's the only draw I see to this movie.And 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. For real?And they gave Suicide Squad a 26%? Why do people trust critics anymore?I'd say "don't see this movie", but I'm someone who believes that someone else's opinion (especially cynical paid critics) shouldn't matter to you when it comes to movies.I didn't enjoy it, but maybe you will. The only funny thing about this movie to me was that some uninformed parent in the theater I was in brought their four small children to see it. Because when the baby carrots starting crying for their Mommy the mother had to get her four screaming kids out of the theater. Highlight of the movie.You want to know how bad this movie really was? I'll tell you. I got more enjoyment out of Ghostbusters 2016 than I did this movie. Just let that one sink in for a minute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And Seth Rogen is one of the most one-dimensional "comedians" I've ever seen in my life. All the guy has is jizz and fart jokes to go along pot humor and an excessive use of the F word.I have an open mind for any form of media that critiques religion as I'm agnostic. But if you're going to take shots at something at least do it in a clever manner. Making obvious stereotypes of Christian, Jewish and Islamic dogma isn't witty or sharp; it's just making obvious and shallow stereotypes. Same goes for the portrayal of homosexuality in the film, which could have worked if the gay men weren't portrayed as lispy and effeminate while the lesbian was portrayed as sex obsessed with a one track mind.At the end of the movie, I was just trying to figure out what the point was. If the whole idea was just to get to an overly long to the point where it gets uncomfortable "food orgy" then the movie didn't have to take as long as it did to get there.There's no "heart", lessons or humor to be found here. It's straw man, shallow interpretations of religion and sexuality rifled with unfunny lowbrow humor that's become the norm for Seth Rogen films.Avoid this one like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I myself tend to try and find the good in every film, even films that completely tank in the box office, but 'Sausage Party' was such an awful, terrible, boring, and vile film that even I cannot find a single positive characteristic in this mess of a production. The plot was boring and unoriginal, the anti-religious theme was so blatant and repetitive that I honestly have a genuine dislike for almost every actor now, and the content was so crude and void of humor that I can actually count the number of times I laughed at this film on one hand. Though I tend to think of myself having a dark/edgy sense of humor, this waste of 89 minutes showed me that some peoples' sense of humor isn't actually humorous, it's just a culmination of random and sick narcotic-fueled ideas.Coming from someone that actually enjoys watching South Park, Family Guy, and listening to Daniel Tosh's stand-up comedy, as well as not even being phased by the elephant scene in the 'Brothers Grimsby', DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. It is so vile and disgusting and profane that I honestly would rather drive railroad spikes through my crotch than waste another second watching this piece of garbage film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The primary villain is a douche. . . Like, a literal, anthropomorphic vaginal irrigation tool.Do you seriously need to know more?! Okay, here goes:The movie's "plot" (and I am using that term very loosely) is supposed to be a parody of religion. Unfortunately, that religion angle is hammered down as hard as Norm of the North's environmental message. Translation: You're going to be yelling at the screen to STFU five minutes in.The "climax" of this plot is when the grocery items fight back and KILL the human customers using darts laced with bath salts. . . So now our movie that thinks it is being so deep and clever about the dangers of religion is pro-chemical warfare. Bravo, movie! Bravo!Think it can't get any worse? Wrong. After celebrating their victory with an orgy (yes, really), they are informed that they are merely cartoon characters being manipulated by animators and voiced by celebrities.Attention movie: Unless you're the Looney Tunes or Deadpool, breaking the fourth wall never leads anywhere good.So the plot is an utter embarrassment, but this is clearly a check-your-brain-at-the-door comedy, I hear you saying. Well, this movie's "humor" comes in three varieties:#1: Stupid ham-fisted pokes at religion.#2: Things that have no purpose except to be vulgar and disgusting (because they think "vulgar" and "disgusting" are synonyms for "funny", not things that often go hand in hand with comedy).#3: Food torture porn.The first two, you can easily make yourself, by yourself. And the third can be found by watching The Annoying Orange on Youtube.This is not a movie. This is Rogan, Goldberg, and their many a-hole friends thumbing their noses at everyone else out there who has ever had an idea for a movie. This is the Movie 43 of animation. IT IS THAT BAD.Do not let them get away with this. Do not watch this movie. Animation deserves to be recognized as a medium instead of a genre, but movies like this do not do the medium any favors. Do not give these bastards your money -- give them the finger right back at them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeez Louise this movie stunk like rotten eggs. and I wish I had eaten some rotten eggs, to potentially end my life so I wouldn't have to sit through this garbage. It stars Seth Rogen, I loved him on Fear Factor actually, but here he just talks like he is a ghetto gangster guy. And he's a damn sausage. The heck is up with that? Basic story is, a couple of snacks get angry when they realized we eat them, and want some revenge. It's actually pretty boring, I didn't like the scene where Frank sexually assaulted the California Raisins, it's like a ten minute scene. Seth Rogen yells while the mildly racist raisins were horrified and one died. This movie is totally screwed up, there's a part where the Bun Lady slices off a human man's member and puts it in the bun for a gag. I didn't appreciate all the racism in the movie, I disliked how it made the foods racist. it was pretty racist. But I liked the one scene where the characters watch The Simpson's parody of Toy Story with food products from over 10 years ago, and send the idea to Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg to write it into their next movie, as Rogen ran out of reefer and needed a fresh idea. I also loved Judd Apatow's cameo as Bill the Banana, who habitually yanks his chain to posters of Mr. T. Also meatloaf had a funny role, as MEATLOAF ha ha so funny. his name is food and they got him for a classic cameo. but this movie is turd on a bird.</fullReview>

In my opinion, the only good parts of the movie were the parts shown in the trailer, leaving the movie goer misinformed of the actual plot and strong satirical base.

The plot and satire on religion was so strong that I felt physically ill while watching this movie. Although there is an occasional funny scene the constant language and sexuality displayed do not leave room for any punch. It is way over played and detracts from the comedy. If I could rate this movie using integers, I would give it a negative ten. I feel extremely regretful that my purchase of this movie ticket, supports a movie such as this.

Perhaps at the daunting age of 24 I am loosing appreciation for movies like this.Some reviewers call the religion bashing "subtle" but it was what I noticed throughout most of the film. Trying to make fun of anyone who believes in a higher power, which is fine it's your movie. I had just hoped it would have been in a more creative way.

I regret to inform you that I didn't laugh once during the 89 minute run time. What started out as an odd but interesting premise turned into an honest bore of a film. Each joke was more predictable than the last. The characters lacked personality and wit. I couldn't for the life of me describe Kristen Wiig's character Brenda. She was only there to be the love interest in a forced romantic subplot. And all the cultural/racial stereotypes were just weak. A Native American bottle of booze named Firewater smokes weed and sounds like he came from the 1950's Peter Pan film. The Black box of grits played by Craig Robinson sounds more like a group of white people trying to write a black person. The whole ordeal was just embarrassing.

		<shortDescription>Great movie held together by poor comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sausage Party was one hell of a great movie. It just wasn't for me. Sausage Party is like Toy Story, but with food. The food live in a grocery store and look forward to when gods come and take them out of the store to the Great Beyond where they'll live out their wildest dreams. However, they're about to learn the horrible truth about what the gods plan to do with them once they leave the store.This movie is raunchy as hell. Possibly the dirtiest comedy I've ever seen. The biggest surprise to me was how intelligent the film was. The entire movie was a giant metaphor for religion and the dangers of blindly following a belief system at the detriment of those around you. But, in film hell bent on offending everybody, I actually feel this was handled rather tactfully, and rather than coming off as anti-religion, it managed to properly convey a message of pro- tolerance, and pro-knowledge, and comes to a conclusion that even if you can't agree with someone's belief, you won't accomplish anything by shoving your beliefs down their throats, which is a message many people need to learn.It's certainly funny and thought provoking, but amid these moments, the movie is glued together with the same tired weed jokes you come to expect from a Seth Rogen film, and these just aren't funny anymore. Also, funny the first time, is seeing a cute piece of food swear. However, the writers failed to realize that this shock humour really only works once.When they made the decision to pointlessly insert expletives into nearly every line in the movie all they did was take their intelligent writing and made it come off as juvenile. Sausage Party would have probably been better off as a short film. Still, it was funny. I won't watch it again, but even at 5/10, it may be worth it to check it out.</fullReview>

And 3% of the movie is gore scenes. Compare that to the trailers which are 100% gore scenes. False advertising at its finest.

I feel extremely sorry for them because from now on, whenever they go to a market they will see their embarrassment in their heads. Sorry guys.The story is the worst part. It is a Food Fight rip-off! When the market closes, the market comes to life and transforms into a city while items and foods come to life and turn into citizens! The new products that look like Pixar freaks take over which turns into a food fight battle.Not aimed for adults OR children. Please, whatever you do, if you haven't seen it, don't try. I regret every second I have watched of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this thing getting favorable reviews?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess that if you're happy hearing the word 'fuck' being repeated ad nauseum, have no idea what subtlety is or care for it when in the service of making an allegory or can watch and actually laugh at a ninety minute single note joke that would be a ten second, throwaway, Airplane (Flying High) or Naked Gun gag then Sausage Party is for you!My girlfriend and I were anticipating a great night out at the movies with what was purported to be one of the funniest movies of the year and a landmark in animated films, period. What we got was bored. There were no jokes that you didn't have to have a wasted mental capacity to enjoy. Then there was a heavy handed subtext about religious freedoms that even the movie itself ignored.Don't get me started on the dick jokes. Christ, it was painful. The constant crass humor had no nuance or measure to it, it just kept coming and none of it was funny. It came to a horrific climax towards the end which just left me wondering if it was part of a joke I just wasn't in on. Then again, apart from our nearest neighbour to the north, no one else got it either. The audience started off excited and was led in nervously laughing at the abominable, grotesquery the heaved and lurched and vomited vile streams from it's noise hole but after a short while they fell silent and just stared as I did. If you must see this film, make sure to get yourself a lobotomy or at least take an interpreter, say the fat idiot who sat behind us and literally NARRATED the whole movie to his moron friends. He told us, by proxy, that his favorite parts were the fact that Tequila featured in the movie and so did the liquor aisle. Riveting and very telling, thanks half-wit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the theater tonight to see it and was expecting it to be a funny dumb movie but no, it was amazing. Had great writing not to mention some of the best actors in Hollywood.Some people say it looks dumb but to those people I say "your an idiot" I mean if you watch the trailer and expect it to not be dumb then your an idiot.This was an amazing movie with tons of funny jokes, I mean its a movie about food so...First of all its a movie about food, then they find out that one day they will become a meal and have to save all the food in the store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie. Had to walk out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie 40 minutes to entertain me. That's about as long as I could tolerate before I had to walk out. It's just an abysmal pile of crap. It's the kind of thing a bunch of twelve year olds would write during recess. This is the epitome of stoner humor: Just cuss a lot and you'll get doped up morons to laugh.It's not clever. It's not funny. It's just stupid. Every line of dialogue is awful, and pretty much every attempt at humor makes me wonder if Seth Rogen should be tested for retardation.I'll give you an example. So the wiener and the bun want to get together, and they tough fingers through their wrappers. They refer to this as "just the tip" which makes no sense at all. That's NOT what "just the tip" means, and yet it's a running gag that produced NO laughs from the audience I saw (half) the movie with. In fact, I heard no audible laughs for the duration. Hell, the trailers got more laughs, and most of them looked stupid.</fullReview>
