		<shortDescription>A Marvelous Family Movie For Both Kids &amp; Adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice Kingsleigh has spent the past three years following in her father's footsteps and sailing the high seas. Upon her return to London from China, she comes across a difficult decision that may determine what she's going to do during the rest of her life. After re-encountering Absolem, she finds a magical looking glass and returns to the nonsensical realm of Wonderland.Alice discovers that things are going very wrong with the Hatter, who is now acting madder than usual, haunted by past events that he refuses to reveal. In order to prevent a heartbreaking end to her friend, she turns to Time himself. Despite his warnings about Alice not being able to win a race against time, and not being able to change the past, she borrows the Chronosphere, a time device that everyone (including the now banished Red Queen) wants, and winds up returning to the past.As Alice witnesses the hits and misses of friends (and enemies) during their lives, discovering how it prompted them to their current states in the present, she may learn how to solve not only the problem with the Hatter, but her own back in London ? but only if she can win the race against the ticking Chronosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel burned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't go in depth much about my thoughts on movies, and that's because in most cases, I feel like everything there is to say about a movie has already been said because so many people, not just critics, are able to voice their opinions now with the advent of social media. I also understand that it's very hard to make a movie, especially a good one, so I generally try not to give much attention to bad movies or waste my time and energy bashing them.With "Alice Through the Looking Glass," though, I feel like I have to put my opinion out there. I'm in the minority with this one in that I loved "Wonderland" and was incredibly excited to see "Looking Glass." Having finally seen the movie, I'm really disappointed. I feel burned.Tim Burton directed "Alice in Wonderland" but chose not to direct this one - in his place is James Bobin, director of the two most recent "Muppets" films (the first of which I thought was great, the second much less so but still fine). I think it would be unfair to put all of the blame on him, but he's certainly responsible for some of what went wrong here... as is screenwriter Linda Woolverton, who I almost can't believe is the same person who wrote "Alice and Wonderland," "Maleficent," and the original "Beauty and the Beast." While her previous work is whimsical but subtle and sophisticated, "Alice Through the Looking Glass" is an uninspired mess, and I can't help but suspect that she really didn't care about this at all.You know, it seems like almost no one involved in making this movie cared. Mia Wasikowska is probably the only member of the cast who deserves any praise, and I thought she did an even better job playing Alice here than she did in the first movie. Everyone else though, ESPECIALLY Johnny Depp and Anne Hathaway, should be embarrassed. Johnny's Mad Hatter was one of the best things about the first one, but here, he's just really weird and annoying. Like, super annoying...I don't even think the composer, the usually amazing Danny Elfman, put forth much of an effort here. The score for "Alice in Wonderland" is one of my favorite scores for a movie ever, but it's like for this one, he thought he could just recycle the stuff he wrote for the first one and that no one would notice? Well, I did, Danny. I noticed.The visual effects and production design are pretty great, as they should be, but you never get that sense of wonder or escapism that you should get with a movie like this because so much of the movie is just people standing around bantering or delivering boring exposition. The movie is loud and sometimes frantic but rarely fun or engaging. It's a major disappointment and a major step back from "Alice in Wonderland" and Disney's other recent live-action fairytale adaptations. It's just not good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Example of Hollywood's Failures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I shatter this film, I would like to say that I do respect the filmmakers of Hollywood (somewhat). They are creative geniuses that have transcended the art of filmmaking time and time again. They have continuously pushed the boundaries, especially when it comes to bringing astounding visual effects to the big screen.However, the art of storytelling has become lost on them. This is primarily because conglomerates have bought out the studios. A movie is merely a commodity to the shareholders. The question they pose themselves before financing a movie is this: Do we already have a built in audience for this story? If there isn't already a built in audience, good luck getting the film financed. With that being said, it is clear that storytelling is the last priority of Hollywood. Through the Looking Glass is a prime example of this. No matter how many groundbreaking visual effects they throw on the screen, the plot stinks. There was no suspense. Very little irony. No interesting characters. No memorable scenes. No compelling conflict and dynamics between the characters. The entire premise of the film was based on Alice saving the Mad Hatter from his illness. Yet, I could really care less. The story reflects nothing about the human condition. It raises no intriguing questions. Not to mention that the plot itself is aimless and disjointed. It meanders along, zipping in different directions without a clear focus and purpose. One wonders how a script like this even gets greenlit. Maybe this is what audiences have come to accept. Maybe it's our culture that is the problem. However, I won't lay down without making my voice heard. When the credits rolled, I personally booed the film. My girlfriend tried to get me to shut up.Story is a metaphor for life. Compelling characters represent something about each of us. We relate to them on different levels. We witness the actions they take, and say "Ah, I would've done the same." or "Wow. I would've never done that, but I can understand why they did it." The problem with fantasy films like this is that they are so far disconnected from reality that they literally represent nothing. So I shall pose a challenge to those reading this review who have seen or intend to see this film: watch Alice, then watch a movie like Birdman, The Social Network, Nightcrawler, Fury, or a TV series like Breaking Bad, then compare the two. I guarantee that you'll find yourself much more emotionally fulfilled upon watching one of the films I mentioned. Not all superhero/fantasy films are trash. But Through the Looking Glass was an egregious example of all special effects, but a junk plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this called Alice through the Looking Glass?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off if you are looking to be magically transported to the pages of this beloved children's story, please prepare yourself to be sadly disappointed. The only thing this film has to do with anything from the book is the characters. The story is as ridiculous as the absolutely exhausting Red Queen baby talking and The Mad Hatters stupid lispy over acting. Both are equally annoying through the entire film. You actually just want to shake Johnny Depp and beg him to stop. I understand film makers taking some creative license in adapting a book to film but this is just pathetic. I can't understand how this movie was even allowed to be released with the title of Alice Through the Looking Glass. It made wish there was a looking Glass that I could jump through to escape having to finish the film, but as I was with family I had to endure it til the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Words: Waste of TIME</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a classic example of a studio's desire to make money. The first one did so well, over a billion dollars world wide, that they felt they had to make a sequel. Well, guess what studio! It will take a miracle for this film to make as much as the first one. Overall the film was terrible. The story was terrible. The acting was terrible. In fact, to me it seemed as if they dumbed down the characters. The characters, including Alice, were not very likable. The best scene in the movie is the opening scene. In this scene Alice is portrayed as smart, daring, brave, and a strong leader. Then she gets to wonderland and she suddenly makes a lot of decisions without really thinking them through and they aren't good. The special effects. I don't know that I would call the special effects terrible, but they were definitely over done. Cinematography, not impressed. The occasional close facial shot is nice, but this film has way too many. In the end, it was a WASTE OF TIME! Not only a waste of my time, but a waste of the studio's time. It took them six years to make this film. They clearly did not use their time wisely. I recommend the studio executives re-watch this film, assuming they have already seen it. Perhaps it will teach them how valuable time is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A confused mess with Mommie Dearest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mad Hatter looked like Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest dressed up as Joan Crawford dressed up as Johnny Depp dressed up as the Mad Hatter!? Alice is the Captain of a sailing Frigate!? And could you understand what Sacha Baron Cohen was saying half the time? Even Alice had some indecipherable lines! The Chronosphere, who came up with this wacky idea? I could go on and on about the goofy mess in this movie but it's not worth it.This movie, this flick, this thing, left me cold and majorly disappointed! I mean really disappointed! Who came up with this plot? To anyone reading this review here's the plot - all the tea party characters are sad because the Mad Hatter has given up on life because 'his family' is missing and presumed dead. (When did the Hatter become Sicilian?) And he has become a recluse. It's up to 'Captain of the frigate' Alice to find them using the Chronosphere she has stolen from mumble mouth Time so she can go back in time to keep Iracebeth's head from swelling because Mirana lied about stealing a cookie and blaming it on Iracebeth and the truth will bring the Mad Hatters family back to him. Now get this - the Hatters family have been living captive in an ant farm!!The descendants of Lewis Carroll really should take legal action for just putting his name in the credits! This is an awful movie and way too long at almost two hours. The only thing that kept my interest is the lavish photography, costumes, and marvelous graphic effects ....... but those 3 thing do not make a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to just stop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice Through the Looking Glass is the sequel to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland that nobody asked for, but yet here it is. We return to the ugly world full of annoying caricatures for a second and hopefully final time (for the sake of my sanity).The ensemble cast fail miserably. Mia Wasikowska's enthusiasm is so false and patronising its as if shes talking to an infant child the whole way through the film. Sacha Baron Cohen and Johnny Depp both suffer from stupid voice syndrome as they both speak with a lisp and an accent that only they know what they were going for there. Helena Bonham Carter reprises her roll as the big headed (pun intended) Queen of Hearts, sulking her irritating little way through this 2 hour cluster f*ck. Its hard to care about these characters when you are simply struggling to tolerate them in the first place.The script is garbage. It's littered with unfunny jokes, puns that are so bad they aren't even funny and convenient exposition like "Oh no only the return of the cronosphere can save us now." Long story short its lazy and hard to believe someone was paid to write this piece of sh*t. I do wonder if the dialogue in the script includes the stupid lisps and accents because if so that just makes things worse.The narrative is heavily flawed from the start of this 2 hour slow motion car wreck. We spend the first 5 minutes hearing Alice go on about nothing being impossible only for her to go against everything she believes in another 5 minutes later. The whole series of events that take place in this film could have been avoided if Alice had just stood up for what she believed in and wasn't so fast to give up on her beliefs. But the illogical narrative points don't stop there, no sir. When the Queen of hearts takes her sister Mirana to a pretty petty moment in their childhood, what is her plan? To bust in the door, point and shout "LIAR" like a bitchy school girl and in doing so almost ending the world and all of time. Also its kinda pathetic that the explanation of why the Queen of Hearts is such an ass hole is because one day her sister ate the last tart and blamed her for it. Seriously? It's not even an excuse, some people are just born ass holes and the Queen of Hearts is one of them.BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE, the ending of the film is literally bull*t saves the day as they straight up lost. Everything was consumed by some brown rust like substance and Alice did not return the cronosphere in enough time to restore time back to normality... Roll credits? Nope, have no fear the magical synapse of time will suddenly make a connection to the cronosphere and time is saved hooray for bs. Also if Alice literally let go of the cronosphere before turning to rust then the balance of time would have been restored, so yeah the ending is beyond stupid.I could go on about the many other aspects of this film that are terrible like the not so great sfx that the film chooses to focus on a lot or how the sfx create an ugly world to look at and yet for some reason the film persists with lingering on it, but I think I've made my point abundantly clear. This is not a good movie plain and simple, about the only thing that's good about this is hearing Alan Rickman's voice and seeing Andrew Scott both of which last for like 2 minutes. Stop trying to make Tim Burton Alice films happen they aren't going to happen, and I hope now that this film has flopped in typical Johnny Depp fashion, most likely due to his wife beating allegations, that this is the last we shall see of Annoying Alice and the ugly Underlandians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Must Have An Imagination To Watch This.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Alice in Wonderland - In fact I love most fairy tale/fantasy movies. With the first Tim Burton Alice movie I wasn't disappointed, but the story took me by surprise. The same goes for this movie. But the surprise for me was that I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I went in not expecting much - and though the story line was a little bland - It was nice to see what became of Alice - Also in this movie, you learn things about people you didn't know. Such as the White and Red Queen's childhood. Take a step through the looking glass and follow Alice through an adventure to save The Mad Hatter's family - In a race to turn back time, Alice goes on another adventure and learns some things that cannot change the past, but can change the present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, but that's not saying much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a common theory that Lewis Caroll was high on LSD when he made up the story of Alice in Wonderland. A concept that wouldn't be completely misplaced given its lunacy and a particular insinuation of certain consumables affecting Alice and her state of being. The truth of how it became is far more innocent but it doesn't stop people making their own assumptions, much like the reasoning as to why it attracted Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The 2010 movie was a cocktail of over-cooked CGI and relied heavily on its main ingredient, another haughty creation from Depp who, thanks to his Jack Sparrow fame, wore the mantle of one of the most prominent character actors of our generation. At the time the visuals were considered a revelation, but where they succeeded the script severely lacked and a much loved story was exhaustively drawn out. Muppets Most Wanted director James Bobin takes the helm (or the blame - depending on how you want to look at it) with all of the original cast returning to their roles including; Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry and Mia Wasikowska as Alice.We find Alice at the beginning of the movie as the Captain of a ship which is threatened to be taken away from her unless she gives up her family home, a deal her Mother struck in a bid to avoid financial ruin. Feeling betrayed, Alice makes a run for it and finds a magic portal through a huge glass mirror. It doesn't take long before we're propelled back into Wonderland through a vortex of swirling colours and flashing images. An epileptic nightmare. Alice instantly finds familiarity in the form of Absolem et al before they inform her that the Mad Hatter is dying and the only thing that will save him is if Alice believes that his family are still alive. She then sets upon a mission to go back in time to warn them of the danger that may cause their death - This is the kind of story that seems to be clutching at the proverbial straw but at that definitive moment within the first 15 minutes of the movie, you know exactly what to expect.What made Alice in Wonderland so appealing was the premise of such memorable characters. Wasikowska seems to slip back into her role with ease, however, she had some practice playing a similar role in Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak (2015). It's not to say that she is a one trick pony, but it is difficult to distinguish variety in her performances. The introduction of (a very reserved) Sacha Baron Cohen as Time and a new antagonist has a promising start and receives the majority of the laughs. Unfortunately his character soon becomes second rate to Helena Bonham Carter's bellowing Red Queen and her painful over- acting begins to grate. Even Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter becomes a pathetic re-imagining as he limps through the movie offering very little performance. Namely, his forced lisp which makes his voice sounds like a creepy, old man that forgot to put his teeth in. The real shame is the misuse of the rest of the original cast who are forced to provide mere cameos in comparison to the lead actors. This is the final performance from Alan Rickman before his untimely death and the only regret is that he is barely given enough screen time to make an impact on the movie at all.James Bobin does very well to mimic the style of the first movie. The audience are dazzled with so much visually, it appears like a desperate attempt to make up for the distinct lack of story. Alice Through the Looking Glass is a lot more structured (believe it or not) than the first instalment but, once again, it suffers from irritating pacing issues and poor performances from their key actors. On a positive note, thanks to the hypnotic special effects this is an entertaining children's movie and, regardless of the crude insinuations, that is most likely what Lewis Carroll intended it to be when he told it to 10 year old Alice Liddell as they rowed down the Thames. Whether that was the intention of Tim Burton is another thing altogether. But for the adults, this one will send you a little MAD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first movie wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination but this movie was a disaster and I'm shocked how it even received the go ahead to be released.The story is weak, drawn out and boring , at no point was I excited or even interested throughout the movie , I just wanted it to end.Another poor performance by depp, who seems to just cash in whenever he can in poor movies with the same performances. He's so annoying in this movie , and this stupid way he talks and the way he moves his mouth is just annoying. He is annoying and so is his character. Depp isn't the only one though, the acting by every character is poor , Bonham Carter with the same annoying voice and movement she does in pretty much every film she's in, Hathaway just looks lost through the whole movie , no expression what so ever , a blow up doll could have played her character.It's really really bad , don't waste your time watching this stuff .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off with the Director's Head!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being six years old and going mad as a hatter with my VHS copy of Walt Disney's 1951 Alice in Wonderland. The pretty colors and zany characters made me want to step into a world of my own like Alice did, which later triggered my obsession with other fantasies such as Harry Potter and Pokémon. Maybe it was the lack of rules and logic that appealed to my peculiar mind of the time, but to this day, Disney's take on Carroll's creation perfectly reflects what goes on in my head.But Alice Through the Looking Glass directly insults Carroll's imagination?again. Why's that? I'll start at the beginning. And when I get to the end, I'll stop.I already hated Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland. It was tonally unfaithful to Lewis Carroll's classic novel, was filled with plot holes deeper than any rabbit hole, and the imagination beyond the art direction was nowhere to be seen. I simply hated every second of that mess of a movie. The rest of the critics pleaded Burton to not make a sequel, but in spite of this very good advice, he did not follow it.Burton is not directing this continuation of his vision. Rather, The Muppets director James Bobin has that burden. He has stated in the past how he wanted to bring out the Victorian era also satirized by Lewis Carroll, particularly the suffragette movement. Therefore, he combined the twisted material with his comedic background in order to portray a woman who has a choice and a voice in society. &#x200b; It does start off a bit promising in the film's first few moments, as Alice has now become a ship captain in memory of her father, and spent the previous three years traveling the world. She refuses to believe in the word "impossible," which shows through her decisions on the job. This would be an excellent role model for girls to follow, if actress Mia Wasikowska cared about the role she was playing. Throughout the entire film, she never reacts to anything, including the death of a coworker, beyond raising her voice a little. It gets honestly annoying most of the time how disinterested she is, even more so than the first movie.Okay, so her acting as the title role halts any positive impression on the girls watching, but it's not the only thing at fault. Take a look at everything else, as in, all the CGI that overpowers the screen in every single frame. Bobin does try to give a different energy from the first film by exploring different parts of Wonderland, and at first, he's somewhat successful at it. When Alice first steps through the mirror into Wonderland, the room she enters is enormous, complete with a yawning tiger rug and talking chess pieces. Next thing she knows, she's falling through birds in square flight patterns into the gathering of all her friends. It all progressively gets curiouser and curiouser as she's taken by her friends into the castle where Time lives, in order to venture back several years and rescue the Mad Hatter's parents from the Jabberwocky. This castle looks huge, with the sounds of cranking cogs leading into the castle's entrance. From here, there's an incredible sea of time and a kingdom of red vines overrun by glowing blue centipedes. These 3D extravaganza elements are both the film's greatest asset and greatest flaw.It's not only that the CGI looks more like video game graphics than an actual world, but more like no exploration goes into this already uninteresting reality of uninteresting characters. There's zero emotion, zero time to look into anything, and zero captivating substance.Plus, so what if the Mad Hatter's may never see his family again? So what if it's up to Alice to rescue them for the sake of Wonderland? I was never given a reason to care, and neither was Alice. I guess that's what you get when you resort to coincidences in order to move along an overused plot. It would be so nice for these stories to make sense for a change.Lewis Carroll's treasured classics have been around for a long time now, and time has inspired thousands of readers to come up with their own interpretations to this new reality. To me, Wonderland is about the autistic mind. To Walt Disney, Wonderland is about a girl seeing all these beautiful colors with unforgettable figures. To Tim Burton, Wonderland needed a makeover in order to become a modern, epic, twisted fantasy for a new generation. Now, his vision gets expanded on to put in another artist's take on Wonderland. While there's no problem with doing so, any credibility or reasoning behind this adaptation has lost its way, leaving behind a lack of respect to its source material. It's not about the message like the director claims, it's about the pretty visuals I wouldn't mind showing up late to see. But even so, I encourage you to give the original books a read, it just might inspire you to make a book, movie, poem, costume, or art piece someday that feels more real than this impossibly mad mess. &#x200b; Overall Grade: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who just found the original Disney movie to just be alright, I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I guess I probably shouldn't judge as I haven't read the book that this was based on. It doesn't seem like a very faithful adaptation. It's just that the plot in this film seems too minor for a whole movie. It features Alice trying to find the Mad Hatter's family through time travel or rather what their fate is. I admit that the effects and CGI in this film are really quite impressive, but it can't help a mediocre story.What's annoying is how the other characters have so little of a role. They don't do much at all and the story even makes little sense. It's explicitly stated (and proved) that the past can't be altered, even though we clearly see it being changed. I will admit that I like seeing Sacha Baron Cohen as Time. The puns involving him are pretty lame. I am quite confused by the beginning as I seriously thought it was just something in Alice's imagination, but instead it's real. The dialogue was pretty predictable and it was weird how it ended with Alice telling her mother to sign the papers and then she didn't sign them. It just seems pointless. It's far from awful, as it does feature clever ideas and it's great to look at. I guess I'm just used to seeing better movies in theaters. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Six Impossible Things "Alice" Did Before the Credits RolledAlice through the Looking Glass is expected to keep the fairytale- adaptation ball rolling. With stellar cast and assumed long- awaited return to the Underland, it seems like it's simply impossible for this sequel to go wrong.Yet it still managed to make the impossible, possible.Alice 2hru starts three years after Alice's first adventure. Fresh from her voyage from the other side of the world, she learns that her mother sold their share of her father's company and she needs to give up the ship in exchange for their house. Pressured by the impending need to finally grow up, Alice walks through the looking glass and finds herself back in Underland and learns that Mad Hatter is madder than usual. It is up to Alice to save him by doing what even she thinks is impossible: sneaking into Time's castle, traveling back to the past, and changing it.Even without saying, we all know how it ends. Here are the other six impossible things Alice 2hru did before the credits rolled:IMPOSSIBLE THING # 1: Fail at the box office with such a huge budget. With a film budget of $170 million, enough to make eleven The King's Speechs, Alice 2hru is a let down grossing only over $282 million?considering that the first Alice film grossed over $1 billion. Low-budget movies turned blockbusters like Paranormal Activity relay on the viewers' word- of-mouth so most probably, Alice 2hru has failed to impress the audience prior to the rolling of credits.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 2: A stellar cast with unmemorable performances. The Alice books from where the film is loosely based are populated by whimsical, strange people. And who else could bring these characters to life but an ensemble that includes: the master of oddness and eccentricities himself, Johnny Depp; the ethereal, apt bride of Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter; and the charmingly mischievous Sacha Baron Cohen. Amazingly, as Mad Hatter, the Red Queen, and Time respectively, they all fail to inspire awe from the audience. This is not to say that their performances are wanting, in fact, they have delivered what are expected from them: their usual quirky selves. But this is also exactly why the actors are forgettable: we have seen Depp, Bonham Carter, and Baron Cohen so many times (especially the first two) in similar roles and they fade into the surreal background with ease. Anne Hathaway's bizarre White Queen on the other hand, albeit having shorter screen time but probably clearly remembered as the tragic Fantine, elicits delight as she dreamily speaks and flicks her fingers, and sashays her way through Underland.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 3: Overwhelming effects without lasting impression. Just by looking at the crowded, kaleidoscope-ish, toothache-inducing movie poster, one would know this movie will be a feast of visual effects?one that would leave the viewers with a bad case of indigestion. Sadly, the film is as advertised: it bombards the audience with colors, ruffles, and frills that, ironically, viewers can easily shrug off in anticipation?and preparation for the next overly done scene. Even the void of infinitude, where Time's Castle of Eternity is located, is not spared from dizzying grandiosity.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 4: Intense music that leaves no feeling of dread. Alice 2hru is an adventure movie so naturally it has a lot of will-keep- you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes like the one where Time is chasing Alice through the Ocean of Time?or at least this is what this scene should have been. Despite the music aptly reflecting the mood of each scene, it fails to elicit any kind of sympathy from the viewers and this is largely because of the too predictable story the film chose to tell.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 5: Producing a pancake-flat adaptation from a rich source material. The director, James Bobin, said that Lewis Carroll's Alice books are "unfilmable". While not a few would agree, it is still not enough an excuse to explain the atrocities of Alice 2hru. The fascinating-sometimes-brutal exchange of ingenious dialogues that play with and make fun of the arbitrariness of language that contributed so much to the greatness of the two Alice books are reduced to bland one- liner puns in the film. The timing is so off the audience would snicker to mask the cringing. And let's not go to the over-all storyline. The plot of the movie is plain immature they should have hired a younger Alice and marketed it mainly for kids. Carroll's Alice books may have been childish and nonsensical on the surface but do not fail to amuse both the young and the young-at-heart?something that the movie failed to do.IMPOSSIBLE THING # 6: A Wonderland without wonder. Contrasted with the dark, dreary reality, Underland should have been a breath of fresh air, a way out, an escape. However, as the Hatter says by the end of the movie about dream and reality, "Who's to say which is which?" Which is which indeed! In reality, Alice believes impossible things are possible but the first thing she says when a challenge presented itself in Underland is that it is impossible. In reality, the actors are superb, eliciting genuine emotions from the viewers (Lindsay Duncan as Helen Kingsleigh is inspiring, Leo Bill as Hamish Ascot is delightfully annoying, Ed Speelers's non-verbals are charming, even Alice played by Mia Wasikowska is more interesting as the odd one out in reality). Also, it is more intriguing to ponder on what would have happened if Alice never escaped the institution than to watch an extremely predictable story unfold in Underland.Alice through the Looking Glass is a wonder in every possible way?wrong sort of ways. It is a wonder why we even have this sequel at all. But if you are one of the few people with time to spare, go ahead and look through the glass. You would be surprised what you would find there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the minority because as many critics fail to see there is a good plot to through the looking glass!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I was hesitant to watch through the looking glass partly because of bad reviews but mostly because my favorite director Tim Burton didn't direct this movie. I finally watched through the looking glass and I was pleasantly surprised! Beautiful graphics and visuals and a touching plot about the importance of not taking those you love for granted...and not taking time for granted. This movie shows how we all learn from our pasts and that we cannot and should not want to change the past. It seems a majority of the critics could not put two and two together to understand or appreciate the message this film conveyed. Shame on you critics ... curiouser and curiouser. ..why half of you can't comprehend. Maybe lacking neurons and brain cells ? Wonderful job done by the actors and actresses as well as the director trying to add some spice to a worldly well written classic by respected author Lewis Carroll</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The CGI is amazing and the story brilliant. You get a bit more information about different characters and their background but there is also a message behind the story. It's the message that makes this movie special. Something you can relate to, especially if you have been through some rough times and time hasn't always been on your side. The music in the first movie was great and so was the music in this movie, really makes a movie more enjoyable if it has good music.I really really liked it, beautifully made and great story. It is an odd movie but what else would you expect? Just the right amount of action, story and humour for me :)Rest in peace Alan Rickman, Absolem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mature fantasy full of "muchness"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of an extravagant fantasy that makes people temporarily forget about reality, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a beautiful fantasy full of life lessons encouraging people to appreciate life, believe in the impossible, treat family well, and keep dreaming. If that's not your cup of tea then the movie may indeed seem boring, especially if you don't catch onto many of the metaphors.After stealing the Chromosphere (a time-travel enabling device) from Time (a man who is the personification of time), Alice travels back in time with a mission to change the past in order to save the Hatter's family, and in the process learns of the mistakes, misunderstandings, and hidden feelings of those in Wonderland. Through it, her outlook on life changes. She realizes that 1) she was wrong to have not believed the Hatter?the one who helped her believe in herself and therefore slay the Jabberwocky during her previous visit to Wonderland?about his family being alive 2) she doesn't need to change the past to make things right in the present?she only needs to understand it 3) time is a gift?not a thief. The time travel also reveals the beginning of Iracebeth's (Red Queen's) vengeful heart from her childhood. After Mirana (White Queen) eats one of their mother's tarts and blames it on her, (mother believes the lie), Iracebeth runs out of the house and winds up with a head injury, which causes her to become self-conscious. At a ceremony later on, the Hatter laughs at how the tiara won't fit on her head, and the crowd laughs when the tiara breaks into pieces. In the middle of her outraged cries, her father states that she is unfit, and that the crown will go to her sister. She threatens revenge on all of them and later locks up the Hatter's family. The Red Queen takes the White Queen back to the stolen tart incident via the Chromosphere, but when given the chance to change the past, the White Queen refuses to. The old and young Red Queen then see each other which causes her to freeze. The White Queen carries her frozen body with her as the rest of the world starts to freeze. If not for Alice, they would have become "stuck in the past". Contrary to what is expected, Alice doesn't save the world from freezing "just in time"; she's about two inches too far away from getting the Chromosphere back in place. However, a simple spark from the Chromosphere reverses the frozen world, seeming to say, 'all it takes is a spark'. The White Queen takes this opportunity to apologize to her sister, and Alice apologizes to Time for stealing the Chromosphere. Time says he is a friend to no one, but he won't forget Alice and tells her to never come back (aka don't make the same mistake twice).Upon returning to the real world (though, "Whose to say which is which?"), Alice's priorities change. She puts aside her sentimental feelings for her deceased father's ship and agrees to sell it so that her mom can afford to keep the house and stop worrying about Alice. However, her mom has a change of heart. They keep the ship, open up a business, and go sailing together?contradicting what society tells them they should do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were a fan of the first one, I believe you will find some enjoyment in this movie. It had the same feel of the first one, but went in a different direction than the first. "Wonderland" was more or less a reboot to introduce the characters and setting to a fresh audience, while "Looking Glass" explored more of the history of the characters and did a bit of expanding on some of the characters (e.g., The Mad Hatter, The Red Queen, and The White Queen). Alice travels back through Time (yes, time is a proper noun because Time is a person) to save The Mad Hatter's family, and in the process, she discovers more and more about the history of the characters listed before. I believe it was a very interesting way to follow the Alice in Wonderland that came out a few years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bottom line: The perfectly OK Alice Through the Looking Glass is getting pretty terrible reviews but I don't really know why; it makes me want to ask, "What were you expecting?" 2.5/4Alice Through the Looking Glass is the sequel to Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland. In this adventure, the Mad Hatter (Depp) is dying of sadness because he believes that his family (long thought to have perished at the hands of the Jabberwocky) is actually alive but just lost. Alice has to, once again, go into Wonderland to save the day even if it means traveling through time.How's that for a spoiler free plot teaser? Any-who, the first thing I would like to note about this iteration of the franchise is how it's not directed by Tim Burton and you can tell because we aren't being beaten over the head with whimsy. We've got Johnny Depp returning as the Mad Hatter but he's just kind of in the background doing his thing instead of being center stage.While I didn't see the first one, my wife did and she thought this one was better. I suspect that that might be the case because with the first one, the crux of the movie is the spectacle that is Burton's interpretation of Alice in Wonderland; we have to introduce all of the characters and tie them all together with an adventure. In Through the Looking Glass, we can just have an adventure.The performances were all perfectly good. In one review, someone said that Sasha Baron Cohen's performance of Time was just Cohen doing an impression of Werner Herzog. Herzog is the guy who made Grizzly Man. Sure, I can see that in terms of his accent but I don't think it's a minus point to the movie. I thought he was a solidly balanced character that I enjoyed watching.The big thing about this movie were the special effects. I thought there were fine too; not earth shattering nor dull.Maybe one of the reasons I didn't mind this movie was because my expectations were appropriately grounded. I was expecting it to be unwatchably bad. Another reason was that I had just finished watching Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which I loathed, so Through the Looking Glass felt like a Burton-esque film that wasn't garbage. Overall, I'd recommend Alice Through the Looking Glass if you are looking for a light movie, maybe a weekend matinée.</fullReview>

Alice must steal the chromosphere from Time and learn from the past.For literally years, I read the film title as "Alice Looking Through Glass". I read it numerous times and saw the same erroneous title, so imagine my surprise that I finally realised the title is "Alice Looking Through the Looking Glass"!Though the visuals are good, I could not get into the story because of the very unusual outlook of characters. I could hardly bear the excessive makeup of Johnny Depp, who is unrecognisable anyway. The lines are very child-like, as if spoken by and to children. I just didn't like it much.

Sacha Cohen made a surprise entrance in this offshoot of Disney's classic Alice in Wonderland story. People, who knew the original fairy tale, still had plenty to wonder from Alice and her band of familiar characters.

		<fullReview>The film business is a big profitable deal, if comes out well. Can I have great doubts about this one? Well, Johnny Depp is not the greatest actor in the world, he has only 5 '10 "(1.78 m). Sacha Baron Cohen is the greatest actor in the world, he has 6' 3" (1.91 m). Seriously, they both are good actors, one better than the other (I'm not a Johnny Depp fan, however, I really like Cohen very much). Anne Hathaway is an excellent actress but here is almost nonexistent and transparent. Helena Bonham Carter is OK. Mia Wasikowska as Alice, doesn't fits at all. I see her very well in a role of working woman in a realistic film, but not here. "Alice Through the Looking Glass" is just an effort. The best thing in it is Pink's song, Just Like Fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcomed step back into the looking glass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director James Bobin (Muppets 2011 &amp; 2014), along with writer Linda Wolverton (Alice... 2010) once again bring color, amazing CGI effects and easy storytelling (although a bit complicated at times) to Lewis Carroll's book. Skirting Depp's current personal affairs, he once again captures the Mad Hatter, this time with more believable reserved flair enabling him to slip easily into his shy yet disturbed character. Successfully sharing the primarily (and believable) green screen set is the wonderfully adverturist Mia Wasikowska "Alice," Helena Bonham Carter as big head Red Queen "Iracebeth," Anne Hathaway as the less then attractive floating princesses "Marana," quirky Sacha Baron Cohen as "Time," Matt Lucas as the lovable Tweedledee / Tweddledum, and the wonderful voices (to name a few) of Timothy Spall, Ed Spellers and the late Alan Rickman. "Alice Through the Looking Glass" isn't rocket science, it's just a good family film filled with colorfully special effects, a familiar storyline and good acting - regardless of what many a film critic are saying. If anything didn't quite fit into the fantasy environment of the film, it was the closing credits song by vocal artists Pink. Where the film places one firmly in a fantasy environment, Pink's song is too current, thus pulling one away from the established dream-state. Regardless, when Awards time rolls around, "Alice..." should fill its glass with recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Lewis Carroll would have been alive today he would have given a nod to Alice Through the Looking Glass. Of course not for the reason that they totally changed his book and messed with every single detail to weave something different altogether, but for the mere fact that it is brimming up with an equal fanciful inclination and zeal that Carroll shared.THE CONCEPT OF TIME Alice Through the Looking Glass personifies 'Time' which is both poetic and enigmatic as Alice embarks on a journey to bring Hatter back to life. Time's depiction is downright extraordinary and aced superbly by Sacha Baron Cohen. The blue tinge in his eyes and his animated mechanical body help him lip a fantastic creation."Time is a thief, and a villain." There are a lot of time references that have been brilliantly thought of and executed nicely. Watch out for that bit when Time is made fun of by Hatter, Cheshire Cat, Thackery, Mallymkun and the rest. The movie packs in the concept of toying with timelines, which happens to be one of my favourite fancies. Unfortunately they fail to make it palpable.ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS REVIVING CHARACTERS You get to hear the voice of Alan Rickman as Absolem which was endearing per se as if he sprang up back from the dead. It was ephemeral but it makes you think of him which was really pleasant. Mia Wasikowska is as outstanding as she was in the prequel. So was Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth. Her rampaging confidence is a joy to watch. Also, Andrew Scott has a short cameo, that was actually quite satisfying.Screenplay is kind of a beautiful literary affair, and will keep you interested throughout. Visually it is gripping. The plot oscillates a little betwixt the real and the virtual but finds a firm grip in both the worlds. Well thought of, I must say. It isn't really that dark and grim as Tim Burton's style of movie-making is. But it is still fun.CURIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD: The thing that seemed a little out of place in Alice Through the Looking Glass was the huge plot punch on which the whole movie was based upon. If you look at it closely you wonder Alice goes to all that trouble just to make Hatter, who is already mad, happy? Is that it? To answer that you must think from Alice's perspective. It is this whimsical world she tries to fit in, and petty things that entail in it that matter to her the most. If one was to weave a story out of her life, it would always surround tales with such quaint things, things that matter to Alice, if not to you. Well, if you can't digest that, a simple ? "Hatter was going to die with gloom" should do it.OTHER DOWNSIDES Alice Through the Looking Glass isn't really that serious when trying to skip alongside the time component that it so profusely tries to milk. It will flabbergast you beyond limit, vex you if you try to connect the dots, and elude you as you try to reason with it. At the end of the flick you realize it's Disney after all. What do you expect? Eventually, you wonder if Alice Through the Looking Glass even came close to how Lewis had intended his book to be, but to be honest there are more creative juices at play in today's fantasy scenario. The world is constantly growing. We improvise, don't we? Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2010 blockbuster fantasy flick 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND', which was (of course) based on Lewis Carroll's classic novels. This film is an even looser adaptation of Carroll's 1871 novel 'Through the Looking-Glass', which was a sequel to 1865's beloved 'Alice's Adventures In Wonderland'. The story, of this movie, revolves around Alice reentering Wonderland, and (once there) going on a time traveling mission, to save the Mad Hatter. It was directed by James Bobin (who previously helmed the last two 'MUPPETS' movies), and it was once again written by Linda Woolverton (who also wrote the 2010 original, as well as 2014's 'MALEFICENT'). Tim Burton, who directed the original movie, returned as just a producer (this time around). Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall and Alan Rickman (in his final film role) all reprise their parts from the original movie. They're joined, this time around, by Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen (who previously worked with Bobin on several episodes of 'DA ALI GI SHOW'). The film was a major bomb at the Box Office (some blame it's financial failure on Depp's recent public image problems), and it's gotten even worse reviews from the critics (than the first movie did). I don't like it as much as the original film, but it's not that bad either.The story begins with Alice Kingsleigh (Wasikowska) returning home, from 3-years of adventure on the high seas. As she returns to London, she learns that a jealous ex, Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill), has taken over her father's company. He's now trying to force Alice into selling her father's ship to him, in exchange for her family home back. Alice is distraught over this, and she returns to Wonderland for escape. Once there, Alice learns that the Mad Hatter (Depp) is in trouble, and she needs to travel back in time to save him. The film has almost nothing to do with Carroll's great literature. That doesn't bother me that much though, but it's definitely not as fun, or involving, as the original movie either. I liked the first film (a lot), for it's creative visuals and spectacular adventure scenes (I was really stoned when I first saw it though). This sequel doesn't have the same thrill, or imagination, but it's still visually fantastic. It's a little slow-paced, at times, but it's also (ultimately) at least somewhat entertaining; it's definitely still a good (and creepy) kids' flick. Wasikowska and Carter both give impressively dominant lead performances, and Cohen is great in his role too. Depp is barely in the film though, it's a shame he still gets top billing (over such powerful women as Wasikowska and Carter), and it's also a little disturbing seeing him on-screen again (after the recent troubling allegations against him). All in all, the film is decent, but nothing spectacular (that's for sure).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler-Free Review. Easily the worse movie I've seen this year. The 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland wasn't a great movie but at least is was entertaining and even watchable at times. This on the other hand is complete garbage. The plot plays like a last minute fan-fiction story you'll find on Reddit. The acting is unimpressive and screams of "I'm just making this film because of the paycheck." I went into this movie knowing it wasn't going to be as good as the 2010 film but after almost 15 minutes into the film, I started yawning. At least five people started scrolling on their smartphones about halfway into the film and no one cared, in fact we all understood why. I was tempted to pull out my phone and play around but I hate people who do that during a movie and I didn't want to be one of them. Without giving anything away, the biggest problem with the movie isn't the fact that it is boring. Oh God, it is boring af. But no, that isn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that it is just stupid. It is like they made this movie for kids who like watching The Minions movies just because the minions act and do dumb things. This movie must have been a last minute rush job. Anyway. On the bright side, this movie is very forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now a buccaneering ship captain, is summoned by Absolem (voiced by the late Alan Rickman, RIP Professor Snape) back to the whimsical world of Wonderland to cheer up the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) who is apparently dying from a broken heart since none of his friends believe that his presumably dead family might still be alive. With the Hatter being her "truest friend", Alice decides to agree with the White Queen's (Anne Hathaway) "unpossible" plan to go back in time to the day the Jabberwocky attacked to save Hatter's family from being killed. Doing this requires Alice to borrow (or steal if the former does not work) the Chronosphere, a gold orb that is in the possession of Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), the human clock of Wonderland. The said orb transforms into a vehicle that will allow Alice to traverse the oceans of time. Not heeding Time's warning that, "You can't change your past, but you can only learn from it," Alice will soon realize that her rash actions impose danger to the existence of Wonderland.When a sequel uses time-travel as its gimmick, one can get the impression that a franchise may be starting to run out of ideas. What's disappointing is that given the wealth of possibilities in Caroll's work, screenwriter Linda Woolverton chooses an antiquated trick that is best left to Back to the Future. I may have only read plot summaries of Caroll's work but that is enough for me to learn that this film is just loosely based on its source material. The only same thing that both happened in the film and the novel is that Alice slips through the liquid surface of a looking glass. Furthermore, it is rather odd to name the film after an object that plays such a small role in the film. For example, Harry Potter films don't end up being titled with, "Harry Potter through the Brick Wall." See how odd it could be? Anyway, believe it or not, this sequel has more structure than the last one. Saving the Hatter's family is clearly the MacGuffin of the story, but what the script asks Alice to do is to be basically a tour guide to the origin stories of the White Queen, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the Mad Hatter. It is more disappointing once you learn that the root of all evil involves a stolen strawberry tart to which the film comes up with a rushed resolution in favor of scenes that add little value to the story. I'm referring to that episode of Alice in the asylum that should be best left in the cutting floor.If there's anything to be excited for with this film it's that Alice Though the Looking Glass is filled to the brim with Wonderland characters both old and new, from the Cheshire Cat to Humpty Dumpy. Depp, as the Mad Hatter, ceased to be a human being in his films a long time ago, especially here because you barely recognize the actor due to the heavy make-up. And, I'm not exactly sure if that's a compliment. He can't seem to get away from this type of façade to the point that his acting becomes somewhat artificial and calculated. However, as the story forces the Hatter to be sad for most parts of the film, he actually becomes more bearable when subdued. Hathaway, with her matching jazzy fingers, puts on a delicate performance that she almost fades in the background and Bonham Carter's shrieking voice of insanity is a welcome repeat. Sacha Baron Cohen as Time, who happens to have an inscrutable thick German accent, is amusing. Despite being marketed as the villain of this sequel, he is actually more of the good guy here than Alice who is messing with the timelines. Alice, however, has a disappointing characterization. She proves to be an intelligent and a strong leader in the real world but when she gets back to Wonderland, she makes a lot of hasty decisions. Wasikowska is a wonderful actress but sometimes she acts too patronizing as if she's talking to an infant during the entire film.Much like its predecessor, this film has a lot of visual feasts to offer: lavish and intricate costumes, expensive production sets, dazzling cinematography, etc. However not even sensory overload and the script's occasional fancy wordplay can compensate for an underwhelming story. It attempts to flesh out some messages on loss and acceptance but my emotional engagement stays behind the glass for me to fully grasp it. Watching Alice Through the Looking Glass is like attending a fancy tea party wherein fact you are expecting for a heavy sumptuous lunch ? it is far from being a terrible sequel, however, it is by no means a good Disney classic.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/alice-looking-glass</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice Through the Looking Glass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only when I saw a trailer for this Disney sequel that I did my research and found out Lewis Carroll did actually write a follow- up book to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I was certainly interested to see it, produced by Tim Burton, directed by James Bobin (co-creator of Ali G, The Muppets). Basically Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) has spent the past three years sailing the high seas as a merchant ship captain, she returns from China to London, and learns her former fiancé Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill) has taken over her father's company, he plans to have Alice sell her father's ship, the Wonder, in exchange for her family home. Alice runs away angry, she recognises a blue butterfly as her former caterpillar friend Absolem (Alan Rickman, in his last film), she follows him through a mirror (the looking glass) and returns to Underland. Alice is greeted by Mirana the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), McTwisp the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), Mallymkun the Dormouse (Dame Barbara Windsor), Bayard the Bloodhound (Timothy Spall) and the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry). They inform Alice that the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is depressed, he has recalled his family during the attack of the Jabberwocky, this shortly occurred after the Hatter's father Zanik Hightopp (Rhys Ifans) seemed to reject his son's gift of his first hat creation, the Hatter, real name Tarrant Hightopp, found this creation recently and has been in poor health since. It is unsure if the Hatter's family survived, the White Queen believes finding them is the only way to restore his health, she persuades Alice to consult the powerful being Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), who rules over time in Underland, to travel back in time, something no resident of Underland can do without destroying history, if they see their past/future self, Alice has no past self. Alice visits Time's palace, finding the Chronosphere, an object that powers all time in Underland and travels through the Oceans of Time, Time tells her that the past cannot be altered, she also finds the exiled Red Queen, Iracebeth of Crims (Helena Bonham Carter), in the care of Time. Alice steals the Chronosphere and travels back in time, the Red Queen urges Time to go after Alice, she wants to use the Chronosphere herself to get even with her sister Mirana. Alice accidentally travels to the day of the Red Queen's coronation, where the younger Hatter mocks the Red Queen not fitting the royal crown because of her abnormally large head, this causes her to have a melt down, her father deems her emotionally unqualified to rule and passes the title to her younger sister Mirana. Alice later learns of an event in Iracebeth's and Mirana's past that caused their friction, Alice travels again attempting to change Iracabath's ways and stop the Jabberwocky killing the Hatter's family, she learns the Hatter's father in fact did treasure Tarrant's first hat creation. Alice meets the White Queen and the Red Queen as sisters and witnesses the event, Mirana steals a jam tart from her mother and eats it, when confronted by their mother, Mirana lies that Iracabeth is responsible, Iracabeth runs from the castle upset, Alice trying to change history causes Iracabeth to trip and hit her head on a stone wall, causing her deformity. A weakened Time confronts Alice, he scolds her for putting all of time in danger, running into a nearby mirror Alice reenters the real world, waking in a mental hospital, diagnosed with female hysteria, a doctor tries to inject her, but with the help of her mother Helen (Lindsay Duncan) she escapes, and returns to Underland via the mirror. Alice travels to the day of the Jabberwocky attack, she discovers the Hatter's family were not killed, they were captured by the Red Queen, but she is too late returning to the present, the Hatter is on the brink of death, she tearfully tells the Hatter that she believes him, this transforms him back to his normal self. The Underlandians go to the Red Queen's castle, the Hatter's family have been shrunk and are trapped in an ant farm. The Red Queen captures them and takes the Chronosphere, taking the White Queen with her, back to the day where she lied about eating the tart, by the time Alice and the Hatter get there, the Red Queen and young Iracabeth have seen each other, Time becomes irrelevant and Underland begins to freeze, Alice and the Hatter race back to the present, at the last second Alice is able to place the Chronosphere back in its original place. The Chronosphere stabilises and Underland is restored, the Hatter reunites with his family, the White Queen and the Red Queen make amends, and Alice says goodbye to her friends and returns to the real world, there Alice allows her mother to sign over her father's ship, but Hamish does not get the family home, in the end Alice and her mother from their own shipping company and set out together to travel the world. Also starring Paul Whitehouse as Thackery the March Hare, Andrew Scott as Dr. Addison Bennett, Downton Abbey's Ed Speleers as James Harcourt, Geraldine James as Lady Ascot, Richard Armitage as King Oleron, Hattie Morahan as Queen Elsemere, Siobhan Redmond as Bumalig Hightopp, Wally Wingert as Humpty Dumpty, Meera Syal as Nobody, Frances de la Tour as Aunt Imogene, Toby Jones as Wilkins and Andrew Sachs as Mantel Clock. Depp remains colourful and bonkers, Carter with her big head is still a fiery villain, Cohen in intriguing as the personified Time, and the supporting cast of familiar weird and wonderful creatures are good, the first film was perhaps uneven but good fun, this sequel has a much more determined plot, it doesn't have anything to do with events in the book and it goes off a little in places, but the special effects are brilliant and the story is good, an enjoyable fantasy adventure. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As the First But Great All the Same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice is a captain of her own ship. But despite that she faces a lot of male sexism due to a suitor that she spurned and with good reason.And also her mother could be forced into saving her house all due to Alice pursuing her dreams.But then she is wanted by her butterfly friend to go back and rescue the Mad Hatter. Not doing good over personal reasons and she is the key to nursing him back to health. And saving Wonderland again.The Red Queen is back after getting banished and she is forced to deal with a new nemesis only known as Time. But as the two bad as they seem to be?As it shows background on the Red Queen the way she is and her good sister the White Queen.This is the last film of the late Alan Rickman who passed away in January 2016. He will be missed.It picks up the story as Wonderland not as happily ever after as Alice left it. But also we see Alice go from shy and sheltered in the first movie to being strong and mature in the second.Not as good as the first film but great all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uninspired Cash-Grab</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a strong difference between when a sequel is released for the fans, with an interesting story to explore, and when one is released for the box office success. Alice Through the Looking Glass (ATLG), unfortunately, suffers from being part of the later, giving the demeaning feeling that the film wasn't given the proper treatment it needed to be a sequel worthy of even existing in the first place.2010's Alice In Wonderland was a new take on the age-old story of Alice and her mystical fantasy world, and while not a masterpiece by any stretch, was a fairly well pieced together and entertaining film. 6 years later, we're back in Wonderland, and for the vast majority of the film, I was left pondering why we're back in Wonderland at all. ATLG is devoid of a meaningful story, devoid of any consistent pacing, and devoid of any originality, not even borrowing from the plot of the original novel.I will give the film one break, in that it is mostly geared towards a younger audience, but there have been numerous kids films that have delivered award-level scripts (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Lion King, etc.), so I can't cut the film too much slack. As a kids movie or not, if a film's story in engaging and interesting, I will be engaged and interested as well, but writer Linda Woolverton and the vision of director James Bobin leave the film feeling hopelessly uninspired, and at some points, completely boring.Like the first film, ATLG uses a mix between CG and live-action characters, and here it's pretty rough around the edges. The interaction between the two types of characters isn't all too believable, and often quite wonky. I would have preferred the entire film to have been animated. The overall use of CGI in the movie, like the first one, is overused almost to the point of garnering a headache. On a positive, the atmosphere presented is mostly wonderful. It's colorful and very detailed, but if you're film is going to have heavy doses of visual effects to supplement live- action actors, it needs to be tight and believable, and here, it's not so much.For the cast, we have the return of Mia Wasikowska in the lead role, and like her first crack as Alice, it is underwhelming and unimaginative. Wasikowska again doesn't seem to grasp the fictional world she's enveloped in, and in a setting like Wonderland, you want your lead to project the sense that she's in a fantasy world to your audience, something that Wasikowska still has yet to achieve. Superstar Johnny Depp reprises his role as the Mad Hatter, and unlike his original performance of the character, seems to not be enjoying himself as much this time around. And since it didn't seem as if he was having fun playing the character, I didn't have fun watching him. There were a couple solid performances, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the antagonists Time and the Red Queen respectively. They're both enjoyable and often humorous, and are the two standouts in an otherwise very poor cast.There's some enjoyable humor and the rare scene that gets you excited in the slightest, but not nearly enough to build up a memorable film. The narrative structure doesn't give you any reason to care, there's not enough passion from most of the cast to deliver heartfelt moments, and while the film has bits and pieces of exciting visuals, the over-saturation of CGI is a heavy weight dragging the film down from being a truly enticing fantasy film. The idea to green-light this sequel was a mistake from the beginning, and it's clear that Alice Through the Looking Glass is nothing more than an excuse to make parents dig deep into their wallets for their kids, and make them witness the final nail in the coffin of this doomed franchise.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice In Wonderland (2010) was an excellent flick and the follow-up here is okay but you have seen it all before. I don't mean that I didn't liked it at all and it's great to see all characters back, with the original cast and effects are again stunning but for me the magic(k) was over.Of course it's Disney and of course it's made for the whole family and you will have your laughter here and there with the rabbit and creatures surrounding the Hatter (Depp) but maybe it was the story that couldn't satisfy me. And it showed at theaters, can't say that it was for a long time in theaters and a lot of them were empty while showing this flick. If you are into Disney then this is a must see of course but it's like seeing bands the second time perform at a gig, the magic is sometimes gone, exactly the same feeling here.

		<shortDescription>Even worst than the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't very fond of Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland, few years ago, so it is not a big surprise, that I am not very fond of with this either. Even movie is well done and looks beautiful this kind of fairy tale won't assure me. Not even Johnny Depp as Mad Hatter's role don't manage. Maybe I am not a target audience of this movie. First movie Alice In Wonderland was actually quite average movie, but this sequel is even worst. Over acted and childish story is just not for my taste. Hollywood movie makers should take these sequels more seriously. Just to make almost identically sequel with first movie won't be enough of price of the movie ticket. There is some try to add some time travelling for story. That may sometimes be quite entertaining, but not in here. Alice In wonderland was quite average movie, but this is not even that. This should be direct to DVD movie, because this is not worth of a movie ticket. Wait until you get it from Netflix. I think it won't take for a long time to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Child Learns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I'm not reviewing this movie on how it doesn't correlate to the book because most movies fail at doing that anyway, and this movie is no different. However, alone as a movie, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a stunning Disney masterpiece and deserves to be watched with an open heart. This movie is a family movie and lives up to its promise of bringing families closer and teaching both adults and children difficult concepts such as time, promises and what hellos and goodbyes really mean to us. This movie should be watched not on a superficial level because every fairytale is not just about little girls and bunnies but each tale has a moral that parents want children to understand. Everyone can complain that the plot is too simple, or that Disney is doing this all for the money but when a family walks out of the theater and a child tells their mom, "Mom, I learned something" then my time was well spent and I don't regret a second of it. This movie is brilliant and I don't care if all Disney and Hollywood want is money, because that can't be completely true. Time is not money. Go to this movie, with friends, family or just by yourself and when you walk out you'll remember that you learned something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might have been the only one in the world that wanted a sequel to 2010's criminally underrated Alice in Wonderland, but whether you wanted it or not, here's the sequel. Alice Through the Looking Glass takes place a few years after the first movie after Alice has finished her voyage around the world. When she returns, an old friend from Underland leads Alice through a mirror which leads her back to Underland. She learns that her best friend, the Mad Hatter, has lost his "muchness." The Hatter found the first hat he ever made where his family was killed by the Jabberwocky, and he thinks that his family is still alive, but no one believes him, including Alice. The White Queen devises a plan for Alice to steal a device called the Chronosphere which will allow her to travel back in time and save the Hatter's family. All the characters come back from the first movie, although a lot of them are in smaller roles, but the real standout is newcomer Sacha Baron Cohen as Time. He and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen were surprisingly funny throughout the film and made for some memorable villains. Mia Wasikowska also had a reliably good performance as Alice. Through the Looking Glass doesn't have the thorough world-building that Alice in Wonderland had, but the plot is easier to follow in this one. Along with some breathtaking visuals, Alice Through the Looking Glass should please fans of first film with a fun and exciting return to Underland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual spectacle that does exactly what it sets out to do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw the first film from 2010 recently and decided to go see the second. While the first film was decent but dragged a bit in the latter half, the second installment has improved on nearly everything. As a family-friendly adventure film, Through the Looking Glass accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. The story has substance from the get- go, while I felt the first one took a while to build up momentum since so many characters and places needed to be introduced. The acting is stellar, and apart from Mia Wasikowska I was particularly impressed by Sacha Baron Cohen who brings a new both nuanced and fun character to life. One of my major complaints is that, while the Hatter is certainly a main character and the March Hare and Dormouse also get a decent amount of screen time, other familiar faces are somewhat underused. I would've loved to see more of Absolem, Bayard, the Cheshire Cat and the White Rabbit. This is very much the Hatter's story, and it also explores the Red and White Queen's background more. Regardless of script or characterisation, this film is absolutely gorgeous to look at, balancing between the possible and the insane. Costume and set designers and the special effects department have done a wonderful job and must've had a lot of fun doing it. All in all, Through the Looking Glass is a great way of spending 2 hours if you're a fan of the actors involved and/or looking for a visual spectacle. This is a solid 7/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited about watching this...and in 3-D...I was ready to leave the theater within the first 30 minutes when I figured this was going know where. There was no charm like the first one. It was poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly acted. I didn't care about any of the characters. (unlike the first one.) The green screen effects were terrible. In the first movie, it was all enjoyable. But in this one it was painful. What a shame. This could have gone so well, but it was if know one even bothered to take the effort. Save your money. Rent it from your local library if you wish. Don't pay any more than a .50 cent rental fee. Its like a puzzle where nothing fits. I was so looking forward to this. To boot, I was excited about going into a big theater with a big screen and getting lost in the moment. Instead, it was a tiny theater which only sat 73 chairs, and there were only 12 people in the theater, and kids sat directly behind be and kicked the back of my seat. Are you kidding me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not see Alice in Wonderland (2010), so I didn't really have a reference point for this sequel. It turned out to be a watchable movie, although it contained nothing which you haven't seen before.Let's start with the story: Alice (Mia Wasikowska) goes back to Underland through a looking glass where she finds out that the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is stranger than usual because he saw the first hat he ever made, which he thought was lost, thus believing his family is still alive. Alice then travels through time, trying to save the Hatter's family before they are destroyed. Time travel stories usually need sharp and clever writing in order to avoid illogical and inconsistent storytelling, this movie more or less achieved this, however the story was amazingly predictable and clichéd, the dialogues sometimes were really dull. One exception was the scene when the Mad Hatter and his tea-party mates cracked jokes at the expense of Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), that was brilliant. That brings me to the characters and the actors portraying them: Mia Wasikowska was solid as Alice, Johnny Depp brings his usual quirky mannerisms to his role (eerily similar to a certain Captain), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) had absolutely no business being in this movie, she literally did nothing through the whole time. My favourite character was the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), her character development was sensible and well portrayed. On the other hand, Time started out as an interesting character, but his love for the Red Queen felt forced and during the course of the film you began to feel that you can't take him serious.Just a few more thoughts: It was beautiful visually, albeit CGI heavy, and the Chronosphere ending was just plain stupid, Alice could have just dropped it in its spot before the rust froze her. Final verdict: 4/10 As I first said, nothing groundbreaking or innovative, typically a movie which you only watch once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised they ever made a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'm in the minority, but I quite liked Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland. As he said at the time ? the original Disney cartoon version was just a girl wandering from one random encounter with a wacky character to the next, i.e. no story. Yeah, I liked the cartoon exploits as a kid, but I have to agree with that description, so I quite enjoyed watching Alice turn into a knight and slay a dragon-type creature while Johnny Depp looks on.However, I sometimes think I was the only one who felt like that. The 2010 live action Alice in Wonderland was largely slated on all fronts and accused of everything from an overuse in CGI (er, what blockbuster film doesn't these days?!) to a lack of character development (um, again, what film doesn't these days?!). Anyway, because of the reception it received, I was pretty sure that would be the last time Johnny Depp ever plays a wild and wacky, exaggerated character (only joking, but I didn't think he'd hung up his 'mad' hat for good).So, we have the sequel ? once again Alice is summoned to Wonderland, this time in order to stop the Mad Hatter from becoming mad (no, seriously). To accomplish this, she needs to travel back in time to stop a cyborg from killing his mother. Wait, that's the plot to Terminator, but it was something like that ? insert 'dragon' instead of cyborg and 'family' instead of mother. And, if there's one thing that every single time travel movie has taught us ? it's that messing with the timelines never ends well. Or, in this case, makes for a bit of a hit and miss story.Alice jumps from one time period to the next, never really staying in one for long. Johnny Depp (again, fronting much of the promotional material) is left in the 'present' and only really stars for about twenty minutes of screen time, so Alice becomes an observer in one time period after another. This kind of gives the 'story' a jumpy 'sketch-feel' to it. Yes, Sacha Baron Cohen plays 'Time' (literally!) and is a pretty cool villain who we actually feel sorry for, as he's just doing his job, but really the story is just one set piece after the next.There are some 'real' elements set outside Wonderland that act as 'bookends' to the fantasy middle portion, but I'll wager you'll have forgotten the beginning once the Wonderland bits kick off. They're pretty much not needed as it's all about the magical middle.Personally, I preferred the original (granted I may be the only one). I could happily watch it again whereas I don't think that there was enough here to really warrant a second viewing. There was so little plot and what was there was pretty predictable. I doubt they'll bother making a third as 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is not currently performing too well at the Box Office, opening against the latest X-men movie and trying to bury Johnny Depp's off-screen antics.But, saying that, I took my Mum and daughter to see it and they both really, really liked it. What do I know? Maybe it's simply more appealing to 72 and 11 year olds that 39 year old blokes who would have preferred to see Captain America: Civil War, but was severely overruled?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say I was pretty excited about this movie and I saw it as soon as it came out in my country. I am a bit disappointed though. It is a good movie that is for sure, the characters are lovable (especially the Mad Hatter), we understand more of their backgrounds and the plot is rather interesting. BUT the main point of disappointment is the lack of this "Tim Burton style" throughout the movie. Although I can't really explain what was missing, there was a lack of maybe magic, fantasy, dream... in this adaptation. I would recommend you to watch it as it is interesting and a great leisure, but if you are a pure fan of Tim Burton and that you loved the first movie then you should probably refrain yourself from seeing this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to waste time. I think wasting talent is unforgivable, and seeing beauty without heart or feeling is pretty sad. In what must be one of the biggest disappointments of the year, there is just not much to admire not because of the fact that is not there, but because it has been muddled and distorted beyond salvation. One can probably look at still, it listen to bits if the soundtrack to see the individual jewels. As a whole, this film is just something to endure.Back are some of the original talents. Elfman is barely there, maybe not inspired by what he sees. Cohen struggles to make an impression and fails. He's buried under his costume and overwrought sets. They're the basic problem here. We find everything you can dream of but moderation or sensible editing. Did they have one or did they run out of time?In the middle of this chaos there's a seed of a story, a good one. However, I don't go to the movies to endure an experience. Alice must travel through time to save the Mad Hatter's family. time travel is always a terrific premise, but the effects, the overcrowding of sounds and visuals ruin the experience. This is perfectly obvious when the movie slows down. Then it has life, and when it goes back to the insane and chaotic, loud, and blinding pace, it sputters badly.There's also the wooden acting and aimless direction. Helena overdoes it again, Depp and Hathaway appear to be in a daze. Mia barely registers since the actors as well as the audience seem to be fighting the overload of visual and audio effects. This is a film that is painful to watch in IMAX because it intensifies the experience, which is not a great one.Overall, it's a film that might have a chance if someone goes back and does some serious editing, but it's going to take a lot of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look I understand that people in my age and social background like movies like this. The first one in particular, being so drenched in Hot Topic merchandise, won us over no matter how flawed it was. However, with this movie, it just sucks. I'm sorry, but it's bad. In fact, this is the movie that drives home the insight that these people simply do not get Alice in Wonderland. It is the type of bad sequels that squanders every speck of potential on theprevious movie. The script is awful, the acting ranges to bland to embarrassing, the direction feels lifeless, the story barely compares the originals big scope as much as it compares to Reddit fan fiction, and theiconographies from the original book remains as sparse and extraneous as the first time around. Out of all the bad sequels to movies, this looks to be by far the worst, simply by the virtue of people behind it not caring what they are required to work with.The level of terrible this movie possesses doesn't even prompt me to even pay mind about the plot, but it's more interesting to realize how the screenwriter is about as careless as I am. The movie literally starts with Alice living her carefree, adventurous life as a naval voyager only to have it all stripped away by her ex-fiancé from the last movie for a contrived reason to have her back to square one (because sure, that's how good sequels usually work!). After about 15 minutes of almost insightful commentary about sexist social life in early England, Alice then journeys to Wonderland (yes they used to call it Underland, but I pay little to that detail almost as much as this movie does) and discovers that the Mad Hatter is suffering PTSD from his parents' death. Grief-stricken, Alice is informed that she must consult the matter to Time, a being with the ability to both manipulate every hour and spew out really obnoxious time puns. Having realized that he and the Queen of Hearts are conspiring against her, Alice takes matters in her own hands and steals the Chronosphere, a device-turned-time-traveling- hamster-wheel to save The Hatters illness. Oh, and the Cheshire cat is in this to!Anyway, if you thought any of the plot points I listed would instantly make a great movie, stay away from this movie. Every story element, like all of the classic Alice characters the movie throws in indiscriminately, is half- realized and with no worth whatsoever. The real life scenarios, where Alice struggles against the aforementioned sexism in the working class, are all abruptly resolved with no hesitation or engagement, with not even an attempt to satisfy with fantasy world, a concept that at least the first movie got right. Whereas the first movie adjoins the two worlds via a theme of finding the confidence to be different, this movie fumbles this completely, having the main lead shift from "I will not stand for this oppression" to "nah, it will pass. You can have all I have."But it's more than just the final message; for a tired attempt to flesh out the Hatters and the Queens backstories' via an over complicated time- traveling concept, the movie lacks the subtlety and nuance to have us invested in any of it. Not only does the movie takes the lazy routes of backstories, the whole staging and execution invokes no subtlety and winds up being tedious, and that is to say nothing of the film frequently detouring to the side characters fooling around. I have never experienced a 3rd grade level script in the short time I spent watching movies in my entire life.Had this been the first film, the weak script would be levied by some visuals, much credit to Tim Burton. But this movie is stuck with James Bobin, late of two The Muppet movie. The attempt to fill in Burton's seat cripples Bobin to replicate his vision, rendering the whole production severely downgraded. Whereas the Muppets all he does is photographs real puppets, he fails with set piece spectacles and overuse of CG and green screen, thus making them look bafflingly poor. And no matter how much CG and over-the-top costumes and make-up piles up on frame, he just makes the time- traveling sequences look boring, the empty story look emptier, and the painfully predictable climax look uninteresting. The first movie may be little more than just style over substance, but at least the style came from a particular vision, and seeing someone trying to ape the same aesthetic is perplexing.The acting is all flavors of bad. Poor Mia Wasikowska proving her abilities in other movies, but here shes is out of her range. Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp both top this year's bad performance. What was once acceptable quirkiness from the first film now proves to be obnoxious once the film attempts to make them well-rounded characters. Only Borat, who plays Time, seems to be consistently fun in his role. Yes, it's clear that he's just marketing bait for the film, but he hams it up just enough so we won't get sick of him.I could go on bashing this movie (like saying how bad the jokes are and how the Queen got her head so big is beyond stupid even by Lewis Carroll standards) but I would just be rambling. Bottom line, this movie is an absolute waste of potential, notwithstanding my low expectations. Don't see it.For my complete review, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has very little, if not nothing, to do with the book. The fun thing about Caroll's two books is that they explain little and confront the reader with paradoxes and contradictions which appear to form a larger part in our language then we'd acknowledge for.That all is skipped from this film, as is the chess game etc. So why bother making a movie about Alice, and giving it the same title as a book which is world famous for more then 100 years. The answer is simple and cynical: because Disney c.s. are in it for the money, not for the art.If only they'd spent as much time on the scenario as on the CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than a cash grab.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I'm rather surprised that this sequel didn't come sooner than this. Considering that the first 'Alice' film, directed by Tim Burton, made over One Billion dollars. No, you didn't read that wrong, that film made over $1,000,000,000. So, of course this movie was bound to happen. Even though it took six years to make 'Alice 2' feels like it was rushed into existence. This is undoubtedly one of the most convoluted and nonsensical films I have seen in quite some time. But this one puts the worst Johnny Depp character of all time in the for front. The film opens with Alice captaining a boat for some reason. Why she is doing this, who knows! After that, some stupid nonsense happens and she ends up in Wonderland, again. Unlike the first time, The Mad Hatter is sick. He randomly happens across a relic from his past and he, out of no where, is sad about it. He thinks that his dead family is some how still alive and since no one believes him he obviously gets really sick.So, Alice steals some gizzmo from Time and journeys to the past to try and fix the Hatter. If my explanation made no sense, that's okay, because this movie makes no sense. There is absolutely no reason for it to exist at all and yet, here we are. Stuck with yet another Disney cash grab.The only saving graces of this film is in it's music and the occasional nifty sequence. Other than those two things, this film is a disaster. Not only does this film try to be a sequel but a prequel too. It jumps between past, present, reality, and wonderland so much that if you don't leave with a throbbing headache you were probably asleep.There is so much that 'Alice 2' is trying to do all at once. It tries to be a direct sequel but since it has no where to go with that it journeys to the past and becomes a pointless prequel. Ever wonder how your favorite characters became the way they are? No? Well to bad, this is how literally every main character became the person you know and hopefully love.The film is trying so hard to justify its existence with meaningless nonsense that it's almost sad. It barrages its viewers with enough CGI and color to make the strongest willed person crack. Whats worse is that all of this feels halfheartedly done. The CGI is so incredibly lazy that many scenes are just an actor or two in front of an obvious green screen. They never try to integrate it into environments, but instead throw their actors in front of countless green screens and pray you don't notice.When you do this to your actors it makes their performances incredibly unconvincing. You could have the greatest actor ever but if you put him in front of a green you are automatically diminishing his performance. Every single actor looks either bored or completely lost. Throw in a bad director and you get some really cringy scenes. Like when an actor is looking the complete opposite way of the thing they are suppose to be looking at.There is so much wrong with this film that it's near impossible to put it all in words. The CGI that dominates the majority of the screen is as bland as the story that is being shoved in our faces. Nothing makes any sense, there is far to much going on, and it all amounts to zero, nothing. It is so forgettable and boring that it may as well have never happened. I can't believe I am saying this, but just watch the first one again instead of this pile of steaming garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the Madness? Alice Through the Looking Glass unlogically tries for more logic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the rabbit hole lies Wonderland, a world where there is no logic and the most curious of characters are here to encounter a girl named Alice, who does her best to make sense of her environment. Rhyme and reason are deconstructed in favor of total madness. Lewis Carroll figured early on that any rhyme and reason shouldn't play a role in his book Alice in Wonderland. Rather then a flowing story, we get a series of events, similar to a road trip story, simply about a young girl who runs into various creatures like the White Rabbit, Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, March Hare, The Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, and the Jabberwocky dragon.The stories have been adapted many times, though my favorite is the animated Disney movie from 1951. That felt the closest to the random madness that the book was getting across. The biggest adaptation though is the Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland, that was anything but a word for word retelling. It was an odd blockbuster that put a young adult Alice into a political war and another prophecy plot that we've seen too often. It was creative at best, but forgettable at worse. Time to return to the Underland in Alice Through the Looking Glass.It has been about three years since Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska) took her journey and came back wanting to make a career through her fathers trading ship. She has now returned to London from China where she finds out that her ex-finance Hamish has taken over her fathers company and wants her ship in exchange for her family's home. Distraught on the issue, she encounters a butterfly as the former caterpillar Absolem (played by Alan Rickman) who leads her to a mirror that allows her to enter. This transports her through another mirror where she finds herself in Wonderland again.She eventually finds herself in the company of her old friends the White Rabbit (played by Michael Sheen), the Cheshire Cat (played by Stephen Fry), the Tweedles, the Dormouse, and the White Queen (played by Anne Hathaway). They tell her that the Mad Hatter has been acting more crazy then usual. Alice visits him, but the Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) asks her to leave. She finds out that the Hatter's family is what's been bothering him, so Alice finds the half man half clock Time (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) who has a machine that can allow her to time travel to find out what happened. Oh and the Red Queen (played by Helena Bonham Carter) is out for revenge.Alice Through the Looking Glass is a prime example on why you should read the script before geenlighting the project. Like how the last one was a political war movie, Alice should not be a time travel story either. In a world that's supposed to be illogical and nonsensical, time travel only sets more rules that make little sense. Not to mention that this movie is really lacking much of the madness that the animated movie has always gotten correctly. Alice is still a bore to follow. I've seen Mia Wasikowska give a good performance, but the emotion is so non-existent, that you question whether is was intentional. Everyone tries, but in a strange move by storytelling rules, the majority of the characters are only there to cheer Alice along. The only one I liked was Sacha Baron Cohen as Time who did get a laugh or two out of me. I just wish his character and environment was not in an Alice in Wonderland movie. The world of Wonderland is still creative and tries to throw a lot of visuals, but another problem is that the dilemma that Alice is trying to fix almost has no connection to her real world problem. In fact, the one time they go back to real world could have been cut out and nothing would have been missed!I'll give this three Tweedles out of ten. Alice Through the Looking Glass was not worth the six year wait (a long time considering that the last movie was a monster hit) and barley justifies a third return. I think it's time for Alice to get out of the Wonderland clouds and stay in the real world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this movie with my 5 year old daughter and we were both entertained from start to finish, it is what it is, a fun, entertaining family movie ! I don't know why this movie is getting so much hate from other reviewers, if you go into the movie expecting a deep, meaningful movie with Oscar potential as it seems some of these folk do then you need to give yourself a shake because it's not gonna happen, it's a happy go lucky Disney movie with enough about it to keep you entertained I promise you that. It goes along at a steady pace to keep the kids interested and I thought the actors all gave decent performances, and as always Johnny Depp is delightfully wacko and zany, to be honest I thought it was a super fun movie and I would recommend it to family's and adults alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice, through the looking glass is a very fun and entertaining family movie with very interesting plots and a great ending. I have been looking forward to see this movie since it went to theaters,but I could never find it online, until yesterday. I really liked this movie, but they had never explained what I wanted them to this whole time. How did Iracebeth escape prison? At the end of Alice is Wonderland, Mirana said that she would be imprisoned for all of her days, so did she let her out? Did she escape? They never said and that is why I gave it a 7 out of 10.One more thing I didn't really like is that Alice basically went to the past for nothing, she didn't really change anything. Over all, I think most of the people who liked Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, will probably like this equally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Enjoyed It More Than Most Sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a film I was hesitant to watch from the moment it was announced to be in production because it is a sequel to the live action remake of Alice in Wonderland that was inspired from the book by Lewis Carroll. There was a lot that could go wrong when making something like this so I just felt like something was bound to go wrong. Surprisingly for me, I really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons. First off the film looks beautiful, the graphics are amazing and the whole film looks the part. Second, I enjoyed the plot because I think the liberties they took still worked with the characters and the story itself. This is where you'll know if you'll enjoy the film or not, do you want to watch a Wonderland film where they explore the past of some of the Wonderland characters? If the answer is no, stay away from this film because I doubt you'll enjoy it. I personally enjoyed going back in time and seeing what they came up with. This film was not at all what I expected it to be, but I'm glad that it wasn't. It turned out better than I thought it would be and in all honesty I enjoyed it more than the 2010 version of Alice In Wonderland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Alice Through the Looking Glass yesterday and I was totally amazed. The cast, plot, visuals.. everything was perfect! I'm going to watch it again in 3D this week since I heard it's awesome too 3D. The good thing is that it's fun for all ages too, so I recommend everyone to just go and watch it because it's worth it. Everyone in the cinema seems to have enjoyed the movie and everyone left after the credits so I do think people on the internet are being melodramatic and hating this film for nothing.Also watch out for the soundtrack, it's amazeballs. I've been waiting for this film to be released since 2010 and now it's here and I'm really satisfied with it. I really recommend it and just don't believe all those negative comments and posts on this site.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In there attempt to create a movie as mad as the Hatter himself, they made one that was far too all over the place.I'm surprise the film did not revolve around Johnny Depp more. Since the sequel to Tim Burton's, Alice in Wonderland is an original story, you would think you'd give Johnny more time to shine, but instead they stay true to the original content.Mia Wasikowska plays an adult version of Alice whose adventures in Wonderland influences her to become a sea captain looking to explore the world, but when her friend the Mad Hatter is in trouble, she is willing to break time itself to save him.Sasha Baron Cohen plays the only new character in The mix as Father Time. Though I think ironically the Borat star actually has a Knack for kids moves (if you seen Hugo, you might agree) but really the material is not that strong. It starts off good with the whole fairy tale motif of Rhythm and Riming you'd fine in a good fairy tale story, but gets weak fairly fast with a noticeable clinging to special effects to drive the story.It's pretty boring all together with very few interesting moments to keep you glued to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Alice Through the Looking Glass" Is Shamelessly Worse Than Its Predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Alice in Wonderland" directed by Tim Burton was a flawless success at the box office in 2010, and with just reasons, the colorful and Gothic style of the team managed to give them two Academy Awards (for Art Direction and Costume Design) . Lewis Carroll's classics have been adapted to the big screen eleven times, and apparently it is feasible creation of other few. The scarcity of the sequel is Burton, his absence is irrefutable and although works as executive producer, his imagination and taste cries out for the reins of the film. This time, James Bobin (The Muppets) is director, his vision is broad and great-looking, but comparisons with Burton make presence on each frame evidenced. It seems that Disney forgets that it is better win a victory that a failure because of the ambition.From a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton, adapted to the books of Lewis Carroll, "Alice Through the Looking Glass" presents to an Alice (Mia Wasikowska) a little more older - really - returning of offshore after three years, preserving the illusion of return to sea. But her hopes are frustrated when her former aspiring boyfriend, Hamish (obnoxious and pretentious played by Leo Bill) takes over the boat her father and her house, inciting her to sell the important boat, stay with the house and with a humiliating and discriminatory work. Alice's problems do not stop there, the blue caterpillar (Alan Rickman, deceased and respected actor) visits her to seduce her to resolve certain matters of her interest in the Wonderland. After an characteristic entrance of the Carroll books, Alice faces a terrible - and stupid, excuse the expression - news, her friend, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is slowly dying. The only solution to restore the vitality of the eccentric young is go back in time and help to recover his family apparently dead, experiencing millions of adventures and eccentricities, accompanied by spectacular landscapes and performances for nothing unpleasant. A small sub-plot is seen to involved in the story of Alice, the truth behind the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and her sister, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), an interesting addition to the footage.The story is one of the fundamental obstacles, lack of a strong and wide idea, makes that the 113 minutes of duration becomes tedious, stressful and the worst soporific, making viewers to cover their mouths, but not of amazement, of boredom. It seemed as if Disney had chosen to adapt the drafts of the wastepaper basket of Carroll, yeah, they wanted that Hatter had importance in the plot, but the magic disappeared. A work of such magnitude should be edited precisely, but this time, they exaggerated.Fantasy and adventure sequences are indeed impressive, accompanied by an exaggerated, but required use of visual effects, minor or equivalent to the of its predecessor. However, the lush visual effects aren't the sufficiently skilled to hide a slow pace, an inconsistent script and a pale and slight story.Characters are distorted and dispel - some - of its strict behavior in books, however, Alice, Mad Hatter and the Red Queen steal all eyes. I'm in total disagreement that the role played by Mia Wasikowska is uniform, awkward and boring, not alluding to books and hampering adaptation, I believe that she is the precise woman for the role and if at some point has failed is the fault of the scriptwriters. Our blue caterpillar performed by professional and king of the acting ,Alan Rickman, was spectacular, serene and substantial, worthy of a so complete and amazing career of a man and an actor who will always be in the heart of the world, rest in peace, Alan.This is the first time that Disney surprises, and not in the way that everyone thinks. With a clear influence of female discrimination in Hollywood and the capacity to decide, Bobin and Woolverton had to leave their idea, just like that, an idea. Slow, lacking of the energy, palpitating continuity and charisma of its predecessor, "Alice Through the Looking Glass" offers a visually majestic spectacle, however, they confused the audience with babies, we are not stupid, so many colors and singularities lack narrative imagination, I think that the 'Wonder' disappeared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to Really Love or Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways Alice Through the Looking Glass is an easy movie to hate. The film is a sequel to the completely unnecessary Alice in Wonderland (2010) live-action reboot which became a hit largely due to their still being goodwill towards Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. This time around, the proceedings of the film take place without Tim Burton and largely sans Johnny Depp who's Mad Hatter monopolizes the plot but remains on the bench for most of the film. What we're left with is Mia Wasikowska's Alice whose blase lack of wonderment in the last film, sunk the movie like a skiff on shallow shoals.The film starts years after the events of the first; Alice (Wasikowska), now the Captain of a merchant ship, returns home to London where her father has passed away. Her mother (Duncan) has traded in the rights of her ship for backing on the family home all but guaranteeing Alice's wondering days are behind her. Meanwhile in Wonderland, The Mad Hatter (Depp) is unwell. He insists his family is alive despite tragedy striking some years earlier. No one, including Alice believes him; thus he withers away (for some reason). The White Queen (Hathaway) suggests the only way to bring the Hatter's family back is to talk to Time (Baron Cohen) who is in possession of "The Chronosphere," a time machine of sorts. Thus Alice goes on another adventure in Wonderland, which quite frankly would be better served without her visits.If recreating the same ornate CGI cacophony of the last movie was this film's goal then it passes with flying colors. There's certainly a lot to take in. The whimsical costumes and the merry, candy-colored set-dressing are certainly pretty. Unlike the original's over reliance on green-screen bravado, this one seems to have a fondness for the middle-England meets Willow (1988) aesthetic. The film is also serviced by Sasha Baron Cohen's dark, angular and severe costume which decently amplifies his character's motivations and demeanor.Yet the film's look is about the only thing about it that really sticks with you. The story doesn't reach the same delirious heights of it's trimmings, giving it's audience the same "save the world" filler we've seen ad nauseum. The difference here is the heroine plays with time-travel in a way that seems simultaneously convenient and lazy. How lazy you ask? Well at one point the entire plot of the movie, to say nothing of one character's future motivations seems to hinge on the smuggling of a tart.Mia Wasikowska acting instincts do manage to be much bolder and more interesting than the aloof supermodel detachment she seemed to imbue in the last film. Yet the Wonderland story betrays her by designating her as a vessel to witness things instead of a character with any sense of agency or will. Additionally the more head-strong Alice still doesn't bring the physicality required for either Wonderland or "real world". The first fifteen minutes of the film are meant to sell the audience on the idea that she's a down-and-out bad a** but her glaring daintiness conjures memories of Geena Davis in Cutthroat Island (1995). I'm sorry if it sounds harsh but Wasikowska can't play a salty sea captain (with a auspiciously form fitting gown) anymore than Danny DeVito can play Romeo.Boring, listless and lacking any narrative flair, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a paint by numbers hero story that can't help but feel as unnecessary as its prequel. It serves no purpose other than to entertain with bright lights and pretty colors while hammering home a message that could have been learned by the character within five minutes if she were treated less like a tourist and more like...you know, a character. But hey, Alice Through the Looking Glass is pretty to look at. So its got that going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the first movie only because it captures the true spirit of Alice in Wonderland. The heroine tries to define herself as she is divided between settling down to a life she doesn't want or embracing the unknown. This is also reflected in her journey. At the beginning she seems to be a much lesser version of her true self. She has to decide who she wants to be and when the movie ends she has found her place. The film is dark, targeted mostly to teenagers and adults which is an excellent choice.The second movie though is just a shameful money grab. Nothing is added to the story, the characters have no depth and Alice's journey is just superficial. The fact that it is targeted to young kids makes matters even worse when ridiculous jokes come up destroying the mood completely. In other words the true heart of the film is missing and I'm really disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Alice in Wonderland," which was delightful, I was very much looking forward to this production. Alas, only to be disappointed. This movie was what the word "lackluster" was made for. It pains me to say that. I love Lewis Carroll and I love Johnny Depp, but this represents the best work of neither. It's a waste of their talents, it's a waste of time and a waste of money. Indeed, I get the impression that even Johnny Depp recognized how weak this production was, and was only just punching the time clock to get it over and done with. Indeed, I really think this is the worst Johnny Depp performance ever. Most certainly the worst I've seen. So sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A less than inspired return to Underland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2010's 'Alice in Wonderland', despite being a box-office hit, was very much a lesser Tim Burton (whose 80s and 90s outings were fantastic, especially 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood', but he became hit and miss after his career low-point 'Planet of the Apes') film.That is not to say that it was completely terrible, there were some great things like the beautiful visuals and some good performances, just that with the amount of talent there was it could have been much more with better execution of its story. Like 'Alice in Wonderland', its follow up this year's 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is a very loose adaptation of the source material, where the only recognisable elements are the title, some of the characters and that Alice goes through a mirror, which will be of a disappointment for some.While there are people who think 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is superior to 'Alice in Wonderland', there are also others who think 'Alice in Wonderland' is better. For this reviewer, there are things that are improved in 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' but the story in 'Alice in Wonderland' is less flawed (while still being so) and it uses its cast better.Starting with the good points and the improvements, 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' looks wonderful like its predecessor. It maintains the very bright and eye-poppingly colourful look of 'Alice in Wonderland', while at the same time giving a softer and at times darker look. The chronosphere and time travel effects are very well executed, and it's exquisitely filmed. The standout set design is Time's castle, and Time's costume also stands out for the costumes. After being unimpressed by her in 'Alice in Wonderland', Mia Waskikowska's acting as Alice has come on leaps and bounds. She speaks with more assertion and has much more expression in her face, the character also having more purpose and intent.There are also a few good performances, namely an imposing and menacing but also amusing and sincere Sacha Baron Cohen as Time, who often comes very close to stealing the film, and a deliciously over the top but also tragic Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. There are a couple of good scenes, the opening scene is atmospheric and nail-biting and the scene in Time's castle is entertaining, visually stunning and has some suspense. Who cannot help love the seconds and minutes, they're adorable? Wilkins being one of those characters who does raise a chuckle but it's easy to feel a little pity for. The tea scene is sort of fun and has a rare sense of dread, but spoilt somewhat by going overboard with the time references and jokes.Danny Elfman's score has some nice moments, with some rousing and beautifully orchestrated and it at least fits. It is a very typical fantasy adventure score however, and it is one of Elfman's more forgettable efforts. Whereas many of his other outings (namely 'Edward Scissorhands' with the opening titles and "the ice dance") have at least one great and memorable track, this reviewer honestly struggled to remember anything from this. Most of the acting does not make an impression. Even when Mad Hatter is restrained and in torment Johnny Depp manages to try far too hard, his facial expressions constantly betray him wanting to go over the top and his voice bizarrely keeps going up and down with a slipping in and out accent and distracting lisp, this makes him come over as annoying which makes it far more difficult to engage with Alice's want to help him. On the other side of the spectrum Anne Hathaway looks completely lost, she looks beautiful but her performance has a lot of listless fluttery hand gestures and emotionless line delivery.Regarding everybody else, there is a lot of talent wasting here. Lindsay Duncan is compassionate but with little to do, but Geraldine James and Rhys Ifans are wasted and Leo Bill, even for a character meant to not be very nice, is punchably obnoxious. On the most part the voice cast are not used that well, with the most lines if remembered correctly coming from Paul Whitehouse, Matt Vogel and Timothy Spall (the first two's contributions entertain the most), though Alan Rickman in his final (posthumously) released film exudes authority and suavity even with very few lines. Despite noble efforts from Stephen Fry (once again purr-fect as the Cheshire Cat, but with not enough to do) and Barbara Windsor, their characters are too much in the background (true for most of Alice's friends) and the film couldn't have wasted Michael Sheen any more if it tried.Where 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' falls down most is in the script and story. Like 2014's 'Maleficent', Linda Woolverton's script is lazy with a lot of clichés, dumbness, very forced humour and too many strands not elaborated upon enough. The characters are bland and one-dimensional mostly with only Alice and Red Queen getting any half-way successful development (Mad Hatter would have been so as well if Depp's performance was better), and the voiced characters are too much in the background. While there is more going on here than in 'Alice in Wonderland', it's still by the numbers and without much heart or soul, with Carroll's kookiness, darkness, unique colour and sense of nonsense not much in sight. As a result of too many plot strands and the film leaving a lot of them half-baked with not given enough explanation (especially with the chronosphere and travels through time), the story is not easy to follow. The pacing is all over the map, with some rambling and drawn out parts (Alice's back story has more conflict and is marginally more interesting but take too much of the film up) and other parts feel rushed (much more time could have spent on the scenes when the film travels back in time).In conclusion, not a complete mess but less than inspired. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even all that visual spectacle can save a poor script and a story that takes too long to get things going.The sets were beautiful, the costumes gorgeous, the acting meh, the plot a yawn fest. Six years have passed, a handful of other live action adaptations of classic Disney animated films have been made and yet here we are, back in Wonderland. The first one did make a lot of money, but to make another one of these movies was a horrible idea by Disney. Only thing I really enjoyed in this movie was the life lessons it was trying to teach about honesty. I also enjoyed Alan Rickman reprising his role. Other then that it's a throw away movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly a lot better than the previous film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally I wasn't really expecting much from this film as I wasn't very impressed with the previous film, Alice in Wonderland (2010) however I was really surprised with how brilliant and how much better this film actually is, and it's definitely a big improvement over the previous film.It has a much better setup of the story unlike the film before which felt rushed, in this story Alice must travel back in time to save the Mad Hatter's life and from there it becomes an epic adventure through time which actually had me on the edge of my seat.Overall I wasn't expecting the film to be so good and yet I actually really enjoyed it. I highly recommend seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice through the looking bore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice Through the Looking Glass is the second attempt by Disney Studios to deliver a live action take on the classic tale. Unfortunately, no improvement or effort has been made over the last 6 years to make a compelling story or plot with compelling characters. This time we see Alice return to Wonderland or "Underland" to save the Hatter by going back in time to significant events in Wonderland's past. The biggest positive I can give about this film are the scenes in the real world. These beginning scenes gave Alice some needed depth. I thought the costumes were excellently done and the CGI scenery for the most part was pretty to look at. I also mildly enjoyed the character of Time, played by Sasha Baron Cohen, who by far was the most interesting character and had the best lines in the entire movie. Now for the negatives. There is not a single scene in this entire movie that I felt had any depth or substance. It was just Alice jumping from one scene to the next. The acting was flat and the CGI characters looked liked a cartoon. This made the film very disjointed, uninteresting, and felt like the screenwriter was improvising every scene and just finally gave up. I recommend you waste two hours watching this mess of a film and instead read the original Lewis Carroll book. You can thank me later. D+/four out of ten stars. -Rooster Reviews</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both my wife and I bought the first Alice on DVD and finally got around to seeing 'Through the Looking Glass' this past weekend. Very entertaining for both of us and not disappointed at all and having spent the money on movie tickets. We enjoyed all of the cast and the plot had some surprises. After seeing 4 decades worth of movies one tends to anticipate just about every plot twist.. which has the benefit of making you look like a genius to the younger generation! One interesting take away from the movie is how similar (I thought) that Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Time' sounded EXACTLY like Christoph Waltz's 'Cardinal Richelieu' from the 2011 "Three Musketeers". If you don't feel compelled to catch it in the theater then I would recommend you check it out on DVD when available. Nothing ground breaking but a lot of fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Wonders in Wonderland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice returns to the whimsical world of Wonderland and travels back in time to help the Mad Hatter. I'm surprised this sequel took six years in the making, regarding the tonne of money it made. By now we should have had a movie every year for Alice in Wonderland: spin- off, sequel, and prequel involving the Cheshire Cat. As its predecessor, this film is visually awesome, time travel and changing the past in Alice in Wonderland : this could be epic - this sounds definitely epic to me. As a whole, the movie has a great message: the importance of family, of being yourself, not what the world tell you-you should be and making your own path.I get that Wonderland might be an odd place but when all actors are acting insane - even the one supposed to be sane - it starts to get a little weirder than usual. Films are hard to make so I'm not going yo trash the director and being able to direct actors is tough as well, but I really noticed the lack of emotional consistency most likely due to bad acting. On a plus note, Sacha Baron Cohen character is efficient, he's actually not a proper villain, he's just Time and I won't spoil anything but you can clearly see Alice as the villain here. However, Helena Bonham Carter screaming and shouting all the time really gets to me after two movies of the same thing. Finally, the film itself looks like animation. Which is pretty weird when you realise actors are eventually alone on a green screen. They're many plots in this film and sometimes it gets overwhelming and you lose that wonder, you're no longer swept away in this world where wonder exist, where awe is so important and one man happiness creates an entire death trap that could literally collide the entire universe. Alice Through the Looking Glass had a hard time balancing all the stories.Overall I was entertained but also annoyed. I can probably say that I enjoyed that one more than the first because of the time travel story line maybe...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun little trip of a Children's Fantasy Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a lot of people are out to forget the one thing about this film: it is a family film that takes elements from a children's book to craft a story.Now, given that, it's not perfect. There are confusing bits and some strange acting from time to time but there are the brilliant bits as well.It's quirky and an interesting play with the Time Travel Paradox (a confusing conflict) mixed with the confusing world of "Wonderland". I do believe that is the mesh of confusion.A lot of the elements are play offs and adaptions of fragments of the books, just as was with the predecessor movie this is a sequel to. If you know the book you will see the randomness that is the Wonderland that the book has to offer while still given the unique story that this movie has to offer. I don't think many people pick up on the subtleties of the references (heck I did a book report in High School on the Alice books so I studied them).Well, as the story goes with Alice an adult now and choosing to make her own decision instead of having a man do it for her, her choices may come off as hard for her; and learning what's important from her friends in the other realm is equally important to her. A moral lesson learned as is a Disney trope for any film children will end up watching.Honestly, as a fantasy lover, and a lover of children's movies as well, I can seriously write this show off as being more in the children's category. If you watch some of the talks about production of the show it is clear that that is, indeed, their audience. That is not what I am basing my rating on, however (as I do watch cartoons every week).Now all that being said, I suppose I can clarify more precisely on the clarification of why the 7/10... Well, I've stated the acting is odd. Well, the characters are odd as they should be, but the acting seems odd and sometimes a bit weird and out of place and quite over-done on some parts. Truly, I found that the best character and the best actor of the film was that of Time, portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen, whose films I do not ever watch and have only caught him in passing in other films. His personification Time itself and how he played of Depp's Hatter and the Mia's Alice was really wonderful.In the end, I actually quite liked the movie. It was fun and entertaining, though, a darker family/children's fantasy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fun movie to watch (I'd even like to see it again)!!! I loved the special effects and all the quirky characters. Johnny Depp has always impressed me with "living" his characters, buuuut I think he fell short this time. I wasn't even sure it was him until I read the credits after the movie. Did anyone else have the same impression? (Meanwhile, the movie was great. I still recommend seeing it.)The whole "time" concept was cool; I enjoyed that. Helena really owns her character; I love how well she plays that part. Overall, this was a really fun and visually satisfying movie. I hope they make another chapter; I would see it! ...but Mr. Depp?

		<shortDescription>Dull, uninteresting and unimaginative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton was an interesting movie, filled with creative art and imaginative creatures and designs, while it lacked story, it was an entertainment, this movie, was not.The movie begins on a high note, with a visually spectacular scene, it was shot and filmed very well, but then moves onto a film that tries to be creative, but falls short due to a lacking of a compelling story. The premise of the movie was interesting, and could have made a very good film, but we are given an over the top mess, with god awful CGI in parts, and some of the worst green-screen effects I have ever seen.The acting in this movie is not bad however, with each performance being either good or mediocre. I was looking forwards to seeing Johnny Depp, as his performance in the first one was very good, here, it was a let down. His make-up is very bizarre, and he does seem like he is investing in the role. Aside from the first scene, there are no memorable moments in this film, and with the dreadful and boring plot-line, the film does not carry itself. It is not a 'bad' film, as there are few moments of laughter here and there, but at the end of the film I felt like it was unnecessary. I feel that if Tim Burton had donned the directorial position again, this film would have been slightly better. 3.3/10</fullReview>

In the recent film "Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016)" which of course Tim Burton was one of the producers turned out to be really good. In the beginning I had thought that it wasn't possible to take the film to the length that it did, by the time it got mid way through I was so much enjoying it that I had forgot that I needed to review it.As expected Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016) came out with the perfect cast, the story was fun and entertaining. The graphics were superb o say the least, this film had everything it needed to be a good film. I'm a fan and I believe the film held up great to my expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what many may think about this film, I loved it. It's far better than its more meandering predecessor--which wasn't terrible, either.No longer in the auteuristic grasp of Tim Burton, but just within reach, is a movie which isn't so concerned about contriving a certain tone that it loses what makes it organically appealing. This one is way more fun because we're actually on an adventure, rather than simply sitting through a series of disjointed events. Here, things actually happen.Alice is summoned back to Underland because the Mad Hatter is dying. He is losing the will to live. He believes his family is still alive, yet everyone is telling him that they've died. After holding on a little longer for Alice to come to his rescue, she also admits that she also believes him to be wrong. The White Queen convinces Alice that there is one way to bring his family back--to go back in time.Aside from a few minor time travel plot holes, the only big problem, if any, is the abundance underutilized characters. We literally get nothing from the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb, among others. They are there so we can say they are. But besides the occasional lark, they serve almost no purpose.We are, however, introduced to a new character, Time, played by Sacha Baron Cohen. He's the gatekeeper of the past, present, and future, and possesses a device that Alice must steal so she can go back in time. With a Schwarzeneggering accent, Cohen provides us with most of the levity throughout the film. He's not over-the-top and he doesn't overstay his welcome.Helena Bonham Carter nearly eclipses her performance from the first movie, convincing as the heartless, yet insecure tyrant, even long before revealing further depth in her character.With dialogue much more fit for following along, Alice Through the Looking Glass is easier to understand than the first film--which is odd since this is the one that features the main protagonist traveling every which way throughout the time circuits. Usually a film with this much time travel would get confusing, but the filmmakers avoid ever making it convoluted.Even though everything in this movie looks amazingly attractive to the eye, every beat is necessary. Every beat feels necessary. Every time travel. Every place Alice goes and does. There aren't any filler scenes.To truly appreciate this film, you must first appreciate the relationship between Alice and the Mad Hatter carried over from the first movie--otherwise you may not care all that much.There is a great vision for this film, and an even better execution. I loved it. Don't let the reviews fool you--it's enjoyable. One of my favorites of this year.Twizard Rating: 97</fullReview>

Now with the recent results of Alice Through the Looking Glass (Depp) and Money Monster (Clooney) doing pretty bad it was expected. When Damons' Jason Bourne comes out (in July) expect the same. These actors think they have a say in the political future of our great nation, they are greatly mistaken. The populace to a great extent will boycott these nut cases films!

		<shortDescription>It's a fun movie, but nothing new or revolutionary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start of, I found it entertaining, which is the main objective of a movie. That being said, it's a forgettable movie at best. And a cluster of rushed ideas at worst. All mashed together in CGI that at times, looked more like cut scenes in a ps3 game than a movie. The good parts are Alice. I like Mia Wasikowska's performance and she did great with what she was given. What she was given, however, could have been better. I liked the idea of Time as a character, but the way he was written pretty much ruined it for me. Top that with the over the top acting from Sacha Baron Cohen and you have a wasted character.The music is incredible. I do love what they did with the Alice theme from last time. The CGI was great at times. I liked the sea of time, or whatever. Can just imagine how it would have looked in 3D. I suspect it to look pretty bad home on my TV, though.A surprising amount of the jokes hit. Even though they are too many and mixed with the occasional slap stick moments. A few fun references and nods are also included. And that's pretty much it. Rest of it ranged from pretty bland to straight out bad. The movie opens with Alice captaining a ship under attack from pirates. Because reasons, I guess. From there we meet Hamish, who she was supposed to be married to in the last movie. He's a total dick. Absolem (Rickman) leads her an a chase throughout the house, ending at the titular looking glass. She walks through it and the story can finally begin. The hatter found some relic from the past, reminding him of his dead family. He states that its impossible for this relic to exist and because it does, his family must be alive. He tasks Alice with traveling through time to retrieve them, somehow. This lead to a lot of jumping back and forth in time, in an attempt at making this a sequel/prequel hybrid of sort that doesn't really work. As a stand alone story, it might have worked, but this mess feels rushed, stupid and tacked on. In an attempt at making all the characters you love, seem deeper, this movie gives you all the back story and answers you never asked for. Pretty much explaining why every main character are the way they are. What was whimsical and fun in the first movie, is now annoying. This goes for a few of the other characters as well, but most for Johnny Depp. He's becoming a parody of himself. To sum up. It's good entertainment, but will probably start slipping your mind as soon as you leave the theater. Still, it's probably a better experience in the theater than renting it on blue ray will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice is average at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Alice Through the Looking Glass" is the newest Disney film, full of colour, adventure, and whimsical visuals. Well, at least that's what you'd think from the trailer. Unfortunately, there's not much to say about this film. It's just an average fantasy adventure. It's very safe, it's light, it's just really mediocre. It's not bad, it's not good, it just is. The film features the titular Alice, who once fell down a rabbit hole, and now walked through a looking glass. Now, Alice is a sailor, and the movie starts off exciting enough with Alice evading a group of pirates who are stalking her ship on the high seas. But eventually she finds herself back in Wonderland, having to travel back in time to try and save the family of the Mad Hatter from a grisly fate.Unfortunately, the story is just mediocre. It's not particularly exciting, or interesting, or engaging. And speaking of the story, it makes too much sense. Wonderland isn't supposed to make sense, and it's not supposed to be easy to follow, and Disney making the movie so incredibly average and straightforward dumbed-down what could have been an incredible experience through a fantastical and insane world of imagination. The movie moves at a steady pace, and never feels slow, but halfway through the movie I really wanted it to end, not because I was excruciatingly bored, but because I just wanted to do something else. And when a movie can't even hold your attention, especially a movie that boasts a Wonderland as a setting, you know that's a bad sign. And unfortunately, I think other movie goers were bored with the film as well, because I haven't seen this many bathroom breaks in a movie ever.Even the visuals are average in this film. There are a few really cool shots in the beginning of the film when Alice first enters into her fantasy world, but these shots are all spoiled in the trailers. After this, it just looks like any other fantasy land that could have been in any other movie. It doesn't feel like Wonderland. Seriously, if the main character wasn't named "Alice," no one would even know this was supposed to be a story based off of Alice in Wonderland. I promise you that if this film was randomly on television one night and you accidentally stumbled upon it, at first glance you wouldn't even know it was an Alice in Wonderland story; you'd just think it's a generic, made for TV, fantasy adventure. Disney really had an opportunity here. They could've made this film great if they would've made it a bit darker, a little more adult, and added more of the craziness that I assumed they were going to add, based off of the trailers. (They only hinted at Alices' insanity midway through this film in a scene that is shown in the trailers but that I will not spoil, but after that scene it is never mentioned ever again.) However, this is just an average, mediocre, straightforward, and serviceable fantasy adventure that you can watch and then immediately forget about.</fullReview>

It is really rare when the second movie beats out the first but this one does just that. This movie is like taking you on an amusement park ride. This truly was a fun movie. Johnny Depp as "The Mad Hatter" truly owns his part for a second time. The makeup for Hatter once again made the character come to life. All the CGI was the absolute best and truly created a fantasy. This movie should definitely win an Oscar for special effects. This movie is fun to watch for everyone. Will see it a second time and buy the DVD. Loved it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the first Alice, so I was apprehensive about the sequel (it's not Tim Burton's and..well, sequel). However, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, sometimes the dialogues are far too unnatural, certain scenes are perhaps not very necessary, there were a number of moments when I wanted to roll my eyes;but the positives for me outweigh the negatives. I was glad to see that there was no "good vs evil" fight, that this movie was more life-like, meaning rarely there are any "bad guys". 2) It elicited a few laughs. No, it's not the most funny movie, but it is amusing at times. 3) The most important for me was the fact that it wasn't a shallow fairy tale. It talks about not only about the importance of pursuing your dreams and not conforming to some common standard (like it was in the 1st part), but also about the importance of family, the melancholy and freedom of letting go, the meaning of time and what we live our lives for. 4) Almost forgot. It's beautiful. Maybe my rating is slightly biased due to my love of "Alice" in almost all its forms, but still, I implore you not to believe the metascore and give the movie a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My review of Alice Through the Looking Glass (Spoiler free)*** (3 stars) Cast: Johnny Depp, Mia Wasikowska, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron-Cohen Plot: Alice returns to the whimsical world of Wonderland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter.All the original cast return to this garish sequel to Tim Burton's unexpectedly all conquering 2010 Alice In Wonderland. Though the original film had a sort of serious tone to it, the sequel decides to go much darker and a lot more silly which isn't a bad thing. We all know what Disney are like with sequels to, in this case originally OK-ish movies.The film is full of clichés and one that particularly stuck out was when Alice, made a conveniently placed Humpty-Dumpty fall off a chess table. It follows the story from the book very well it just falls flat after the first hour.Mia Wasikowska's Alice maybe more brave but she is also more clumsy, the Mad Hatter (Depp) is more irritating than the first and the real stand out performance comes from Sacha Baron-Cohen, who puts on a very convincing Werner Herzogian German accent as Time, so instead of calling him Father Time he should change his name to Furher Time.Here are some points as to why this is an OK sequel: From book to film: The film follows the book well but after the first half-an-hour to an hour the story in the film starts to fall apart, the book is a lot more serious an dark. The film is dark but as I've already said silly especially with Time, you see him making a cool-ish entrance and then falling over which is funny but over done.Working Factor: This is in term of Johnny Depp's character the Mad Hatter with the original film it felt that he was necessity, but with this not so much in fact it would have been better if he wasn't in it, or if Disney didn't do it at all.Landscape: The landscape is the only good factor in this film because the landscape is gorgeous especially Time's castle which is just, the part of the landscape which particular beautiful it's more of a room and the room of watches which is just a design triumph. Other than that James Bobin's Wonderland looks exactly like the first.Bad Points Over done gimmicks: The gimmicks more alternatively things that happen are all over done the main thing being that Time is extremely clumsy, which is over done especially with him falling off his convenient flying bike, when it happened once it was funny and in this case maybe gimmicks should only be done once.Clichés, clichés and more clichés: With Disney films the use of clichés is predictable but this film uses more clichés than the average Disney film. There are too many to count but if I was to pick one it would be Humpty-Dumpty see above.As far as sequels go this isn't the worst but it certainly isn't the best, it's entertaining if a little silly. The film only occasionally enchants which is just a shame. It could have better but other than that it's an entertaining experience.Verdict: Wasikowska gives it her all, while Cohen shines in this silly but still entertaining sequel that won't leave you feeling out of pocket. Will leave you feeling more curious than the first time round.6/10 good but not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning but Emotionally Empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Too many liberties are taken in this sequel which is visually stylish but emotionally inert. GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: Alice returns to Wonderland which is curiouser and curiouser to say the least. Alice Through the Looking Glass adds more than a mere word in its title and takes very little inspiration from Lewis Carroll's successful sequel of Alice in Wonderland. It fabricates new characters and a screwy plot to the classic tale with decidedly mixed results. This sequel of a sequel may still have many creative flourishes in its luscious production design, as did Tim Burton's 2010 cinematic take on that novel, but this movie quickly fades from memory, just like a Cheshire Cat's smile, despite its state-of-the arts wizardry.&#xfffc;Here, or there, Alice (a pale Mia Wasikowski, both in appearance and performance) returns to Wonderland. Years have passed since our last outing with this girl and our little Alice is all grown up. Now, an independent seafaring woman-empowered captain of her own ship, she eagerly sets sail for adventure and will later meet some old friends including the eccentric Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp, again at his hammy best), The White Rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen) and Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), The White Queen (Anne Hathaway, paler yet), The Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), The Blue Caterpillar (voiced by the late Alan Rickman), and The Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter, scene-stealer once more).&#xfffc;On her journey through the other side of the mirror, now known as Underland, Alice is asked to save the Mad Hatter who is quickly losing what is left of his sanity and is in dire straits. Our feminist heroine, who is constantly upstaged by the strange denizens she encounters, does indeed meet many new characters. Some are from the Carroll novel like Tweedledum, Tweedledee, and Humpty Dumpty; others are brought into this convoluted story-line such as The King of Underland (Richard Armitage), Bayard the Bloodhound (voiced by Timothy Spall) and Time (a buffoonish miscast Sacha Baron Cohen, outfitted in steam-punk attire and sporting a German accent which comes and goes like time itself.) The new assortment of uninspired crazies do little to enthrall.&#xfffc;Purists, beware! In this theatrical re-telling, there are no tales told of the Jabberwock (a mere mention), no Lion or Unicorn, nor any Walrus and Carpenter. The chess match theme is gone as well. Alas, this version literally has no poetry or insight. Humpty does have a big fall that is nano-seconds in length. However, the biggest tumble comes from the dumb screenplay by Linda Woolverton which lacks clarity, whimsy, and charm. Nothing could get this mess back together again. She tries to give some characters a needless back story to explain the characters' motivations and actions and fails miserably. Her script becomes curious-er and curious-er, especially when just adhering to Carroll's original story-line would have been a wiser and wiser notion.In this heavy-handed fantasy, our grown-up Alice's mission is solely to help The Hatter by capturing a sci-fi inspired object called the Chronosphere, which is coveted by Time and The Red Queen. The film is just a series of misadventures (including the script) that are strung together with the thinnest of narrative threads. The whole enterprise would seem as if it were much ado about nothing, were it not redeemed by its state-of-the arts dazzling CGI visuals. The look of the film is pure Burton, without its imaginative director. (Mr. Burton did serve as one of the film's producers and his mark is all over this venture.) Helming the direction this time is James Bobin who imitates the master's surreal images quite well. He keeps the action flowing and steeps his film with vivid colors and fancy visuals. The film is never boring, but it is never endearing either.&#xfffc;However, it is the artisans behind the scenes that accomplish the film's true sense of wonder. Kudos to the ever-present costume genius Colleen Atwood, a clever score from the prolific Danny Elfman, Stuart Dryburgh's richly hued cinematography, the eye-popping production design by Dan Hennah, plus the hundreds of artists creating the wonderful make-up designs and stunning visual effects.&#xfffc;With Alice Through the Looking Glass, there isn't much here to feed the mind, just the head with its bountiful visual feast. I, for one, can bask and admire the eye-popping splendor for quite a long while until my palette is in need of tastier morsels of wit and substance. However, if style and flash is your cup of tea, drink it all in! There's enough here to pass for entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went with my mom to the cinema to watch Alice through the looking glass. It was an amazing movie to watch. I expected The Time to be the bad one in the story, and the Crazy Mad Hatter to come out more. It was surprising that the Red Queen was good at the end! Also the head of the Red Quin wasn't so big always... Let's not waste Time. The Time, like a time hatter, he is bad, or good?we don't know! He kills people, BUT RELAX, not intentionally. He is responsible of peoples time, well not responsible, HE IS THE PEOPLES TIME! Alice and Time are friends and enemies, let me explain, something happened and he was very mad at her, very MAD-HATER HAHAHAhAHA, OK no. I like Humpty-Dumpty :) if he wasn't clumsy he would't be Humpty-Dumpty :).I recommend this movie because it is really cool and I am a big, BIG fan.Mountainsparkle</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the Looking Glass is fun and cute but unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sequel six years later won't garner much attention at the box office, but Alice Through the Looking Glass is a fun, cute movie with colorful imagery and a goofy time travel tale. Mia Wasikowska reprises her role as the titular Alice and does a could job as the curious and friendly girl just hoping to save her fantasy world from the trappings of time. The recently troubled actor Johnny Depp dresses up in a custom that might be more fitting to take part in a horror movie than a children's fantasy film to return as the Mad Hatter. The story centers around the Mad Hatter's desire to reconnect with his family who were believed burnt up by the Jabberwocky, a dragon ordered around by the Red Queen.Also returning, though next bringing her ex-husband to the director's chair, is Helen Bonham Carter as the big-headed Red Queen with a bad attitude and a pension for chopping off heads of those who displease her. Anne Hathaway is the White Queen and they all go by other names, but the world is too confusing to understand them beyond their iconic images. The cutest creature, and my favorite, is most definitely the Cheshire Cat, voiced by Stephen Fry.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They had to make a sequel, didn't they?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I really enjoyed the first movie it goes without saying that I was going to see this film, but then again I suspect that that is how sequels work ? capitalise on the popularity of a previous movie. The other thing is that Carrol did actually write a sequel to Alice in Wonderland, with the exact same title, however the only similarities between the book and the movie is that Alice goes through a mirror into another world, and in the Carrol original it isn't even the same world as the one from Alice in Wonderland (though since the original book is actually a nonsense poem, it doesn't really matter whether there is any consistency or not).As for this film we encounter Alice as the captain of a ship running away from pirates in the straights of Malacca. Upon returning to England she has discovered that her patron has died and the man whom she publicly rejected has now taken over the company, and wants to put her into the back office. Mind you, the people of Underland want her to come back, namely because the Mad Hatter has fallen into a fit of depression and is on the verge of death. It turns out that his family was killed in the past, however he discovered something, the first hat that he ever made, that suggests that this might be the case. As such Alice has to go back in time, after stealing a time travelling device from Father-Time, to try and work out what is going on.Needless to say that I did enjoy the film, though as I have hinted it is nowhere near as good as the previous film. Of course the main characters of the original film have been brought back, however we also have some new characters, in particular Father Time (who isn't actually an old man, and also a bit of a bumbler as well). Since it is not possible to change the past in this universe, there are a few events that happen in this film that lead on to events in the first film, though not that much. It was fun, but it still suffers from sequelitis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly an effective sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did like Alice In Wonderland(2010) directed by Tim Burton. Was shocked that he did not return to direct the sequel. I thought going into this it was going to be lame, even though the cast do return in there roles, I had a feeling they would have been sleepwalking through it. But I'm glad to say they did not. Everybody jumps back in there roles so perfectly it's like they never left.Mia Wasikowska slips back into her role as Alice quite perfectly, I thought Johnny Depp was gonna be lame here, but he really is quite the scene steal er has The Mad Hatter, with his interesting use of dialog. Helena Bonham Carter is also pretty good has the evil queen, in this film we dive more into her background on why she is the way she is. Anne Hathaway I felt was not giving much to do here as the white queen. Sacha Baron Cohan is also a scene steal er has TIME, he was basically doing a Peter Sellers like accent. He did this so his kids could watch this. I like the message it sends across, about dealing with the past, and that time travel doesn't always settle it. Not a terrible film, surprised it's getting some hate. The effects are pretty descent. A film for kids and adults to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet More Disney Cash-ins Down the Pike.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as animated mock busters go, Alice Through the Looking Glass is one of the least bad. It is far from a good movie, but unlike most other animated mock busters the DVD cover for it was really cool, and again it does attempt to do things differently to its inspiration Alice Through the Looking Glass instead of blatantly ripping it off. How Alice discovers leeching off the classics from Walt Disney's lifetime is also in my opinion more believable and makes more sense than with Jungle Book or Maleicafant, so Alice Through the Looking Glass deserves some credit in this regard.The flash animation(not CGI as the trailer seemed to imply) is neither terrible or great. Some of the backgrounds are handsome and some of the colours nice, but most of it is rather flat and spare and the character designs(especially that of the main seal antagonist) are rather limited in movement and weirdly proportioned. The music is very often the opposite of toe-tapping, and was in need of more whimsy and less of the loud action soundtrack quality. There are some genuinely funny moments here, but not consistently. Much of the dialogue in Alice Through the Looking Glass is very bad, the dialogue between the villains being especially face-palm worthy(i.e. the 'places to pinch' line, the Cheshire Cat's not-sure-what-to-think facial expression mirrors exactly how the audience will be feeling).Alice Through the Looking Glass is short in length at only forty minutes and has some very sweet parts. Not all the pacing works however, some of it is efficient but some of it is draggy and like it was trying to stretch out the story and the running time. Regarding the story, while there are some funny parts(which is another big improvement over most animated mock busters), there's not a lot to it(most of it actually is very thinly plotted) and a good deal of it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Particularly true to this is the dynamic between the main characters, not since Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales has there been a weirder and more senseless dynamic/pairing in animation(I'd say it's even more so here), if the movie gave a reason for the pairing and why the mastermind was the carpenter and not the walruss it would have been much easier to swallow.As for the characters, they fail to engage, with the exception of adorable Alice. The mad hatteris incredibly annoying with a voice that makes the ears bleed, having no real personality or motivation and is saddled with the worst of the movie's dialogue, his constant pessimism didn't come over very realistically and instead rather forced and the rest of the characters are bland. The voice acting is a mix of flat and irritatingly over-eager, nobody apart from the voice work of the chain-smoking catepiller which has a cute factor without being shrill sounded like they were happy to do this.Overall, not particularly good and lacking in a lot of areas, but actually has its moments and is one of the better animated mock busters around(which is saying a lot, as most of them are dreadful). 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will not waste your "time" on this sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2010, Disney's "Alice in Wonderland" was met with mixed reviews. Mia Wasikowska was criticized for her apathetic outlook on Wonderland, or more aptly called Underland. Tim Burton was bashed for making another family/fantasy remake. All around, the critical reception was not very good.Six years later and Disney and Mia Wasikowska return, but Tim Burton does not. Does Burton's absence make for a better "Alice"? Does Wasikowksa become more interested in Wonderland (this time we are not Underland)? "Alice Through the Looking Glass" revolves around Alice (Mia Wasikowska) who travels to Time's palace in hopes of bringing back the Mad Hatter's family- the Mad Hatter being played by Johnny Depp. As Alice rides around in the Chronosphere, a flying apparatus that allows her to travel through time, she soon discovers how set in stone time really is.2016 Alice definitely has an inferior plot the first. Alice having to destroy the Jabberwocky? How cool is that! Especially in 3D fun (although, if one remembers, the 3D version was not very good)! Here, Alice has to... get the Mad Hatter's family back? get her mom not to sign a contract? It is not terribly exciting compared to slaying a dragon. Yes, Alice goes in and out of time but to be fair, the audience is only treated to several flashbacks. Even then, no immediate danger is ahead. However, 2016 Alice is superior to 2010 Alice because of Wasikowska's performance. Here, Alice is strong, charismatic, and vulnerable all at the right times. Alice will not let sexist men tell her she cannot be a sea captain. Alice will prove to Time (Sasha Baren Cohen) that she can not only walk in his palace, but she can steal the Chronosphere from him. Alice will also greet the Mad Hatter with a vivacious and charming smile. She will also shed a tear for him in times of distress. This is a welcome change of pace for the audience because Wasikowska was as dead as the Jabberwocky in 2010 Alice. Alice had no charisma. No character development. You might as well hired a no-name actress to do the same job.Yet, 2016 Alice looks better than 2010 Alice. Director of photography Stuart Dryburgh did a fantastic job. Sets are purple, red, blue, and just about every Crayola color you can think of. The scenes where Alice rides up and over some waves during her time in the Chronosphere are truly breathtaking. 2010 Alice was drained of any color with its ugly grey hues. It was like the director of photography decided that the picture was too vibrant and decided to smudge all the colors. Ew. Albeit, "Alice Through the Looking Glass" is not better than "Alice in Wonderland". For one, the film is absent of the whimsical and funny nature that Burton's film had. Here, death surrounds each and every character. The Red Queen is also more vicious and unrelenting than ever before. And, if editor Andrew Weisblum cut the film by 10 minutes, the film would be less "Alice Through the Looking Glass" and more "Toy Story 3" (if you catch my drift). Likewise, what makes "Alice Through the Looking Glass" worse than "Alice in Wonderland" is a lengthy middle section. It might be cool to see how the Red Queen became a vindictive, dictator-like person, or how the Mad Hatter got his hat, but there is nothing here that furthers the plot. It is a shame because the beginning is extremely substantive. The film starts with Alice and her crew trying to survive a swaying ship from sinking, where everyone will end up like Jack from Titanic. However, what redeems 2016 Alice is its use of 3D. Every time there is a close up of a character or every time a character sticks out their hand, I wanted to grab it. The 3D also benefits from the beginning action and Time's never-ending array of stopwatches. 2010's Alice had very dimensionless 3D where nothing popped out at me, and there was no depth of field. To be fair, I saw both 3D versions at the same cineplex and with the same 3D projectors. How is that for reliability!In the end, 2016 and 2010 Alice both have their problems. 2016 Alice sports a better Alice yet 2010 Alice sports a more whimsical movie. However, 2016 Alice should do. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking, and Alice is a better fit for Time's Palace than Underland. Yes, 2016 Alice is not as great as 2010 Alice, but it is still a decent excursion. You will not waste your "time" on 2016 Alice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice Through the Looking Glass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6 years ago, I didn't find Alice in Wonderland exactly bad, but hollow and lacking of enough dramatic deepness to support its mottled settings and eccentric characters. And now, we have the tedious Alice Through the Looking Glass, which has nothing to do with the eponymous novel; well, there's a mirror, and Alice goes through it, but that's where the similarities end. Screenwriter Linda Woolverton preferred to take the road of an "origin story", exploring the past facts which contributed to the particular hobbies from the Hatter, the Red Queen and the White Queen; and we also find a new pseudo-villain in the shape of Time. One of the few things I liked in Alice Through the Looking Glass was the initial sequence, in which we find Alice as captain of a boat (in the real world), fighting against pirates in the high sea and the sexism of Victorian society on land. I would have even preferred (like it is implied on a moment) the characters from the Underworld to infiltrate into our reality in order to help Alice, or something like that. I mean, if author Lewis Carroll's legacy is already being trampled, why not employing another arbitrary invention? But that would have required a more creative and balanced screenplay, instead of an empty parade of special effects pretending to distract us from the fact that nothing happens on an emotional level. Speaking of which... Johnny Depp is the black hole of this movie. His performance as the Hatter is full of "tics" and affectations, but I never felt him as a real entity; it's just Depp maniacally gesticulating under his heavy make-up in order to charge his paycheck, and nothing else. On the positive side, the female cast makes a good work in their roles: Mia Wasikowska feels credible and enthusiastic as Alice, while Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway also display conviction in their roles, while having an adequate "complementary opposites" chemistry with each other. However, I found Alice Through the Looking Glass boring, and inferior to the previous film, which I hadn't liked very much either. In summary, another movie infected by the re- imagination virus. Not even a Chronosphere can stop that epidemic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this film, but if you're expecting a "book accurate" adaption, this film is not that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen a lot of negative reviews about this film before I went to see it and now that I have watched the movie I'm rather irritated by the criticism it got. I'm someone that has read and loved both of Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland books (they are actually my favorite classic novels) and I absolutely loved this film, not because it's like the book, but rather because it took the idea of Alice in Wonderland and its characters and created a new, interesting story. There was so much criticism saying that this film is nothing like the book, which is somewhat true, but neither was the Tim Burton film that was done before this one. Burton's Alice in Wonderland was inspired by a single poem from the novel Through the Looking Glass (The Jabberwocky) and also referenced Down the Rabbit Hole, but still had its own original storyline, just like this film did. There was also much criticism saying that the story was hard to follow, which I found to be quite the opposite. This film did a bit of hand holding and lead the audience through the plot to make sure everything was clear, but I personally find the criticism of an Alice in Wonderland film having a "hard to follow plot" a ridiculous criticism because anyone who read Lewis Carroll's novels knows that the "plot" is practically nonexistent and the point of the novels is the adventure, creativity, and absurdity. I personally loved much of the nonsensical banter in this film, but could see how it would confuse someone trying to make sense of it and apply it to the plot, but again I make the argument of previous adaptions doing this and being praised. Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland for instance, has just a tad more of a plot than Lewis Carroll's novels, but is still filled with even more nonsense than this film and yet it was better received and I think this is due to today's audiences expecting an epic tail with a complex plot when they go to see a film rather than simply enjoying movies as a creative art form. Another criticism I saw was that the visuals weren't as good as the previous film which isn't true. Yes the previous film used a bit less CGI and a darker pallet, but that was Tim Burton's choice as a director and a design technique that fit that films tone. This film used a much brighter colour scheme and tended to have more CGI characters, but this is because this film is meant to be much more lighthearted and there were many more characters that were too complex in design to not be CGI, but those characters were still unique and creative as well as properly rendered and well animated. I think most of the bad reviews of this film come from people who were expecting a true adaption of Lewis Carroll's book Through the Looking Glass-which, lets face it, would not have been well received either because of it's "nonplot"-. Or maybe the reviews are from people expecting another Tim Burton film-which this isn't, it's directed by James Bobin-. Or perhaps they come from people that would have liked a child Alice and then would have been more willing to accept all of the nonsense, childlike behavior and excitement Alice had in this film. In short I loved this film, and this is coming from someone who loves Lewis Carroll's books and who is studying film. If you're expecting a "book accurate" adaption, this film is not that, but it is still creative and fun and does capture the essence of Carroll's books, so I would suggest you go watch it and form your own opinion, but the only advice I would give is to go into this movie with the open and adventurous mind of a child.</fullReview>

Therefore, the Bigwigs among the thousands of folks involved with ALICE have no notion that her travails here constitute a perfect analogy for Disney's successful nefarious plot to FREEZE World Copyrights forever. ALICE may come to a happy ending point because the folks in Wonderland are NOT persuaded by crass and blatant bribes to corrupt Common Sense, Nature, and Basic Human Dignity. In Real Life, the Disney Henchpeople have discovered--like all other U.S. billionaires--that the U.S. Congress will decree that Black is White, East is West, and Satan is God for rather modest "Campaign Contributions."

For example instead of the cheesy HI- TOP family thanking Alice and the hatter +contract nonsense with the mother they could have just had the hatter wonder if Alice is a dream as she is leaving the looking glass (original book ) and Alice could wonder if life itself is just a dream.... Also this movie could have benefited from Sacha Cohen doing a better accent than his french Les Mis accent. The hatter could have been a more well thought character and Johnny Depp brought very little to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice Through the Looking Glass continues with the adventures of Alice Kingsleigh(Mia Wasikowska). This film takes place, some time after the events of Alice in Wonderland(2010). Alice returns to Wonderland. Here, she finds out that the Hatter(Johnny Depp) has gotten himself into a life-threatening situation. Alice will have to travel back in time, to save the Hatter's life. She takes the help of her friends in Wonderland namely, Mirana(Anne Hathaway), Tweedledee/Tweedledum(Matt Lucas), Absolem(Alan Rickman), Bayard(Timothy Spall), Thackery(Paul Whitehouse), Cheshire Cat(Stephen Fry), Mallymkun(Barbara Windsor) &amp; McTwisp(Michael Sheen). However, going back to the past to save the Hatter's life, puts Alice on a collision course, with Time(Sacha Baron Cohen) &amp; her old enemy, Iracebeth(Helena Bonham Carter). Alice Through the Looking Glass is a good film. However, I liked Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland(2010) better. Don't worry though. This film is as visually stunning as its predecessor. It just lacks the non-stop adventure &amp; humor, that made Alice in Wonderland(2010) thoroughly entertaining. The visual effects are otherworldly. The 3D is effective. I just think that on the whole, Alice in Wonderland(2010) is a more memorable film. I love the fact that we find out why our favorite characters, are how they are. Johnny Depp is awesome as Hatter Tarrant Hightopp. Mia Wasikowska is brilliant as Alice Kingsleigh. Helena Bonham Carter is outstanding as Iracebeth. Anne Hathaway is great as Mirana. Sacha Baron Cohen is spectacular as Time. Rhys Ifans is good as Zanik Hightopp. Matt Lucas is adorable as Tweedledee/Tweedledum. Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Paul Whitehouse, Stephen Fry, Barbara Windsor, Michael Sheen &amp; Matt Vogel are excellent as the voices of, Absolem, Bayard, Thackery, Cheshire Cat, Mallymkun, McTwisp &amp; Wilkins, respectively. Lindsay Duncan, Leo Bill, Andrew Scott, Richard Armitage &amp; Ed Speelers are impressive as Helen Kingsleigh, Hamish, Dr. Addison Bennett, King Oleron &amp; James Harcourt, respectively. Alice Through the Looking Glass is worth a watch, for fans of Alice in Wonderland(2010). Watch the film, with slightly lowered expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, if u liked the first movie there is a good chance u will like this one also. For all readers who like the books by Carroll u should be warned - the story of this Disney product has nothing to do with the original Alice Through the Looking Glass. So like the first movie this one is filled with CGI-landscapes and weird characters and some tasks and adventures to be completed by Alice (solid play again by Mia Wasikowska). This time Alice has to do some timetravel to save Wonderland and restore the order of the universe and we get some insight about the cause for the love/hate relationship of the Red and the White Queen. I myself enjoyed watching the movie like the first one but in no way I would say that these two movies are masterpieces or made big lasting impression on me. The last version of The Wizard of Oz - Oz the Great and Powerful with James Franco, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz was a far better made adaption of Oz world. But anyway, what u get is a little adventure-movie with some actors who apparently have fun acting like weirdos on acid. Cohen as Time is fun to watch, Bonham-Carter a professional crazy like always, Depp is - like Depp is, u like his play or not, but ofc after all the movies he has done the magic of his play is a little more than just worn off. Imo the biggest issue of the movie is its length - 30 or 40 min less would have been more because sometimes the movie just moves too slow and some scenes are not really necessary for the story.The one version of Alice in Wonderland I do really miss and I would like to see on screen would be the interpretation of American McGee's Alice/Alice Madness Returns - the dark, bloody, nightmarish version (video/pc games) that I liked so much to play. All ppl who played or know this games will understand me. For that at least R-rated-movie I would hire Zack Snyder or Tim Burton as directors or Sam Raimi. Ah, that would be a dark feast! Ofc no stuff for the clean world of Walt Disney Corp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Feast that Carries On The Wonderful Alice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The visual delight of sharp colors bombards the eyes with amazing, creative, feast for hungry film goers. This palette of rainbows and geometric magical forest of sites brings Alice-like wonder to the optic nerves. This sequel bursts with vibrant life developing its primary characters further in a strong female led role. This fantasy come to life offers a script filled with a meandering thread of life and death, of space and time, and weaves it magic in tender and sometimes action-filled circles. Predictable for the most part with a not completely developed tie up between sisters, this film is entertaining to the visual senses and a matured bed-time story for the imagination. The close-ups of Johnny Depp's character are sometimes the highlight of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Visuals, Wonderful Acting, But Mediocre overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, Hey, Hey it is Robbie K and I'm unleashing a second review for this holiday weekend. Today's movie is one that promises wonder, excitement, madness, and of course Disney magic. Yes, today's review is on Alice through the Looking Glass, an unexpected sequel given that both of Lewis Carroll's stories had already had films dedicated to them. Nevertheless James Bobin and Disney studios are giving it another go to bring Wonderland (or is it Underland?) to life. So why don't we get started with?THE GOOD:? Beautiful world and creature design ? Plenty of Comedy ? A decent beginning ? Good acting One thing I always love to see in these movies, is the design teams' ability to bring Wonderland to life. Through the Looking Glass once more grabs hold of us and drags us into the trippy imagination of Carroll in glorious detail. Brilliant colors, twisted towers, and distorted scenery are all present in spectacular effects that immerse you into the world. And filling the landscape are bizarre creatures who add their own touch of magic to scenes, each befitting of the environment they are in. The new minions of Time and The Red Queen will entertain young ones and are a welcome addition to the CGI world. Unfortunately, they (alongside the classic characters) are somewhat underutilized in this movie (more on that later). While the world is thrilling and impressively designed, it is not the only thing entertaining in this film. Through the Looking Glass has plenty of laughs within the two hour run time that will have both young and old laughing alike. For this reviewer, the writing had some well-developed puns and jabs that had the theater chuckling. The Time puns are somewhat clever, but do get a tad stale at times when they abuse the simplistic comedy. Alice, the Red Queen, and The Mad Hatter also get some unique one-liners in as well, the timing more comedic than the actual lines themselves. But it's actually the acting that truly brings the punch. Cohen as Time was a perfect casting call, as he was able to deliver great accents, annoyed looks, and some original material were the funniest aspects for me. In terms of story, how did this original tale fare in my books. The opening was well developed, a fantastic introduction that reintroduced to the lives of our characters while setting up the dilemma at hand. Once Alice steps back into Wonderland, the mystery begins and the suspense builds as you try to uncover all the secrets at hand. It's the second half of the movie where the problems hit. Speaking of which, let's hit on?.THE BAD:? The second half of the film ? Under utilized characters ? Missing some of the magic The second half of the film was not nearly as developed as the opening and felt a bit rushed in my opinion. After a great set-up, the solutions began to come too fast, and there seemed to be little challenges standing in the way of Alice and company. Even the Red Queen's threats felt a bit shallow at points and she was nowhere near as menacing as the first (I missed her powerful beasts). In addition, the time travel tale began to unravel and they found a convenient loop to bring the final dilemma at hand. A nice try for originality, but the execution needs some fine tuning to deliver the satisfying finish.In addition the characters were not nearly as integrated as the last film. Old classics like the Cheshire Cat, White Rabbit, and the Door Mouse had key parts in the last film. But in this sequel many of them dropped into the background where they managed to make a few fun comments or look cute before disappearing again. The White and Red Queen got a little more time thanks to their story, but as mentioned earlier their characters seemed a bit diluted compared to what we saw eight years ago. But don't fret because Time, Alice, and the Hatter are the key players in this story and as such will be the ones you see the most of, which isn't a bad thing just disappointing that our characters couldn't all be in the show longer. Which brings me to the final weakness, missing the magic. We have a lot of great things in this movie, but something about it feels off from Alice's other adventures. Maybe it was the rushed ending of the story, or maybe the lack of key character integration, but Through The Looking Glass is missing the oddness its predecessors have. And with the lack of threats from rampaging beasts and a tyrannical queen, the dilemma was much less suspenseful than I wanted. I also feel this story took a turn down the PG lane, which may not have been the best move creative wise. THE VERDICT:Through The Looking Glass certainly has a spectacular look and has some of the adventure we loved in the first installment. In addition the actors play their parts well, and the writing is great in terms of adding a comedic zest to the cuisine. Yet it still is missing some of the magic and wonder that Tim Burton brought us and makes this film duller than I had expected. I think that the visuals took a little more precedence than the second half of the story, as well as not integrating all the characters into the tale. Thanks to this?I have to recommend this one for a Redbox rent at home instead of a theater visit. Should you choose to hit the movies for this one, I encourage a 2-D showing to save some money. My scores are: Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the end of time..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole cast returns from Alice in Wonderland (2010) but with Tim Burton taking a producer seat and letting Muppet Director James Bobin take the reins, no offence. With a couple of additions, one being Sacha Baron Cohen who incidentally previously worked with Bobin on most of his Ali G series. The other addition being Rhys Ifans playing the Hatter's father. It opens well, and considering it's all about time travel it's paced rather well too. It's incredibly crazy-colourful especially the dress Alice wears to the party. And Bobin does good keeping the same feel as its predecessor, but I think that's got a lot to do with the cast. The colour makes a great contrast for the darker moments which are plentiful. Sacha plays the personified character of Time and he does exceptionally well. His clockwork castle and minions look impressive, transforming seconds into minutes and minutes into hours; even his Iron Mannish bodyworks look spectacular. My favourite set of the picture. The rest of all-star cast reprise their roles respectful though again, Helena Bonham Carter is amazing. Has a 'done-before' time travel scenario but that's forgivable ultimately being a family film, it's easy to follow and gives an interesting back story to the former Queen of Hearts, Iracebeth and carries an important moral message about wanting to change the past.The climatic conclusion with the end of time was fantastic, really enjoyed looking at how everything was getting taken over and coming to a complete rustic stop. Just that scene alone was worth the whole movie. Thought predictable I still enjoyed it. Carrying much from the first film, it reminded me very much of The Return To Oz (1985) especially of Tik-Tok. Also Labyrinth (1986) and the poor sequels to The Neverending Story (1984) (would actually welcome a reboot of Neverending Story.) Depp's MadHatter reminded me of American Comedian Carrot Top! It's an average film, easy-going entertainment but definitely below par for a Disney movie. Just lacked character investment, I didn't feel any empathy for any of the characters. Maybe I'm becoming too cold-hearted or maybe the old cast look, tired. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 8 Direction: 7 Story: 5 Script: 4 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 5 Job Description: 5 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 Sacha portraying Time and when the time comes to end. 68% 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just love how people on here turn into "seasoned critics" when leaving a review. Well don't pay any attention to these stiff shirts. It's a fun, extremely colorful movie that's a little off the wall, but then again we are talking about Disney &amp; Tim Burton. It moves along nicely, doesn't drag, and keeps your attention. It's not great, but it is better than good. You're already familiar with the characters so it doesn't doddle with character recaps. I for one really enjoyed it, and that's what movies are all about.- You really don't have to bother with the rest of this, apparently IMDb has changed their rules and require ten lines of drivel before a review will be accepted for posting, so therefore I will drivel on about nothing really until I fill enough nonsensical lines in order to meet their ridiculous requirements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What. Is. Happening.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the pros of this movie. The score provided by Danny Elfman was beautiful, with a nice improvement on the original Alice (in Wonderland) theme and more great new music to match. The CGI and practical effects were great, with some nice cinematography as well. The designs of the items and places were very cool, with the costumes in particular really suiting the characters ("if it's good enough for the Dowager Empress of China it's good enough for the Ascots!").However, this is all in service of a story so lunatic and untrue to the first one that not even the Hatter could've made it up. In the first movie, things made sense. "Alice slays the Jabberwocky" is a simple goal (for Alice) and an inevitable climax. Now, Alice must...time travel? Get her mom to not sign a contract? Return and/or steal the Chronosphere? Come to terms with the inevitability of Time's march and not have crushing existential crises with the realization that all these concepts suddenly have corporeal manifestations?! This script is A MESS! I truly am sorry that all the people involved who were committed to this project had to see it through to its manic finish. A movie shouldn't leave people wondering "what the **** happened here!?"P.S. The pointless throwaway asylum scene included because of Andrew Scott didn't help matters, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't understand the negative views at all. I thought it was great. I was worried about going to see it after reading the negative reviews but it ended up being better than I thought. More fantasy than the first one so if you love fantasy, you'll love this film. It was pretty dark too. Intro of new characters who I really ended up liking. The actors did great just like in the first one. It definitely focuses on Mad Hatter and Alice the most and I love those two characters together. I brought my almost 7 year old daughter who sat through it better than Zootopia. She definitely loved it and it is great for the kids. It also had me feeling different emotions. I felt a little terrified at times, in a good way, I laughed, and at times felt sad. The entire movie theater clapped when it ended so I'd say we all really enjoyed it. I will be buying it on DVD when it comes out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Negative Reviews Are Simply Being Melodramatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No. This movie does not correspond with the book of the same title, I can sort of understand why people would be a little disappointed with that, however!! for those claiming that the plot doesn't make any sense or that it is all over the place; have you ever read a Lewis Carroll book??? I genuinely thought that all of the acting was perfectly suited to the style of the movie, the special effects were beautiful and as whimsical as I would have hoped for being an Alice story and although it may not have been a match to the book, it is a completely believable (in relation to Alice and her friends) extension of what Alice could have become as an adult.Those leaving shockingly low ratings are simply being way too melodramatic about the authenticity of it (or lack thereof) and quite honestly dull. It is a beautiful, fun and wonderfully bizarre film. Kids will love it just as much as grown ups!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Similar to a lot of people who have also reviewed this film, I have enjoyed the stories of Lewis Carroll since I was a child so of course I was both excited and apprehensive about the new film. Unfortunately, the film did no justice to Lewis Carroll's' stories of wonderland however putting the book aside the film impressed me regardless. I enjoyed the story line, I think one notable fault is that it was somewhat predictable which made me worry that it would also be dragged out and tiresome but that wasn't the case at all, I was entertained throughout. Due to so many poor critic reviews I was expecting the worst from the story line, but now after seeing it I would say those reviews were unfair, granted the plot was quite simplistic it still managed to be enjoyable regardless of whether you're an adult or a child, it truly was a movie that was made for everyone. There was significant improvement in Mia Wasikowska's acting in comparison to the Alice in Wonderland that was released in 2010, I think without Sacha Baron Cohen the film wouldn't have been nearly as good. I was surprised that Sacha Baron Cohen was casted to play Time but he did a terrific job he portrayed various emotions and did them all wonderfully. I was also surprised that Johnny Depp didn't feature in the movie as much as he normally does but during his scenes he acted well, however Anne Hathaway is a brilliant actress but I don't think she worked to her potential in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chaotic to a fault, this journey return to Underland has manic, trippy and inventive visuals with a simple yet busy story, while managing to overcome its' own flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been hesitant about this movie since it was announced. After the mixed reception the first one got (even though I quite liked it), it's unlikely for me to be hyped for this sequel. Based on the negative reception this one got, I'm more reluctant to watch it. But, I gave it a chance, and it turns out better than I initially expect it to be. Set a year later after "Alice in Wonderland", Alice Kingsley now becomes a captain of her father's ship. After an incident with pirates, she returns to London, only to find out that her father's ship will be sold by her mother to her once soon-to-be fianceé Lord Hamish or she'll lose her own home. Soon after, Alice thrusts herself back into Underland, with the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) being unwell and needing her help by going back through time while racing against Time (Sasha Baron Cohen) itself.I think I'm in the minority here who thinks this movie is great. It seems like there's so much going on when actually it's really simple to follow. As I thought it was going to be incoherent, it flows along nicely. There's a sense of union in it's theme, with the importance of family as one of them, including a timeless message that you can't change the past but learn from it. Every character from its' predecessor returns with a few additional ones. I love the fact that they give a few characters their backstories, like the Mad Hatter's family to the rivalries between the Red Queen and the White Queen. Mia Wasikowska turns out better as Alice here than the first one, who was a bit dull and uncharismatic. In here, she's livelier. Speaking of lively, the special effects and production designs are spectacular. It's sort of trippy, gorgeous and thrilling at the same time, including a scene in the climax that's bursting with manic energy. I have to say, it's one of Disney's best efforts in making visually inventive images.Alas, there are some flaws that I can't ignore, beginning with the screenplay. This isn't one of Linda Woolverton's best efforts. Mia Wasikowska did her best effort as Alice. The side characters weren't fully developed and a bit too two-dimensional, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter, reprising her role as the Red Queen and Sasha Baron Cohen as Time, who gives a bit subtlety to his role. They both managed to elevate the material a bit, while the others fade into the background. Some of the lines were too simplistic and forced. There's one scene in the middle which I won't spoil, that drags the movie a bit. You'll know it when you see it.That being said, it doesn't detract anything from the viewing pleasure. For those who say it's boring and doesn't have a sense of magic or wonder, I really have to disagree. At times, it's quite touching and deep. It's not as audacious as its' predecessor and even though it's not very original, they twisted it into their own unique vision, giving its' own originality. It does have its' own flaws, but I think it managed to overcome it. I can't really compare and say it's better than the first one, only at some areas (the first one has it's own weird scene where Johnny Depp is break-dancing, which is quite off-putting). I would give it more stars if it fixed the screenplay. Yet, I enjoyed it.Note: This is Alan Rickman's final role as Absolem the Catterpillar. He will certainly be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While director Tim Burton decided to give a dark and adventurous for the first Alice, this one is done completely differently. Director James Bobin (Director Of The Muppets movies) decides to give the sequel to Alice a go. While he ain't no Tim Burton, he certainly had a go.The CGI is still as bad as the first one, so it's no surprise to us that they kept everything the same. All the characters return, some get more screen time than others, which might be a disappointment to who you choose your favorite character to be. Mia Wasikowska seemed to be performing better here than she did in the first one. She's really good at playing this role. Johnny Depp was more in character this time than he was in the first one. Sacha Baron Cohen steals the show as playing the character "Time." His German accent went well with the character.While there were many scenes in the movie that were good and were entertaining. We just couldn't get into it. The movie was too slow and all the characters once again are all unlikable. Even Anne Hathaway (playing Mirana) and Helena Bonham Carter (Playing The Queen Of Hearts) are completely over exaggerated.It's not a horrible movie, but we would never pay to see it again. Only see it if you really must. Autistic Reviewers gave this 2/5 stars. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't know why so much people hated this movie and the first one. When i was watching the movie, i wasn't worried about the negative response, because i loved the world they created and because of that, i knew that i was going to enjoy this movie, and that's EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED! This sequel it's just as good as the original or even better. The visual effects are so much better now and the photography it's stunning! This movie doesn't have the dark tone that Tim Burton used in the first one and that's a good thing and you can explore this rich world much more deeply. The characters are charismatics and they add much to the story. The cast it's once again WONDERFUL with particularly praise to Mia Wasikowska, who is more confident and plays a much bigger role. Once again, Disney hits to revive its classic movies but i'm sad that people didn't like this one, because I REALLY LOVED IT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The emotional dryness of "Alice Through the Looking Glass" is so vast and unsettling it made my head ache. Not even a talented and experienced director like James Bobin could manage to save one of the most disastrous screenplay ever to be adapted in recent memory, bringing to the screen a story that is duller and more uninteresting than its predecessor (which is saying something) and makes no justice to Lewis Carroll's rich world.This movie admittedly has a couple of things going for it: firstly it is never so bad I got angry at it, it is just boring to the point that it made me feel dizzy every five minutes and I'm sure I lost something in the mix because my eyes were constantly about to close. But we were talking positives: James Bobin demonstrates he is a good director here, he makes whatever is possible to make out of this mess. The integration of practical effects with CGI is definitely improved over the first film, the design and color is definitely the element that saves the film from an abyss of dullness. There are also some remarkable visual cues here and there that show Bobin's eye for cinema and comedy. Helena Bonham-Carter is as always entertaining and has just a couple of really funny moments, plus the score I must admit is quite good.And that's it. For the rest we are treated to an assault to our brain that has one of the most incoherent and despicable stories I have ever had the displeasure to experience. It is so mind bending how bad this is from its basic story structure it deserves a whole beat-by-beat analyzed commentary to teach what's wrong for story. Every line or action could be literally ripped apart, I never ever felt a genuine emotional connection with anybody, I was never given a reason to do so.Characters exposing the plot constantly, a whole throwaway sequence where Andrew Scott appears out of nowhere for sixteen seconds for absolutely no reason, an incoherence of internal story logic that goes beyond what I can explain, a story message that is so confused and nonexistent the movie literally turns it around for itself, a plot that dictates story at every turn, predictability in every single climactic moment, suddenly there are transformers in the Alice universe, character relations being so undramatic they start to look like parodies, you name it this movie has it all, I could not believe it, it was frustratingly boring and if there's one thing a blockbuster, visual extravaganza film should not be, it is exactly that.Disney has had its first terrible quality flop in sometime and its a real down step, I am sorry for all the talent involved which I am a fan of, but this film is not recommendable, child, kid or adult I can't see what anyone would find to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Visuals/Messy Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Alice Through the Looking Glass", starring Johnny Depp-The Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Secret Window; Mia Wasikowska-Crimson Peak, The Kids Are All Right; Anne Hathaway-Les Miserables_2012, Ella Enchanted; Helena Bonham Carter-Les Miserables_2012, Fight Club and Sacha Baron Cohen-Les Miserables_2012, Talladega Nights:The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.This is a sequel to the 2010 'Alice in Wonderland', which was directed by Tim Burton. This one is directed by James Bobin-Muppets Most Wanted, The Muppets, Da Ali G Show_tv-and Tim is only a producer. Maybe, just maybe, that is why this one is not as good. The looks of the film are great but the story.....not so good. Mia returns as Alice, who travels back to Wonderland for another adventure. It seems that Johnny/Mad Hatter is in a serious depression, missing his presumed dead family. Mia is on a mission to find out exactly what happened to Johnny's family and ends up meeting Sacha/Time, a man in charge of time itself-I guess that is why he is just called Time. Mia steals a time travel device and when she uses it, Time-and all of regular time too-is thrown out of whack. She-and, of course, the audience-do get to learn the origins of Johnny and the White &amp; Red sister Queens, Anne and Helena. You also get to learn how Helena got such a huge head. Alan Rickman voices the caterpillar, now a butterfly, in this, his last film appearance-I think the movie was released about 4 months after his death. As the end credits start, there is a dedication to him. It's rated "PG" for action, peril and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 53 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-the first one was better-but it would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All About The Time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you couldn't tell, Alice Through The Looking Glass is about time itself. There is even a person named Time played by Sacha Baron Cohen. I like the idea of time in this movie. He ends peoples lives by closing stopwatches and puts the stopwatches in the deceased section of his castle. But he is probably the most inept character in the whole entire film. Before I begin talking about what I liked, let me tell you what me and my sister (who went to see the film with me) really disliked. The movie is extremely preachy with it's message. It hammers it into are heads giving us brain damage in the process. The message of Time is precious is a dumb and obvious message. OF COURSE TIME IS PRECIOUS! Who wouldn't think that? The whole movie is Alice traveling in time. Time trying to restore time. Alice trying to restore time. Saving the universe from time itself. It is the most ridiculous thing ever.Why do we have to have this overused and obnoxious message slammed into our faces? I like messages in movies that are vague. The Lego Movie which I continue to talk about to this day has a very great message but it's also vague enough for everyone to see. This movie is too preachy and tells us the message right away at the beginning of the movie and has extremely heavy handed symbolism to play with.Now that I have gotten that out of the way, the movie is absolutely ridiculous even for an Alice in Wonderland movie. The whole film has a story that is to stupid for it's own good. Johnny Depp's Hatter character you can barely hear what he is saying. It's like hes trying to add a T and a H to every sentence he says. The movie has way to predictable lines and twists that most people can see coming from miles away. The movie is dumb. That's what I'm trying to say.I would say from what I have told you that it's a so bad it's good movie, but in fact, I mostly enjoyed a lot of moments in the film in all seriousness. The colors and visuals are much more sharper and cleaner then it's 2010 counterpart which is a huge refreshment, Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen is fun and has more character. I enjoyed the scenes with younger versions of the Wonderland characters.But unfortunately, some of the acting is stuff you would see in a Wachowski Siblings film. Dry, Deadpan and emotionless. James Bobin (Who made the fantastic 2011 Muppets Movie) could have done a much better job with the actors. The movie needed more flare in emotion instead of focusing on solely and only on it's message. If you don't know whether or not you should see Alice Through The Looking Glass, I suggest you wait for it to come to Netflix or Blu Ray. The movie can easily be skipped. But if you really want to see it, then go in knowing this is like a Sunday School Class only about time. It's a really good film in my opinion, but unfortunately, the movie is rather too preachy.89/100 B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, if you want an entertaining film, by all means try Alice Through The Looking Glass. It certainly isn't for everyone but it might fill some time on day. But you arguably want more from a film that using it to just pass some time. It considers some very interest and intriguing ideas (the personification of time) that are lost in the time travelling aspect of the film, much like some of the narrative cohesion and tightness. Visual spellbound cannot distract from the flaws of the film but can tide you over just enough to find something enjoyable in this jumbled adventure.FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/alice-through-looking- glass-2016-film.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too preachy for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never minded the re-imagining of Alice in Wonderland, especially as Tim Burton was honest about doing it. It was fun. It was true to the characters as they were created by Lewis Carroll. It did create a wonderland, and that's much more than simple good CGI. So it was successful, often a big mistake in the world of Hollywood. If you make money, they'll never let you die. So another story was written this time a re-imagining of the 2nd Book Carroll dedicated to his young heroine. Once again Burton proves he knows when to call it quits. He does remain as a producer but not as a director. And as the movie moves on the difference between the 1st part and the 2nd becomes all too evident. the last 10 minutes of the film are in fact one long lecture, Alice and us are being force fed with one moral lesson after the other. Well Alice is inside the movie she has to swallow it and smile. We on the other hand being captive audience in the movie theater while we're still forced to swallow the same stuff, we're not required to smile. I know I certainly didn't.It wasn't as funny and imaginative as the first part but before the preachy ending it was doing OK. The acting was still superb, the setting still looked great, and Sacha Baron Cohen proved again that when his comic genius is being kept under control he's a decent actor. But then it became educational: I can honestly say that almost the entire ending had a hollow ring echoing through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innecesary extension from "Alice in wonderland"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed some aspects from the movie like music, cast (specially Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway), costume, makeup, sound, visual effects and cinematography, but the script don't give surprising elements to the Alice's history. I feel this new movie like an extension from "Alice in wonderland". It's true that in the previous film some aspects from the book weren't included, but the opportunity of a surprising film was gone. Some messages at the movie are very good. The inclusion from Sacha Baron Cohen like Time, was a good idea. If your are looking a movie to enjoy colors and scenes,this is your movie, but if you are looking for a good story this isn't. But, the best critic is yours, once you have seen the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...i have to say i went into Alice Through the Looking Glass only because my 7 year old daughter asked to see it. I found the original Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland to be a bit of a mediocre yawner, and really don't feel like a sequel was necessary. Surprised to say coming out of the movie that i actually feel like it was better then the original. Much more interesting story, with a much more engaging Alice. And holy cow did this movie have great 3D effects. A lot of times i feel like the 3D is a cash-grab, but this movie is very well made technically with some great FX.Definitely worth seeing in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the record, I do NOT understand all the haters! Really? This was a fantasy film, and they succeeded in the fantasy realm. The story lines kept us wanting more; and more importantly, we didn't look at the time at all (yes, that's a gauge for us, how many times we check the time to see how much is pain is left). To us, the time flew by, we felt like we'd just finished an awesome roller-coaster ride and wanted to ride again! That all being said, my daughter and I found this latest version of Alice completely entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end (we really loved the opening scene especially)! I'm a bit confused by the expectations of many, it makes no sense to me. This story has been around for decades (over a century), so they needed to spruce it up a bit, and did a superb job of it. The actors were fantastic, the CGI drew you in, and the multiple story lines kept you guessing and wanting more. Of course the movie was going to be "strange," that's been the base for this story-line since its' inception! Hello? To quote another writer: "...have you not all watched the original Alice in Wonderland? Screams weird!" Recommendation, if you haven't seen the first one (2010), watch it before seeing this one... but if you can't, it does NOT take anything away from this one! Take a chance, watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice through the boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Disney's "Alice Through the Looking Glass," with the characters from Lewis Carroll's famous stories, Alice returns to the world of Underland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter. This sequel to Tim Burton's (by the way I love his movies) 2010 Alice, is a spectacular, yet hollow, Disney product and just a pointless sequel that didn't need to be made. Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, Sacha Baren Cohen as Time, and the visual effects provide some entertainment, but overall the movie is boring and predictable and is lacking of the magic of the first film. Unfortunately "Alice Through the Looking Glass" is another multi-million dollar sequel with an uninspiring content. nikisreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605; - glorified pantomime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alice In Wonderland was a disappointment; how it made a billion dollars is beyond me. Sure it was inventive, but you expect nothing less from Burton, yet it was so dull and unenjoyable. So, with a new, more comedic director (James Bobin), as least Alice Through The Looking Glass will be more fun, right?'Fraid not. Visually it seems the movie has taken a step back. It's plastered in quite blurry CGI and clearly used so much green screen that the actors had no idea what to look at or interact with. Mixing the sub-par visuals with Elfman's massively over-the-top music (complete with Gothic choir) made a very uncomfortable tone that never settle down.The story at least is a little lighter and less apocalyptic (though *massively* flawed). When Alice finally gets back to Underland there's enough quirky charm to last a few scenes (though the awful script detracts from it, rather than enhancing it). Then we run into the annoying characters again. Wasikowska is trying her best as the posh feminist snob, but there's little reason to invest in her. Depp's Mad Hatter has lost his madness in a nonsensical plot drive, and the rest of the animals/creatures are barely worth including at all. The double- barrelled villains are no better - Bonham Carter once again rips off Miranda Richardson, and Baron Cohen can't seem to make his mind up how to play Time and ends up being a mish-mash of various bad guy traits.So, we're left with a story which isn't morbid but isn't light, characters that aren't interesting or likable, dialogue which isn't funny or clever, and animation which isn't realistic or imaginative. Basically feels like a glorified pantomime with a ridiculous budget. Great job, team.2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a film so greatly invested in the concept of time, it ends up being such a staggering waste of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After spending a year sailing around the world, Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) returns home to London to find that her mother (Lindsay Duncan) has sold off their shares in the trading company that had been backing her journeys - to scorned suitor Hamish (Leo Bill). Facing the end of her career as a sea captain, Alice escapes her distressing surroundings by jumping through a magical mirror that transports her to Underland. Once there, she discovers that her good friend Hatter Tarrant Hightopp (Johnny Depp) has grown deathly ill at the thought of never seeing his family again. Determined to help, Alice discovers she must travel back into the past using Time's (Sacha Baron Cohen) "chronosphere" to undo the events that would lead to the demise of Hightopp's troupe. Disregarding the clock-keeper's warnings, Alice steals the device, unwittingly setting into motion a chain of events that will threaten the very existence of her beloved alternate world and all of its inhabitants.The film starts off like a "Pirates of the Caribbean" yarn, sporting a young skipper engaging in high seas battles, spouting orders to disapproving minions, and succeeding in impossible feats of seafaring luck. Impossible for anyone unfamiliar with the realm of Underland, that is. For Alice, anything is possible; for the audience, this belief in spontaneous, inexplicable happenings becomes extremely annoying, very quickly. Every predicament is hopelessly insincere, since solutions can be invented on a whim. No real peril - and therefore no sense of genuine adventure - can exist in a world where nothing is clearly defined.It seems contradictory to criticize a picture based on the works of Lewis Carroll for being too unrealistic. More specifically, it's not as much an issue of realism as it is reasoning (or explanation), which again might sound contrary to the obviously absurdist concepts that populate Carroll's visions. But when everything is nonsensical, the plot and the characters generate little purpose or drive. Motives and emotions become pointless and hollow. It's a bit like watching a program for toddlers; it's full of colors and sounds and commotion, but it serves merely as a distraction, instead of as thought-provoking entertainment. To anyone not enthralled by the manifestation of key elements from the original stories, this lack of engagement is insulting to the intelligence.As for the look, even though Tim Burton is no longer directing, the sets and environments are still dark and morbid. With its classic sentiment of an escape from oppression or conflict - or simply retreating into the imagination - the film seems to scrape the edges of significantly heavier material, like "Sucker Punch" or "Pan's Labyrinth" or, visually, "Crimson Peak." But Depp always seems to pop up at random moments to force the mood back into utter lunacy, with his exaggerated, cartoonish movements, grotesquely thick and vivid makeup (which ought to be added to Wasikowska's incredibly pale features), and lisping deliveries. Cohen, too, adopts a strong accent, similar to that of Christoph Waltz, but for no apparent reason. With all the attention to caricaturing these roles, they might as well have been completely computer generated personas.While some of the dialogue retains a touch of Carroll's rhyming whimsy, most of it is negligible. The jokes aren't funny and the various interactions are either too generic to be poignant or too asinine to be significant ("That cannot be," insists Alice, to which Mirana the White Queen replies, "Unless it could"). Quite ironically, for a film so greatly invested in the concept of time and its value, "Alice Through the Looking Glass" ends up being such a staggering waste of it.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

The actors/actresses did wonderful - no complaints there - and the writers did a great job as well.

He seems very good as a person. He is smart and an entertaining actor.The supporting actors did a very good job, as well. I liked seeing the queens young because it was so cute and with their mother. The English are really nice in this and so is Mia Wasikowska.I think they put a great deal of positive work into this and were successful as a sequel to the 1st movie. The art in this was fantastic and mesmerizing. It's a good sign and very uplifting! Morally, this movie touched on a lot of things, I felt.

		<fullReview>Alice Through The Looking Glass is not particularly good. It's a classic case of sequel bloat, a film that seems to exist less because of any extended story it wants or needs to tell than because it must repackage something that was once popular The premise is so thin that it wears out its welcome before the first act is up, and not even the visuals can save it. The art direction and design are uninspiring. Time, as one might imagine, lives inside a giant clock, operated by what are essentially vintage BB-8 robots. But it's dour and dark, and the days that Alice visits are set in rooms and houses and streets that don't offer any glimpses of the nonsense world that makes the stories themselves so unique. But the real problem is that there isn't enough whimsy in the world to save this unengaging story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i could give half stars, this would be in the 7.5 category. Like the title says, thanks to bad critic reviews, i went in with extremely low expectations and was actually surprised with a fun and enjoyable movie.The movie is a lot brighter, sunnier, than the first one, and i think that's what made it more fun. Its not gloomy. There's a bit of whimsy to it.There's a lot of action scenes with a few breathers in between to develop the story some more. Neither kids, nor adults, will find it dragging at any point in time.The story isn't too deep, good for kids, a tad more boring for adults (who will probably enjoy the FX eye candy more, as per critic reviews); the dialogue is okay but has a couple of cringe worthy lines that you'd expect out of a 3rd grader, trying to write his first script, instead of someone in Hollywood. I want to call the script, "simple". I personally find it lacking, perhaps shifted towards younger audiences more, on purpose, but in the end, it works fine. The acting ranges from okay to great, thanks to performances from Sasha playing as "Time", and a few of the secondary characters throughout the story. Mia's also eons better than what she was doing in the 1st Alice movie, and she did her best with what she was given.Thankfully, Depp's Mad Hatter wasn't the "lead" in this movie as much as before. His character is central to the plot of the movie, but takes a step back to Alice's performance, something the script got right for a change. Its a good family movie that will entertain a wide range of ages, but lacks the depth of a movie like Titanic or The Shawshank Redemption, that critics seem to be looking for.</fullReview>

And with the return of cast members like Johhny Depp and Anne Hathaway this was a watch. The plot is still pretty simple it's a fantasy fairy tale type of movie as I saw it in 3D with the images and a bright screen, and the theme of good against evil is present with the hero that being Alice trying to save the day. This time Alice awakes in a world with the snow princess and finds something has happened to the Mad Hatter yet the journey and adventure is that she must travel and go back in time to save him and his own little world or crazy universe. Overall this film entertains it's a journey of fun feel good fairy tale and save the day that makes you the viewer happy all while the bright images shine on screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually stunning and with a captivating story, this movie is enjoyable from start to end. Centered on time management, it gives lessons on how to get the best of every second and how useless is trying to stop it or reverse it. It also breaks the old "time is gold" quote. Alice is now less innocent and fearless, defeating Time (the character) while moving through mind blowing past time scenes. Between the lines there are lessons on honesty, friendship, family love and respect. Each next scene is so unexpected that you won't get any chance to loose attention. Imagination at its highest degree, the intricately colorful Burtonish locations, changing at lightning speed, are a most-see jaw dropping spectacle any member of your family will want to experience more than once. I saw it in an Imax cinema in Santo Domingo. The 3D rendition and sound are fantastic. Those who use to claim that "second parts were never good" will undoubtedly change their minds after watching Alicia Through The Looking Glass. Highly recommended!! (by Rafi Pinales).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're through the looking glass here, people?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the seemingly few people who actually really enjoyed Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, I was hoping I'd enjoy this sequel too. Sadly, it falls quite short of the first film (so those who hated it should probably steer clear of this one). We begin promisingly enough, with some time having passed since the end of the last film, with Alice now captaining her father's ship, 'The Wonder', pursued by pirate ships on a dark and stormy night through the Straits of Malacca in 1874. This gloomy opening is quite thrilling and puts the openings of the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies to shame. One year later, and she's still adventurous/free-spirited as ever, wearing a stunning technicolour Mandarin outfit she discovered on her travels and sticking it to the uppity folks, including the slimy Hamish (whose views/opinions of Alice/women sadly reflect those of a certain group of individuals even *nowadays*). He's still holding a grudge regarding her not marrying him (though I don't blame her). I actually didn't mind this opening scene and the other ones set in the 'real world'. Having said that, it's a relief that not before long, Alice is being led by Absolem (the voice of the late Alan Rickman, who there's a dedication for at film's end), now in butterfly form, through a magical looking glass and finding herself back in Underland/Wonderland.Maybe it's the fact that the original film was my first 3D movie I saw, but I remember being wondered by the effect of Alice's falling through the rabbit's hole and how that felt, whereas this time around it was much less effective and there just seemed to be a lack of 'magic' (and not just because I didn't see this one in 3D). After Alice accidentally shatters Humpty Dumpty, she's soon reunited with her old wacky friends (all of whom I was glad to see again...except for that damn annoying dormouse who I STILL hate). However, her closest friend, the Mad Hatter, has apparently lost his "muchness" due to the loss of his family in the past. It's not long before Alice seeks out Time, who is a "he", and nicks his time travel device called the 'Chronosphere' to change the past and reunite the Hatter with his family. As we all know, time travel is a tricky thing, and sure enough things go awry for our plucky heroine.Whilst I never had a problem with Wasikowska's performance in the first film, I'll admit that she does seem somewhat 'livelier' in this (maybe in part due to her looking less deathly pale this time around on account of James Bobin instead of Tim Burton as director?). She manages to make Alice more 'mature', but at the same time never loses *her* "muchness". She also makes mistakes...quite a few, actually. However, her determination to set everything right ensures that she doesn't turn into a villain (which is exactly what she'd thought of Time as being. Though it becomes clear that he isn't one either, and instead just wanting to maintain 'balance'). Whilst I found his first line amusing, his buffoonery behavior doesn't provide that much genuine humour (and his 'miniscule artisans', which can join together like Transformers' Constructicons, are annoying). Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal, when he's allowed to play things more 'serious', is not half bad. I liked that he wasn't just a one-dimensional 'bad guy'. The theme of the characters not being what they might first appear also extends to the Red and White Queens. The first film never really explained how Iracebeth (Helena Bonham Carter, who's still a riot) came to be so angry/crazy/big-headed, but this one does...and it has everything to do with her sister, Mirana (played to perfection by Anne Hathaway, still as amusing as ever with her gliding about and floaty hand gestures), not being as saintly as she appears. Thanks to Alice's various trips through time, we're treated to seeing the sisters' younger selves and where their animosity began. I don't suddenly dislike Johnny Depp (despite the whole "Terriergate" thing) like many people seem to do now regarding the roles he plays, and I think he does as much as he can with the material given for the Hatter character. The film's plot kind of revolves around him, and it tries hard to evoke some feelings from the audience regarding the theme of 'family'. While I do admire the efforts, perhaps more time could've been spent making this theme become fully realized and less on crazy hijinks. While the visuals are quite dazzling, especially the sequences involving Alice's sailing through the seas of time, the over- reliance on CGI gets a bit tiresome after a while. As does the 'wackiness' of the Hatter, his tea party guests and Time, who share a tea party scene that could've been trimmed down and better spent on character development. There's a 'steampunk' vibe to all of the stuff regarding Time (the sea of dangling pocket watches that represent peoples' lives is especially eye-catching/interesting, as is the red crustiness of the climax), and it all makes for interesting visuals, but the story seems rather lacking. After Time's introduction, I found my interest waning off and on. Although, after Alice woke up in the mental hospital, which seemed like a major setback on her journey, ironically things seemed to pick up the pace again. However, this was getting towards the last third of the film. The use of score and callbacks from the first film, as well as the interesting costumes and retro feel of the pictures used for the end credits (a nod to the original illustrations?) were welcome. The use of a Pink song? Not so much. I still stand by my opinion of the first film being enjoyable, but sadly even I must admit this one doesn't match it in quality. There's some decent stuff here, but it seems to get lost in amongst all that which is unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expecting very little from this film, I walked in with hopes that it wouldn't be 110 minutes of rubbish. Thankfully, I really had a great time with this film! Directed by James Bobin (The Muppets, Muppets Most Wanted) and starring Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' is a stylish sequel with heart and good messages for all ages.I was not a massive fan of 'Alice in Wonderland' back in 2010, but I still came out enjoying the performances and scenery presented by Tim Burton. When I heard Tim Burton wasn't returning, I was glad but also thought that nobody could recreate the colorful world that Burton had created. I stand corrected. James Bobin added more bright colors, and gave the film a lighter tone compared to Burton's 2010 box office success. Bobin, who directed the two recent Disney Muppet films, made the most of the 3D CGI world and truly made it his own. 'Alice in Wonderland' featured one of my favorite musical scores of 2010, so I was very excited to hear the music in this film. Fortunately, Danny Elfman returns with his whimsical and exuberant score which was featured in the first. Mostly with a choir effect, I really enjoyed the musical score when it was copied from the 2010 film. The original song is "Just Like Fire" by P!nk, which plays throughout the credits. Just Like Fire is a already a chart-topper around the globe.Alice and Hatter are the central characters in this film, and they are played very well by Wasikowska and Depp. Time is the new villain, but I found he was very under utilized but Sacha Baron Cohen gave a cheeky and pleasant performance. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter also return as the White and Red Queens. Anne Hathaway was once again delightful as the White Queen, as was Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen who had a magnificent screen presence. The screenplay by Linda Woolverton (The Lion King, Maleficent, Alice in Wonderland) is charming and witty but sometimes has cringe lines which involve characters explaining the plot, which is very frustrating. But you have to remember, that this is a family friendly film and in that aspect I think this film succeeds. Die hard fans of the novels will be disappointed with this film as it doesn't stay true to Lewis Carroll's Alice series.Alice: Through the Looking Glass is definitely more family-friendly than the first, and it will be highly enjoyed by families around the world. The performances are great, it was directed very well and the CGI was colorful and vibrant on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this on imax on the pre-premiere today, and it was a pleasant surprise. I don't really recall many details about the first one, the only thing I know is that I went in with huge expectations and came out disappointed. This time, I went with no expectations. The film didn't seem that good judging by the trailer, so I just went with an open mind, and this time, came out pleased. I can't say it is an awesome film that will stay engraved in my mind forever, but it is good fun. The film is entertaining enough, although it lacks pace at some moments around the middle of the story, and can be a bit boring. Whenever I notice myself wondering for how much time I've been in the theater, I know that the film isn't doing its job properly. That being said, the visuals are quite stunning and they really make you dive into wonderland. I found the acting to be lukewarm, with some exceptions (Johnny deep did do a wonderful mad hatter this time, as well as Helena Bonham Carter, who never fails to perform). I left the theater feeling not amazed, but pleased with the film. It was a fun experience, not out of this world but still fun, and I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS REVIEW - Alice In Wonderland was a good entertainer with Great writing and Direction so obviously expectations from sequel were on similar level, if not higher. And after watching it, i clearly say that Alice Through The Looking Glass is as good as its prequel considering all factors. Few minuses to talk but those were ignorable because i didn't expect a Classic film. I am fully satisfied with film cause Film completed my low expectations. Title got nothing to with movie's story actually, cause story is about Time. That Glass thing is very small. Performances of all Actors are good enough to praise them all. Less screen space to Johnny Depp was disappointing. Writing is Very Good, because Climax is like fulfill end to a fairy tale. Its all Visual world in 3D so technical field has to be great and it is great. Visual and 3D effects are excellent. Runtime is 114 minutes which is neither long too long nor too short. Screenplay is good Enough to keep you hooked. Cinematography is Brilliant. Direction is fairly good Considering movie as a whole, despite having some ignorable minuses. Overall Alice Fans won't be disappointed but Critics will be disappointed. If you loved Alice In Wonderland then you should give one time watch to this film too. Go for it, if you're looking for same kind of Cinema as you're expecting. 7/10 Stars by me.</fullReview>
