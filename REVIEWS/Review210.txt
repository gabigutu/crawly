		<shortDescription>Michael Moore is the #1 patriot in USA, I hope people realize it now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only hope this movie wakes some people up, especially those flag waving people who keep on repeating slogans like "greatest country in the world" etc. This could be a serious wake up call for a proud nation. I have always wondered how people can still call it the greatest country if it does not have universal health care, but maybe the reason is, they don't know any better. They do not realize that in other western countries this has been done for ages and it works.People of USA should embrace Moore as the patriot he is. He wants the American PEOPLE all the best, but he gets sacrificed by the same people because he dares to speak about the government. But true patriots rise against governments too, if they are bad for the people. United states is not the flag, not the white house, not the senate, not the soaring eagle. It is the people living there, and this is what they have to remember. You can demand for universal health care, and you can vote for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viewer beware on Sicko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an American this movie was one of the most depressing movies I've seen in awhile. Bowling for Columbine doesn't even hold a candle to the disheartening realizations contained in this film. I walked away with a sick taste in my mouth having been reminded of how disgusting and heartless our bottom line policy making is. How sick it is to be imprisoned by the government through healthcare. How the healthcare system will tear down every other joy in your life until your 80, working 50 hours a week to pay the cost of staying alive, unable to stand against the rich or have the hope left to vote. Thus the propaganda arm of the American Dream prevails. I don't plan to watch this movie again until I obtain citizenship in Britain, France, Cuba? or Ron Paul could get elected president and as a former physician he might actually fix the system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got done watching this movie and no other movie I have seen in my life has had the impact on me that this movie has had.My wife has M.S. and requires a LOT of medical treatment. Just ONE of her many prescriptions is a thousand (US) dollars a month. This very expensive experimental drug is nothing more than an old flu shot they are experimenting with. ( seriously ) I am a middle class skilled worker with great insurance.. and I may soon be homeless due in part to this. The other part is due to the corrupt banking system that I hope one day gets equally exposed.I am now officially embarrassed to be a US citizen. If it wasn't for me already being middle aged and having 15 years seniority in a job I cannot replace... I would forever leave this so called "Free Country" Peace Richrich3077@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sicko" Diagnoses a Cure for the Nation Perhaps the exponents of expediency just haven't met the rescue heroes of September 11 still plagued by debilitating respiratory illnesses, but unable to get the healthcare they need in the country they volunteered to help in our hour of despair. Or the machinist and his newspaper editor wife who had to sell their home and move into a cramped room in their daughter's house when his heart attacks and her cancer caused their medical bills to soar. Or the woman whose husband died after their insurer refused to authorize a bone marrow transplant from his younger brother because it was "experimental." They are among the stars of Michael Moore's riveting new film "Sicko," that we were privileged to be among 50 people in an intimate private screening in New York a few days before the premiere in Cannes Saturday night where it was the hottest ticket in town and greeted with well-deserved rave reviews. Many of those in the New York audience, the real life stars of "Sicko," were brought to tears by a film and filmmaker who viewed their lives with a lot more humanity than the insurance companies who had treated them with such calculated disregard.The people, who, as one industry whistleblower says in the film, didn't just "fall through the cracks." They were deliberately thrown overboard. Cast aside by the same insurance giants that far too many ostensible reformers think we should reward for their greed by funneling them hundreds of millions dollars more. "Sicko" is not just an indictment of an indefensible healthcare industry in the U.S. It's a rejoinder for those who think we can fix the soulless monster by tinkering with an unconscionable system that puts us further in thrall to those who created the crisis.Following the screening, Moore put it as simply as possible: the private insurance companies "have to go." Unlike too many of our friends in the progressive community, Moore did not go for the easy way out. There are no calls here for forcing individuals to buy unaffordable, junk insurance. Or handing over ever more tax dollars to those who profit by denying care, and whose biggest accomplishment, says Moore, "is buying our U.S. Congress" to protect their wealth and stranglehold over our health.There are no cynical ad homonyms to not let "the perfect be the enemy of the good" - the last refuge of the politicians desperate to convince us, and perhaps themselves as well, that the Faustian compromises they propose will all be OK. Tell it to the worker in "Sicko" who had to choose between restoring one severed finger for $60,000 or another for $12,000. No, Moore doesn't feel he has to temporize with people's lives or accede to those whose goal, he says, is to "frighten and demoralize" people so they are unable to fight. Moore doesn't think the problem is "too much" medical care, or people who want to over utilize the system by spending hours waiting in an Emergency Room. Among the rare gems here is one of Richard Nixon's taped conversations, in the Oval Office with John Ehrlichman on the eve of Nixon's 1971 law promoting managed care. You can rest assured, Ehrlichman promises Nixon, "all the incentives are towards less medical care." "Sicko" has no trouble finding a solution. It can be found in the rest of the world. There's no hand wringing here for the ideologues who are already attacking Moore for promoting the alternative- medical systems he visits to Canada, England, France, and even Cuba, countries, says Moore, where when it comes to the nation's health, they know the distinction between the "we" and the "me.". Here's what Moore found. Care "doesn't depend on your premiums, it depends on your needs," the film reports. You don't have to check your health security at the door, or mortgage your future when at your most sick and vulnerable.Moore's not even afraid of the inevitable complaints about "socialized" medicine. "Back home in America we're socializing lots of things," "Sicko" finds, among them our fire and police service, Social Security checks, and even the library. At a time when the apologists of accommodation are promoting the lowest common denominator, Moore most of all offers a vision and hope. "Not all of us have a kid in Iraq, but all of us have been to see a doctor, or paid for a prescription, or have elderly parents," he said after the screening. To put it another way, there's no free marketers in hospital beds, just patients. The health care crisis "will bring us together," says Moore. And, I'd add, "Sicko" will help us get there.see www.CalNurses.org for more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please, cast aside your prejudices and watch this film with an open mind. I personally do not like Michael Moore whatsoever, but this film is mind blowing. I hope that that including quotes from the movie is not considered spoiling it.Feb 17th, 1971 5:23 P.M.Ehrlichman : "We have now narrowed down the vice president's problems on this thing to one issue, and that is whether we should include these Health Maintenance Organizations like Edgar Kaiser's Permenente thing." President Nixon : "Let me ask you, you know I'm not too keen on any of these damn medical programs." Ehrlichman : " This is a private enterprise one." Nixon : "Well, that appeals to me." Ehrlichman : " Edgar Kaiser is running this permanente thing for profit. And the reason he can do it... I had Edgar Kaiser come in, and talk to me about this... And I went into some depth... All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, the more money they make." Nixon : "Fine." Ehrlichman : " And the incentives run the right way." Nixon : "Not bad."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>European VIEW FOR CONSERVATIVES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As European living temporary in this country (my wife is American), I would like to give my point of view about the movie:1) The facts that Michael Moore show about European Health System is true. We don't pay bills for medical procedures.2) Universal Health Care it doesn't mean "socialist" health care like Cuba. Rich and middle-high class can go to the private system, so we have both to choice, but it's normal that if you have to afford a expensive medical bill (how can afford a 250k medical bill?), even rich people go to the public system.3) As European living in United States, I can say Americans pay more taxes (direct and indirect), than Europeans, it's absolutely false that UHC will double the taxes of Americans.4) This is not a issue about conservatives or liberals, this is simple a humanity question.5) The Cuban woman made the right question: if a poor caribean island like Cuba can give Universal health care to their citizens, how the first economical potence can afford this? 6)One of the typical points to critic this movie is about wait lines to have medical attention in countries with UHC. The statistics are very clear: there are no more wait lines in this countries than in USA, even covering 100 % of the people (if you are a little bit intelligent and not a fanatic extremist, you can understand that if you exclude 50 milion person from medical attention, your rates about this issue can be better).7) This people that support the actual health care, I think they don't understood one of the principal messages of this movie: it doesn't matter if you have a good insuarance...you can be exclude for "bussiness" reasons. HORRIBLE AND INSANE.8) Every American had to recommend this movie to their neighbour, and associate (like in other times for other issues like segregation laws or vote for women), because affordable health care is BASIC HUMAN RIGHT, forbidden in the the richest country in the world.9) A lot of Americans are proud to be good Christians...I'm not sure Jesus and God support a system that treat human being as garbage. This post is specially dedicated for people that love America and the tradition (conservatives), because if they accept taxes for pay national security, inside this security can include this silent and big enemies that are always waiting to kill American people (cancer, strokes...). Don't worry, you can be conservative and patritotic and support a human and Christian system that support the poor and normal people. This not socialist, is capitalism with human face (normal in other advanced societies where they live more and better).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore For President!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film, i grew restless. Not the sorta restless, you get, when nobody calls you on the phone for weeks. No- restless that i can not reach out, and share parts of the health-care-system, from where i come from in Denmark. Now, i've only once experienced this sort of restlessness after watching a movie, and it was Michael Moores "Rodger and me". YES- Moore does it again. And he fulfills his role, as an rebellious anti-capitalist, pointing out the wrongs and rights in society, that people have simply grown accustom to. PERFECT! He once again gives us his artistic brand consisting of small terrific, or in this case, horrible stories from everyday people who have been neglected by the American health-care system. Michael Let's you pass trough the homes of MANY families as you engage upon their stories. This time Michael has brought far more people into the interviews, and it gives the hole bundle more juice then FAHRENHEIT. He also, takes his time to show old clips, video/photos of the people hes interviewing, so you feel you get the entire background on some of the folks. BRAVO! Michael himself, is this time a bit more "americaniced" -but only to really point out the benefits of the other countries, does he take the role of the average American joe. PERFECT! Over all. If you read this. I think this movie will make as huge an impact on you, as it did on me. And i think every Michael Moore film, is both educational and should be thought in schools, as well as very important for the entire society to see! That is... if you want to be a part of your society?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insured Americans beware</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently finished watching Michael Moore's Sicko (it's a great documentary that everyone should see). It's not about the 47 million Americans who don't have health insurance, it's about some of the 250 million who have/had health insurance and in spite of this their lives were ruined. It dispels a lot of the myths espoused by some in America such as long waiting lines, higher taxes and the doctors being paid close to nothing. It explains why HMOs were established and how their primary purpose is to deny claims. Advancement in these companies is based upon how many claims an employee denies and any claims that are actually paid out are seen as failures. He goes to countries like Canada, England, France and Cuba and talks to citizens of these countries to get their take on their country's health-care system. He also goes to hospitals and emergency rooms in these countries to get the take of the people there and when he ask "How much do you pay?", they all laugh at him. Moore sums up the premise of film when he says the rest of the western world practices "We" health-care while Americans practice "Me" health-care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read all the comments and reviews, this movie was pretty much what I expected. Moore does a really good job in making his point.What bothered me a little was his black &amp; white view of the healthcare industry - either it is public OR private. In reality, many western countries have a "hybrid" system. For example here in Finland we have a pretty reasonable public healthcare system (which by the way is not totally free for the patient, albeit very cheap), but in addition, we also have private clinics, if you want even faster service and are willing to pay extra. You can also get an insurance from private companies, which provides extra financial support and/or service in the private clinics in case of illness. Also some workplaces and institutes have free doctors.A portion of the cost of medicines is substituted by the government in either case, and there is an annual limit after which they are totally substituted.I think it would be pretty straightforward to establish this kind of system in the US. There is no need to socialize healthcare TOTALLY. There is no need for the insurance company to "go" (as Moore put it), they just need to step aside a little and stop being the main authority. Also, if insurance companies have to compete with FREE (health care), there is only one thing they can do: offer really good service!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>his best documentary so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant documentary, with a softer, less angry Moore taking a good hard look at the current state of the inner-workings of the American private health care system, and comparing them to the universal systems in Canada, England, and France. The nay-sayers will argue that he's skewing his content, or simply choosing the worst HMO stories, but that's exactly what he has to do to drive his point home! The content here is far less controversial than in his previous films. It's widely known that, despite being one of the richest countries in the world, the states is far from best when it comes to taking care of their own.The film gives the impression that Canadians wait an average of 45minutes to get seen at a hospital. Being a Canadian, I'll tell you right away that is not the case. There is an issue here in Canada with long wait times (both at the hospital and for major surgery), however, the system still works well, and everyone is taken care of, regardless of financial or social status.Seeing sicko really made me realize just how much I take our universal health care system for granted. Some of the HMO horror stories Moore gives are shocking (to put it lightly).While this film doesn't pack quite the punch, compared to Fahrenheit and Columbine, it's still going to turn a lot of heads. Everyone should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched all of Moore's documentaries and this one is far and away the best. There's none of the polemical fireworks of Fahrenheit; it's a film that examines people's lives and Moore simply allows lots of space for their stories to be told. This is a very balanced look at the American health care system and is a documentary with optimism and hope despite being very bleak in places. Moore tries really hard I think to talk to American audiences in his films - he frames his issues with wit and a deep sense of wanting things to change. Hopefully, this one will have some effect in America where it is most needed. I've heard that even Republicans have come out of cinemas moved by its message and perhaps a little disturbed by what it has to say about some elements of the American system. The masterstroke of the film is the revelation that Moore secretly paid the medical bills for the wife of his most strident web critic. It is timed perfectly at the end of the film and is a truly moving moment in the film. The fact that Moore moves some people to seemingly despise him for being motivated by a love of his country and filled at the same time with a sense of rage at certain injustices confirms not only that he is doing something right but also warns us about how screwed up people's values are. A film for lovers of truth everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a documentary. Last night I had the opportunity to attend an advanced screening of "Sicko", the documentary by Michael Moore on the subject of the health care system in the United States and the lack of free universal health care for all American citizens. Walking in to the screening I was a bit skeptical. I am a registered republican, conservative minded and had previously avoided Moore's films. This film changed my entire perspective. It flat out blew my mind, it was sad, beautiful, funny, enlightening - a complete learning experience. Honestly, "Sicko" was astonishing (a word I don't use too often). There is one scene in particular in which an elderly woman cannot pay her bill at the Hospital of USC, so she is put in a cab and dropped off on the side of the road (all of this is captured on surveillance cameras) and left to wander around in the street, completely unaware of her surroundings. Just about everyone in the room watching this was choked up and fighting back tears as this horrendous scene unfolded. Sometimes it takes something like that to shock you out of the world of money, the latest gadgets, workplace stress and losing that last 10 lbs to realize that most of the things we stress about each day are very insignificant problems which we have blown out of proportion, meanwhile innocent people die by the thousands every day because we are simply too self absorbed to notice or care about anyone else.The documentary makes a great point regarding the fact that the United States is the only country in the western world without universal health care. Michael Moore takes each argument used against socialized medicine and effortlessly debunks it. You get a good glimpse at how the HMOs work, how they do all they can to avoid paying, and how hard they will make it for you to receive benefits. Several people used in this documentary passed away before it was finished due to their treatments going unfulfilled because the insurance companies deem so many operations and medications as "experimental", thus not covered.In the end this documentary was ultimately depressing. We are shown to be nothing more than tools in a plutocracy that rewards the richest and keeps the poorest in fear. The movie points out that the richest 1% of the world owns 80% of the world's wealth, and that the other 99% do not protest this because they are demoralized and kept in fear, worker bees kept in that state of limbo, living paycheck to paycheck.To fellow conservatives reading about "Sicko" out of curiosity, do yourself the favor of watching this, because who in their right mind wants to deny anyone health care?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it may not win any awards, when looked at purely as a film, this documentary by Michael Moore is an entertaining and interesting one. It presents all the facts (whether you consider them to be biased or not) in the typical Michael Moore style (heavy on the sarcasm and wit) that we've all gotten used to by now and in an easy to digest format. As this is IMDb and people should rate movies based on their values as films rather than opinions expressed, I think it's best to refrain from mentioning Mr. Moore's obvious view on the American health care system. However, if at all you're interested in learning more about the system or simply want to watch an entertaining documentary, I suggest you go out and watch this film when it arrives in cinemas near you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A massive wake up call for an entire nation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally have never really been a fan of Michael Moore. I find him to be an attention whore more than a fact teller. This piece is no different, but with a twist. He comes with easily checkable facts &amp; lots of them.Any American who watches this will (unless they are a CEO of an HMO) be appalled by what they see. Any person from Canada, United Kingdom, France or even Cuba who may see this will be thankful of the system they have in place.The American health system has been openly criticized for a long time because they don't have Universal healthcare. After seeing the horror stories of the individuals in this story, including the deaths of people with "coverage" in the U.S. it makes me thankful for being a Canadian citizen.Of course, you may say "well what do you know, you don't live here" &amp; while this may be true, I have lots of family &amp; friends who DO live in the U.S. who hate their system, have had problems themselves with their HMOs &amp; on at least two instances I know of, have travelled back up here for their medical needs to be met.The healthcare industry is shown to be frauds in this film. They are in my opinion, pathetic. If I were a Doctor in the U.S.A I would be ashamed to admit that was my profession after this story comes out, and if I worked for an HMO I would probably want to commit suicide after seeing the harm that you have caused undeserving people by denying simply basic medical coverage.Michael goes to 4 countries with Universal healthcare coverage, including a longtime alleged nemesis Cuba. In all instances he finds that there is great medical coverage, FOR FREE. Ontop of that, medications are either free, or almost free compared to U.S.A. In Cuba a woman paid less than 5 CENTS for a medication that she was charged $120 for back home, while in Britain there is a $10 (approx) maximum charge on any prescription. In France, if you have a medical condition you are paid by the government &amp; the employer to rest up. The myth of long lines to see a Dr. in Canada are blown away.Simply put, this IMO is the most damning piece of film ever put together on the Americal healthcare system &amp; frankly, it should make every American irate. It should certainly become a hot point topic for the 2008 elections &amp; the American people should refuse to accept anything less than a comparable system to what we here in Canada have, what the British have, French have &amp; Gasp, the Cubans have.I might not like Michael Moore, but I respect him a lot after this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ghoulish System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SICKO is right on target. The US is 37th in the world in terms of quality of health care--slightly ahead of Slovenia, but behind Costa Rica--but number one in terms of per capita health care spending, or $7,000 per person per annum.Michael Moore chose the title "Sicko" for the movie, but what I think he meant by this was "ghoul," which is an Arabic word, among so many in English. In Muslim folklore, a ghoul was an evil spirit believed to plunder graves and feed on corpses.What is the for-profit, insurance industry run, so-called "health care" system, then, if not a truly evil racket run by conscienceless, psychopathic ghouls who feed on human flesh? And the only way you combat this system--long buttressed by the government, the insurance companies and the AMA--is to take the profit motive out of it: it is an immoral motive when it comes to people's health and their lives.Michael Moore wants to take the insurance companies out of the equation and wants to regulate health care like a public utility (a public good)as it is done in practically all other developed countries.He points out that all this fear of "socialized" service is nonsense: our fire departments are run as a public good, and so are police departments.Would we allow the bottom line to determine whether or not the fire truck went to a home to attend to an ongoing fire? Well, in another movie--the Canadian documentary "The Corporation"--it is pointed out that until very recently (as late as the 1950s)--that is the way it was in the US: if your house caught fire, and you didn't have a particular fire brigade's medallion on your house, the fire truck went right past your house and didn't extinguish the fire.Do Americans want to go back to those days? Why do they allow it when it comes to health care? A deeply Christian sense of justice permeates the movie: Moore is a Catholic Christian who believes, as the New Testament says, that when we leave our mortal coil and arrive at the pearly gates, Jesus will ask us only two questions: "When I was hungry, did you feed me?," "When I was homeless, did you take me in?" As Valgard Haugland, the leader of Norway's Christian Democratic Party and the cabinet minister for children and family affairs, told Washington Post correspondent T.R. Reid: "Americans like to talk about family values. We have decided to do more than talk; we use our tax revenues to pay for family values." (Reid, T.R. The United States of Europe: The New Superpower and the End of American Supremacy. New York: Penguin Books, 2004. pp. 152-153) Through anecdote after anecdote about how this question is tackled in other industrialized countries, Moore points the way to what a just system would look like, and how unjust the US system truly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important film that you'll see all year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one film this year that every American needs to see. That seems to be the general consensus about Michael Moore's new documentary, Sicko.After just watching the movie, I can say that this is the most important film that is going to be released in 2007. It may be the most important film for some time after, as well.This movie is filled with deeply touching and heartbreaking moments. The story of a man having to choose which finger is going to be reattached: the middle finger, which will cost $60,000, or the ring finger, which will cost only $12,000. A mother, who's infant is refused treatment from a hospital because her insurance company wants her to go to a company owned hospital. A couple in their fifties who have insurance, but have to sell their home and move into their daughter's basement because they accrued so much debt from illness that they are forced to sell their house. Rescue workers from 9/11 who haven't received proper medical treatment because they don't have the money, and the government isn't convinced that they spent sufficient time at ground zero to receive government funds.The effect of these stories, told by the people who lived them, is obvious. These stories are meant to overwhelm you. To challenge your assumptions. To raise alarm and disgust over the treatment of human beings by insurance companies. It's no secret that the dollar is the bottom line for every corporation, but to have it written so poignantly across the health of American people is frightening.Moore does his normal routine, here. He uses anecdotal evidence to present his case. Statistics are used sparingly, and never sourced, and the narration is infused with mockery and sarcasm. He holds up Canada, Great Britain, France, and even Cuba as the mirror on which we can see our own faults."Look at what's possible! Look how these people live! They aren't weighed down with medical debt, they don't have to be denied health care by insurance companies unwilling to pay the money! These are are nations with problems, who still refuse to allow their citizens to go uncared for!" And the outcry is heard. It is felt. And it etched plainly on the soul of every American who has had to pay for medical care.Is the portrayal of these nations accurate? I don't know. Michael Moore has a clear reputation for needling the government (especially the Bush administration) and corporate power. Historically, he's never balked from exaggerating the truth and distorting words to suit his purpose. It's doubtful that he didn't do that, here.But that's not the point. The point of this film is not to say that Britain or France is better than us. It is to say that they aren't better than us; to ask why their citizens are treated better. Why do we have to fear going to the doctor because we can't afford it (even with insurance), yet they can walk into any hospital and never pay anyone for the care they receive? The message of this film isn't that the American system is bad, it's that the American system isn't working. The evidence is in how much money insurance companies make, and the effect that has on the population.Every nation has priorities. Universal national health care requires money, and that money has to come from somewhere. We spend as much on the military, in this country, as the next 20 countries in the world. Combined. Whether that is what this administration should be doing or not is another issue, it's a fact.What are we fighting for? To prevent another 9/11? Sure. But, meanwhile, this country is being eaten alive by illness, and insurance and drug companies are growing fat off our plight. There are many dangers in this world, and terrorism is only one of them.See this film. You owe it to yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's worst than Romania!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movies that either make fun or try to exemplify American stupidity, but none convinced me of it unless I've seen Sicko. How can you people put up with this?! The medical system portrayed in this film is worst than here in Romania!Basically, it tells about the medical system being bought and used by insurance companies to trick people into paying huge sums of money for any medical care, regardless of them having a medical insurance or not. Then there are examples of the Canadian, French, British and Cuban health care systems, which are, as I think they should be, free and of high quality.And the logic is very simple, even if one chooses to disregard the highly emotional examples presented by Moore: people who win money from not taking care of you will not take care of you.Take care!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly brilliant piece of documentary film-making...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, this film is brilliant. Michael Moore's Sicko covers the spectrum from universal health care, to HMOs, to pharmaceutical companies, to sickening governmental complicity. It is a truly intelligent documentary on the state of America's health care system. But the film is about more than just health care; it is a non-partisan, richly in-depth piece of film-making that manages to capture the zeitgeist of our times. Unlike his previous work Fahrenheit 9/11, this film does not carry with it a blatantly biased point of view. Rather, it speaks to the human condition, in sometimes gut-wrenching ways, and the pathetic, dangerous state of America's health care system ? a system that doesn't care if you're red or blue, but only about the bottom line. In a country where the vast majority of citizens feel we're headed in the wrong direction, Moore manages to take the issue of health care and shed light on much broader reasons for American discontent. Good work Mike - no one can argue with what you've done here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you that seem to get "stuck" on HOW Moore chooses to pass a message to viewers, and thus mainly missing the message itself....you will find this film more to your liking. Moore here is more substance and documentary, than what some people would call "Rambo revolutionary". The documentary examines the US Health system, and then indirectly compares it to Canada's, France's and other countries.The differences are obvious.In the U.S if you cant pay the huge amounts of money required, you get no help. In these other countries, exactly the opposite. You pay nothing. And if you think you are left with no money, because of taxes, you're wrong. The sad thing is, that countries with much less development and resources can offer a better overall health system. It IS true that you can judge a people from how it treats, it's most unfortunate citizens. The conclusions are indisputable. The only thing i was hoping for, was some more heat on Pharmaceutical companies (major heat is on Insurance ones). Maybe in Sicko 2 , or the extras. A MUST see!</fullReview>

Watching this movie you can see how far we have to go. America is so far behind virtually every other industrialized country in health care availability and other social programs that it would seem this country is doomed if things don't change soon. As a former member of the British Parliament states in the movie, the governments in countries like England and France fear the people while in America the people fear the government.

		<fullReview>Please pull the silver spoon out of your ass, and God help you if you ever actually become ill. As a Canadian citizen who became ill on American soil without my healthcare coverage that extends to other countries i would have had a medical bill for $6,000 for the following treatment hospital bed, 10 minutes with a doctor, blood sampling and signing the forms upon my release. Perhaps i might have had a 45 minute wait in Canada but at least it wouldn't have cost the same amount as my first year university tuition. And what would i have done if my insurance company had later denied my claim? It is a governments responsibility to care for its citizens, America has failed and although the Canadian system may not be perfect (please remove your rose coloured glasses) its not leaving millions of HMO recipients holding the bag. It is also not bankrupting families of sick children having to take out 2nd mortgages just so their children can see a doctor. You may not agree with past films produced by Mr. Moore, but this film is not political in my mind it is simply rational. Something needs to change perhaps this is a start</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful, funny, moving cinematic essay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, I hesitate to call Moore's films "documentaries"; Oscar win notwithstanding, it's become less trouble to remove them from that (ostensibly) "objective" label altogether and consider them to be what Orson Welles called his great 1975 effort F For Fake: essay films. Looking at the Moore filmography through that prism at least helps this writer free himself of the (at least subconscious) guilt for admiring the films in spite of their refusal to bow to the documentary tradition?not only in failing to present opposing viewpoints, but also for their loose, freewheeling structures (particularly in Bowling for Columbine) that some dismiss as rambling and disorganized.So dismiss the ideology if you'd like, or tear into the minor points of contention, but make no mistake?Sicko is a tremendous film, possibly Moore's best, equal parts devastating fact, hilarious social satire, and genuinely moving emotion. Moore acknowledges (following a brief prologue) that the film is not about the 50 million Americans who are completely uninsured, but the 250 million who think they're covered, and their battles within our broken system. The film's first act is the story of a few of those Americans, and while Moore's reliance on anecdotal evidence may not be the greatest journalism, it certainly makes for good drama?and better film-making that a laundry list of statistics.The second act takes us on a tour of foreign countries and their government-run health care systems?along with some helpful rebukes (though again, primarily anecdotal) of the usual (and usually right-wing) arguments against "socialized medicine." In a strange way, however, Sicko becomes about more than health care; Moore discovers other advantages of living in England or France, and wonders why America can't boast of the same.I'm sure that some more narrow-minded critics will seize on these passages as proof of Moore's anti-Americanism, but I think it's just the opposite?he loves our country, but knows it isn't perfect. Here, it seems, are some ways in which it could be better. What could be more patriotic than that? I will say that I wish the advance hoopla over Moore's trip to Cuba hadn't leaked out, as the film is structured in such a way that it would have been a nice surprise. That being said (and concerns about the validity of that footage aside), it leads to some amazing footage of (at long last) care for people who genuinely deserve it, and a quite scene at a Cuban firehouse that moved me in a way that no other 9/11 commentary has.At the end of the day, Sicko is simply an extraordinary film?funny and powerful and moving and scary (it gets under your skin in the same way Bowling did). It provokes thought, not just about the health care system, but about our country as a whole, and what we want from it. Oh, and it's got one of the best closing shots in recent memory.</fullReview>

MM blew the whistle on the rich trying to get richer, and some people aren't going to like that. In reading the comments on IMDb, folks are already going through the cliché conservative motions.

		<shortDescription>Shining Light on America's Health Care Crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, "Sicko" is Michael Moore's most tightly focused film since "Roger &amp; Me." Recently he's dealt with heady philosophical issues involving America's obsession with guns and violence in "Bowling for Columbine" and then displayed the follies of the Bush Administration and the quagmire that is current geopolitics in "Farhenheit 9/11." Here he turns his gaze to a single, tangible thing: America's health care crisis.Moore is up to his usual bag of tricks with his goofy pop-culture inspired propaganda, expertly combining heartfelt sentiment with big laughs in his anecdotal pieces, and essentially preaching to the choir. Informing us that insurance and pharmaceutical companies are vile profit driven machines who lobby hard in Washington and buyout politicians left and right isn't exactly telling us something we didn't already know. Scary still are the review board doctors working for the insurance companies who get paid big bonuses for denying the most claims, and saddest of all, the people who actually die from not getting their treatment. Moore, never shying from his political leanings, firmly points his finger at Nixon (whose policies paved the way for HMO's), Reagan (who propagated the idea of socialized medicine as the first sign of Communist invasion), and Bush (who signed into law prescription drug bills that have crippled our senior citizens). He also suggests that Hillary Clinton, whose own health care plan was shot down by special interests back in the early 1990's, is now on the same payroll after losing the good fight.Moore really scores, though, when he starts globe hopping and shows us just how well socialized medicine works in countries like Canada, Great Britian, and France, and how much all of the people involved (doctors and patients) think it's wonderful and that our system is absurd. The most telling anecdote is when he's able to get a group of 9/11 heroes suffering from the debilitating effects of having worked at Ground Zero some much needed treatment in Cuba (of all places!) after they have been repeatedly denied by their insurance companies here in the States.Other than marrying a Canadian or moving to one of these countries where health care is free to all, he offers no solid suggestions for how people who want to stay in America can fix the system other than to give this vague sense that "socialized medicine works." He's shed some light on the topic, and points us in the right direction, but isn't willing to lead the way with any practical solutions.Some of the most interesting points are made while in France, where the citizens enjoy free higher education, free health care, 35-hour work weeks, and government issued nannies. One of the Americans living now in France points out, "the people in France get all this because here the government is afraid of the people while in the States the people are afraid of the government." Marie Antoinette, it seems, lost her head so the French could get free health care.Funny, sobering, and frustrating, "Sicko" is a wake-up call for America to start their own revolution.Message to Washington: Off with their heads!</fullReview>

The realities of the American health care system are not easy to swallow. As someone who IS NOT a Michael Moore fan, I went in looking for the flaws in this film. Hoping, in fact, that I could dismiss it as anti-republican rhetoric. Quite to the contrary, I was floored. If it was all scripted and BS, then it was FANTASTIC fiction. If, however, it is factual then it is a sad expose on American society (don't think that this film is limited to health care, it revolves around US society as a whole). I give it one thumb up (I lost the other in a farming accident and since I live in America, well...I digress).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Michael Moore. I liked him since I saw "Roger and Me", many years ago. I admire his compassion for the less fortunate and his tenacity in going after the big sharks and exposing the rotten parts (and people) in our country's system. What I don't like is feeling manipulated. Moore's intentions are the best, his points are always good, but the execution is not that great, mostly in this film. He takes too many things out of context or exaggerates them, and in the end he overshoots the whole thing. Which reduces the impact of the film for viewers on both sides of the issue, in my opinion. ***SPOILERS***For ex. the Havana hospital scene: a bit of a sham, in my opinion - maybe an involuntary one, but Moore should have gathered more facts before he decided to believe the fairy tale he and his companions lived in Havana. I grew up in a communist country. Had a group of American patients with cameras shown up at the best hospital in my country's capital city - like the one Moore went to - the best possible care (reserved only for the high rank Party officials and NEVER available to the general population) would have been given them, if only to keep appearances and show to the world, specifically the US, that the communist system "works". This would have been a better documentary, with a stronger impact, had Moore relied more on statistics and scientific data, and less on emotional individual stories. Still, it's worth seeing - it has many eye-opening moments...</fullReview>

I am an avid Woody Allen fan and still love his films but Michael Moore has jumped in and become an entire nation's conscious. Even though I have realized for years that there has to be a better way for health care, Moore crystallized every feeling I have ever had about what needs to be done about it. All it takes is an open mind and anyone will see that changes need to be made to our health care system and needs to be done now. Many people in this nation claim the moniker "Culture of Life". Those who view this film will see that it is anything but a "Culture of Life" and we aren't even speaking about violence overseas. We are speaking about the covert violence against Americans who happen to get sick without enough funds to get the treatment they may need. Health Insurance companies in this country do more to harm Americans than any terrorist could.</fullReview>

I was told I had to wait two weeks just to see if a specialist could see me. And I have military insurance! Is this how America thanks its soldiers and their families? When I was visiting London I became very ill and was treated for free, no hassles, with a 30 minute wait in a West London emergency room. I can't even get that kind of treatment on Nellis Air Force Base as a US citizen with insurance, with an appointment! This film hit the mark dead on, I don't care what your party is or what your politics may be, insurance companies are literally getting away with murder and sucking the quality of life out of this country.

		<fullReview>What's wrong?After watching this movie a couple of times now, it has become clear to me that the United States is sick (and I'm just talking about health-care here). I just don't understand the mentality. Answer me this; what's wrong with socialism? What's wrong with caring for your fellow man? I've read most of the reviews from from people who graded it at the bottom, and what became clear is the all but three are from the United States. And even of those three, one just didn't like the documentary, no political views were apparent in his review.The argument that somebody shouldn't have to pay for somebody else's decease or accident doesn't stick with me. I'll explain: If you get into accident, you certainly don't ask for that. And on another note: a friend of mine has a blood decease, he didn't ask for this and he has to worry enough about this in his everyday life. Some people get born with a disability, chronic heart problems, what are we going to do; let them rot? That sounds a bit ?although this is pushing it- like what happened 70 years ago. And I'll go further; when my wife had our child, we first had a doctor to come to our house. For some health reason we had to go to the hospital. My child was born, they had to stay for a night, and the next day we left. The following day we had a health-care worker who gave us tips, did some cleaning in our house. She came in twice a week for about 4 hours, this lasted for about a month. No bill, just happiness with the arrival of our son. My brother's son was in the hospital for 5 days, after that he left. No bill, just health-care. Unfortunately his son became ill the next year as well. But no problem, he went to the hospital and received care again. If I get sick or get in some kind of accident I get treaded in the nearest hospital and after I'm healthy I go home? that's it, no bill, no hassle, no fear. I don't have to worry about anything. We don't have a maximum on sick-days, and we still get paid for our sick days. I just pay my monthly bill of 95 euros. For dental I have to pay, but only for the first 250 euro, after that it's free again. People under 18 don't pay anything. And don't presume that our health-care is bad, of course it could be better? but that is not the point at the moment. What's wrong with socialism? It might not be a perfect system, but I wouldn't have it any other way. The fact of the matter is that nobody can do everything on its own. Of course I believe that people should be paid for the work they do, or the amount of work they do. But a person making a million is still somehow dependant on people that have to work in shops, factories, or any other place.I think the message here is that Americans should and could open their eyes. And maybe not to change their point of view, but at least to know that there are other systems in the world that work as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good message, alienated voice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow, because of various degrees of "You're not a good film buff/filmmaker/film historian (and sometimes American) unless" style recommendations, productions shown in class, and general rave reviews and whatnot, I have ended up seeing all of Michael Moore's movies except for his opening, Roger &amp; Me. This situation is pretty funny because I've never really cared for the man. Back when Bowling for Columbine was the only thing he had, I thought he was kinda funny sorta interesting and was a lot more open to his ideas. However, one cannot watch four movies by one filmmaker and not start to get an idea of how his rhetoric works, especially one calling his works "documentaries." Frankly, I don't care for it. Moore, however, has his uses and his controversy, and for now he's a voice that people have to deal with.The thing about this documentary is that Moore finally has a message that is not only right, but has a solution. The real argument here is that the amount of money we spend paying for health insurance that often doesn't benefit us could easily be replaced by a universal tax that would cost less to each individual both percentage-wise and dollar-amount per paycheck than typical health insurance costs. Also, since the people paying the taxes would consist of a higher demographic (many people in the U.S. do not qualify for health insurance), and since the amount would not have to be taken directly out of paychecks from full time jobs, overall Universal health care is technically cheaper and more efficient for more people.So why don't we do it? Two things: the very real American mis-perception that makes them fear in a gut level a word: "socialism". The other thing? The fact that a tax-based Universal health care system is NOT, in fact, the idealized literally eutopic world that Moore presents in this film, but has its minor problems too. For instance, in any socialized health care system, a choice has to be made between limited service or limited coverage. That could mean that we still have to reject poor people who cannot in some way repay for the service, or that many ailments anywhere from pink eye to bronchitis may be left out.Which gets us to the structure of Moore's movie itself. In SiCKO, Moore treats us to horror stories involving Americans of middle-to-lower class status who, in some way or another, was basically refused by our health care system. Some of them are usual shmoes that are moving into their children's houses because they went bankrupt from hospital fees, some of them were relief workers during the September 11th attacks. Then he goes around to various countries, England, Paris, Canada, and Cuba, and shows how their socialist-based health care systems are better. At this level of "truth" and "narrative", sure, the documentary is successful.The part where it gets annoying (in only the greatest Michael Moore of ways) is, well, Michael Moore. For instance, when he takes the group of 9/11 firefighters to Guantanamo Bay because they have a medical supply service for their inmates. The result? Well, exactly what you expect, exactly what Moore expects, and pretty much exactly what should have happened: at first no response, and then a threat alarm. Yeah, that was a useless scene, but in Moore's particular "oh they must be avoiding me because I'm Michael Moore" world, this scene is supposed to mean that they didn't want to provide service for the firefighters--it had nothing to do with the fact that an unmarked boat with unknown people on it in the middle of the ocean making a bee-line to Guantanamo Bay could maybe possibly be considered an invasion force? Naaaawww, of course it's the American health care system's inability to stand up for itself! Of course! Of course that's not all he does. It's all the usual: interviewing only people who had major and potentially lethal problems in other countries who got service immediately, letting the camera sit on crying people for dramatic effect, and the usual in, "And back in my hometown of Flint, Michigan" and "could this possibly be because of the War in Iraq?" style stuff that's his signature. However, I do have to admit that in this film, he tones it down a bit, and once again, I'd like to point out that this time he has a message and a solution that actually functions in the real world. That makes this documentary stand out way above Fahrenheit 9/11.The unfortunate thing: well, it's a Michael Moore movie. Even if he did completely recreate his approach and work towards a different form of argument, the fact of the matter is that at this point he's either preaching to the masses or just convincing people to decide otherwise. That is to say that I feel Moore's style has become so alienating, that even when the man actually has a point it either has no effect or could potentially have a negative one to the things he's trying to do. He puts himself up as a sort of crusader of the people, but some people think that Fahrenheit 9/11 had as much to do with Bush getting re-elected as Bush's own campaign, and other people pretty much assume that his alienating stance just makes him entertainment for frustrated people who can't get their voices heard, meaning that over time his works are going to become increasingly more and more negligible.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Awful Truth About The American Health Care System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the third straight film, Michael Moore has become an extremely painful thorn in the side of the political right in America. And where he once tackled gun violence in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE and the errant War On Terror in FAHRENHEIT 9/11, now he takes on the lack of affordable (and even universal) health care in America in SICKO, a typically scathing expose from the premiere cinematic muckraker of our generation.As Moore points out, SICKO is not necessarily about the fifty million Americans who don't have any health care at all. This is about the rest of us who have health care and think that our health care plans will cover us, come what may. But as Moore tells us, the awful truth about the American health care system is that we may all be one illness and one rejection notice away from becoming either destitute or dead. And the awful truth is that the HMOs and big pharmaceutical manufacturers have a strangle hold on our elected officials that is matched or exceeded only by the military/industrial complex. Moore offers us dozens of little health care horror stories from across America, in which treatment was denied to patients by health care providers for one excuse or another (whichever was the handiest at that place and time), which in a few cases resulted in death. Now, this is happening in the wealthiest country in the world--the United States of America. It shouldn't be happening! Then Moore takes us to nations where universal health care is a way of life--Canada; Britain; and France. And for all the tough talk by uber-patriotic politicians in America about the ills of so-called "socialized medicine", what do we find? We find reasonably healthy people who don't pay for than a few dollars at a time for medical treatment, and a lot of times they pay NOTHING. And these countries have health and worker productivity rates that we in America ought to be having. But instead, with the HMOs and pharmaceutical behemoths running things, America has slipped to #37 in the World Health Organization rankings--just slightly ahead of Slovenia! But Moore's biggest coup, and where he has gotten himself into hot water with the Bush cabal (hot surprisingly), is when he takes four emergency workers who were at Ground Zero on September 11, 2001 to that bastion of the Red Menace, Cuba, for medical treatment that these folks could either not find on American soil or couldn't pay for. And do they run into a Commie bureaucracy? Hardly! They get the necessary care from doctors who don't have to look over their shoulder to see if an HMO or pharmaceutical lobbyist is about to put them out of business. And this is happening in a country whose leader we've learned to despise with every fiber of our being for almost half a century, and against which we've had an embargo in place since October 1962! UNREAL!As always, Moore's film, and indeed the man himself, are being attacked by right-wing extremists, and the HMO/pharmaceutical bureaucracy. If he had only shown one or two HMO horror stories in this two-hour opus of his, they might have had the grounds to go after him they way they do. Instead, however, he shows us dozens of them, some of them involving hospitals dumping homeless patients on L.A.'s Skid Row. And there are thousands of other HMO horror stories that have been in the news the last thirty years. What Moore is presenting to us is nothing new, and that's the problem. This is nothing new, because America, in the age of Bush and the Iraq war, is apathetic, and lets things like this happen. Again, this agent provocateur with a movie camera is letting us in on some dirty little facts about his, and our, nation. And the most daunting and tortuous fact that he shows us is this: Unless we have a health care system that leaves things in the hands of We The People, particularly the doctors, instead of the hands of the HMOs, the pharmaceutical manufacturers, and their political lackeys in Washington, being the richest country in the world will be negated by our record as having the worst human rights record in the world. Universal health care shouldn't be a privilege. It should be a human RIGHT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore continues to be an extremely frustrating man by presenting a documentary with very interesting points to make and then making those points in the worst way possible. I know next to nothing about economics and was hoping to learn a great deal about socialized health care, but instead I got a peek into the private lives of various people on various continents (what is this, a travelogue?). The movie's arguments rely entirely on PEOPLE. Has Moore ever heard of statistics? Moore opens the movie focusing on the problems of the American health care system. His cases are all anecdotal, but he succeeds in pointing out some obvious absurdities in the system. The movie doesn't become BAD until he looks at socialized health care, which is supposedly light-years ahead of our American system. For me, the strongest evidence of this is that citizens in most other developed countries are quite happy with their health care and look upon our system as sort of ridiculous. At least, that's the point Moore attempts to make, and it's a good one, but he fails to back it up with anything remotely resembling facts. Instead of interviewing a dozen people in Canada and France who think their health care is great, how about taking an actual opinion poll to find out the majority view? How about researching its effects on people of *various* economic classes? (Watching this movie, you'd think Europe doesn't have any poor people). If all we're doing here is interviewing random people, could I go interview six people who have been screwed over by socialized health care and thereby prove that it doesn't work? It gets worse when he addresses the counterarguments, apparently thinking he can put to rest the issue of taxes by interviewing *one* doctor and *one* family. A truly bold filmmaker would find the most damning counterarguments possible and attempt to refute them point-by-point, but Moore has to be the laziest debater ever. He's been criticized for all these same reasons on his previous documentaries, and you'd think there would come a time where he'd say to himself, "Okay, no more fooling around, THIS time I'm going to do a serious investigation and come up with real statistics," but he never does. The best that can be said about this movie is that it might spur people to do further research on their own, but unfortunately there are many morons who will take it as "proof" that socialized health care is the way to go. People who like some actual DATA with their arguments are going to be very disappointed.On an unrelated note, what is with that terrifying cover art of Moore wearing scrubs and menacingly putting on a rubber glove with the tagline "This might hurt a little"!? Is that supposed to make us want to run in the other direction or what?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shocking truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched Sicko and made me cry of frustration!Honestly. I am a Medical Doctor, E.N.T Specialist in Athens General Hospital, Greece, and I am working there as a Surgeon for the last 4 years. Until seeing this film I have been often frustrated about my working hours, 90-100h A WEEK, people coming any time of day or night for minor health issues and of course low salaries. This film was a revelation to me. I would still like better working conditions and higher wages but it NEVER even crossed my mind not to help anyone in need, and I have treated some really bad cases or criminals in the hospital. It has never occurred to me that there are places that people are refused of health care because they do not have to pay! We often hospitalize poor, helpless refugees and when they get well, we staff, NOT THE HOSPITAL or Government, the staff, we make a small collection and give the patient some cash on his/her way out! it is SO outrageous that the largest country in the world will let people die, EVEN ONE PERSON, because he cannot pay the bill! In civilized countries, WE PAY YOUR BILL! Tomorrow, your child or grandchild will pay ours, in case of need and so on. Sicko was a sad film, especially for a health care provider. It is beyond my understanding that people, even MEdical Doctors can refuse treatment, regardless of the cost (as long as it is necessary) to ANY patient because of financial issues. I still cannot believe it! If you live in the US, watch this film and check your policies or arrange for moving to another country. I would! If you live outside the US, feel happy, blessed and safe. Even if you health system is of low quality, you will not be denied of care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love travelling to America, I've visited about 12 states and spent quite some time there. I've also found Americans to be charming, kind and welcoming. BUT, this film shows how big business in the states is in bed with the government to the detriment of most Americans.I knew little of the health care system in the US but was totally shocked by Sicko. In European and indeed most civilised countries in the world we have health care that takes care of people regardless of their bank balance. Here in the UK, the NHS is not perfect but accurately represented in the movie. The American system relies on private insurance companies who care only for their bottom line, not their customers - after all they've already paid. Its pretty grim for those who do not have insurance, but even those who do can find themselves in a bad situation, through no fault of their own.It would be very easy for Moore to have painted a dour, depressing picture of the subject at hand, but he manages to place some lighthearted moments at just the right times. This film really opened my eyes, and I'm not too proud to say made them moist at times too, and I usually NEVER cry, being a man &amp; all! For the first time in my life, I actually feel sorry for the American people as I hadn't realised how underprivileged many Americans are. Its movies like this, if the enough people actually watch them, that will wake people up and make them demand better treatment from their government. Freedom doesn't equal survival of the fittest.I will still enjoy visiting to the USA, but I'll be even more careful to check my travel insurance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko proves that our system is what's really sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sicko! covers much more than the idiocy and ruthlessness of our own failed health care system. It illustrates how we've been propagandized into believing that all forms of socialized medicine, such as they have in Britain,Canada and France, for example, are much MORE functional than our system.I, for one, believed the stories of long waits for treatment and longer waits for simple doctor visits that are supposedly typical in these countries. Do I believe everything I saw in the movie at face value? No, but it's made me think, and it's made me curious to find out about more it. That's what good agitprop film making is supposed to do.For instance, did you know that in France, Doctors still make house calls? Moore rode shotgun one night with a travelling Parisian Doctor and went from call to call with him. These countries just take it for granted that they don't have to risk losing everything they have if they get sick. The people he interviewed are both amused and appalled when they hear of our predatory medical system. It's as if we're a third world country. We might as well be?we're ruled by third world despots.Which brings me to another thing.Why do we take it? Why don't we DO something about it? We're supposed to be a government by the people, of the people, and for the people. When did we lose that? When did we become so passive? When did the response to bull***t simply be to write a snarky blog entry or laugh at some comic's send up of it or just bitch and moan? WHAT DO WE DO????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, a horror movie. Despite the huge sarcasm and irony of the film, Moore explains brilliantly the terrible situation of the US health system.I knew that the US heath system was a private system but I couldn't imagine that it would be such pile of crap. When I saw the movie I started to compare the US private system with the Spanish free, universal, and government controlled system, and guess what, I felt sorry for all the people in the US. Yes, all the people, because the insurance companies are going to do everything they can to avoid paying the treatment the people need as it is shown in the movie.I have been in hospitals many many times. I've practiced Taekwondo more than ten years and the broken bones and injuries where part of my life. I never paid for any treatment, any plaster, any X-Ray or MRI. My father had non Hodgkin lymphoma had to suffer many operations, chemotherapy and radiology, and it was also free. And what is more important, I can't imagine a system that isn't free, simply I can't.This film in my opinion is not a message to the politicians or the government, is a message to the people of the so called greatest country in the world, it is a message to you if you're American and you're reading this. Stand up and claim the power that the big companies and their politician puppets have stolen. Do as we the Europeans do, get out, don't be afraid of the government, the government must be afraid of you BECAUSE IN DEMOCRACY THE Government IS AN EMPLOYEE, and you the people are the employer. Let them know who gives the orders. Demoracy is not something that happens every four years, if that happens the government is not better than dictatorship. If you do nothing to change the system but you still complain about it, to find the one that has the blame of it you will have to look in the mirror.If you are American please take care of yourself because you know what can happen, you might have to go to Cuba to get free health care.</fullReview>

We need to stop working within a system which rewards people for NOT providing care. (Remember, when your insurance company rejects your claim or refuses to provide service, their profit goes UP. They have no incentive to provide you with great service and no reason to ensure you get adequate care. Remember . . . they profit when you DON'T get care).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's "Sicko" is an entertaining film from a very gifted entertainer, that can't be denied. However, he doesn't have the best sense for keeping the entertainment in balance with the information he wants to communicate. He never goes into complex details, but rather asks very easy yes-no questions, that completely ignore the bigger context of the topic (like e.g. the thing with the laundry: it's a fun idea yes, but?). Moore seems to be of the opinion that he has to present complex problems in an easy to understand form, so he can reach the masses and there might be truth in that. That's the point also: His goals are right. Affordable health care for all people is important. If Moore wants to contribute his mite to a better system, I think there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is: It's hard to trust Moore on the life stories he presents and often victims of the system seem to be just a means to an end rather than people that he takes seriously with their problems and their views.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is Health care so horrendous in the states?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore does a fantastic job in opening the debate about our flawed health care system. What he forgets to do is follow up and explain why our system is so flawed. An explanation would have the viewers better understand how to rectify the situation and start moving towards a more Nationalized Health care System. Unlike the UK, Canada, and France; US citizens refuse to pay higher taxes. This alone forces our government to allow for the privatization of health care that we see in our nation today. Doctors refused to have their salaries decreased due to such astronomical malpractice insurance charges which are so high only because the nations citizens are more than ready to take our health care professionals to court for frivolous suites. Though we point the finger at our capital, what we need to realize is that it is our direct actions that result in our horrible health care system. If Moore were to touch on that, this movie would be fabulous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's Tremendously Important Pastiche of Atrocities about the American Health Care System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tremendously important cinematic beacon is Michael Moore's pastiche of atrocities about the American health care system, which is run for profit, and insurance companies, which pay bonuses to employees who are successful in denying coverage or claims.I have noticed that Michael Moore backs out of the arguably self-righteous spotlight little by little with each film. Unlike the Michael Moore we see in Roger &amp; Me, The Big One and Bowling For Columbine, he's on screen less, not so self-promoting, not going for so many laughs, though he continues to employ dry, unexpected humor as anesthetic. He merely reveals one story after another about American working people who are sick or have suffered the loss of someone very dear and close because we have an undemocratic, capitalist health care system. Governments in Canada, England and France, some being Conservative no less, all support universal health care, as if it's a no-brainer, which we would know if we didn't live in the United States, the only developed nation without it.But hold on. I've never been denied treatment. And my dad's life was saved by brain surgery. But I, Americans with my luck, and my father's, do not then have the right to dismiss accusations against our health care system, or turn away in disdain from any kind words about socialized medicine. Every American should be as fortunate as I have been. And as Moore makes painfully, movingly clear in Sicko, that is not the case, and some 50 million Americans have no insurance and probably never will. Insurance investigators generate lists and lists of conditions and procedures that are not covered, or come up with "pre-existing conditions" about which the patients apparently should've known. One woman, unconscious when she is put into an ambulance, is billed for the trip because it was not "pre-authorized." Who are we? Shouldn't this sort of thing speak loud and clear for itself?All the FOX commentators, of course, as well as some on CNN, found the film to be an outrageous piece of "anti-American" propaganda in favor of socialism. They find fault with every Michael Moore film, it seems, but one can find fault with any attack on our system. But there's room for exciting comeuppance when the webmaster of an anti-Moore internet site can't afford to maintain it when his wife falls ill, because he needed US $12,000 to cover the costs of medical treatment for her. You will be unable to help but cheer at what you find Moore has done. And room for boiling blood when a claims investigator for an insurance company confesses to Congress that she was her company's tool for denying life-saving care.To vilify socialized medicine is to vilify the 24-hour service in France that provides house calls by physicians, with one of whom Moore goes for a ride. Or the day care for $1 an hour and cooking, cleaning, and laundry services for those on maternity leave, again in France. And to vilify these things in the way in which American media tends to do means glorifying the denied government funds for the 9/11 rescue workers Moore interviews to care for physical and psychological maladies they subsequently developed, including shellshock and respiratory ailments. It is to glorify their resorting to sailing with Moore to Cuba to obtain the free care given to the supposed enemies detained at Gitmo, an attempt which abruptly ends when a siren resounds from the base, and the group moves on to the long-vilified Havana, where they happen upon free medical treatment. Providing only their name and birth date, the 9/11 volunteers receive medical attention. Not only that, but they are honored by a local Havana fire station.Cinema is juxtaposition. It is the power of juxtaposition, and in Sicko, perhaps the quintessential documentary, Moore juxtaposes the backdrop of the history of the American health care "debate," throughout which opponents of universal health care are apposed in the context of 1950s-style anti-communist propaganda. A 1960s Ronald Reagan record distributed by AMA uses the basic media signification of fear to instill that universal health care leads to communism. And, in reply, Moore brings side by side that socialized public services like police, fire service, postal service, public education and community libraries have not led to communism.</fullReview>

I had no idea that the country declaring itself as "The greatest nation" had this kind of policy, that the leaders were such moneymonkeys.I live in Sweden, we have the healthcare system that USA turned down, and i can say that i have never been happier that i was born here. I'm thinking about moving to France...The movie is charming, warm, funny and educating, it contains a lot of irony and really lets you see how the American health care system affects the people living in that country, that "great nation". Maybe Mel Gibson should leave the American flag out of the picture next time he rides heroicly to the rescue in a movie, or they should cut down just a little bit on the "I'm proud to be American"! As of now, i won't believe it the way i used to. This movie is a disgrase to the American leaders, and they should be very happy that they have Sir Michael Moore to create fantastic movies about their flaws.This is one movie, that i will buy, not just rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Finger In the Wound of the American Health Care Corporations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this documentary, the brilliant director / writer Michael Moore exposes the dysfunctional North American health care system, oriented to huge profits and not for their mission of saving lives. Further, her shows the corruption in the political system, with members of government and congress "bought" by the corporations and the situation of the average American citizens, including those that volunteered to work in the rescue mission of the September 11th. Then he travels to Canada, Great Britain and France to compare their systems showing their hospital, doctors, staffs and patients. Last but not the least, he shows that the prisoners in Guantanamo have better medical treatment than the common people in USA, and he ends getting free treatment to the Americans that participate along the documentary in Cuba.I am a great fan of Michael Moore, and"Sicko" is probably his sharpest documentary. The comparison among First World Country health care systems is important but the conclusion in Cuba is heartbreaking and full of emotion. One thing that impresses me is how brave and patriot this man is; he is certainly wealthy but instead of accommodating himself, he raises his flag of opposition to The Powers That Be and makes powerful enemies to defend his strong idealistic position and is not afraid to disclose what is wrong in his country. In this documentary, he puts his finger in the wound of the American Healthcare Corporations to show how ill this elitist system is. I believe most nations might need filmmakers with the courage of Michael Moore to denounce what is wrong in their systems and make the electors aware of the behavior of their politicians. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "SOS Saúde" ("SOS Health")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a very proud American, I love this country, we have a lot of freedom, great food, kind people, and we stick together in a time of need, except for one thing, when it comes to health and debt, our country isn't the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. Health care in our country is horrible, Michael Moore didn't need to point that out, except for those select few that health insurance came pretty easily to them. While I do agree with Michael Moore's documentary, he does do a biased opinion. America does have the medicine and every machine possible to help run tests, the only problem is that doctors have now become more about money than helping people, insurance denials take away life saving tests and operations, among with other major flaws like what the insurance company can handle and pay for. Michael Moore takes this documentary to point out how hard it is in America and how scary it is to get sick if you have no health insurance.America is one of the lowest countries in the world when it comes to health, other countries that we have labeled as "third world" are extremely kind and have free or cheaper health care where the doctors seem to really care about their patients. In this documentary we meet several people who either have or don't have health insurance and what has effected their lives with their failing health. Including a very sad story about 9/11 volunteers who America seemed to forget about and their health is now deteriorating because they were not on the pay roll like the fire fighters or policemen, so they've been refused treatment.Sicko does hit home even more, a couple years ago I was without insurance, it was scary, I told my mom if I got into a car accident, my car would be OK, but what about me? Even now my insurance has so many catches and doesn't cover everything, but there is only so much you can do in life. While I think that Moore does forget about certain pro's of American Health Care, he does make his point across with how other countries seem to really care about each other. I did have a customer at my work who was visiting from Canada, I commented how great it must be to have free health care and she said that they do pay it in taxes, but I feel like at least they're still covered, it's a different kind of insurance and I really hope that America will change it's health care system. Unfortunately, I don't think it will happen any time soon, but this documentary will open eyes.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me alienate as many people as possible by saying that I am a huge Michael Moore fan. A "Moorist," if you will. I've seen "Roger and Me," "Bowling for Columbine," and "Fairenheidt 911." I've read "Stupid White Men" and "Dude, Where's My Country." I'm hooked as hooked can be, and I love a troublemaker.This film, be you Democrat or Republican--or anything in between---should scare the ever living hell out of you. It doesn't choose sides between donkey or elephant, it simply states the scary facts that our European friends have known for quite some time--our health care SUCKS. As someone who since childhood has been forced to take chronic medication, the fact that my medication costs a relative nickle in Cuba cut me to the core. Let me go a step further--living in Key West, FL, I'm closer to Havana than Miami (90 miles compared to 150 miles)--anybody got a boat? To know that a doctor can be called in Paris at any hour of the night for free, to know that you can have a child in London without worrying about expenses--and, getting your cab fare home, if you don't mind, and to know that the only questions you're asked in Havana is your age and name when you are seeking medical attention is an absolute travesty! And, for those of you still choosing to see the Emperor's New Clothes, if it doesn't work in countries far older than ours, DON'T YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE CHANGED IT BY NOW???? Even if you're a Reaganite, THATCHER DIDN'T TOUCH IT! Blair wouldn't have dreamed of it! I know if I had a terminal illness where'd I'd be headed--Air France, baby, all the way. In fact, when it was brought up during the film by an audience member that a mass exodus to France might be in order, we all cheered! All you nay sayers out there have obviously never been really sick and in need of help, and if you have and are still unmoved from this film, you've obviously drank the Kool-Aid and will still fear the Burkha no matter what logic is banged over your head. Kiss your gun that the constitution allows you to have under your pillow. It's a sad state when you'd rather carry a semiautomatic than be able to insure your children and loved one's physical health. While you're holding your gun and cursing the terrorists, pray you don't shoot yourself in the foot. Blue Cross won't cover it.We'll rally around so much in this country, it's a shame we don't see that the rest of the world, through the red, white and blue, can see us for what we are...money hungry Darwinists...you know--survival of the fittest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Michael Moore's best movie so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Michael Moore because he says things that need to be said. But I'm glad that the tone of this movie is much less snarky and adolescent, and that the cheap shots and bouts of wild speculation are mostly eliminated. Moore is kind and respectful with everyone he talks to in this movie, and he lets them tell their own stories in their own way. People who are determined to find something to complain about will no doubt be able to find things to dislike here, but that's true of any movie or any creative work of any kind.In structure, this is like other Moore movies, a documentary which advocates a side of an issue - in this case, that the U.S. should convert to a single-payer health care system like England, France, and Canada. He presents the stories of the uninsured and of fully insured Americans who were refused treatment, with mostly tragic results. He presents the stories of some professionals who worked in the medical insurance industry and regretted their role in rejecting claims and blocking treatment. He also talks to doctors and patients in the Canadian, French, and British medical systems about their much better experiences.This approach is vulnerable to the standard complaint against anecdotal evidence, that a different choice of anecdotes would yield different results. But Moore also includes the basic incontrovertible facts - Americans spend more than anyone else on health care (counting taxes, premiums, and out-of-pocket) and get health care that ranks 37th in the world (just ahead of Slovenia), and that our life expectancy and infant mortality, among many other metrics, are worse than the rest of the developed world. It has been pointed out that Cuba, which Moore also visits in the movie, ranks 39th, but Cuba is a Third World country under U.S. embargo which spends (no matter whose numbers you use) less than one-twentieth what Americans spend on health care per capita.The point of all the true stories is not to "prove" that the American system is bad and that the other systems are better - the facts cited above make that case. It is to humanize the issue, to remove it from the world of numbers and ideology and put it in the world of real people and their real lives. Whether or not the British, French, and Canadian responses he got are typical or reflect the exact statistical averages in those countries, they demonstrate that the single payer systems are not hellish and totalitarian as Americans have been led to believe (also that the incentives in a single-payer system are to save money by keeping patients healthy, not to save money by denying treatment as in our system). And the stories of insured and uninsured Americans makes it clear that this is not a purely theoretical issue suitable for airy debate, but a crisis that calls out for action.The ideologues and interested parties have been out in force, trying to refute the case Moore has made for single-payer health care. So far all they've come up with are fairly silly nitpicks (for example, the man who lost two fingertips had for practical purposes a choice between attaching the one for $60,000 and the other for $12,000, but the hospital did not present the matter to him in exactly those words) and some criticisms of the Canadian, British, and French systems. But neither Moore nor anybody else ever said that those systems were above criticism of any kind. Furthermore, we pay more for health care per capita than any of those countries, so we should be able to do better than they do instead of mostly worse. Amongst actual Brits, French, and Canadians, it's hard to find any but a few cranks and extremists who would propose to replace their systems with one like ours.By the way, I refer to counterarguments and attacks on the movie that I have read in other fora, not on IMDb. I consider it inappropriate to comment on the other reviews. Also, I checked "spoiler" only because I mentioned Cuba, on the off chance that that might be considered a spoiler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mourn not the dead, but rather mourn the apathetic throng who sees the world's great anguish and its wrongs, yet dare not speak." (source unknown).Michael Moore reminded me of this while I was sitting through his spellbinding and not to be missed new documentary.This time we have a restrained Michael Moore who delivers his punches through the many he interviewed for this, his best film to date, in my opinion.The huddled masses of the supposedly advanced civilization that is the U.S.A. of today are not being cared for in the most basic of ways, their health and welfare used by profiteers who have a flagrant disregard for life (and limb in some cases).I admit to crying many times throughout this film. The woman who lost her beloved husband, the seniors moving into their daughter's basements, the old man (seventy nine) working at cleaning a store to pay for his and his wife's drugs, the woman who lost her precious toddler. And what is absolutely shocking to me is that these were people who were supposedly covered by insurance plans. Mike did not bother with the forty-five million U.S. citizens who are not covered by any plan whatsoever. What a powerful indictment of the corruption of power and the appalling takeover of the U.S. government by private and powerful corporate lobbyists.Mike takes a long hard look at other countries, (Canada, U.K., France and Cuba (Cuba?!!)) and evaluates their systems. Well, ahem, Mike, anything, anything is better than what the U.S. has. The true test of civilization lies in how the best off treat their worst off and the sight of an old, muddled woman being dumped out unceremoniously onto a skid row road by a taxi paid for by a H.M.O. is devastating. There were muffled sobs and gasps in the audience I was in.The trip to Cuba was enlightening and again I cried for these selfless people who went to hell and back for the victims of 911 only to become victims themselves of their own monstrous health-care system and got the best care in Havana and met with their fire department counterparts.I won't get into the denial of coverages on the flimsiest of excuses, the avarice and murderous neglect of the corporations that own these HMOs. Suffice to say that everyone in the U.S. should see this and RISE UP. Where in heaven's name, and the names of all who have died and were maimed so needlessly, is the outrage?? The population of the U.S., I surmise, is sedated by the fear of their own government and as one British M.P. so succinctly put it: Fearful people are depressed and do not vote. Plus the ceaseless brainwashing of a people told they are the greatest nation in the world and kept insulated from the rest of us has taken its toll on the least of its citizens. Just look at the U.S. MSM and the insularity and idolatry of its 'info-tainment' system. No international news whatsoever and the clear-eyed journalism of the past a distant memory. Everything bought and paid for. Including its so-called politicians. And the very lives (infant mortality higher than many so-called third world countries) and needless deaths of its citizens. See this movie and weep but RISE UP, U.S. Citizens. Take back your country! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world will never be the same. The triumph of this film is its pathos, philosophical correctness, and vigor. It is also this: the energy that Moore creates on the screen by visiting other countries and showing Americans what life can be like, in effect, showing them and letting them feel the effects that universal health care can have on a populace is astounding, thus making the film's formal qualities on a par to be emulated in this regard. Show as well as tell indeed. "They are afraid of us," a Frenchman speaks about their government to the audience, "While in America, the people are afraid of them." Free education and free medical insurance are now ideas that are on the table casting their shadows, where they did not have tangible form before the film. This is the way art can change the world. If any aspiring filmmaker doesn't know where to start, I would hope that they pick up any month's issue of reader's digest, flip through it; there are at least three documentary subjects in every issue that are worth the effort, and if done with sensitivity, intelligence, and heart, will be rewarded. Let's hope so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressingly truthful -- one of the most important films of the last five years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me just say that I am 13 years old. Yet, this does not mean that I am so ignorant as to not know what goes on in the business of healthcare. I stay on top of political issues, and I read the news regularly to see what's going on in our world.So, naturally, I've grown accustomed to Michael Moore's ideas and, when I heard of his new film "Sicko" that would exploit everything wrong with America's healthcare system, I got excited.I saw Sicko last night and let me say right now that it does not disappoint. Michael Moore has created a painfully truthful documentary that seriously opens your eyes to yet another thing America lacks: true care for people who are sick and can't afford it. Moore takes us on a 2 hour long trip interviewing people and discovering their horror stories about their health insurance companies refusing to cover their necessary health expenses, and for incredibly shallow reasons.Now hang on a second. Don't we already know all this? The answer is yes. But Michael Moore takes everything we know and magnifies it 100x so we can view it in full spectrum. The result is clear: depression about how awful our country, the land of the free and home of the brave, is on healthcare.Next, Moore takes us along on journeys to Canada, the UK, France, and even Cuba to show us how amazing their healthcare is. Moore talks to the locals to find out their stories and then compares them in full force to the horrifying tales of injured and/or sick Americans who don't have--or can't reason with--health insurance.The painfully truthful documentary is accompanied by Moore's special, dry, tongue-in-cheek humour that we know so well from his other films. You'll be laughing at one moment, and the next moment staring in absolute sheer horror at what is being exploited right before our eyes.Whether you are young, old, sick, healthy, with health insurance, or without health insurance, Sicko is definitely worth the high admission prices we pay these days for the movies. See this film, in no way will you be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad documentary on a good cause.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What irks me most about Michael Moore is the (rather inexplicable) idea that somehow he is a brave radical, railing against the system.Making a government-critical documentary in North Korea is brave. Blowing the whistle on ex-KGB members is brave. Robbing Duncan Ferguson's house in a Liverpool shirt is brave.Taking cheap shots at the US government is not brave, in fact it has made him lots of money and given him a lot of fanboys and fangirls.His documentary's have all the bias of a football manager, with cherry-picked facts and awkward symbolism that make it difficult to take him seriously. At least in the UK we know that the grass is not half as green as he makes out.For example, a typical segment on the (U.K.) National Health Service will go something like this.---------------------------------------------------------------Michael Moore: "So how much did your stay in hospital cost?"Patient:"Nothing, it was free."MM (in apparent surprise): "No, what I mean is how much did the operation cost?" Patient: "Nothing, it was free." MM (more surprise): "OK, but how much did the medicine cost?" Patient: "Nothing, it is all free." MM (yet more surprise, goes to find doctor): "How much did you charge the patient"Doctor: "Nothing, it is all free.......... Listen Michael, we explained all this months before we started filming - it's all free. Surely you can't have forgotten?" MM: "So you must get paid very little right?"Doctor: "Not really, enough to get by" MM: "Yes, but you must have to walk ten miles to work every day, right?" Doctor: "Actually, I own a car" MM: "...and work 25 hours a day and eat gravel for breakfast..."Doctor: "Erm, no" MM: "...and live in a shed..." Doctor: "Actually, I live in the lost city of Atlantis, in a penthouse suite, with 20 servants and Donald Trump as my butler" MM: "And this is all free, right?" Doctor: "Yes, you see, it doesn't get paid for by taxes, but by Tony Benn" MM: "Uh-huh?" Doctor: "You see, Tony Benn's arse is actually a never-ending cash dispenser - it pays for the whole NHS" MM: "So we should have this system in the USA then huh?" ---------------------------------------------------------------Not once does MM ever give even the slightest bit of balance to his campaign. Never does he mention the patients left in ambulances in order to meet government targets on waiting-times. Not once does he find someone who can't get treatment because *Britain* cannot afford it. Most pertinently at all, never does he discuss why many Britons ACTUALLY WANT TO GO AND PAY FOR PRIVATE TREATMENT, EVEN THOUGH FREE NHS TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE.What makes it all worse is MM's latching on to single, emotive examples, leaving the camera rolling too long just to get his 'money shot', of someone crying, to show the cruelty of the system. He just can't help himself, like when he needlessly tells us all how he donated money to the guy running an anti MM website, as if we were supposed think "What a guy! you da man Michael". No Michael, you aren't the man. You're a false man-of-the-people who makes money out of wearing a baseball cap and playing the aggrieved for all they're worth. If a big-bad-rich-capitalist tried to buy the silence of a critic in the media, you'd be onto them like a ton of bricks.Don't get me wrong, I'd be in favour of universal healthcare in the US. There's a decent documentary to be made here, but this just isn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Michael Moore has opened Pandora's box with his new film Sicko. This time he shines a light on Americas broken health care system. Having lived over seas for the better part of ten years (7 years in Italy and almost 3 years in Japan) I can say that in almost every corner of the industrialized world has better health care system. I still can't fathom that America is barely above Slovenia in infant mortality. (WTF!?) I don't even know where the hell Slovenia is! Fox news lambastes France for being almost communist with there dirty liberal socialized health care system. Funny they seem to have the best system in the world followed closely by Italy. Now I will say that medical technology in America is un-surpassed, as long as you can pay for it. We perfected the MRI and digital X-rays. We came up with the AIDS cocktail, yet we can't figure a way to provide adequate health care for working Americans. I don't even care about getting free health care, how about affordable. I think Michael Moore is a great American in that he is using his right of free speech to bring this ugly truth to light. See this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grievous Look at What 'We' Have Become</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by saying that I consider myself a religious conservative. That's if you must pigeonhole a bible-believing Christian who has turned his life over to Jesus Christ. The only reason I mention this is that there are STRONG reasons why every Christian should see this movie. In fact, there are strong reasons why all American citizens should see this movie. Another reason I mention my beliefs is that I know that the 'religious right' have usually lambasted any of Michael Moore's documentaries. Unfortunately for them, he is right 90% of the time.In this movie, there are compelling stories of health insurance company &amp; hospital indifference leading to patient's deaths. There are stories of those who have lost everything due to the insane costs associated with being sick in America. And, there are stories of countries that treat health care as something that is essential and who GIVE it to there citizens as a right, not a privilege. You will be sickened and appalled by how we treat our own citizens in comparison to how they are treated in a poor, under-developed communist regime like Cuba. You will see that socialist medicine practiced in countries like Canada, France and England provides for stress-free care to all of their citizens. And you will see that our politicians, within our current corporatocracy where 1% of the population controls 80% of the wealth, do not care about changing the system as their purses are being lined with blood money from the industry itself.I was almost in tears several times during this movie. Michael's questions towards the end of the movie are stirring and will make you think. One of them is "What have we become?" Sicko challenged and chastened me for my lack of caring. I hope and pray it does the same for all of you.</fullReview>

This movie compares the health care systems of the USA, Canada, France, England, and Cuba. The US is the only country that denied health care to anyone. Especially disturbing are 9/11 rescue workers that are denied health care in the US and granted health care by Cuba. After seeing this movie I went home and wrote my congresswoman and senators to ask for progress on a universal health care plan. I suggest that every American see this movie.

		<fullReview>Americans are so proud of their country, and so ignorant about the rest of the world. We arrogantly think we have the best of everything here, and Moore's film shows clearly how wrong that notion is. Health care systems in Canada, Britain, France and even (god forbid) Cuba exceed ours by a large measure, both in terms of cost and quality. "Sicko" traces the development of the HMO system from Nixon up to the present, and shows how America's corrupt health system actually provides incentives to provide as little care as possible. Will we ever wake up to how our corporate socialism cons us and exploits us? Maybe we will if Michael Moore makes enough films! He is a national treasure for his humor, compassion and truthfulness, and every American should go see this film, for their own sake as well as that of their fellow citizens.

		<shortDescription>Moore reveals another monstrosity behind the veil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore pulls the curtains on one of Washington's longest-running vaudeville shows. This time around, we are introduced to familiar villains from previous episodes, and all new monstrosities. This time around, the heavies are the parasitic health care and pharmaceutical industry. Your blood will boil. You may wish to have yourself fumigated after having realized the extent of the HMO infestation. We knew the general nature of the problem, but as the saying goes, the devil is in the details. And details there are.The lives we explore, ordinary citizens nearly broken by our plutocracy, will render an undeniable picture of corruption. Their stories will make your heart ache. Behind the bureaucracy's curtains, we see evidence of a legion of suffering Americans. They drift on the wind, from town to town, sustained by the vile organism they are literally dying to feed. Whether or not you like the man, Moore, you cannot deny his patriotism. What he has done, is brought these haunted lives into the light of public opinion for all to see. This is not an indictment of Americans, but a rally of hope. Nowhere in the world is there more potential for democracy than in America, the great experiment.</fullReview>

(This is probably symptomatic of a minute country's inferiority complexes...)

		<shortDescription>Health Cared to Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Sicko today at a sold-out sneak preview in Las Vegas. My neck still hurts because I had to sit in the first row, as I came in last minute.The movie got plenty of applause during the entire film and when the final credits were rolling. And I have to say well-deserved applause.I have always been a fan of Michael Moore, but this is his best so far and I can only hope that the right and plenty of people are going to see it and that America gets up in arms and starts fighting the insurance and pharma industry.And not only the health insurances the entire insurance mafia.Actually, for me there was nothing new in this movie. I have lived through abuses and denials myself or through friends and acquaintances; we all experienced, how cruel the health care system in the U.S. is. A civilized nation, who health cares their citizens to death?I also have lived in France, Great Britain, Germany and Italy and everywhere medical care was better, easier and cheaper than in the U.S. I am not saying that it was perfect, but definitely much better and much more humane than here. I was also grateful to Michael to point out that in other countries doctors make house calls, overworked mothers get government assistance, people get long paid vacation, paid maternity and sick leave and an illness does not mean financial and mental ruin. Here an illness makes you even sicker because of all the problems you have with insurance companies, outrageous bills, doctors performing all kind of unnecessary tests because they are afraid of being sued, loss of income, employers firing you because of your illness, etc.We are not on this earth to make a few rich and live in slavery to pay for dividends of share holders and multi-million dollar salaries of CEOs.Michael also made it clear that fear-mongering and financial oppression are the favorite tools of corporate America to enslave people. First they sleep-school everybody into obedient little consumers and drug them up to the eyebrows.I am so glad that somebody else tells people that living in the U.S. may not be the greatest thing on earth. I get so tired being told that by people, who have never set a foot outside their state, do not own a passport and whose only connection to foreigners is to illegal uneducated immigrants, who are mowing their lawns or are cleaning their kitchen. Usually when I told somebody about health care and working conditions in other countries, the reaction was: Why don't you go there, if you do not like it here? They have been so indoctrinated that their system is the best, that they just cannot believe that somewhere else things might be better than here. Of course, if somebody tells them that now they have to drink better tasting coffee for 4 or 5 dollar instead of the 75 cents including refills, they used to pay, they gladly do that. When I told people before Starbucks that American coffee tastes and looks like colored dish wash-water, guess what I was told: Why don't you leave?Thanks, Michael Moore, I hope the movie becomes a huge blockbuster and you will be able to make many more movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sicko is a masterpiece! It left me feeling like I was living in the wrong country. The United States, the "Greatest Country In The World?" Hogwash! More like, "the best brainwashed" people in the world!" Other countries have their priorities straight, that is Canada, France, and even demonized "Third-World" Cuba! In the United States, where we pride ourselves for our "freedom" and "fair play," we tolerate a Heath Care system which gives hard-working, medically-insured, middle class people the freedom to die, in order to maximize corporate profits! And, God help you if you don't have Health Insurance in the United States - it's "fair play" to literally dump you in the front of a homeless shelter in a hospital gown while you're disoriented. I mean, you can't afford treatment so let the Catholic Church, or some other third party, play doctor at an emergency shelter! While we have been brainwashed about the evils of Fidel Castro's Cuba, the vast majority of the residents of present day "Communist" China would be slobbering all over themselves to have such advanced and universal medical care as Cuba does. For Pete's sake, it took China many years just to get HIV out of their domestic blood supply! But yet, no one in authority, dares demonize "Red" China. Why? Because our two governments are in bed with each other to such a degree neither really cares what the other does to its own people! But Cuba, which is exporting medical breakthroughs, like vaccines, to the entire world, is Public Enemy # 1! Why? Because they won't obey our "American" rules with regards to screwing their own people out of benefits such as Universal Health care! I don't for a second think any country is perfect, whether it be Canada, France, Cuba or any other nation, for that matter. But, when a country that is so incredibly wealthy, powerful and technologically advanced, as the United States, lets numerous people suffer and/or die solely to maximize corporate profits, then it's time for marching in the streets! Maybe we all should be taking lessons from the French! They know how to bring their government to its knees in order to benefit the many over the few!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The conservatives have tried to Freep IMDb with their screeds based on either 1.) Not seeing the movie; or 2.) Watching a pirated copy, making the MPAA and Baby Jesus cry.However, this has to be Michael Moore's best. He steps into the background and lets people wronged, or whose family were killed, by the scattershot American health care system, state his case for him.Conservatives love to use horror stories about how Canadians have to wait 10 years for a knee replacement, or that Britons can't get Botox, or that the French live for 50 years because they smoke and eat fatty foods. This film puts a lie to all of that; Moore simply *asks* his subjects in foreign countries, whether patients, doctors or other health care professionals, about what happens when someone needs medical care. No more, no less.Other people (including reviewers like David Denby of the New Yorker) faux-naively say that Moore doesn't have any solutions. Of course Moore has a solution - either single-payer like in Canada or a NHS like in the UK. The problem in implementation is not going to be finding money; it's going to be fighting off the insurance industry and hospital lobbyists who won't like their cash cow being slaughtered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko, and my upcoming personal experience with Insurance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to give Sicko 10 out of 10, as I believe in its message 100%; that the insurance industry in this country is exploitive. Michael Moore doesn't delve deeply into statistics as he knows the American public doesn't have patience for them, so he relies on anecdote. Of course, he goes too far in presenting one side, when he would actually win more converts if he presented both, and let the public decide for themselves. My personal experience: I work in the insurance field, and I am about to leave; it was only the insurance that made me stay. I am about to take a test to determine if I am diabetic; a little late, as I am about to lose my insurance. Now I may change my mind; because, as his movie states correctly, if I am found to be diabetic, I will never get insurance again! I will find out just in time for my insurance to run out. So what do I do? Get the test and find out I am diabetic, &amp; not get insurance again, or don't get tested and live with my gradually worsening state of health? Without insurance, I can't afford treatment for diabetes. So I may need to cancel my appointment (so the insurance company doesn't find out) and wait until I get insurance again, which may be never. Meanwhile, untreated diabetes only gets worse. And if they find out I suspected I'm diabetic, the new insurer will cancel me anyway. That is the place I am in. I wonder how many millions of Americans are in the same place for different reasons? This is the richest country on earth. We are "Number One". And this is the way we have to live? In fear of our health? Only in America....And Michael Moore's critics call him "UnAmerican". The question of Sicko is: What is American? Supporting capitalism to the point of sacrificing life and health (hopefully others', not yours), or saying this is a pathetic situation, and we need to do better for our people?By the way, did I mention I work in insurance? Right now my company is bribing the Governator to throw Californians a bone &amp; insure the poor. Awwww, how sweet. They've put hundreds of thousands of dollars in this millionaire Governor's pocket. Again, what a sweet gesture. Do you think they're doing it out of charity, or because they see Californians waking up and getting angry? So they're throwing you a bone. And if you accept the bone my company is throwing you (i.e., the current proposed scam), a bone is all you're gonna get. Go see Sicko, however biased you think Michael Moore is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I assume that if you went to see "Sicko", then you fully agree with everything that Michael Moore says. I don't know what more he can do to get the American people to demand national, single-payer health care. I mean, probably the two best things that he did were taking the 9/11 workers to Cuba to receive the top-notch treatment that American insurance companies denied them, and then anonymously sending the man trashing him money to pay for an operation (Moore will affirm that even his worst enemy deserves quality health care).As for people who claim that Canadians and Europeans would rather have an American-style health care system (my mom's brother asserted this), one can safely assume that such people don't know any Canadians or Europeans; I know some Europeans, and they wouldn't give up national health care for anything.An important question would be: even if the US got national health care, would the right wing accept it? Even if you remind them that the fire department, schools and libraries are socialized, what would they say? About the whole part where Ehrlichman gets Nixon to side with the HMOs in setting up the health care system so as to deny people care, that's the sort of thing that I wouldn't even have expected Nixon to do. Having seen everything that Bush has done, Nixon looks really good.But, as Moore has affirmed, he hopes that "Sicko" will encourage Americans to demand a real health care system. Considering the massive applause that he got at the Cannes Film Festival, it's hard to challenge him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Lopsided Of All Michael Moore's Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have at least two marbles rolling around in your head, you can't watch SICKO and not realize the extreme lopsidedness of this well-filmed documentary. I should preface that comment with the fact that I've worked in the medical field for over two decades and know full-well that the insurance system in our country (the U.S.) is broken.Having enjoyed Michael Moore's previous documentaries (BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE and FAHRENHEIT 9/11), there's always been a problem with his representation of only one side of the issues. Granted that "the other side" pushes back in different ways (governmental regulations, etc.), I feel Mr. Moore could improve his standing as an upright denizen of justice (as he know doubt sees himself) if he would pull in opposing views. Bowling and Fahrenheit did some of that, but not much. And here with Sicko, Mr. Moore doesn't do it at all.The biggest problem is that Mr. Moore shows the downtrodden in America, those on the lower income scale (mostly), or those without homes (the disoriented lady dropped off on a corner by a cab driver after being released from a hospital), but doesn't show this same economic class when comparing insurance related issues in socialized countries (Great Britain and France). In countries with socialized medicine, Mr. Moore focuses his lens on the middle or upper class, making it seem that this is the epitome of what the U.S. lacks. Socialized medicine is shown as the golden chalice, something that will fix our ailing medical and insurance industries. The fact is that socialized medicine probably IS what the U.S. needs, but we also need to see the downside to it. Taxes will be affected heavily, wait times for various tests will probably increase, and incomes for doctors and other healthcare professionals will be curtailed. The amazing thing to me is that I don't find any of these things off-putting. I'm willing to pay extra taxes, have increased patient loads for tests, and to have my salary dropped ...if everyone in our great nation could be covered.For all its flaws, Sicko is entertaining. And it makes anyone who watches it think about how messed up our healthcare systems are. Seeing Cuba's minimalist medical practices is fun to watch but Mr. Moore doesn't show their limited medical supplies. Watching him and his entourage go to GitMo to try and get free healthcare was laughable and a bit stupid, though (all he needed to do to prove that there is a socialized system already in the U.S. is to go to a federal prison ...but that wouldn't have been as dramatic).If Mr. Moore wants to increase his exposure and retain a semblance of authority on anything he films, he'll need to improve his standards as far as showing the issues from multiple viewpoints and multiple socio-economic households.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a true tragic-comedy, balanced out to pure Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore, even with all of those who have lambasted him over and over again, serves a strong purpose in this day and age. In a time when democrats can whimper out of many an issue, Moore is someone who's got guts as a muckraker and filmmaker, but also as just a thinking member of the populous. The health-care crisis (and it is a crisis, in America anyway) is his target this time, and it's one that goes beyond the usual party politics or instantly hot-button issues like 9/11, Bush and guns. Everyone gets sick, it's a fact of life, and unless you're young and healthy and die instantly in a car crash or other you're bound to have to deal with death and the ailments that perpetually lead to it. It's not Moore's intention to find out how people get sick- that could be for a whole other movie, probably by somebody else- but to reveal two major things. how America, the only first-world nation to not provide universal health-care, makes it in the corporate interest for the insurance companies to people to STAY sick and, even crueler, to more than likely let one die than to help save a life (and not simply for those who don't have health-care, but for those who do and get screwed as if it were with your car). And, how other countries, countries that the news media in this country for many years has said is wrong and bad in different respects (eg France and Cuba), pretty much laugh when asked questions like "do you have to pay?" or "how much does your medication cost." What Moore is revealing here ever so clearly is how common sense is put to the wayside and used as an issue, at least by the government, who by the way are paid off by the insurance companies, and pragmatism is put aside for profit. There are some crushing scenes, aside from the typical human interest angles- and there may be more here than in any other Moore film, for first third it's nothing but depressing testimonials ranging from choosing which cut off finger to save to 'I had a brain tumor, and later died'- where we see one person stand up to testify to congress in 1996 about what horrors the insurance companies allowed by way of choosing money over actual care, and maybe as one of the greatest real-life moments/tributes to fallen humanity a poor woman who's dropped off in a cab from her hospital back to the slums, shown on the security cameras as wandering around in a total daze. And what's more terrifying to contemplate than a baby (actually two babies to be precise) dying of a fever due to the HMO not covering enough for proper care? It comes down to Moore having to ask a question he's been pondering throughout his research: Who are we? What have we become? But it would be less typical of Moore to not have his satirist's cap on some of the time, and there are many moments where Sicko is blisteringly funny, as when he showcases the "terrors" of socialism and its connection to social health-care (featuring Ronald Regean on an instructional record from many years past), or just in his choice of songs (i.e. "I got a golden ticket"), or in his bravest move, an exceptional balance of tragic sincerity and laugh-out-loud theatrics, in taking a group of 9/11 workers who were permanently marked with major health problems left untreated due to over-priced health-care to Guantanamo Bay, the only place on US soil where there IS free health-care. As usual, Moore is top-notch in putting together freewheeling images of pop-culture and images of politicians in mock-able order (number signs over the congressmen as to how much they're bought by lobbyists), and he skillfully weaves together bits of levity when he's talking with his international counterparts- Canadians included- while making it endlessly informative in an accessible way. I loved the scenes in England when we're given light on how National Healthcare works, how it all seems to work out for both patients (who actually get *paid* to get rides home) and the doctors. The same levity, of course, can revert to a creepy feeling, like hearing how the current form of American health-care got started- thanks Nixon! A lot of this, as any great work of non-fiction film-making should do, will stir up questions from anyone who's willing to go for the simple premise that the insurance companies make things a hundred thousand times more difficult than in the other countries presented. It's always a tough call regarding taxes, and if they should be raised or not, but even if that isn't the case the posit of Sicko, an extremely well presented one, should not be ignored. Presented as an accessible entertainment while also a call to arms, Sicko is one of the most important films of the year, and maybe just as prevalent, funny, and consciousness-shattering in impact as Fahrenheit 9/11.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"SiCKO is Moore's most depressing documentary film yet and will no doubt start discussions"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With any Michael Moore film it's hard to take what he says at face value. There are so many two faced scenes in his other films to believe him and his biased ways. Yet his views are views shared by millions of people. Once again Moore shows the United States in it's most inane state and gives us his most depressing documentary film yet, that will undoubtedly get people talking. With Moore's films it's always hard to review because you have to look at it from two perspectives. One is from the political stand point, the other is obviously from the technical standpoint of the film. Either way you look at it, the film is outstanding on both accounts. Moore has just as many haters as he does lovers and this film is no different. There will be people who praise it for it's message to the American government to change their ways, while others will condemn it for its praise of other countries and the "facts" it presents us. Bottom line is any documentary you see is going to be biased, Moore's films are no different. I myself live in Canada, so I do get free health care, technically, so I can't really begin to understand the horrors of what Americans with no insurance go through, I can only go on by what this film and others have shown me (John Q anyone?). But it seems that the message in all of them are clear, that whatever it is the government is doing, it's not working.Moore compares the health care system of America to other countries, such as Canada, France and Britain. The one contrast that sticks out in my mind is when a man from the States had the tips of two of his fingers cut off, he had a choice: Save the middle tip for $60,000 or the ring finger for $12,000. The man chose the more romantic and cheaper finger to save, the tip of his other finger was thrown away into the dump. A man from Canada had it even worse, all of his fingers were cut off during an accident, at the knuckle. He went into surgery for approximately 24 hours and they were all saved and his has motion in all of them. This cost him nothing. This is the same predicament (one wasn't as bad as the other though) and the outcome was totally different.A woman who went bankrupt and was forced to live with his daughter has to pay $240+ for drug prescriptions, which she can get in Cuba for about 5 cents. If America if the richest country and the world an its citizen always seem to proclaim that it's the greatest country in the world; then why is this happening. Why are rescue workers from 9/11 not getting the treatment they need because they weren't on the government payroll? Does these atrocities make for the greatest country in the world? Moore makes Canada, France and Britain seem like heaven compared to the States. I know that not everything is peachy in the other countries like Moore claims, but they are doing something right, morally and financially. The wrong people are in the powerhouse positions in the government. A man from Canada in this film said one man changed the health care system in Canada, if it only takes one man to change something, why isn't anyone stepping forward in the States? If they are, why aren't the citizens helping to push him into power? I don't know all too much on the policies in the States, or even Canada for that matter, but the taxes Canadians pay go towards health care. Taxes Americans do not pay. If this system would begin in the States, would would happen? Can they afford it after what has happened recently with the Bush Administration? These questions are raised by Moore and by people who've seen the film and who will see the film. These questions should be asked and should be answered.The film itself is depressing and done with the "Moore fashion". I liked both Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11, SiCKO can be added to those films as one that is not only thought provoking, but entertaining. The dark sense of humour Moore adds to the film helps keep it afloat from its bleakness. Mainly his entrance to Guantanamo. SiCKO is Moore's most important film because it speaks out to everyone in America. Bowling was targeted towards a small percentage of people, and Fahrenheit was really just an Anti-Bush film, SiCKO speaks to everyone. As everyone needs health care, everyone should see this film and change the system. The facts Moore presents (true or fudged) is an eye opener. For people to be denied such things is a crime. Greed is what makes America the most hated country in the world, Greed for money. Money is what is keeping these people sick. Unlike Moore's previous films, SiCKO doesn't stay with one subject for too long, Moore goes through dozens of people and their problems within minutes, to illustrate how many people this effects. The film doesn't stay with them long enough to pack high emotional punches, but enough to give a shock to those who had no clue what was going on.They say laughter is the best medicine, for the people of America, I hope his is true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propaganda Masquerading As A Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Aren't the health insurance companies supposed to be there to help us?" So asked Michael Moore in Sicko. The answer, of course, is obvious. In Moore's romanticized world they should be, but the point is that they're health insurance COMPANIES! This is business, and the point of business is to make money.I don't want to be too hard on Michael Moore. I share a lot of his basic world view. I'm a Canadian. I support government health insurance. I think we have a far better system than what exists in the U.S. The problem is that Moore lets his anti-George Bush, anti-conservative, anti-Republican bias get in the way of what are really some pretty strong points. Americans - who live in the only significant state in the Western world that doesn't have publicly funded health care - have shorter life spans and sicker lives than the rest of us. An interesting documentary could be made based on an investigation of those facts. But Moore manipulates and twists and takes things out of context just for the sake of making those he disagrees with look bad. Example: I don't know how many interviews he must have conducted to find people in Canada who talked of such short waits in Canadian emergency rooms. Like I said, I think we have a better system, but it ain't that good. And, yes, we get to pick our own family doctor - the catch is that we have to be able to find one, and lots of areas in Canada are underserviced by family physicians. That was conveniently overlooked. And frankly, I personally wasn't all that impressed with the American woman coming to Canada and trying to sponge off our health care system when she hasn't paid any taxes to support it! And the trip to Cuba? How would Michael Moore know that the folks he took to Cuba for care got the exact same care as any Cuban would get - which is what he claimed. Sorry, but I rather suspect that the Cubans saw an opportunity to score some propaganda points with this. Let's be honest, you can find people who dislike any system and using only them make it look terrible; you can find people who think their system is great and using only them make it look great to everyone else.I don't want to be too hard on Moore. As always, he's entertaining and fun. He gets you laughing right off the top with the clip of George Bush saying that he wants to make sure that OBGYN's will be able to "share their love" with the women of America. (Where does Bush come up with some of these things?) In the interests of balance, he also took a swing at Hilary Clinton. I just wish he would stop pretending that he's making documentaries and admit that he's putting out anti-George Bush propaganda. As propaganda, this is brilliant. As a documentary (which he claims it to be) it really falls far short. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of you posting here are a little confused. Michael Moore is as patriotic an American as there is. Let's not forget that a TRUE patriot is someone who will speak out against injustice -- even when perpetrated by his government. The big lie promulgated by the radical Right is that Socialized Medicine = Socialism/Communism. The unsophisticated and uneducated masses in this country believe it: they think that waving the flag and "supporting the President" mean they love America. But America is not the President. America is not the Administration. Think for yourselves. Michael Moore has debunked the LIES spread by the insurance industry: the Canadian system works and ALL Canadians like it. Same for the Brits and the French. Someone wrote, "...I disagree with his facts..." and that makes NO SENSE -- a fact is a fact and is not open to interpretation: if it's not true, it's not a fact. The FACT is that thousands of our fellow Americans die unnecessarily every year because they cannot afford medical treatment. It's not because they would rather spend their money on recreational drugs. It's not because they're "livin' large" at the taxpayers' expense. It's because there's no money left for insurance after rent, food, clothing, transportation to/from work, student loans and taxes (mostly used to fund the war in Iraq). It's because we live in a country that values corporate profits over human lives. It's because there is no such thing as a corporate conscience. It's because we allow the un-Christian, Undemocratic, IMMORAL practice of "for profit" health insurance. When a doctor working for a health insurance company is awarded bonuses for rejecting the most legitimate claims, there is something very wrong with that company -- and the industry. Wake up America. The insurance industry hopes you're stupid. The Bush Administration thinks you are. Don't be a sap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is an expose on the capitalist nature of the American health system.Quite frankly I was shocked at how unfair this system is. Michael Moore was able to show a well balanced account of this sensitive topic, talking to a wide range of people affected by this crisis, from patients to politicians.The statistics and practices of these corporations and the lengths they go to turn a profit is downright evil. People are literally being given a death sentence, if they can't pay the expenses. I would not go to to the U.S for a holiday after viewing this.Every US citizen should view this documentary to see the real damage corporate medicine can do. Very powerful, heart felt documentary. This should be viewed in American schools. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

I have immense problems with the American government and their blatant scare tactics that keep the rich rich and the poor poor. This shows that America hasn't really advanced out of the middle ages. Its great to see that Obama has brought in government controlled health though I'm not too sure of the actual parameters involved in his scheme as it wasn't really covered in Australias mainstream media.This is something that i think all Americans need to see in order to realise that Public health is not a bad thing. Here in Australia, we have public health, and yes, there are large waiting periods for non-essential surgery but that is only due to the fact that any life saving treatments are performed immediately and for free. We can elect for private health insurance and remove any waiting periods but thats only really for the people who can afford to do so. Also how can the pharmaceutical companies in the US justify the prices they are charging for the essential drugs that the American people need, its absurd.Brilliant movie and i know i just ranted about health and not the movie itself but this is the exact response that this movie provoked within me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent critique of America's wretched health care system.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sicko is Michael Moore's best documentary yet. He speaks to real people who have been victimized, some tragically, at the hands of America's amazingly horrible health care system. Moore shows that the real villains in the health care mess here, are the greedy insurance companies, HMOs, and politicians, who are bought-off by both the insurance, and pharmaceutical behemoths. It's bad enough, that there are millions of Americans that can't afford health insurance of any kind. Moore shows that those who DO have health insurance in this country, are still subject to substandard treatment, IF their insurance companies even cover their health care costs at all. Michael Moore travels to France, the UK, and Cuba. He showcases the wonders of totally free health care, in those countries. Moore discovered (not surprisingly) that citizens in those countries that he visited, are healthier, and live longer than most Americans.I hope that Michael Moore decides to do a documentary, on homelessness in America. Just like the health care debacle, homelessness is another glaring symptom of how inhumane this country has become, towards its most vulnerable citizens. And, like the American health care crisis in this country, the homelessness problem here desperately needs to be solved.We need more people like Micheal Moore, who are willing to expose the many injustices in our country today. I recommend that every American see Sicko, to find out just how unfair our health care system is these days. Those who see this film, many become outraged enough to demand free health care here, which other industrialized countries now take for granted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an American watching this movie it made me very upset. The reason I was upset is Sicko exposes and brings up the God awful truth about our Health Care System and it is not pretty.Sicko is about America's Health Care System and how flawed it is. Michael Moore doesn't hold back as he finds some of the worst cases of Americans being abused by the very system that is supposed to help us. No matter what country you are from, Sicko will shock you and make you cry.Despite the sadness in the film it is still spectacular. The movie reveals many elements of our health care versus other countries and has the facts to back them up. The film has been put together very well and pulls no punches in its intent. Michael Moore has always excelled at exposing things that people should know or need to know and Sicko is no exception.The bottom line is every American whether you are insured or not needs to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK to exaggerate to make an obvious point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a non-American who spent about two years in the U.S., I have come to love many aspects of American life. But I also believe that the American media have a tendency to emphasize the good and ignore the bad. This is why I think this movie was so important. As much as I hate it when the Dutch media misrepresent the way some things are better in the U.S., Americans must be careful not to be blinded by patriotism and the idea that they're living in "the greatest country of the world" and thus everything must be good. For not all is as good as it could be.I like Michael Moore's rhetorical question "why don't we copy things that work well elsewhere". People are the same no matter where they live. Americans deserve universal health care as much as anyone else. Capitalism and free enterprise works well for many things. But not for basic needs like health care.I am so pleased that the Obama administration succeeded in finally passing health care reform and hope that it will work as well (or better) than it does in Canada or the Netherlands. These systems aren't perfect, either. The waiting lists typically were longer than they would have been in the U.S. (an issue that has improved somewhat over the past years in the Netherlands). But at least nobody is denied health care, and people certainly don't stress over health care expenses like they do in the U.S..I am a 44 year old entrepreneur and I pay around $1.500 in annual health insurance from a private health insurance company. This is significantly less than what an American would pay. The reason: Everyone is obliged to have insurance, and the government subsidizes the essential care.Hmmm, I guess the IMDb isn't the place for politics. So let me end by saying that although I found some of Michael Moore's films a bit annoying for exaggerating, I felt that Sicko was relatively balanced. An entertaining and partly shocking watch. Anyone who still has any doubt about the need for health care reform should watch it. Hopefully in 5 or 10 years people will look back at this movie and think "boy, things have improved since".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sicko" is Moore's grandest effort and believe it or not, his least controversial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wouldn't seem easy for any documentary filmmaker to tackle an issue with as broad and universal (pardon the unfortunate pun) a scope as health care, but Michael Moore, the United States' most famous and controversial documentarian, strikes again with more poignancy than ever before. "Sicko" is multi-faceted, strongly organized, emotional and thought- provoking. Best of all, it's Moore's least controversial film to date. He continues with his liberal sense of humor, but "Sicko" poses more questions about what it means to live in America than it does to assign blame.It is clear that Moore also has more help than ever before, with financial backing by the Weinstein Bros and a team of researchers to find the most compelling personal stories from the tens of thousands of if not millions of health care tragedies to be told in America. Armed with these resources, "Sicko" goes into the history of health care and HMOs in the U.S., gives countless examples of people denied insurance or denied coverage of certain operations at the deadliest of costs and then ventures up north to Moore's favorite country and overseas to both the U.K and France, to inquire about the effectiveness of their universal health care. Lastly, its final thirty minutes involve Moore taking a handful of 9/11 emergency workers who were not adequately treated in the U.S on a journey to Guantanamo Bay, where America's worst criminals receive free treatments.As usual, Moore lines this film with moments of shock, where we have to laugh at how painfully obvious his points are. He also brings back his leanings toward satire and exaggeration for humorous effect. And just like always, Moore merely addresses the other side with an example or two, never really digging deep into opposing viewpoints. For example, we've been told time and time again that universal health care in countries like Canada comes at a cost -- lesser quality, longer waits for treatment, etc. and instead of surveying hospitals all over Canada, he merely takes us to one. He would better silence skeptics if we knew with 100 percent honesty that he didn't just pick the hospital with the responses he was looking for.Still, Moore's documentary is not about converting to Canada or Britain's system, but about the principle of universal health care. The mentality from talking to these countries is that everyone should be helped, that when it comes to health -- to life or death in many cases -- that nobody should be deciding whose worthy or not worthy of treatment, especially not billion-dollar HMO corporations. Everyone values his or her health, and it's so distressing to know that our country is stuck in a rut where too many dollars and jobs are at stake to just flip our health care system over and shake it out. This is an issue where everyone's livelihood is affected and Moore offers plenty of insight into the emotional factors, the everyday person.Moore has a tremendous responsibility as a filmmaker. After "Bowling for Columbine" shot to critical and box office fame, he's become the most visible icon of the documentary craft out of thousands of others like him who will never be known in the slightest. Add that to his choice of social topics and his tendency to have a sense of humor about him and he will always be a controversial but crucial American figure. No one dares to upset establishment like Moore and as much as he becomes a social pest to many people for it, democracy requires it of us and Moore simply has accepted the responsibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore, up to his old tricks. He gives us a number of horror stories from American medicine, then takes us on a tour of Canada with its universal health care system, then Britain ditto, then France likewise. All his subjects are happy with the way things work. The taxes are high -- somebody has to pay for it -- but middle class families live in comfortable housing. One French engineer is living in a million-dollar apartment, spacious, elegantly decorated, and with rooms for all occupants. He drives a new Audi. Of course, he chuckles, under the American system he might have a three- or four-million dollar dwelling, and two expensive cars instead of one.And none of Michael Moore's propaganda would be complete without one of his sometimes amusing stunts. In "Bowling for Columbine," residents of Toronto tell him that, not only do they not need guns, they leave their doors open all day long. But do they? Moore leaves the house in which the interview is taking place and walks down the block from house to house, opening unlocked doors. Now that's a stunt, not an experiment, but it's a successful stunt.Here, in "Sicko", he interviews a dozen or so trained people, firefighters and EMTs, who volunteered for emergency work at the WTC on 9/11 and who were not covered by any insurance for the upper respiratory or psychiatric symptoms that developed afterward.Then he learns from the politicians defending the detention center (or whatever it is) at Guantanamo Bay that the prisoners (or whatever they are) receive the best possible treatment, with modern facilities and a health-care provider to detainee ratio of one to four, far better than in the states. So he bundles his interviewees together, rents some boats, and sails to Guantanamo. Just off shore he shouts through a bull horn and asks for medical treatment for his guests, all of whom have been described in the press as heroes. No dice. A siren sounds and they beat it to Cuba.They visit Havana Hospital where the patients are signed in -- name and birth date, nothing more -- admitted and properly treated for several weeks. The patients are so happy to finally receive the treatment they've been unable to afford, that some break down. They are given a treatment plan to follow after their return to the states. Before they leave, they are invited to visit a Havana Fire Department, where they are treated as guests of honor. "We fire fighters are all brothers," says the station captain, embracing the one of them who speaks Spanish.Well, these are all anecdotes -- or case studies, if you prefer. And it's easy to build an argument on a few cases. We do it all the time to bolster our opinions. One outrageous example proves the point we're trying to make. (It's called an available scheme in psychology.) There once was a welfare recipient in the 1960s who was found living in the Waldorf Astoria -- therefore welfare recipients are cheaters and the system is corrupt. Right? Wrong. Anecdotes don't prove anything, though they may illustrate a truth. Moore's anecdotes, the cases he looks into, prove nothing. He could as easily have found poor but happy patients in America, or dissatisfied and bitching doctors in Canada. But Moore has the statistics to back up his case. Take infant mortality. The US ranks 37th in infant mortality, just ahead of Slovenia and behind Cuba. We're the richest country on the planet. How come we can't keep our kids alive? I don't particularly care for Moore's movies. I don't mind that they're propagandistic. That's taken for granted. It's just that he's so far from dispassionate. He works himself so thoroughly into the narrative and has developed a self-conscious image: baseball cap, slight stubble, those odd glasses, and a working man's ensemble.Yet his movies raise challenging questions that few of us seem willing to face head on. Too many of us find ourselves able to dismiss universal health care by the simple expedient of name-calling. It's "Socialism." But Moore's movies asks, "So what?" And I would add that calling names belongs on a third-grade playground, not on the floor of the Congress.There's another consideration. Moore's position has moral authority. He himself has nothing to worry about as far as health care is concerned. He's making his argument for the benefit of other people who are less well off, people who are suffering. His movies are far from selfless, but their arguments are humane and constructive. And he doesn't get swept up in angry rants. Compared to, say, Rush Limbaugh or Anne Coulter, his venom quotient is near zero. He STANDS for something, in a way that propagandists of the right simply do not.I frankly admire the guy, have no answers to the questions he raises about our health-care system, and was moved by some of the scenes he's captured on film, and angered by others. Alas, the people who most need to see a film like this will condemn it without ever getting near it. They'll probably dismiss it as "Socialism."</fullReview>

I deferred watching this movie until now - having been unimpressed by Mr. Moore's other offerings - because, I really had no desire to see a country I had worked in for 5 years be ripped to shreds by some itinerant, maverick movie maker. I was SO wrong. I'm British (by birth), and now Canadian - proudly so - and heading to China in the next month (another Socialist system......but it's working!). But have to say that never has a movie moved me more in the past 5 years.......everything he says is just so true - I've lived in the 'European System' and the 'American System' - I've seen patients dumped on freeways (interstate 8 in San Diego, Mission Valley) because they had no health card or no means to pay the statutory $500 "admission" fee to an emergency room! I've been a part of that - and that shame will always be with me. It's nice to make a good salary......it's nice to have a secure job with great benefits (which Kaiser Permanente, Tenet Health etc. provide). I guess it was the breaking point for me when my boss called me in to review critical costs.......and told me "real costs to us are $3500: if the patient 'self-pays' for this procedure, it's $6500......if they have insurance then the cost to Aetna/Blue Cross etc. is $35,000.......what's wrong with this picture?". That's the corruption you are facing, my friends in the US. It's real. I've been a part of it. What he says about Europe is true too.......but the government is etching away at the benefits even as we speak - no free dental care any more - nope - it's all private - if you can even find a dentist. Same in Canada - but the primary health care here is second to none. View this movie with open eyes and an open mind - because, by the end of it - you'll have both.........oh, and make a Kleenex run before you even start! I believe it, because I've seen it first hand - been there, done that - never again! Hats off to Michael.......he's got my respect from now on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent for the USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This political documentary is a manifesto against private medical care in the US and for universal free health care, what some have called socialized medicine. Michael Moore thus compares the US system based on the full exclusion of 50 millions Americans from health care and the partial exclusion of million more under the title of denial, the denial of one particular treatment to specific Americans by their own private insurance companies, a denial that can go as far as a full rejection of the client by the insurance company and the cancellation of their contracts and all benefits. To make his point he follows the cases of quite a few people in the US who suffered these "ailments" or "ills" of the US health system. Some people dying because of these denials, even infants, some people living in total discomfort, poverty, dependence even, because of the bills that ate up their homes, savings, and all other amenities they may have had before getting sick. Then he compares with the systems in four countries: Canada, Great Britain, France and Cuba. All of them have a globally free universal system where only some marginal costs are charged, at most. The verdict is obvious. To emphasize the Cuban episode he compares with the care the prisoners in Guantanamo get (free top notch medical care) and the care some rescue workers at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks get in the US, and the care they managed to get, for free in Havana from Cuban doctors. The verdict once again does not stand the slightest possibility to appeal. This film though has a shortcoming. He notes the flat rate of a prescription in England (about ten dollars) but does not wonder why it exists. He speaks of a 100% free medical care in France and neglects some side charges. He is probably right with Canada and Great Britain, and definitely with Cuba, when speaking of a state system. But he is under a wrong impression as for France where the health system is not paid by the state but by contributions paid by working people on their salaries and this money is used to reimburse the medical expenses of people up to a certain point and managed by elected councilors representing the workers and employers equally and chosen by their electors on union lists from the trade unions or the employers' unions. The state only intervenes for the people who do not work through subsidies or contributions to the "social security authority" to compensate for the contributions these people do not pay. And what's more about 30% of medical expenses are covered by cooperative, or private, insurances that everyone is supposed, if so is their choice, to get and to whom they pay premiums that are at times higher than the basic contributions. It is a complex system. But Michael Moore does not explore the easy abuse these systems are the victims of from some people who are inconsiderate in overusing medical assistance or care. In England they introduced a flat payment per prescription to encourage economy on drugs. In France a small part of doctors' fees and prescriptions is not covered at all, even by the cooperative or private complementary insurance companies, by decision of the state in an attempt to curb down expenses and particularly abusive expenses. For instance in France brand name drugs that have an equivalent generic, and cheaper, version on the market are only reimbursed on the basis of this generic drug's price. But altogether Michael Moore's discourse is true and right, when we keep in mind that we have to think of the people who always try to get undue or abusive advantage of a generous system, and that we have to consider being economical with drugs and treatment because it is also a syndrome of our advanced stressful societies that many people, and at times those who are least stressed, look for some medical care when none is needed and they use a lot of time of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel for no reason at all except getting some attention. Finally let's keep in mind too that any system, private or public produces a bureaucracy and then a wasteful exploitation of an economic niche in society. This is an important shortcoming of the film: how much money is wasted by private insurance companies in the US to employ people, at times highly paid people, just to deny services to clients, and patients, and how much money is wasted on law suits by clients who are dissatisfied or on damages paid by the insurance companies when they lose these lawsuits? That would vastly account for the denial procedure that has to bring in a profit after paying for the expenses it incurs, money that could be used paying for hospital bills or doctors' fees.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pity it is so propagandistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person that lived many years under a communist regime I am very sensitive to propaganda. M. Moore film, unfortunately, has all features of a propagandistic work. To run a sound health care system is tremendously difficult, because new drugs and equipment are costly and population is getting older in all industrial countries. Of course, a society that allows dumping people on the street as a garbage has really reasons to examine its conscience. Moore touched important and sensitive subject. But it is a pity that he strongly exaggerated his arguments. The worst case on individual level was a story of a lady whose little girl has died because she was insured by Kaiser and another hospital refused to take a care about her. But Kaiser runs its own network of hospitals to be cost-effective and efficient and she quite certainly had it written it in her contract. If she immediately took her daughter to an appropriate hospital she would very probably live. Moore did not mentioned it, and it is a grave omission. The case with Cuba was even worse. How he can compare 5 cents to 120 dollars for a drug not taking into account the income differences? If he would made a list of drugs available in Cuba to what is available in the USA, he would have to tell a different story. Under communist regime we had a free health care, too. But when somebody was seriously ill, we had not only to pay for western drugs, but we had to smuggle them somehow into the country. Who had no acquaintances, died. Pockets of doctors were full of kickbacks because there was a shortage of everything. When an old pensioner gave to his doctor a 10 dollar bill, doctor told him: thank you, I do not need a change for cigarettes. I think M. Moore does not understand much how a health care systems work. True, USA need an universal health care system. But it is not necessary to abolish HMO's. They simply must not have right to refuse anybody and there must be a powerful enforcement body to punish cases when HMO's misbehaves. Of course, details are complicated. When this would happen, system would change even without a National Health Service. But it will be extremely difficult to push it thru. Vested interests are enormously powerful in this field. I can only wish Americans a wise hand at election ballot. Mr. Benn was right: people have power. But they must be able and willing to use it. Vaclav Zak</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's Best Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Michael Moore's film Sicko last night at our local theater in Paris. It's quite a great documentary film, maybe his best since Roger and Me. This is a great film because it goes right to the heart of the core problem and vividly shows its human effects. The core problem is the degradation and denial of health treatment for the sake of saving money. The core effect is that people's lives are diminished and destroyed, or simply ended prematurely.Moore's trademark stunts here are particularly good because they take "reality" as seen on TV and turn it upside down. So we see his Canadian cousins buying insurance to travel to the United States. This nicely inverts the principle of American superiority that has Americans buying insurance to go to Mexico. We see free universal health care on "American soil" - but not for regular citizens, but for the detainees who are getting it partly so they can be force- fed on their hunger strikes. We see a cashier in a British hospital, but he gives out money to people for transportation home rather than raking money in.The master stroke involves 9/11 rescue workers who can't get health care for conditions induced by their emergency work in the wake of the destruction of the Twin Towers. Moore rounds a bunch of them up, and they get on boats in Miami harbor and set off on what looks like Gilligan's three hour cruise. They go to Guantanamo and then to Havana. This nicely inverts the principle of American superiority illustrated by the Cuban boat people yearning to be free in the US. The 9/11 rescue workers are reverse boat people heading for the Cuban doctors and medicines no one will give them in the US.Moore's "analysis" is in every frame: if you don't keep market logic out of human essentials, you damage and destroy people. Period. That's the analysis. And it is correct.The other countries - Great Britain, France, Cuba, and of course Canada - are there to show how much better people do when the criterion of care is patient need rather than business revenue. The health outcomes of that philosophy are so much better that that it reminds you of how detached from external reality American business "pragmatism" has become.Moore asks the great humanist question in the US today: "who are we?" What kind of people are we that we leave people on the sidewalks like trash? Are we monsters? Brainwashed "profits before people" neoliberals walking in lockstep to the obsolete dogmas of the Rupert Murdochs? A people in steady decline and simply afraid - afraid of our own government, as one of the Americans in Paris suggests?For me the answer appeared in two sequences in France. The first came from a moment when Moore asks a comfortable French couple, so what are your biggest expenses after your mortgage and car payment, and the wife says, "the fish." They then spend some time together, this small French woman and the giant Michigander, peering into her well-stocked fridge. Moore is still wondering what they do with the money they don't spend on $200 office visits and $295 bottles of pills (my own tab for an advance supply of my cholesterol medicine since I was leaving the country and Blue Cross will pay only one month at a time). She says vacations, those are very important. We travel. And she shows Moore tiny bottles of sand she's collected on several continents.The other sequence involves a French guy in his mid-30s who had moved to the US at 18 but who came back to France when he got cancer. It was all free, he said, and explains how the state-employer partnership assured him 100% of his salary for 3 months of rest and recuperation during his treatments, which he takes in the sun in the south of France. This guy shows Moore pictures of his tanned and smiling self hanging out with friends while the taxpayer foots the bill. Moore expresses surprise, and the guy, with no trace of American defensiveness, says something like, "in three months I went from being a 95 year old man back to this. I had to take care of myself. Now I'm recovered and can carry on, with my life and with my work."My theory is that French people can expect and demand that everyone pay for everyone's healing as a society because they believe that life is about satisfaction, happiness, pleasure, and well-being. Their food culture is one expression of that, and so is government-funded child care. Another expression is affordable, high-quality health care for all. Life is short, you need to enjoy it, you need to be healthy, so what ELSE, exactly, is it worth spending our money on?It's this jouissance that the US has lost - the sense of the RIGHT to happiness. We don't expect it for ourselves, so we don't care that the richest companies in the world can take it away from others.Just a theory, but I do know that the French have much hipper and more beautiful eyeglasses than we do. And their sense of beauty fits together with how much better they treat each other than we do.</fullReview>

I couldn't, and had to work for a year and a half (standing, eight to ten hours a day) on a broken foot (until the swelling refused to go down and my foot ballooned to twice its normal size); nor could my mother (who died of undiagnosed lung cancer because she couldn't afford to go to a doctor) (and I did my best to take care of her during her last year or so, at home, but I'm no medico). Just a couple of years ago, my wife was literally shown the door at a cancer clinic when it turned out that she had no health care insurance. I tried to comfort her, but her breakdown was inevitable. My own subsequent heart attack was just icing on the cake. (In this country, one must wait a full year to "qualify" as "disabled." Anyone who's ever eaten handouts two years past their expiration date for a full year can tell you what it's like. It ain't fun.) The Profits of this New Age- the politicians and televangelists- may choose to ignore SICKO, but those of us who've been ground up and spit out by this defective "system" like Charlie Chaplin caught in the gears of the Machine in MODERN TIMES, we cherish it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that after screening this movie, I feel different inside... It's a strange thing when a movie can affect your life in ways you never saw possible. This is not a good thing in this case. The part of the movie that got to me the most was when they let the one older lady out of the cab, shoeless, in front of a shelter. It was her time to leave the hospital and she had no where to go. They just basically threw her out on the streets on skid row, since there are lots of shelters. They asked a doctor why this is done, and his response was that they could "Just open the door and let them all out" meaning they could force them out into the parking lot, I am guessing...I used to work social services when I was 17-19 in Fort Lauderdale, FL, and that is a decent sized city, with a high population. I cannot tell you how deeply I was hurt to see how our rich and powerful cast aside anyone who needs assistance, it's truly sad... People act like they are helping people for the good of helping people, but it's not like that, seen it all first hand. I am now only 23, but after working in the corporate world for 5 years now, I am a banker, you can't help but notice how much people really do not care. It just breaks my heart...It's sad for me to say this at only 23 years of age, but it's almost like we have nothing to look forward to. More wars, more puppet-like presidents, more laws passed to restrain us, more scares of terrorism to contain us... It's just too much... They said in England that it was one man who changed their thinking... It makes you wonder, who was it who got us into this, who is going to help us get out of it... Maybe Michael Moore will help this country in more ways than one... Let's just stay open-minded...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Check</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies and documentaries that after someone watches them and you see their reaction you can get a good view of their humanity, or the tragic lack of it. "Sicko" is a documentary you should include on that list. I felt and experienced a lot of things when watching Sicko: anger, sadness, incredulous disbelief, sometimes even hopelessness. When you've lived enough substantive years to have seen a significant amount of social change and have been courageous enough to not only critically analyze society but yourself, your own weaknesses and failings, you are always a little shocked at the lack of enlightenment and humanity in others, even in your most cynical moments.The U.S. health care system is driven by unconscionable greed, has been for quite some time, from the pharmaceutical industries, to the corporate hospitals, to the medical supply companies, to way too many greedy doctors who have forgotten or never really believed in the Hippocratic Oath, and too many others ad nausea. Quite frankly the world has been driven by greed throughout history and still is today but just because most are doing something does not make it right. If everyone believed that there truly would be no hope for homo sapiens, we'd only remain slightly advanced apes using narcissism and mythical beliefs to justify the most egregiously brutal behaviors. (All committed with your god's blessing naturally.) But there are those who want more than just a smash and grab world, who really want a kind and decent society not just a lot of excuses why we can't do it right now. There must be those who are courageous enough to rise above the cruel and ugly status quo. This courage is what allows people like Mahatma Gandhi, Oscar Schindler and other really beautiful persons to exist in the sea of hideous what's-in-it-for-me beasts. Without the Gandhis and Schindlers in this world (and those who have the courage and humanity to replace the unjust and cruel with the kind and considerate) we would not be making progress towards a better world. Albeit moving painfully slow at times, even with some tragic steps backwards, we still must press on for a kinder, better world. Live it, not just say the words while we rob our neighbors and bomb our supposed enemies, being ever so careful not to catch a glimpse of that hideous reflection we might see looking back at us in the mirror.I can sort of understand the greedy rich that are driven by more greed for more money they don't really need or will ever use. Most of them sold their humanity for cheap so long ago they really have nothing else but cold, heartless cash to measure their worth. I certainly don't envy them and would much rather live in a cardboard box than the biggest mansion in the world if that meant being as dead inside as I think many of them are. But what I am always puzzled by is those of much more limited means who eat the meals of greed and fear fed to them by the avarice powers that be. So be it, it is hard to rid ourselves of our fears and admit we're all human and share the same weakness. The difference is just whether we chose to cave in to our weaknesses and fears as we see most around us do or to be courageous enough to buck the ugly norm and show more kindness to others than they show us.It would be fantastic and a great moment of celebration to see America turn away from scapegoating, victim blaming and general mean spiritedness to a place that is more like what the politicians and others claim it to be, a leader of civilization. I am saddened to see my country fall to such low levels and be stuck in the old feudal system in so many ways including health care. If you said that the poor and struggling working class don't deserve police protection or a response from the fire department when their house in on fire or they're being beaten by some savage everyone other than the sadistic and sociopaths would laugh at you. But that's the way it used to be not so long ago for those social services we take for granted when we were living in feudal times. Shouldn't the most advanced health care be available for all in a truly civil society, not just a luxury for the wealthy? For a nation of so called Christians, it'd be nice to see Americans living like Christ rather than using his effigy to beat others over the head. Wasn't it Christ who said how you treat the lowest among you is how you treat him? Sicko is not only a great documentary, by far Michael Moore's best, it's also an excellent health tool. You can use it to see if you have a healthy heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sicko is an editorialized documentary-style film about the shortcomings of the American health care system and how it compares and contrasts to countries with universal health care.I say "editorialized" because this is not a just-the-facts news report, but rather in true Micheal Moore style it uses real life facts to support the film makers opinion.It was a great shock to me to see the people who are portrayed as American Heroes on a daily basis in U.S. media being neglected in our own country despite the millions of dollars in aid that have been donated just to assist them. It was even more of a shock to see Cuba, a country that has been vilified by U.S. propaganda over the last half century, not only able, but willing to provide care free of charge to these people that ended up saving their lives.Even if you don't care for documentaries this film is still very entertaining. Micheal Moores wit and sarcasm elevate this from a typical documentary film to popular cinematic entertainment.I highly recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge Mike Moore Fan, HUGE! Sent him emails of support and praise. Got on his mailing list and always responded with a thank you note for informing me of the maladies that lurk in the USA.Then came Sicko.Mike you've let us, The British People, down. Way down. You've sold us out for your own cause, to highlight the negatives of your own land, and it's a sad, sorry end to the last 12 years of my relationship with you - you as film maker, me as audience - because now I've gotta question everything else you've said, and I so willingly believed.I had waited for Sicko with baited breath, preminiscing an edifying and satirical boot up the over paid behinds of those who've miss-managed the USA health systems, or the even more maniacal stock jockying over in the corrupt world of insurance which cost many innocent lives for the sake of a few dollars' profit. I'd foreseen Mike flippin' the bird to those who've hidden behind the general public's ignorance, murdering and destroying lives for money. And so it was, the film starts great, we see the sick twisted mind of the arch US Capitalists, scheming new ways to cheat the proletariat from what he's owed. We see the evil of corrupt politics, going back as far as Nixon. We see it all in a matter of fact way because it must be true - Mike's telling us! We know Mike, we've loved him for years. He's been the fly in Bush's evil potions since he cheated and schemed his way into his job as the world's most powerful man (and if you believe he's the most powerful man, then I have some swamp land I'd like to sell ya to build on - it's guys like Mike, who can oust the likes of Bush with their films, and education of the masses.)But then, alas and alack, Mike moves to England for a spot of like by like comparison, where everything's free and cozy and charming and easy, and people actually get paid - that's right folks, you heard me right - get paid, their expenses for visiting the hospitals. I was almost a Sicko myself by this stage! Since when are drugs free for working people? I paid ?6.85 for ten tiny pills that cost less than a penny to make by some poor Cooley working in abhorrent conditions in India for less than third what he'd get if he came and did the same job in the UK. Since when do working people get expenses paid? Even to those on minimum wage?Why Mike, WHY??? Why did you show us a maternity ward in a lovely area of Middle England/Home counties, but not show the real conditions real people have to put up??? Were your researches negating the challenges of filming in hostile conditions?Why did you leave out telephone number sized wages for the top brass who've so badly miss-managed this shinning example of the egalitarian ideal into a sprawling mass of superbugs, while the frontline staff are on barely more than your average Macdonalds worker after 3 years at college?Did you forget MRSA Mike? I can't, my neighbour died from it. He was relatively healthy when he went into hospital, but he came out in a pine box.Did you forget past pay offs to the top brass, after they've messed up so badly you would trust them to scrape sprouts off the xmas dinner plates, just?Did you forget the postcode lottery? Women dying because they live only a few miles away from where if they'd been smart enough (it is, of course, their fault) to move to before getting breast cancer, they would've been saved?What was up with Tony Benn (a truly wonderful man, please don't get me wrong here), why didn't you tell him, Tony? Or maybe you did and a bit of creative editing took out the stuff that makes the British NHS more saleable.Did you forget about the ?8 billion set aside for negligence pay outs?Did you forget about waiting lists for vital operations? Did you forget we also have a private sector? And, just like in The Home of The Brave and The Land of The Free, you don't wait for an operation if you've got ?/$.Or did you just forget to look into them? Did you come and spend time in the UK Health System? Trust me Mike, it sucks. But it didn't do 20 years ago. 20 years ago it was everything you said it was now.Did you forget these things, Mike, hah? Hah?Or did you just need to highlight to Americans how greener the grass is on the other side of the pond? Because my American chums, it simply ain't so rosey here, not if you're working class, poor and from here originally. In fact the truth is, it's a shambles. We had one of the finest health services on earth, then disastrous governments after disastrous governments killed the wonderful white dove that was once so envied.Mike, I'm crestfallen. I believed all you had to tell me, but now I have to question the veracity of every single sentence. The last 12 years together seemed so wonderful, so inspiring, so funny and yes, made me feel affection for you, only now do I see it's all been a sham. The emails and messages I sent you (or someone pretending to be you) on myspace, and the other notes of praise, can you please return them. You've lost a fan Mike, shame on you.You'll have lost many more by the time the British public gets round to seeing Sicko.I'm off to do some campaigning for Bush - he never tried to sell me lies about the NHS.</fullReview>

Whether or not it's the obvious cost cutting initiative's that benefit Insurance companies, or the fact that America's health care system is ranked 37 out of 191 by the World Health Organization. This documentary is a superb eye opener when it comes to seeing just how a few other countries and their policies seem unreal by comparison.This is possibly my favourite of Moore's work so far. There cannot help but be a presence of sarcasm as he continues to go to the lengths he does in order to make some progress, especially with the rescue workers of 9/11. It wouldn't be a Michael Moore film without a little politics here and there, whether you agree with the man or not there's always a level of truth to it all.Final Verdict: Definitely something you should watch, just for the absurdities of it all. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say this movie is what has made me advocate for a universal healthcare system in this country because Moore brings undeniable facts and statistics and personal testimony of how our current privatized system is a failure.He starts out with a story of a man who cut two of his fingers off accidentally and was forced to pay $12,000 to have one finger reattached because he didn't have health insurance. But Moore states the film isn't about him or the other 50 million plus Americans who don't have health insurance, but to all the others who do.Moore brings up several different stories of people who came down with illnesses or serious injuries and were rejected by their healthcare companies for multiple different reasons, such as having a pre-existing condition or the companies simply not wanting to shovel out the money to cover the medical expenses, and as a result were refused treatment or became bankrupt.He travels to countries that have universal healthcare and those countries do not reject anyone for any reason, and their medical professionals make more money than American doctors.He really does a good job of showing how our healthcare system is designed to make profit and not actually help people. Nearly seventy percent of bankruptcies in this country are a result of medical expenses. These things are frightening, and this documentary does a very good job of exposing the greed of the insurance companies. Say what you want about Michael Moore but all middle and lower class people owe it to themselves to see this film.</fullReview>

That's six times as many American's then those who were killed in the 9/11 terrorists attacks!Film maker Michael Moore shows and explores the many ways health insurance companies treat their tens of thousands of customers in denying them and their families the care that they've been paying for over the years. That's by them finding whatever loopholes,like pre-existent conditions, in their policies in order not to pay for their medical expenses. Moore doesn't show us the health care debate with any cinematic tricks actors or propaganda but with the very people on both sides of the fence, patience's and doctors, who suffer through it!We get to see people who have to work passed their retirement age, work in fact until they die, to receive heath care, that's not covered by Medicare, that in almost if not all the European industrialized countries like Great Britain France &amp; Germany as well as Canada is absolutely free for their people! Even for non-citizens, mostly Americans, who go there to get help! As bad as things are for the insured the non-insured in America are treated like you would treat the morning garbage! In them being thrown out, many needing extensive medical help, in the street and left on their own because they can't pay their hospital bills!Moore really hits home when he shows the contrast between the almost non-existence health care for Americans to that of the health care provide to their people by countries like Great Briitan France and even Communist Cuba! The myth about how free and socialized health care is a disaster in those country's is exploded on the screen in seeing how much better off the people, as well as the doctors who treat them, in those country's are compared to here in the USA!The most touching as well as outrageous thing in the movie "Sicko" is how we, the US Government, treats the people who volunteered to risk their lives to save lives at the 9/11 disaster site in New York City after the planes hit it! Left out in the cold without any medical care, because they weren't covered by it, Moore rented a boat to go to Guantanamo Bay with a number of those heroes of 9/11 so that they could get the same treatment, state of the art health care, that the suspected El-Qeada terrorists who pulled off 9/11, who are imprisoned there, are receiving free of charge! Being refused entrance into the US Military controlled army base Moore was force to travel to Havana Cuba to get those with him the help that their "greatful" nation that they voluntarily risked their lives and health for refused to give them!And would you believe it the Communist Castro Cuban Government whom the US has been in a virtual state of war with for the last 50 years treated them all back to health as well as provide the stricken, almost to the point of death, Americans with years supplies of drugs that their own nation completely denied them! Sick or Sicko isn't it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Especially relevant documentary on the American healthcare system.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this twice now and it still shocks me. I just cannot believe that the American people think healthcare should not be universal! The way the conservatives have been acting makes me wonder do they not have relatives or friends who are sick and struggling with any of the issues presented in SiCKO? How can so many people be against universal health care? There is an argument that healthcare is a privilege, not a right, which is by far the most horrid argument ever. The right to healthcare is a basic human right. Why is it that it is assumed everyone should have a right to an education regardless of their wealth, but not a right to healthcare unless they are rich? I loved the part where Michael Moore was interviewing the ex-British politician, that man had some wise words to say as to why it is governments try to suppress people with fear, why they try to keep most of the population poor and 'trapped' in the never ending rat race of 'life'. Well done Michael Moore for presenting another viewpoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking information to help educate some Americans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen Moore's "Supersize Me" on TV a few months ago, but this is far more impressive and emotionally involving. I've obviously been living next door to a country that is living a lie. Of course, Canada's medical system is far from perfect, so is the English one. I have witnessed long delays and a major misdiagnosis during my deceased husband's medical treatment, but had we lived in US, he likely would have died sooner because he and I were self-employed and would not have been able to buy health insurance. As for the woman with yeast infection; that totally blew my mind. Everyone owns that little pathogen in varying amounts. Regarding poor education: No wonder Jay Leno has been able to find so many ignorant "Jay Walkers." Isn't that how the Catholic priests feathered their own nests in Ireland and other countries before the advent of the printing press? By keeping the general population poorly educated and ignorant? I was shocked to hear the Ehrlichman/Nixon conversation in the Oval Office, also to learn about these huge pay-offs. We need more Michael Moore types, America needs better education.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Devastating Indictment of the American Heath Care Industrial Complex is Itself Devastated by a Typical MM Stunt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't believe Michael Moore is a Communist. I don't even believe he is a seriously committed ideological leftist. What he is, fundamentally, is an immature and overly zealous aspiring provocateur. He is, though, one that is capable of fits of comic brilliance that sometimes elevate his otherwise smarmy and unsubtle undergraduate level audio-visual activism. "Sicko," like most everything else he has done, is both brilliant and ultimately self destructive.This movie will make you laugh out loud in the face of greed induced misery, and at its creator's collegiate stunts, but it will not advance the cause of meaningful health care reform in the United States. It will not do so because Moore, like he always does, goes too far with his stunts and gives his enemies all they need to effectively disregard anything meaningful he says as they discredit him. Consider this. If you really want to convince the millions of public educated, hard working, patriotic, service-jobbed Americans who are the most abused by Big Health Care, you can't use "Che" Guevara's daughter to help make your case for reform. All you will do with this is give a good "Christian" red state pickup truck demagogue like "Not Ready Freddy" Thompson the opportunity to chomp on a Montecristo with all the B-movie bluster he can muster, and wipe you out with a nicely drawled red herring like, "Michael Moore thinks you and I ought to go to Cuba to get our health care." No, Michael Moore probably doesn't think that, but he should have stayed away from Havana.The movie works only when Michael stays Stateside, wallowing in the ennui of middle American HMO Hell, and the corrupt politics that sustain it. When he visits friendly "socialist" paradises like Canada, Britain, and spends time with the interminable French, he starts to cook the books too much for his own good, then he finally runs his ragtag flotilla of uninsurable American rejects completely aground in what looks like Castro's own private hospital.Michael Moore recognizes the problem, but like most everyone else, he can't follow through with any viable solution in a way that makes logical sense. He falls into the most basic polemical trap used in debating this issue, that: of comparing alternative systems by using objective statistics that don't conform with his own stacked deck of anecdotal evidence. He is not unique. The reactionaries who defend the current U.S. system do the same thing.Everyone has heard it a thousand times. Canadians have to wait months for CAT scans and by-pass surgery, etc. Maybe sometimes they really do, but apparently they only have to wait 45 minutes to see a primary care doctor in a clinic. Band-Aids are cheap. Is the homey private room in the British maternity ward typical of what awaits the average NHS hospital patient? I'm skeptical.There is no question that the life expectancy in Sweden, Canada, Britain, etc. is higher, and the infant mortality rates are lower, than the same figures for the USA. "Socialized" medicine probably has a great deal to do with this. Here is why.If you are a bank president or a lawyer or member of Congress in the USA, you will get much better medical care than the average person would get in Canada, Sweden, Australia, etc., but you will not if you are one of the millions of Americans with no health insurance, or the even greater millions of working class types who are marginally insured through cut rate HMOs.Even the most buck-toothed Brit in the NHS would fare better than these Americans who are on the margins. That is the key to understanding the statistics. Moderately mediocre care for everyone that stresses preventing illness is better, at least for the statistics, than no care, or really bad reactive care for a sizable chunk of a country's population.There is no solution to America's Health Care woes without a solution to the whole dysfunctional and mercenary American consumer culture of which dysfunctional health-care is only a logical part. This is the bizarro world where fat people super size it at McDonald's, then go home and take their handful of cholesterol, blood pressure and ED pills, the same ones they saw advertised on TV just after the McDonald's commercial. The American system is really all about making you sick, keeping you sick, and making money off of both ends. It ought to be, of course, about making you well, and keeping you well."Socialized" medicine, of some sort, will eventually come to the USA. Thirty years, at least, and counting, of the creeping "fascist" medicine of HMOs have psychologically conditioned the population to accept it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America is still the best country in the World ...even with a major flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love him or hate him, Micheal Moore has done the one thing almost everyone can agree on: making documentaries worth watching. Admit it, before Moore, many of us were passing documentaries off as the 'lowest of the low' in film. Moore has made documentaries as important as Biography pics, not just for himself but for all who follow - and many SHOULD follow. Especially after seeing this one, Sicko.As I watched this, the one thing that kept running through my head as an American was how awful its health care system is, but even though it is awful, folks from other countries keep coming to America; and Americans are not leaving the country in droves to avail themselves of better health care other countries have to offer. In Sicko, Moore answers this while exposing America's flaw: As long as you have money, America is the place to be. America is a Marketing Capitalistic Machine. Feed the machine or...die.Now before the 'right' argues with me and the 'left' shuns me for that statement above, Sicko makes this point and I agree. Health care Insurance Americas pay for is still of no guarantee for top health care. You will be indigent. Moore points out, you may get a bed; and even then that bed and care MAY be designated to one type of hospital. If an emergency arises, you or your loved one better live next door to that facility -- or you may be crap outta luck. How can that happen? You pay for the Health Insurance. You're just not getting universal health care. You may have just gotten "pick and chose a life" health care.Then there is the bureaucratic mess of who decides what sickness is treatable - and what isn't. While they are alive and deciding to treat you, you or your loved one, may die. So here is where I side with all those who do not want government interference in health care. Imagine stacking more deciders on YOUR or your loved ones lives. Sicko shows you how the outcome may be.On the other hand, you pay for health insurance, you decided what you want, and you STILL have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of bills. Gee, how did that happen? I mean, you ate right, exercised, watched your weight and still got Cancer and bankrupt. This is scary. Whatever happened to the Hippocratic Oath of "...first do no harm"? I guess that works on what Insurance plan you have if you have any at all. And if you get sick ...and your insurance payments lisps, you get a lovely taxi ride down to Skid Row in Los Angeles while you're still hooked up to shunts. You don't know where you are, the hospital doesn't care because the money stopped coming in and you're still sick.This documentary shows how one in America can go from the top of the heap into living on the street in a flash. This is where marketing has eaten Americans brains, some believe the hype instead of the reality. Who wants to live with their grown kids because the medical insurance YOU paid for left you with hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills? Isn't that why you bought insurance? Here is where I side with those who want to revamp health care so paying Americans don't get shafted for medical care.Wait...I agree with those that do not want government interference, and I agree with those that do not want to pay high premiums and deductibles for health care. So what's the answer? Is this really a political issue or a human issue? Sick gives no answers really but lets all who watch know that SOMETHING has to be done.What that something may be for Americans is compassion for their fellow man. While money and success is wonderful, you may get sick tomorrow and be out on the streets. Sicko wants us to realize we all need to help each other, and its not about politics. Moore goes through great pains to show that both the democrats and the republicans will sell your health up the river for their own financial satisfaction.So it's up to America. Everyone in the world are all going to die of something. Preventive health care, wellness care, long term care, employment furloughs, senior care, help. Quick fixes, Marketing lies, the biggest loser exercise gurus pushing tapes and TV shows, TV hostesses on the liquid diet/lap band/stomach stapling one minute and gain back four fold the next, ex-models crying the blues because one goes from a size 00 to 4 and the media calls them fat, and blaming cooking shows don't. Have some common sense about health is all Sicko is pointing out. Let's face it, all those government officials against universal health have 100% paid health care... and 100% paid funeral costs. Why not let Americans have that option to pay into something like that too. Not a hand out, just a better plan.Maybe it was Moore's anonymous financial gift to the man who ran a website that spewed hatred over Moore. Even though he hated Moore's guts, he was in trouble because of a heath concern. Moore sent him the funds. The man continued to hate Moore. That was fine, it's his right of freedom. That's the lesson of Sicko. Hate is temporary. Death is permanent. Live well, live free in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko - A Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's "Sicko" may not be the most objective or accurate documentary on earth (Cuba, for example, has a worse healthcare system than the United States, according to the World Health Organization), but most of what it says is true. If Moore makes extravagant use of hyperbole, this is because Americans are unlikely to listen to his message -- that the American healthcare system has to change -- unless it is loud and clear.As with "Roger and Me" and "Bowling for Colombine," Moore skillfully blends scenes that are really sad with those that are cheerful and funny; and that, more than anything else, is what makes Sicko an entertaining documentary. Now I won't spoil the plot, except to say that Sicko is an informative survey of healthcare systems in the US, Canada, Britain, France and Cuba, where the stars are ordinary people who talk about their experiences with healthcare.The argument that is so often made against this film is that American healthcare is excessively vilified. In truth, the critics say, the faults of the healthcare systems in western Europe and Canada are as great, if not greater, than the faults found in the US healthcare system. But if one examines the World Health Organization's comparison of healthcare systems around the world, it becomes apparent that this contention is invalid. France's government-run healthcare system, for example, is the best in the world. Italy, San Marino, Andorra, Malta, Spain, Austria, Norway, Portugal, Monaco, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Switzerland have largely government-run healthcare systems that ran among the top 20 in the world. Canada's public healthcare system has unfortunately fallen to 30th in the world, because of budget cuts in the 1990s. But the United States has a healthcare system that ranks 37th in the world, even though it is far more expensive than the healthcare systems mentioned above. In short, there are flaws to government-run healthcare in Europe, but they pale in comparison to the flaws found in the American private healthcare system. For that reason, the message of Michael Moore's "Sicko" is largely true and certainly far more truthful than anything coming from the health insurance industry or the far right.</fullReview>

Were these paid actors? Is all this true? Are they actually talking about a country that I was born and spent my whole life a part of? Unfortunately, I found that no the individuals are not actors. Yes, it is all true and yes this is America they are speaking of.After seeing this I wondered how I could have been so naive for so long.

		<shortDescription>" If there is intelligent Medical coverage on the planet, America is on the farthest point from it "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is a more sympathetic and economical system to Medical care in America, you can bet there is a vicious Three Headed Insurance dog name Cerberus guarding it's doorway. In this film, academy award winner Michael Moore examines why our country is listed as 23rd on the list of world countries. It is plainly obvious why no Insurance company paying it's dues to Washington lobbyists, should take heed of this incredibly insightful documentary. It is plainly obvious from the enormous sums paid under the table to our (supposed) Representatives why Health care in America reform is so difficult to obtain. No one working for the Industrial arm of Insurance companies would ever desire to change so lucrative (for themselves) a system. Moore is one of those exception individuals who should have been given the America Medal of Freedom, for his original work called "Fahrenheit 911." Now with his exposure of the Insurance and Pharmacical industry this film should be a wake-up call for Americans to change their way of life, before the Insurance giants suck every dollar out of the citizens. When and if, America does decide to establish Health Care for all it's citizens, you can rest assured the same proponents against it will suddenly be saying they were for it all along. Moorse travels to France and Canada and examines how their entire countries have established a revolution in Medical health care and compares it with America where only the rich and powerful can assert it. After viewing this film, no one seeing it can ever site similar examples of the same type of medicine in America. Despite the detractors who insist our country is second to none, they have very few examples to offers. All one has to do is to take any list of the highest paid Doctors in this country and ask them to treat the largest segment of the poor in their cities for a 10th of their salary and you will understand why Moore's perspective is so illuminating. An excellent contribution to our awareness and should have earn him a second Medal of Freedom. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wish I could go to Cuba right now...if only for a moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This doc literally made me cry. Although I caught it towards the middle of the program, I found it heartfelt and also made me disappointed in our health care system. I could not believe the story of the lady who was paid 5cents for an item should would have spent more than a hundred dollars for in the U.S. I can relate as I have been without a medication that although is not a necessity, would make my way of life a lot better. All because it cost $130 for a one month supply. I called my boyfriend this morning who work as a medic in the U.S army to let him know that I would like to go to Cuba one day just to see if there is something we can do for a country who gives so freely to others in need.One thing about living in a country such as Cuba that was NOT hit on in the documentary was that although they might recv free health care in places like Cuba, there are still not many more places on this earth that gives you as many opportunities as the U.S. I lived in Brazil were meds. cost almost nothing (not quite as cheap as the ones in Cuba). The downside of this was, the country was filled poverty and corruption. I wish this doc focused, if only for a moment at the negative points on countries such as this one...not just on the fact that the health care system was supreme.The most important thing about this touching movie was that there were 100% right about our American Health Care system. It is very much flawed and it hurts me to see how so many have suffered that really have no need to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film, Michael had pointed out some current flaws of the HMO system. He made comparisons with the other countries. Not so much as to offer viewers alternative solution, but to highlight that maybe, just maybe, we can tweak the current U.S. system to make it better.It may not be the best documentary. And yes, it is attacking the system and the country's politicians - as they are the policy makers.The general American population don't exactly pay the lowest personal tax in the whole: go Google and search "Tax_rates_around_the_world".However, the American Government spend the most money on 'defenses' relating expenditure: go Google and search "world-military-spending".Spending lots of money on military related can only benefit defense companies (its executives). And where does the money comes from? Is it a way to create jobs for the nation? What happens to all the weapons that comes out from this industry? Do we use it to benefit humanity? Could the tax dollars be channeled to health-care related?I need some Americans to comment on my comments... is it true that typical American depends only on 2 forms of insurances (personal and employer) to fund their health-care needs?In Singapore, we've the Central Provident Fund (CPF "mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/CPF/About-Us/Intro/Intro.htm") system. It's not the best system but one of its purpose is to solve escalating health-care related cost. A mandate percentage of your income contributes (by yourself and employer) to 3 accounts named: ordinary, medical, special.Ordinary: for housing, education, retirement needs. Medisave: for hospitalization (due to diseases or accidents, etc) needs. Special: Retirement only.We also have a compulsory national hospitalization insurance plan called MediShield (now administer by 2 selected 'private' insurance companies).So when one gets a hospital bill, this is the general sequence to get funds to pay for it: 1. Employer group insurance plan; 2. Personal insurance plan; 3. MediShield (premium paid using Medisave or cash); 4. MediSave (from CPF account); 5. Your personal savings.Every country has its special situation which make it very hard to adopt another country's system 100%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thomas Paine Lives!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore, America's living embodiment of Thomas Paine, gives us a measured, and uncommonly evenhanded look at America's health-care industry as compared to those in Canada, England, and France. Although pocked by spurts of pomposity, Sicko uses the "cruel to be kind" method of educating its viewers about the issue of universal health care in the United States. "Look at the other civilized countries," Moore says; "their systems work. When other countries make better cars, we drive them. When other countries make better wine, we drink it. So how come, when other countries have better health-care systems, we don't adopt those systems?"Moore's plea to the American consumer is an emotional roller coaster, and that's understating things. Excluding people who have no health insurance at all, he describes the difficulties of several individuals across the country, all covered by health insurance, in receiving adequate medical attention. Heart-rending stories are told about people denied tests and procedures that would have ultimately saved their lives, as the HMOs deemed the efforts as "experimental" or the patients' status as "not life threatening." Moore includes sworn testimony (before Congress) and interviews of former or current medical reviewers, i.e., people who decide whether a claim will be rejected or accepted. It's pretty damning stuff.But of course, it's the health-care system of other countries that are sometimes held up as the ideal to which America should aspire. But that's socialist propaganda, you say. Government-supported health care? Bah. Socialized medicine is just another way for the commies to get to us and destroy our way of life. But it turns out that's not quite the case; Canadians, for instance, pay nothing for health care and still enjoy comparatively low taxes while living longer than Americans. Oh, and they have a lower infant-mortality rate too; but then again, so does nearly every other civilized nation. Things are bad enough in the US that Moore's Canadian relatives get temporary health care before visiting him in the US, just in case something goes wrong. And some American citizens steal across the border to get themselves some of that free medical attention when they can't get it here.Moore also examines, in a touching, gut-wrenching look, the plight of many September 11 first responders. As most people know, the air around Ground Zero in New York was dangerously bad for quite some time after the attacks. Many firefighters, EMTs, and policemen risked their lives to pull others from the wreckage. But there were also many volunteers who happened to be in the area who ran back to the flames and into the smoke to help others. These people, says the government, aren't eligible for much care related to their injuries. After having been constantly lauded as heroes for months after the attacks, many of the first responders were ignored, left to fend for themselves as their health slipped further and further. One man - a man who risked death to help strangers - has two bad lungs and must cart around a breathing apparatus to survive; he can't even sleep on his back or stomach, because he just can't breathe.The only true instance of bombast on the part of Moore is when he takes a few of these 9/11 workers to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to receive the same level of medical treatment as the "enemy combatants" in the prison. He's denied, of course, so he traverses Havana for help and easily finds it. An inhaler that costs one of the 9/11 workers over a hundred dollar - when several are needed monthly - costs under one dollar in Cuba. Same inhaler, same medicine for a fraction of the cost.I realize that even though this is a documentary, Moore does have an agenda to push, as he does with all of his films. But what is his motivation? Is it merely to poke fun at big, bloated insurance companies and the government? Or is it to raise awareness of a national crisis? Moore's point isn't that health care should definitively be offered to everyone for free, it's just that there are a huge number of people in America who are actually covered but can't get proper medical treatment. It's a national disgrace, Moore implies, and he's precisely right. Understandably, we often have to throw money at war machines to gain a political edge, but in doing so we tend to completely neglect the sheer humane practice of making sure everyone has the opportunity to get well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I didn't think of the American health care system at all. Because there was nothing left to think of, all of the facts were in that documentary. Instead, I started thinking of Michael Moore as a person. Actually, I was rethinking my opinion of him, that I have made after watching his previous films. After "Bowling for Columbine" and "Farenheit 9/11" I came to a conclusion, that Michael Moore was a bit of child in how he approached those matters. Maybe, I got a wrong message from Farenheit, but I just felt that I've seen a political propaganda, rather than an attack on G.W. Bush. So I thought: "OK, Mr. Moore just got a little carried away". Any how, he made a very good documentary that was quite interesting. After watching "Bowling for Columbine", I thought: "Yes, Mr. Moore has done a very good documentary about guns and stuff, but I don't see anything that I would consider something that I was not aware of about the US. He simply pointed out some flaws in the system and made fools out of some "big guys" in front of the camera". His approach made me think that he was a little too aggressive and too, don't know how to put this right, fixed on small things. Small things that matter, but still, he had to, in my opinion, try and have a wider look at the problems he's trying to describe. So because of all this, I felt that Mr. Moore was in some ways infantile.But after watching "Sicko" I realized that I was either wrong all along and I have to watch "Bowling" and "9/11" again or he actually "grew up". Because everything that that film had in it was true. There is a joke in Russia:"In a school in the Soviet Union: Teacher: Where are the best schools in the world? Kids: In the Soviet Union! Teacher: Where are the best toys in the world? Kids: In the Soviet Union! Teacher: Where are the best teachers in the world? Kids: In the Soviet Union!A kid in the class starts crying.Teacher: Why are you crying, Peter? Peter: I wanna go to the Soviet Union!"And yes, the American Health Care System is flawed and yes, you get better treatment in most other countries that the US government poses as enemies and so on and so forth. But Michael Moore has shown more than that. He told the Americans that they are being deceived by the government into believing that they are the best country in the world just like the kids in the Soviet Union school. And how that lie is one of the best money makers the government has. And then I remembered what Felini said about peoples approach to life. I'm not going to quote him, I'm just going to give you a summary of things. He said that the best way of life is to be as naive and pure in your approach to life as a child is. Be less logical and more open hearted and things will come your way. That is what Michael Moore is doing, at least that's how I see it. Going to the NRA guy in "Bowling" was a naive and stupid thing to do. Because there would be no consequences. The people who already thought him to be an idiot, wouldn't find anything new. The people who respected him are stupid enough not to see that he is an idiot and they would call Mr. Moore the idiot. But it would get everybody to think about bigger things, grow more skeptical about the people how run the country. And all of his movies work this way.So I say thank you, Mr. Moore. Your films are bigger than documentaries. Your films are, in a way, advertisements of a better human being. A human being who thinks and analyzes. Who cares not only for the well being of his wallet, but for the well being of himself. Your films are a propaganda of a way of life that would make the human being WANT to become the Homo Sapiens he calls him self. So bravo, Mr. Michael Moore. Rock on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get both sides of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has always been a mixed bag for me. His movies are generally entertaining and thought provoking, but his extreme bias and often dubious techniques can overshadow his strong points. I thought Fahrenheit 9/11 was great, enjoyed Bowling for Columbine (even if parts of it went overboard or felt staged), and found Roger &amp; Me interesting, albeit a little economically ignorant.Relying mostly on anecdotal evidence, Sicko cherry picks the absolute worst stories from the US and the absolute best stories from other countries. When he does give actual statistics (which is rare), they're often misleading. It's beyond the scope of this review to dissect all of them, but I recommend you do a Google search for Greg Mankiw's article, "Beyond Those Health Care Numbers." Nonetheless, the movie is well-made, fun to watch, and highlights important issues. It's a shame that Moore's methodology and total disregard for the other side of the story make it feel incomplete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye opening and terrifying - from an American in another country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say this is not really a documentary. Documentaries "document" events, situations, or people as they are. Sicko is a visual essay, like all of Micheal Moore's films. They do not portray certain situations evenly because Moore has an objective with each film, just as a writer has with an essay. There is nothing wrong with that. I don't know why people complain and say what he says (using freedom of speech) is propaganda when the opinions and "counter" facts they spout is doing exactly what Moore is (using freedom of speech). And what some people fail to see in all of Moore's films is that he makes these films out of his love for America. We are most critical of the things we love. Why? Because we want to make them better.Secondly, I have to say this was an amazing film. I don't write reviews too often because there are so many available for each title, but I just had to throw in my two cents because this film really made me aware of some of the problems going on in the health care system in the US. In the film I constantly was saying "No way! That can't be happening in America!" And then it got me thinking: this has got to be just one person right? But wait...getting photographic evidence of anything (rare animals, rare stunts, even bigfoot!) is an extremely hard thing to do. But just because you finally got a picture of Evil Knievel jumping over 20 semi's doesn't mean it's the only time HE's done it, it's just the only time YOU captured it on camera. Finally documenting something is a lot like finding a termite in your house - if there's one, there are thousands beneath the surface. And if there is just one person they could get on camera with this problem, that means there's probably many many more out there who didn't want to be filmed or didn't know of the opportunity to speak of their plight. And in this case that is a lot less rare than I would hope it to be. That is scary.Finally, I have a unique perspective on the matter. I am an America filmmaker currently living and working in Japan (and have so for 6 years). Even though I don't live in America I still very much care for my country,but am saddened when I see things seem to degrade in the land that most countries USED to look up to. Living in Japan is kind of another world experience because, you and people from other countries tend to get isolated into the "foreigner" category. So I've made friends with people from all over the world and have heard their take on health care from their countries.Moreover I've experience the Japanese health care system first hand which is a mixture of the American way and European. There are no private carriers, just a mandatory national one. Here the government pays up to 70% of your medical fees and there is a monthly cap to the amount you have to pay (roughly $8000). The cost to you is a bit pricey however, but in my opinion worth it for the peace of mind (and nothing like 50% in taxes). It is approximately 11% of you wages (1/3 of that is for health insurance and 2/3 is for pension). There are 2 sets of ways to pay for it. If you are unemployed/ self-employed you foot the bill yourself. If you work at a company your company pays for 50% of the bill. I've complained before about the pricey-ness of the system and I don't think its the best one out there, but after seeing Sicko, I am sooooooooo happy I am a part of it and never have to worry about not being covered.I just have to say this film opened my eyes, and I truly hope something will change in the current US health care system. I recommend everyone see this film simply so that they can have an opinion about health care. I guess it's really not surprising that in the most "profit centered" countries (the US and Japan to a degree) who's main focus in anything is first and foremost "make money," that this carries over into health care too. But health care is not a business. It's a matter of life and death. And who wants to ask "How much is your life worth?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was totally blown away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a Michael Moore fan, although I liked "Bowling for Coumbine' very much. I was totally blown away by this movie 'Sicko'. WOW! I know we have a problem in the healthcare/insurance area. What I did not know was- a)how bad our problem is, b)how well some other countries are handling this very important issue.The real contrast is that in the USA, of which I am a citizen, it's all about ME. In the countries Moore showed in this movie, it's about WE. When greed takes over, we have a catastrophic situation as we are experiencing now.After showing some horrible cases in the USA, Moore takes us to Canada, UK, France, and ....Cuba- yes, that communist country which is supposed to be so poor that many Cubans try to take a boat to the USA. In this movie the boat went from the USA to Cuba, and the story Moore showed was so heart warming that it brought tears to my eyes.If these countries can provide healthcare to their citizens, why can't the USA do it? Again, the answer is greed and MEism.This movie was an eye opener for me. It almost made me want to immigrate to France (yes, that beautiful country with the Eiffel tower), but any of the English speaking countries would be more convenient- LOL.Seriously, if you have not seen this movie yet, you have really missed something. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the comment, i find that most of you in the US think that 1. your health care system is good, or could be better. 2. you think that he is not telling the truth about others country's 3. you don't believe that others could have this health care whiteout corruption To answer this: 1. no it is not good, because it takes care of people whit money and don't care about you how don't have money, so my question is simple to you, are they more worth then you are, or are you more worth then them, I will help you all NO. 2. We did not see so much from Norway, but in the second disk, yes it is true. 3. we have some corruption in Norway, but not much, the doctor's and the company's are always been look after for to protect us for that here. What i am telling you all, is that before you come out and say that the movie are not telling the truth, and that it can be done. Then read the comment from all the people here and see for you-self. One more thing this is happened now, why don't you all do something about it??? What we in this country's think of you all, is how can you be so ****** and not vote, or try to get this what we have, free hospitals, cheaper medical support, and also vacation. If you googel this you will find that the company's don't lose money, and we don't work less then you, it is a way to keep the workers work longer, i mean in time, and also take care of the people that actually make the rich people make more money. So again to be the best democracy, you are in fact the worst we have seen.What i did feel after have seen this movie, is this cant be true, i have heard about this but i could never believe that is was true. Here is something more we have in Norway. When you give birth, you get 1 year free from work so you can take care of the baby, but you also get about 6.000$ us dollar because you got the baby, so you can buy what you need for the baby and you. The father can take 2 months free, but he will only get 80% of his generally salary. so booth can be there for the baby. We get 5 weeks vacation every year, but the company have to save 12% of my yearly income, that is my vacation money, so I make about 400.000 every year, so my vacation money that my company is paying me is 48.000. that is about 8727,30$ us dollar. And we don't work more then 7,5 hours a day, after that it is overtime, and we will make more money. My friends wife, got his mother in law on visit, and she got some hart problems here, she is from Bolivia, she went to a hospital, and she was so afraid that she had to pay, because she did not have money, she did not have to pay, and not my friend. We have read about a person from Norway that went to us, and she got a hart problem, they did not want to nothing to her before they had the money, she had to sell her house in Norway for that, in Norway free, how can that be so different, when you are the best democracy in the world?? If i am so unlucky to get a sickens, or a accident so i cant work any more, i will get money from the government to my life, rent house, food, everything i need. yes it cost some, but again we are alike, and nobody is more worth then the next one. School are free until you Begin on university. So again google and you will find that in the western country's your is the worst to be in when it comes to take care of people, as pore, as rich, well maybe not the rich because they have the money. All this is not because we don't like to work, but we have learn that we have to take care of our people, because they are the people that in fact are doing the hard work to keep the company up and running. I know it is a lot of wrong spelling here, but please bear whit me. After this could you honestly believe that you are living in the best country in the world?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So biased it is hard to trust any single statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is obnoxious. It is blatantly attempting to dumb down the health care systems of a few countries to the degree that the average American is supposed to understand. Some of the things covered in the film are accurate, others are partial truths at best, however they are presented as absolute fact. The pathetic pandering to the emotions of those foolish enough to believe everything Moore presents is frustrating. This is NOT anything I could recommend that someone watch, even to begin understanding health care systems. This is presented as a documentary but is frustratingly far from accurate. For those who cannot be bothered to research these systems on their own this is believable. I even agree with some of the premise (in terms of health care being a fundamental human need that a modern and economically stable country should provide their people). Moore then stoops to where he is comfortable, making it an emotional plea without putting much actual concrete fact into the production. He spent more time on annoying music, needlessly dramatizing certain areas he wished to highlight, than he did with actual comparisons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intriguing documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Flicking through Michael Moore's previous films, if you were caught in his cross hairs, you automatically needed your "Foot-in-the-door O Matic", to sever his leg if he came knocking at your door; as shown in once part of Sicko, the Big Cheeses' don't like being in the next Michael Moore film. Moore is an angry man, and he wants his results when he is asking why something isn't right. Sicko yet is Moore's less intrusive film to date, being he is not the main flag waver here. Unlike previous film Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore pushes himself to the background, and lets the people's voice through, and their horror stories with battling the American Healthcare System.As Moore simply states at the beginning of Sicko, this is not a film about all the millions of American's who have no health insurance what so ever, this is about all the people how are actually covered by the HMO, or so they think. Sicko is one film that really makes your stomach churn in revolt, and the ending result of feeling just plain sick. The stories told by those covered who felt so secure by their HMO, are truly horrific. Just when they think all is well and be covered for the hospital bill, they better think again. Excluding care for the most trivial problems, or if nothing is wrong, the Health Insurance will find a way to deny you. The private health system, big money with little to none care given. The Ultimate Money Game should be the actual name of the American Healthcare System, to no wonder why they are so low on the world standard for Healthcare.Moore presents something truly horrific in Sicko, that does speak to everyone. We all have people we love, and it's a terrifying that so many people in the American Healthcare System worry more about the bill or being thrown out to the gutter, then receiving the care they ask for. Sicko is one film also being an Australian, they should all see, as when the Australian Healthcare is slowly being privatised and morphing into one resembling that of America, it's enough to take a lesson from the French and fill those streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is only incidentally about health care; it is about core values in the USA compared with Canada, Britain, France and Cuba. It is a call for more human-centric family values. It is not about statistics. It is about seeing the national differences for yourself.For me the key scene was two American parents, bankrupted by HMO co-pays who had to move into their adult daughter's storage room. The daughter had done nothing to prepare for mom coming and clearly resented her presence. The daughter was unwilling to relocate anything in the storage room to make room for her parents. In the meantime the son whined about having to help his parents move every 5 to 7 years as their financial situation deteriorated. The parents felt humiliated and unwelcome. The whole US attitude is ME ME ME. The ME, money-first attitude is reflected by the HMOs who reward doctors financially for refusing care. The key is making money and the means is using every dirty trick in the book to refuse payment or refuse insurance altogether. The ME attitude is demonstrated in the surveillance tape of a hospital just dumping an indigent patient in the street without clothes or shoes.This attitude contrasted so sharply with people in the other countries who felt an obligation to make sure EVERYONE was FULLY cared for, not just them.To Moore, the extent others take this obligation seemed ludicrous.Rescue workers from 9-11 ended up in Cuba, treated free, simply because that is what the Cuban people do. The doctors were so kind, that some of the rescue workers burst into tears, so unused to being cared for. Given how cruel the USA has been to Cuba, and for no good reason, it was remarkable how gentle and considerate the Cubans were with the Americans. The segment was so rich with human goodness I doubt there were many dry eyes. If this reconciliation were possible, what other miracles could happen? Britain's Anthony Benn explained universal health care so simply and so clearly, that I felt as if I were in the presence of a saint.</fullReview>

The movie will keep your mind focused on the subject at hand. This is the best Moore film and does not strike me as mere sensationalism as did F911. I am not an extremely emotional person but this movie made my eyes water up a few times. The movie begins by talking about Americans with no insurance and then moves on to cover those who have been failed by our managed system of health care. Moore then takes this farther by showing how are country showed appreciation to rescue workers at Ground Zero who were not officially employed by the government. This movie should change people's lives and if there is any fairness maybe it will impact our system.Great.</fullReview>

Watching the movie made me realize just how precarious everyone's social status is, and how difficult it is to change one's work situation if you're reliant on insurance to provide you with medicine that keeps you alive, such as asthmatics and diabetics. One of my friends who discussed the film with me had cancer at the age of 21, has chronic asthma, and owes massive amounts of money to every hospital in town. If anything, Michael Moore's film doesn't go far enough in documenting just how entrenched this debt structure is in the States.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are we getting screwed!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone is laughing at us. We are workaholics hurriedly going through life...too busy to bother thinking about anything other than paying bills, going to work, saving for college, worrying about healthcare. This film makes you stop and think about the *why*. Why are we killing ourselves so that big pharma can profit. Why is it okay to profit off the backs of sick people but somehow unpatriotic or wrong to ask if there's a better system out there for healthcare? There are incidents in this film that will make you outraged. We want to feel secure in the knowledge that our insurance will be there for us when we get sick. But they're busy finding ways to decline coverage, as one person in the film put it, (I'm paraphrasing) "It's not that there are cracks in the system, somebody deliberately put those cracks in place and is sweeping you towards them." It's denial by design. In the film, you learn about claims review doctors getting bonuses the more claims they deny. Michael Moore is right..."Who are we?" Have we traded profit for humanity? I want to move to Europe!Michael Moore, don't let anyone tell you that you are not a patriot. You are a courageous, kind hearted, human being and yes, you are a real patriot. You don't have to help people, but you do. You don't have to educate people, and show them how other people live, but you did. Thank you Mr. Moore. I know that you love this country because actions speak louder than words. And speaking of words, you make it easy to see past the political sound bite into the (dark) heart of what's really being said by the soothsayers, the appeasers and defenders of the status quo.</fullReview>

And remember that he is not the kind of filmmaker that presents both sides of the argument and then lets you decide. He is the type of filmmaker who attacks the injustices of issues he feels need to be addressed and brings them to the audience's attention by showing people that have actually experienced them. He also takes his oppositions arguments and deconstructs them excellently. Was very touched by many parts of the simply amazing film.</fullReview>

I think I can now even like the French. The movie is entertaining and fact filled with Moore's very effective mid-western tone narrating dialect. The work is better written and the flow of scenes smoother and more effective than his other documentary films. The various hospital scenes across the world might have been balanced with some of the more successful U.S. hospitals and the amazing amount of excellent volunteers. This could have played to the story that despite all tragedies of poor care it can be done right and compassionately.

		<shortDescription>Sicko is an absolutely necessary film, with only a few small flaws, a lot of heart and a lot to think about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sicko may be Michael Moore's best, though I will always hold Roger And Me close to my heart. I've never seen another film that so effectively makes me laugh while making a point about something horrible, like the U.S health care system. I won't recap the film, as it's been done all over, other than to say he profiles many cases that show how bad HMO's are in the U.S and how other major industrial countries take care of their citizens so much better. Seeing how people live in other countries, like the U.K, Canada and France, made me very angry about the U.S. Government and Corporate America--how they are structured to keep most people living like slobs and a very few live like kings. France, Canada, etc., seem to understand that the Government is there for the good of the people. It is a tool by which people maximize happiness. It is there to run services that allow the people to not have to think about the stupid mundane crap that runs our lives in the U.S. The film touches upon the whole concept of "we" vs. "me" and how the Government should be afraid of it's people, afraid of protest (echoing V for Vendetta, one of my favorite kinda recent movies). It is a very powerful idea.One of my criticisms of this film is this: a lot of the anti-Universal Health Care people (coincidentally, the same people who oppose raising the minimum wage--Gingrich, Bush, the Heritage Foundation, etc.) perpetuate the idea that these countries with Universal Health Care are crushing their citizens with their high taxes. I really wish Moore had done a better job dealing with this argument, as he only showed one European family (who have a very comfortable upper middle class lifestyle) to refute it. An anecdote does not make an argument (even if it is one that I am inclined to agree with). I was sad to see that he did not make this point better by showing many more examples or hard data. Of course the whole deal with Moore's films is that the anecdotes make the point. He does supply other hard facts, but facts in and of themselves do not make for an entertaining film.Other than that? Sicko is an absolutely necessary film, with only a few small flaws, a lot of heart and a lot to think about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Tommy Douglas, the man who introduced social health care to Canada, was mentioned by the golfer friend of Michael Moore's Canadian relatives, I wish more had been said about him. Canadians did vote for him as the greatest Canadian when the CBC held a nation wide contest on that subject in 2005, and I think Americans should understand why he even beat Wayne Gretzky in that competition.Our health care system has taken a beating in recent years, but what we do have we cherish, even though some Canadians will whine about it and think privatization is the answer to waiting in line for an operation. I have had epilepsy since I was a child and I'm able to go specialist doctor appointments without having to pay a fee, I've had more than one EEG, MRI, CAT Scan and other tests without having to pay for them. If I were to have an operation, I wouldn't need to pay for it either. Now we do pay taxes for our health care system, but you just don't think of that. We are just glad to have it. The only thing I pay for his the health insurance I get through my employers (Pacific Blue Cross) so that I can pay for my medications and dental appointments. I only pay about 72 dollars Canadian a month, my employers pay the rest.Some Americans will probably be immediately interested to know that Kiefer Sutherland is Tommy Douglas's grandson, and that Kiefer and his mother Sheila Douglas are avid supporters and defenders of the health care system here in Canada, taking part on certain occasions in protecting it from privatization.If you want to learn more about Tommy Douglas go to:www.cbc.ca/greatest/top-ten/nominee/douglas-tommy.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SICKO (2007) **** Documentarian filmmaker Michael Moore strikes once again ? in this, arguably his best work to date ? focusing a scrutinized lens at America's insufficient health care system, the unscrupulous insurance companies, crooked politicos and the general malaise of the world's greatest nation shunning its citizenry with subpar work and no universal national health care that unlike other nations in Europe, Canada and Cuba have and the inexcusably horrific situations many are discovered to have been swept by the side in handling those who are in desperate need of sufficient medical care. For the most part the comedic glance is a bit eschewed in favor of depicting a human portrait instead for a stronger argument that it is truly unfathomable of how we take care of our own. ***A special personal kudos to editor Chris Seward, Mary Anne Van Wagner and Aneetha Rajan, former colleagues and friends of mine who worked on this project; kudos kids!!***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Documentary -- Pay Attention -- SICKO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the reason for watching Michael Moore's awesome work! It is a huge message to those of us living in America! Take back our country and what it stands for; in this instance -- UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE!!! Government won't do it for us. As in France, we need to stop living in fear and get our rights back for all who live here. It's time we band together and stand in number to make our demands and get our country back for what it's supposed to represent.End the war in Iraq, better jobs so we can actually pay our bills, and have universal health care for all of us in America. Our taxes cover health care for our high political figures till they die. What's up with this insanity?See SICKO and inform yourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some American's in the USA do have fully funded government health care!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello everybody. I am American and I have fully funded, US government run health care. How is that possible you ask? I am an active duty US servicemen! My deductibles are nothing, I pay nothing, I can go to the government run hospitals anytime I want, and none of my requests for special medical services and procedures will ever be denied or declined. In fact, I literally have the same health care plan that the Gitmo detainees have. However the current politicians in office have decided to deny that health care system to reservist, national guardsmen, and veterans (but they give the health care coverage I have to themselves). So don't tell me that a government run, government funded, non-profit health care system won't work for Americans, because it is working for millions of Americans.Since I am writing here I might as well address some of the BS arguments against universal health care.BS argument #1; it's too expensive. Well, according to CNN.COM's fact check on "Sicko", France, which has a health care system that is ranked in the top 10 (where as America is ranked 37th) only spend 11% of their GDP on health care, where as America spend over 15% (much of which goes to help make the CEOs of Aetna, CIGNA, Kaiser Permanente, Humana, Wellpoint, HealthPartners, Allina and all the other HMOs billionaires, as Michael Moore pointed out). Also according the CIA world fact book, American's have a GDP per-capita of $44,000, where as France's GDP per-capita is only $31,100, so in fact if America had an identical system to France, it would only cost about 8% of our GPD.BS Argument #2; it would cost the tax payers a lot of money. True, but let's think about this rationally; would you rather pay a $1,000 a year in taxes to fund a health care system that will give you universal health care no matter who you are, or do you prefer to pay $1,900 a year out of your pocket to a heath care system that works to maximize it's profits by denying as many claims as it possibly can? Where would you rather have your hard earned money go to; to the national treasury, or to the bank accounts of the billionaire HMO CEOs? The national treasury we can control with our votes, but we have no control over the HMO CEOs, most of whom keep their money in accounts and investments outside of the USA.BS argument #3; citizens of nations with universal health care systems have to wait longer to get operations. True, but not by much, and at least they get their operations. In a universal health care system claims are not denied because of preexisting conditions, and cancer survivors are not denied coverage because they once had cancer.BS argument #4; Fraud cases are costly. However the people who say that fail to mention that the fraud cases are present in the existing American privatized system, but that under a Government run system fraud cases would be easier to spot, because the government would have more sources (such as law enforcement) to look into cases that were fraudulent. The US government is lass likely to get ripped off by individuals than private HMOs are. In any case it does not seem likely that the amount of fraudulent claims would increase under a universal Health care system (more than likely the amount would decrease).Personally I know a lot of young, very patriotic US servicemen, servicewomen, and dependents who have survived cancer through the health care they received from the US Military, and are terrified of getting out of the service, because they know American HMOs will not want to offer them coverage.We are a very sad country if we cannot take care of our heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a must see movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the movie and loved it. This should be a must see. Of course Michael Moore is one-sided on this issue. But so was "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair and other notable works of activism like "Silent Spring". That didn't mean they were wrong.I could have done less with Moore's commentary, but its his style. At least it isn't nearly as prevalent in this film as compared to some others he's done.An interesting point that Moore raises in the film as a question about our cultural identity as a nation when it comes to issues like health care is: "Who ARE we?" And although he doesn't answer it, I'll give my answer. We are a country that culturally is motivated by greed. Every man for himself. "Got mine, screw you." If you believe in using taxes to make lives better for your fellow neighbors and citizens no matter whether they are rich or poor, you're some kind of sucker. That's the legacy we're fighting in the uphill battle for universal health care.A word though about the detractors of this film. They seem to fall into three categories:1. The MM haters who review the film by personally attacking Moore and not even addressing the film except to apply adjectives to it like "fraud", "lies", etc. Yeah, REAL convincing argument there.2. The irrational who take the premise of "socialized medicine" and immediately jump to Communinism, Nazism, and how all citizens will lose all their rights if we dare even move in the direction of universal health care. (Based on which you'd think that by now England would be living in the world of "V for Vendetta". Oh, it isn't?)3. The US "experts" on how bad universal health care is in other countries. If they aren't baldly lying, they are taking a statement with a grain of truth in it and blowing it up so many orders of magnitude as to make it appear that they have made some kind of unassailable point about us good, them bad.My suggestion to combat these critics? Go online and find a forum that nationals from these other countries gather at and ask them questions about their health care systems. Not every system is perfect. But in all the opinions I've read NO ONE is willing to give up their national health system in favor of the American model, or even seriously consider replicating part of our system. Wait times are often the most exaggerated lies spread around. And if people are coming to the USA for health care its usually motivated by highly particular circumstances, not because if they had it done at home they'd surely die waiting or some ridiculous argument like that. And guess what? Those foreigners are coming with all the money in hand or high-cost extra private insurance to pay the full outrageous US bill. Meaning a good amount of them who hop over to the US for some treatments are wealthy to begin with.Finally the thing you NEVER hear the critics address is American ingenuity to solve the problem. They point out one or two bad things about this or that country's system, condemn their entire approach based on those negatives, and then conclude that we therefore already have the best system in the world and to change it would be disastrous. NEVER does a single one of them talk about the good old-fashioned concept of stealing the best ideas from a variety of sources to build a better system than any of the others. No, just be thankful for what you already have (even if you aren't allowed in because you aren't healthy enough, can't afford it, or will be bankrupted by it via denial of claims). End of story.That's why I think most of these people (usually in the #3 category) are shills for big health care and big pharma who are trying to spread misinformation in order to maintain the status quo. Don't listen to them. They DO NOT have your best interests in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it kind of interesting to slow down the trailer when the list is on to check out the order of things. There are absolutely things that we need to change about our health care system, but check this out. Cuba and Canada (two countries touted in Sicko?..) rank 39 and 30 respectively which doesn't exactly mesh with some ideas in this film about the quality of care in those countries. France the number one according to this list is working on changing their health care system to include more personal choice and responsibility to have a market influenced system. The other thing is that I looked for this ranking list on the WHO's website but could not find it. I wonder what the criteria was for the ranking. Just a few thoughts. I just get frustrated because I truly believe that our health care system needs some fairly major redoing. But there are just so few examples of universal health care being a great system and I think that the idea of universal health care bogs down the discussion that USAers need to have about how to improve our health care system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All you people give Mr Moore so much credit for his latest effort have obviously never been in Cuba or Canada's hospitals. I have been in both; in Cuba to visit my dying mother and in Canada to receive treatment from an accident at Toronto's airport. The hospital my mother was hospitalized in Havana was according to the US office in Havana the unit with the best Dr's in Cuba. IF that's was the best, no wonder my poor mother die. The place was incredibly dirty, the staff including Drs. did not wear proper attire and smoked in the hallways and eat snacks in the patience room. My family had to bring towels from home so my mother could be washed, and them take the dirty towel back home to wash...should I go on? do you get the picture? In Canada, I had some sort of virus infection that caused me to faint at the Toronto airport, pron ting the personnel to call the ambulance service to take me to a local hospital. This happened at 8:00 am, I was seen by a Dr. at 4:30 pm. With me there 15 other cases that had arrived by ambulance. All those ambulances and their operators (2 each) were at the hospital with us until we were seen by a Dr. At one point my co-worker walked outside and counted 13 ambulances park in the lot (imagine the cost). Why the delay you ask? Because of the socialized system everyone uses hospitals emergency room for anything from a tooth ache to a heart attach, and the system is overwhelmed. On the other hand, when I was finally seen by a Dr., the care was excellent, and I even received a cat scan (didn't have to wait months) all for $980.00 US. There is no doubt the American health system needs help, but don't praise the rest of the world before you try their system. Ours is not so bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>taxes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts with Michael Moore presenting cases of Americans struggling with the health care system. This first act is the most compelling part of the movie. The people are very human. Their cases are touching, insightful, funny, and head-shaking. Next, it gets into the political case.The case is very general but informative. It tries to be too cute with the comedy. It's very much Moore's style but it takes away from the seriousness of the situation. Once it gets to Canada, the movie has a great opportunity to explain the system. It's an opportunity half exploited. Moore is able to dispel some of the scare tactics of the American critics. However, he doesn't explain how the system is paid for. It's half a story told and that keeps going as he starts globe-trotting. I would rather he dig deeper into the dollars and cents of the Canadian system. Moore plays like nobody pays but of course, it's all paid in taxes. It's disingenuous and too obvious. The problem is that the audience is not that dumb.In Britain, he spends a little time promoting how well a doctor gets paid. It's the wrong audience. Nobody watching this cares if doctors stay rich. Again, it's the lack of an overall financial picture that leaves the critics with the ability to muddy up the story. It allows them to say it's too good to be true because Moore is almost saying it's all free. It gets even worst in France. Moore is coming up with some of craziest social programs. I don't understand why he'd think Americans would love the idea of the government coming into your home to do laundry. He's basically doing the work of the opposition by showing the weirdest thing a socialist French government waste their money on. He finally figures out that the audience is asking about the taxes but then he simply asks one random couple with the least informative questions about their finances. Fishes...I have no problems with globe-trotting. Go to Britain. Go to France. Go to Cuba even. The most compelling human story continues to be in the U.S. Dumping human beings by American hospitals is horrifying. There is no doubt that this raises the issues with great personal stories. It is missing a more in-depth explanation of what the solution entails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All I can say is... WHAT THE SH*T America?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me how f**k up the American system is. People say that the biggest threat to the American citizens six the terrorist, the drug wars, and gangs, when in reality the greatest threat to the people are our own Insurance companies. I mean my god, Health Insurance companies kill more people than any terrorist, and all the sh*t we've heard about how awful socialist health care is is all total bullshit. My jaw dropped when I found out that you can go to a hospital in Canada and or France for free. When they said the French government offers maids to parents, I laughed my a** off because it seemed so absurd to me, but it was true. Obviously, taxes are a nightmare in socialist countries, but if it means not having to choose between drowning in debt or saving your child's life then by all means tax me! I can very easily relate to this movie because I've lost five family members on both my mom's and dad's side because of their crappy insurance companies. My grandma had breast cancer and diabetes, but because those diseases were hereditary she was denied coverage for her medication and died a horrible and painful death at age 60. My 20-year-old aunt went deaf at 12 because she contracted an ear infection and she was denied money needed to get the an implant required to fix her ears, but her health insurance declined coverage because they said the implants were experimental. I've lost so many loved ones because of the damn insurance company, and of course, no one gave a sh*t because not only were they poor but also black. I know people like to pretend that the health departed doesn't discriminate, but they do so just accept the truth. We're not free; we're a country where money rules and if you don't have that you might as well buy a gun and shoot yourself. I'm afraid to drive my car because what if I get in an accident, because at fault and end up bankrupt and be thrown out of a hospital while dying of cancer. All I can say is 6 years from now I'm kissing America goodbye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're really not number 1.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore does the best job at exposing the American government for its huge flaws and failures. So why make a movie about health care? Where to start. The American health care system is a gigantic abuse of American greed, where insurance companies dictate the health of millions of Americans and only a small percentage of people can see a doctor without worrying about their finances. Moore takes a look at countries all over Europe where health care is free of charge, and a complex tax system pays for not only health care, but education and paid family leave at a brilliant and cost affective rate. Why the hell can't we do that? This is America. Moore calls out the horrible economic differences that are not present throughout the rest of the modern world, brining moral questions about how our health care and economic system affects millions of people daily and how we need to make drastic change. Agree with him or not, Moore gives tons of evidence and interesting interviews that give a different take on health care and economics, as well as brings in some clever sarcasm to make this both another educational and entertaining documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sicko (2007): Dir: Michael Moore / Featuring: Michael Moore: Michael Moore's often hilarious documentary that attacks American health care and in particular the attitude that translates to him from the government as indicated through those whom he interviews. There is a couple whose medical bills were so high that they were forced to sell their house and move in with their daughter. Another gentleman is still working at 79 years of age. Moore also introduces those who went unnoticed after their heroism at 911. American health care is so bad that Moore sought answers elsewhere only to learn that Canada, Great Britain, France, and Cuba have tremendous care. He brings out the sorrows of his guests while still taking hilarious crack shots at politicians particularly George Bush. His films often attack or address issues concerning our corrupt society, or more often our government. He does this famously with the humour and sarcasm that attracts viewers who made Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 911 tremendous hits. He manages to pull off a film every bit as effective as those other titles but that may also pend to how one feels about his political views. The film concludes with a humorous scene where Moore lugs his dirty laundry towards the White House with claims that they can do it. He is attempting to fight our battles for all those too ill to care anymore. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I was not all that impressed with Sicko but I was definitely saddened by many of the stories along the way. The major problem is that the film misrepresents healthcare in other countries. England does have a two tiered system and it might be a point to mention somewhere in the doco! Furthermore I couldn't help but think as Moore ranted about health care problems in a western world - this almost seems like a luxury - what about all the countries in the world that don't.I was distracted by much of the camera work. Some of the movement and out of focus shots felt staged to remind us that this is a doco.... and supposed to look on the fly not a cinematic experience. But sure, Sicko does make you reflect on how lucky we are to even have the healthcare debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should health care be free?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has always been controversial. And, as all conflictive people, you can only love him or hate him. Because of this his messages are, very often, misunderstood or simply dismissed. I will not align myself 100% with Moore politically but his message in Sicko got to me loud and clear. Some reviewers have criticized this documentary for, according to them, telling total lies or half-truths at best. Of course, we all know that the US Health System is not as bad as Michael portrays it and the systems in place in the UK, France, Canada and Cuba are not as fantastic as he shows them to be. But it's only natural that Moore would carefully select the appropriate examples to make the point he's trying to get across, isn't it? I know of some examples of my own that he could have easily included in Sicko had he known about them. An Argentinian friend of mine went to Spain on vacation, suffered severe food poisoning and had to be treated at a local hospital for a day and a half. He was expecting a substantial hospital bill but when he was discharged he was told his treatment was free as Spanish Social Security pays for all health care expenses for, not just Spaniards but also, foreigners while legally in Spain. He also told me the care he received was top notch. So these things do happen, they're not a figment of Michael Moore's imagination. But let's get to the main topic of Sicko. Should health care be afforded everyone in the USA for free or not? I am no communist and I still believe it should. I cannot imagine any obligation that should be more important to any government on earth than to protect the well being of their citizens.And we have the money to pay for health care but our government chooses to use it elsewhere. I cringe when I hear how much we're spending in building yet more fighter planes, bombs or any device manufactured with the sole purpose of killing other human beings. The LGM-118 Peacekeeper ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) cost $400 million apiece and 114 were built thru 1998 alone. Each F-177 stealth fighter comes at $111.2 million each and they were all retired in 2008. The bigger stealth bomber (Northrop Grumman B-2) came with a price tag of $737 million per unit and $44.6 billion total program cost thru 2004. We built all these weapons, spent fortunes and never got to use but a few of the planes in Iraq. We threw away billions of dollars while people at home could not pay for health services as they were losing their homes. We're still building weapons we don't really need just because of the scare tactics and lobbying by Northrop Grumman, Boeing and the likes. The USA is already, by far, the most heavily armed military in the world and their latest budget is higher than the combined budgets of the eight nations that follow us. And Congress actually believes it's better to spend an additional 2 trillion in 2014 than to pursue health care reform!If we used this money to take care of our poor and specially our sick....I believe we'd be a much better country. Quite frankly, I very much prefer my tax dollars be used for taking care of our people than to ensure we're more capable of killing others abroad.That's Michael Moore's message in Sicko and I, for one, wholeheartedly have to agree. Don't let whatever personal dislike, or even hatred, you may have for the guy obscure this simple fact. Moore may be a Marxist, a reactionary or whatever you choose to label him but...on this particular occasion he's totally right!!!! Let's get our priorities straight...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Insurance Companies Hold All the Cards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the extreme partisan divide within this country this film probably won't even be viewed by certain segments of our society. The fact is that if any news isn't from one of their "trusted sources" they simply won't believe it. But the truth won't be denied forever and all American citizens will eventually get sick or injured. It's just a sad fact of life. Now, as far as this film is concerned, I agreed with most of it because I typically endeavor to keep an open mind. The fact is that there are millions of people in this country who simply can't afford to get sick. There are millions more who believe that if they do get sick that their insurance will pay for it. What they don't realize is that the insurance companies are concerned with only one thing?making a profit. And if that means denying needed care then that is exactly what they will do. In that regard, Michael Moore does a very good job of proving that point. He also does much to dismantle the argument that countries with "socialized medicine" are necessarily second-rate societies begging for an American-style solution. There is a reason that the United States ranks 37th in health care and countries like Finland, Sweden and Norway rank ahead of us. If only certain people would open their eyes to see it. On that score, I believe Michael Moore stumbles just a bit. For example, his attempt to enter Guantanamo was obviously nothing more than a publicity stunt that would have given him a desired result regardless of whether the ill 9/11 rescue workers were seen or not. If they had been treated at Guantanamo he could have trumpeted the success of "government health care". The fact that they weren't seen merely gave him the option of going into Cuba and being used for propaganda purposes by the Communist regime. And make no mistake, the government there was clearly interested in putting on a good show for the world to see. Additionally, some doubt could also be raised concerning those he chose to interview in Canada, England or France. Because of his obvious bias it could be charged that he only used stories that would buttress his case on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean--or in Canada's case, both sides of the Detroit River. That is not to say that he did, but it leaves open the possibility. Likewise, he didn't need to bring up college tuition at all. The fact that he did merely serves to prove the accusation that he is a "socialist" and therefore "un-American". At least in the minds of some people. Be that as it may, there are two things that are certain: One is that our current system leaves many people vulnerable to a catastrophic illness or injury and the other is that the insurance companies are making enormous profits in the process. These two points are undeniable. Unfortunately, it is equally undeniable that vast segments of our society are completely brainwashed by clever slogans and clichés which have them believing that America has the "best health care in the world". What they refuse to see is that this is true only for those who can afford it. To further confuse people the very thing the insurance companies want is the exact same thing their brainwashed minions repeat as the cure for our problems?tort reform! One need look no further than this very board to see a few misguided souls talking about "limiting lawsuits" as the practical solution. Nevermind the fact that "tort reform" is only a "catch word" which wouldn't accomplish anything other than making sure the insurance companies won't be held liable for their unethical practices. In short, health care in this country is a big business and the insurance companies hold all of the cards (i.e. "politicians"). The only joker in the deck is the will of the American voter. But as long as the American voter is uninformed or fearful, this trump card will never be played. It's absolutely sickening and Michael Moore does a reasonably good job of making the point. Again though, he goes overboard a time or two and that's all it really takes to leave millions of people unconvinced. Hence the reason I have rated this as only slightly above average.</fullReview>

The stories of what some of these families went through was tragic beyond anything you would imagine. Losing loved ones because insurance companies refused to pay for their treatment. Giving them BS reasons for it such as. 'Oh this particular treatment is experimental' Even though that was not the case. There was a man who lost 2 fingers in a DIY accident. He was using a steel disk saw for cutting some wood, his hand slipped and it took his middle finger and ring finger off above the knuckle. This man having no health insurance had to choose which finger he wanted reattached. He couldn't afford them both...he had to choose...what a horrible thing to have to do. Which finger do you like better, or rather...which finger can you afford to get back? Trust me when i say they were NOT cheap. The health insurance companies greed stood out like a big red spot on your face. They make it their policy to make sure that at least 10% of applicants are denied. Doctors who actually denied more people admitted that they received a bonus for doing so. People who did actually manage to claim well they came after them best they could. Having staff dedicated to finding any errors in your contract which would nullify your insurance, and getting them their money back.I live in Scotland, United Kingdom. Thankfully we don't have to deal with this. I get all my prescriptions free, if i have an accident i go to the hospital and they patch me up and i walk out without paying anything. Don't believe the BS slurs they've fed you about the service in countries with free healthcare. Its just lies spun to put you off. I can assure any American that this system is so important to our society. The people can rest easy not having to worry about paying huge bills should they injure themselves. With so many injuries in the US every year, from gunshots, stabbings whatever, well, its making these greedy companies tonnes...and tonnes of cash. They want to keep that money, they don't want you getting it for free. Its another sham of a law which keeps the rich rich and makes the poor even poorer. I really did feel so sorry for these people who lost loved ones. I cant even begin to imagine the frustration and hatred they must feel. Well worth checking this documentary out. Hopefully you guys over there can get some kinda petition going and demand change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sicko is a documentary directed by Michael Moore released in 2007 which addresses an always controversial topic in the United States: the existence of a private health care system. Shot in a documentary style, Sicko mixes political opinions, interviews of people who have suffered the weakness of the medical system and shows how other countries manage this issue. After watching this two hours long movie, the viewer realizes that the U.S. has a serious problem.Before shooting the movie, Moore on his website asked anyone that has had problems with their health insurance to mail their stories. One week later he received over 25,000 answers. In addition, to revealing these personal issues the film severely criticizes the insurance companies accusing them of being worried more for their profits than in their customers. This idea is supported by many people interviewed in the film who claim that either they, or a relative, have been refused a treatment by these companies. Moore states that this is because some treatments are very expensive and the insurance companies search for any excuse to avoid paying, for example: unreported preexistent disease (even though it has been a minor disease non-related to the current illness), complaining that the treatment is experimental or refusing people when they apply for an insurance (in some cases the reason was that the applicant is too fat). Finally this system causes many Americans live without insurance (50 million according to Moore's data). On the one hand, this movie has many good reasons to be watched. First of all, the spectator can see first-person stories about terrifying experiences with the insurance company in America. Conversely it shows how countries like the UK, Canada, or France manage with their public and egalitarian health care system. In Europe taxes have created a universal medical coverage which extends to all the layers of society. No one can be refused. Eventually, the movie leaves a very good question to answer: If in America there is a socialized education, a socialized fire department, a socialized police and so on, why doesn't a socialized health care system exist? Moore claims that medical and insurance companies are very powerful and when someone has tried to change the system, they have stopped him or her. Specifically, the documentary accuses Hillary Clinton of receiving big amounts of money from those companies for shutting her mouth because when she was the first lady she stressed several times the idea of creating a public health care system. On the other hand, there is something that I always criticize from Moore 's movies which is his extreme egocentricity and his showman abilities. I think that the same message could be more effective without him showing up in front of the camera but being behind at all times. However this is his hallmark.I highly recommend this movie because I believe that this is a worrisome issue. The U.S. is the wealthiest nation in the world and in my country (Spain) we have a much better medical system whereas we have less economical power. From my European point of view this is unconceivable and I think that watching this movie could open many people's minds.</fullReview>

I've wanted to get a better glimpse at the vaunted French health care system and it gave a nice look at some of the benefits.Just as a note to all the Americans in a huff about "OMG MORE TAXES!" Average Income Tax in the USA is about 30%...Average Income Tax in Canada is about 32%...Average Income Tax in the UK is 30%...There are European Countries where you get much more paid time off/year and generally more healthcare with more tax.For example France at about 48% average, Germany 50% average.Australia pays less in average income tax and they have universal health care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Moore until the date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The USA is one of the few developed industrialized countries without an universal free Medicare system. Sicko tells us how the medical and pharmaceutical system works in USA, and harms the health of their members - those members carefully chosen by the HMOs who can afford paying the fees of a private insurance to then be ignored when they are sick.This is Moore's more accomplished documentary, to me. We are used to Moore's blaming of big corporations and their leaders in a funny sarcastic provocative way, taking situations to the extreme to make his point. However, those Corporations seem to be too alien to us, that is, too removed from our daily life and reality. The difference with other of his documentaries is that Moore poses the question: Are they? And organizes the doco to demonstrate that their greediness and dirty ways affect the American citizens - directly.The documentary is that proclaims the right of every single human being to have a public universal health system. Something that we Europeans take for granted, and, Moore puts a lot of heart in it. He not only believes in what he preaches, but he really cares.It is a terrifying documentary, because it departs from a point that is not the usual. That is, the film does not explore the situation of those millions of Americans who cannot afford paying for a private medical insurance, but on those who have one, to demonstrate that, too often, they are in the same situation.To make his points, Moore talks to insured people with grave illnesses whose lives turned into a nightmare after claiming support from their HMOs and they said no. They are hard-working people, some of them even 9/11 heroes, who have been evicted from their houses, who have to keep working until old age to pay for their medicines, and those how have lost a family member or a going to die as a result of the carelessness of the HMOs.Moreover, Moore visits some countries that have free universal Medicare systems. Especially funny and exemplary are his visits to France (alone), and to Cuba (with a group of sick Americans), but also to Canada and England. Moore also visited Norway, but that is only shown in the DVD's extras. Those visits matter-of-fact demonstrate that a developed country, and even a poor one, can afford a universal Medicare system without affecting their economy and profiting the general population. You just have to care for your citizens, and put boundaries to the activities of greedy corporations and their CEOs.I especially liked Moore's interview with English labor politician Tony Benn, which has extended footage in the DVD's extras. Benn is a fascinating chap, a person able to talk about politics in a language that is practical and easy to understand for everybody, making his points with heart, warmth and reason, for the benefit of the people.The doc is excellent for USA viewers, but also for European ones, as we too often take for granted our wonderful health care systems! The DVD's extras show some of the reactions of conservatives and lobbyist mass media to Moore's visits to Europe, saying things like USA's health system is better than the French, which, by the way, is the 1st in the world according to the World Health Organisation.The film has been criticized by the American media, but we need to remember that Free Press in America is just a fiction, as the Press is managed by a small bunch of tyrants of the information, who have a direct interest in the survival and domination of the corporations they have built. Although I love the Wikipedia, the page on the film shows a biased section devoted to critic, mostly ignoring the praises of the movie, and reducing them to the ratings in several movie sites, Rotten Tomatoes included.One ends thinking, if Moore is such a fool, he does not say the truth, why don't those HMOs corporations bring it to Court? Why do they hate him so much to the point of discrediting him so often? The answer is simple and terrifying the same.A very entertaining, moving and heartfelt documentary, with Moore's usual dose of sarcasm, cynicism and exaggeration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This and Fahrenheit 9/11 are the best of the documentaries Michael's made(I haven't caught Roger &amp; Me yet, though, and Captain Mike Across America, which I'm not sure is any good; apart from that, I've taken in all of his theatrically released features, including The Big One, Bowling for Columbine and Capitalism: A Love Story). Yes, he's manipulative, and he plays easy with the facts sometimes, making things appear other than what they are. I hope that everyone does realize that. Anything purported to be true should be researched by the individual viewer, and that is especially the case with what he delivers. However, he also has compelling points, and presents them in a persuasive manner. This uses interviews(probably the biggest amount out of any of his movies, and it really helps elevate it; 3 extra on the disc, too, check them out) and footage from films/commercials/etc. and real situations. The focus is squarely placed on the people affected, and what they've experienced in their struggle to get treatment. This is incredibly moving, particularly the last fourth; fortunately the very last image is a pleasant and highly needed relieving laugh. Yes, he makes the trip to Guantanamo Bay with WTC rescue workers; I will not give away the result. He visits Canada, Great Britain and France and it gives first-hand descriptions about socialized medicine(as a Dane living under such a system, I can confirm that it is quite accurate; in addition, we have private hospitals as well, so here, you can choose between the two. Taxes are higher, but salaries seem to be, as well; I haven't had a job in my short stays in the US, so I don't know). There are brief sequences of nudity(not sexual), disturbing/intense/disgusting content and strong language(by someone who hates the director). The DVD comes with no less than an hour and 25 minutes worth of features, in the form of half a dozen informational segments, a music video and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of Moore, or at least anyone who can stand him. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is REALLY good at what he does. He is not a pure textbook documentarian - he is a theatrical filmmaker with a definite and specific opinion about his subjects. This film made me want to put on a surgical mask, hide underneath my bed, curl into a little ball and cry... or just move very far away from the U.S... or open my window and shout "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!". Having had my own exasperating experiences with healthcare - this film really rang true, as I am sure it does for millions upon millions of Americans. This film, perhaps more than any other I have seen in some time, really made me quite embarrassed to be part of such a criminal, negligent, greedy, violent, selfish, borderline fascist country. Why we are not all marching in the streets demanding a revolution is a sure sign that those with 'the most' have succeeded in making those with 'the least' petrified with fear, paralyzed with despair and programmed into laziness.Be sure to watch the special features on the DVD - there are some fascinating bits that were left out of the final cut. Meanwhile, I'll be on Paris.craigslist.org checking out the housing listings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore was my gateway to the world of documentary cinema years ago, but I think I've outgrown him now. 'Sicko' starts well enough, with a series of horror stories from people who needed medical care in the US but had no insurance. And there are some worthwhile moments along the way (a woman who discovers that an inhaler that costs $120 in America is five cents in Cuba).But around the half way mark, Moore visits Britain, Canada and France, and tries to make out that their versions of the NHS are perfect, democratic, flawless machines that treat everyone like the beautiful human beings they are. And that's when this movie and I parted company; it's a silly and idealised treatment of an interesting subject. And by the time Moore takes a bunch of sick 9/11 rescue workers to Guantanamo Bay, where a bunch of terrorists are getting top notch health care, I wanted facts, not gimmicks. And when he sends a cheque for $12,000 to a guy who runs an anti-Moore website to pay for his wife's hospital bills, I felt slightly nauseous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the documentary "Sicko," filmmaker Michael Moore is at it again, doing what he does best: providing social commentary in his trademark pull-no-punches, shoot from the hip style, with his expected blend of irony and understatement to make his point. "Sicko" is a film about the sad state of health care in the United States and functions to shake us up and make us think about the kind of mess we are really in with escalating costs of medical care and prescription medicine in conjunction with a broken health insurance system. With a mixture of interviews from sick patients having been denied medical treatment by insurance companies, to images depicting our poor dropped off by taxis on streets corners by hospitals, to presenting in comparison the exemplary government managed health care systems of Canada, France, Briton, and Cuba, Moore's theme of the inadequacy of health care in the U.S. shouts at the audience loud and clear. Rated PG-13 for mature subject matter, mild profanity, and brief nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Winner from Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sicko (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Michael Moore sets his fire onto the American health care system in what's probably the best movie of his career. Moore interviews several Americans who have health insurance and yet they find no ease as the companies are constantly denying people in order to save their company money. One after another we hear a wide range of stories dealing with the downside of health care and this includes several people who had to die simply because the insurance companies wouldn't pay for medicine, a trip to a hospital or just some basic care. To make his point, Moore also travels to various places like Britian, Canada, France and even Cuba to show how much the government takes care of people by making sure everyone has insurance and that no one is denied no matter what. No matter what feel about Moore there's no question that this is a very good documentary taking a look at the problems with health care. Yes, as with many of his films this one here features some questionable stuff and I'd say that it also overlooks any good story about the American health system but these don't take away from anything. The main purpose is to show that the health system is a complete fraud in America and there's really no excuse for it. There's a sequence where people are thrown out of hospitals, put into cabs and dropped off simply because they don't have money. Even worse are people who helped at Ground Zero after 9/11, including firefighters and cops, who were refused medical treatment. Needless to say, this is certainly the type of documentary that is going to make you angry and it really should. Moore doesn't go on the attack as much as previous films but he does tell the human side of the stories and this is why he gets so much out of the material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore delivers once again, as usual, an important message which should be seen by every American. Moore travels the world for comparisons and finds much better coverage for the citizens elsewhere. In England, everyone is covered by a comprehensive system which was determined to be the right of every Brit starting shortly after World War 2. National health also works well in Canada, where as in England and France, all are covered. Here in the United States, about 50 million people are not covered. The drug and insurance companies run the system through lobbyists who write the laws. This needs to be changed. Hopefully, enough people will see Sicko to make a difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About The U.S. Healthcare System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After exploring the predominance of violence in American culture in Bowling for Columbine and taking a critical look at the September 11th attacks in Fahrenheit 9/11, activist filmmaker Michael Moore turns his attentions toward the topic of health care in the United States in this documentary that weighs the plight of the uninsured (and the insured who must deal with abuse from insurance companies) against the record- breaking profits of the pharmaceutical industry in this documentary,Sicko.It investigates health care in the United States, focusing on its health insurance and the pharmaceutical industry. The movie compares the for-profit, non-universal U.S. system with the non- profit universal health care systems of Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Cuba.According to Sicko, almost fifty million Americans are uninsured while the remainder, who are covered, are often victims of insurance company fraud and red tape. Interviews are conducted with people who thought they had adequate coverage but were denied care. Former employees of insurance companies describe cost-cutting initiatives that give bonuses to insurance company physicians and others to find reasons for the company to avoid meeting the cost of medically necessary treatments for policy holders, and thus increase company profitability.Moore interviews a number of people who have been left broke by medical bills even though they were fully insured, and explains how the corporate drive for profits has left numerous people in financial and medical disarray. After hearing that detainees in Guantanamo have access to free health care, Moore assembles a group of World Trade Center rescue workers to travel to Cuba in order to get the medical help they need for ailments they incurred in 2001.Driven by Michael Moore's sincere humanism, Sicko is a devastating, convincing, and very entertaining documentary about the state of America's health care system.It should serve as an eye-opener and one should not deter anyone from seeing it or giving some credence to what Moore is saying because what he is talking about is very real and very important.One must realize that this is a very important issue that every American is currently facing and it would be hard put to dispute the basic argument of his new film: The American health-care system is a sick joke and has been for a very long time.And worst,Obamacare won't solve many issues that the health care system is currently facing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the original title was phonetically used as the Japanese title as it is, the film was not often welcomed regardless of good or bad. "Sicko" is a slang used as psychopath or weirdos. It is a documentary film directed by Michael Moore, an advocacy journalist, who reveals the dark side of the healthcare system in the US.From the beginning of the story, some hurting stories that people cannot join the medical support are introduced - who cannot pay for the medical bills and he stitches up a cut by himself. The guy who cuts his two fingers off in an accident was told from a hospital with 60,000 US dollars for his cutting long finger, and with 12,000 US dollars for his fourth finger to put them back. A family had to sell their house as they cannot afford to pay the extraordinary medical fees.When seeing them, however, they don't look the poor people and it looks they can live their lives without big problem in life unless they don't sick nor have illness. Why they can't buy an insurance? why they can't take fully support in the hour of danger? As Michael Moore investigates in detail to reveal the American ripe medical system. It came to light the fact that how hospitals and insurance companies manage to obtain money greedily and how they try to decline insurance taking all possible steps once the subscribers are injured or affected by a disease.After watching this film, you may feel to live in England, France or Canada where the medical systems work for the nations, compared to one in the US. Because no one can predict what will happen, I want to live a country where the medical system and insurance institution are decent, considering of the future.It's been passed 4 years after the release. I wonder if the system has been changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the health care debate rages in America over universal health care I find myself enraged. Enraged at a lot of things but the one thing that really bothers me is seeing all these stupid (sorry for using that word) people at the town hall meetings screaming and yelling against having a universal system of health care. Why? I think Mr. Moore said it best towards the end of Sicko when he said we need to get out of this way of thinking of "ME" and start thinking of "WE." These people are crazy. It makes sense to have a national system of health care. A healthy nation would make a better nation. They are all scared of the high cost of national health care but don't seem to bat an eye when the Government spends billions of their tax dollars on a war in Iraq. In the long run we would save money if we had universal health care because it would mean less trips to the doctor and emergency rooms. I am so tired of this "I don't want my tax money paying for some dead beat who does not pull his weight..." attitude. All of our so called public servants in this so called best nation in the world have some of the best health care in the country, so why would they not want it for the rest of us. Why would not anyone not want it. I wonder how many of these town hall meeting screamers have no health care. Mr. Moore shows in his film how this system works in Canada, France and England. It just frustrated me when I was watching this film and the privileges these people have that we do not enjoy here. A nation can claim to be the best in the world by how it treats its people. I would say that after watching Sicko that France, Canada and Great Brittan treat their people much better than we do our own. In America if it does not have a dollar sign on it, than no one wants to help.We are not the best nation in the world but rather the most shellfish...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is probably the greatest horror film maker in the world today. He doesn't create terrifying villains or frightening locations ? he just tells true stories. But these are not ghost stories or sightings of UFOs, but everyday stories of everyday happenings. What happens when people get sick, and the health care they receive, as Moore paints a horrific picture of the injustice of health care in America.Sicko is basically just a collection of stories about the horrendous inadequacies of the American health service and how people have been severely mistreated in light of their lack of insurance and the health companies' desire to save money above all else. As an Englishman, it certainly makes me terrified of the thought of getting injured in America. Michael Moore then goes on to compare the overwhelming injustice of the American system with those of Canada, Britain, France and Cuba ? and the USA compares less than favourably with all of these, even with it's communist rival to the south. Further, there is some pretty damning evidence produced by showing testimonies from HMO workers and even footage of President Nixon, all tarring the American health service.However, the picture painted of Britain's NHS is certainly rather rose-tinted (no mention of waiting lists or hospital superbugs etc), and makes me wonder what Moore is not telling about the other countries' health services. In addition, while the incredible stories of unfairness and hardship told by the American public will leave you open-mouthed, shaking your head (and fist), something does not feel quite right, and rather forced or artificial somehow. Now no doubt all the stories are true, but there are no real figures given along with the facts to indicate how widespread these occurrences are ? all we know is that about 25000 people emailed Moore to complain about America's health service. Surely this is not an accurate representation of the whole population of America ? some 250,000,000 or so? Further, the attacks on 'Dubya' and the seemingly selfish capitalist tendencies of government bigwigs come off as somewhat of a vendetta ? a feeling heightened having already seen 'Bowling for Columbine' and 'Fahrenheit 9/11' produced by Moore in the past.But then again, even if the stories are only from a small percentage of the population, the injustice still greatly rankles and shocks, and at the end of the day this is exactly what Michael Moore set out to do, so as a film, mission accomplished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Neo Reviews: Sicko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tagline: Michael Moore is still the master of documentary? Review by Neo: Like him or hate him, there is no question that Michael Moore knows how to entertain his audience. Even though half the time, Moore is simply reinforcing the obvious, there is no doubting that he is a film maker. While this flick is less controversial than his award winning debut in Bowling for Columbine, Sicko continues Moore's lines of entertaining films which highlight an obvious issue in America. Perhaps, Moore is bias, but who isn't and that's not to say Neo is agreeing with the filmmaker. After all, everyone is entitled to his or her opinion and there is no doubt, Moore is manipulating the audience to side with him. In a critical manner, one can easily say that Moore only show one side of American insurance and seems to ignore any thing that shreds even the slightest light of the industry. As the saying goes, everything is happening for a reason and while on surface, the insurance companies seems to be just aiming for profit making , it is ultimately the fault of the people in power.It is almost stating the obvious when Neo begins to quote a famous line from somewhere, "power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely." It is human nature to be self fish and when people in power give away a certain power to some other people. It is quite frankly obvious that there is a certain chance that they will misuse that power. In the eyes of the dog eat dog corporate world, the reasoning of making more and more money is seemingly ethical, but at what cause? For Neo, his honest opinion is that the problem ultimately lies in the government as the fundamentally reasoning of having a system of government is to serve the people and for the people. If they decide to give away the insurance industry to some minded people whose eyes are only on the stock market, it doesn't take a genius to work out that there is bound to be trouble.Then again, it goes back to the quote, "one man's utopia, is another dystopia?" where the saying maybe an inch too pessimistic, it actually rings quite true. Perhaps, the idea of insurance company for the chief executive is his utopia of money making and the means meeting the ends. The same cannot be applied to someone who has just been denied that surgery due to some weird and unaccommodating reason provided by the insurance company. Their utopia is without doubt a hell of a difference. Likewise, in Sicko, Moore shown visions of what other countries are able to do. The problem lies in the fact that Moore seems to suggest that everything is great and everything is in order. It is difficult to believe in a perfect health system. In Australia, the film never mentions it, thus only comparing the best with the worst.Neo is not disclaiming anything Moore makes is just yet another manipulating and anti-American propaganda. Then again, it is not Moore's fault for being bias as it is human nature to desire for one thing and ultimately it is his own perspective. It is obvious that the American insurance system is bad, but the real question is that ? is it really that BAD? Why Moore didn't show the opinions of those who favours the insurance? Why didn't Moore show even the slight of bad points of the perfect system in Canada or say France? Neo is sure that system might be a utopia for Moore's world, but a dystopia to those sitting next to him. Truthfully, the current reviewer cannot believe in such undaunted system, until he personally experiences it himself. Up until he experiences it himself, Neo's opinion remains reserved. As for Sicko being a good film, there is no question that nobody makes a better Hollywood documentary than Moore, himself? (Neo 2008) I rate it 7.75/10- www.thehkneo.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a comment for the above author, i find it very ironic that you hail from Denmark. I have just about decided to move to Dk before viewing this film and afterwords i wonder if there should be any question. I wanted to see some reviews and this was the first i found! ha ha. anyway for the film.This movie expressed a lot of ideas I've been dealing with in the past six months. I am a recent graduate and at the age of 18 i am having a hard time dealing with the way our "system" works. This film is undeniable and as far as I'm concerned, free of any possible disputes. Moore's films in the past sometimes went a little over the top to express a point. This film sticks to a subject that isn't simply an opinion on the president, or conspiracy theories, its an exhibit of the seemingly unavoidable flaws in our society. This movie almost made me cry at times, and i had a pretty good idea of the kind of stuff our government is up to. To those that live comfortably within their ignorance, i would not suggest viewing this. Get out while you still can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I begin? Probably best to declare as a UK citizen I have only experienced the NHS, though I have been to the US thank goodness I never had need of medical treatment there. Secondly I am not a rabid Michael Moore fan, in my view is track record on film and TV is mixed. I thought "Sicko" was a good, eye-opening documentary which was frankly hard to enjoy, but I suppose for an American audience that is the point. I do have family both "blood" and in-laws in the US and I knew from them that the cost of health insurance was both crippling and also the nature of care provided is not always perfect...I think that I can guarantee no country has an ideal system. Yet watching this film made me thank God I live where I do. That scene where a bewildered patient is kicked out of a hospital only to be dumped on to the street was frankly beyond belief to me. Yes there was an inaccuracy about people in the UK who pay for prescription medicine, and there was not a full explanation of the French system which is different from ours, but broadly speaking the NHS was portrayed in financial terms factually. No-one is turned away for treatment, cash is paid out for travel if you are below a certain income and GP's are paid pretty handsomely. I read one UK reviewer complaining bitterly about MRSA. Is that unheard of in the US? NO. Also the 'postcode lottery.' Well my cancer ridden cousin from New York was told by her Insurance provider she was forbidden to see any doctor they did not choose. How would you like that? Ultimately this film was not made for me, it was made for Americans and only you can decide what a horrendous system you have to put up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko Jolting But The Math Doesn't Add Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even as an American with an English wife and living 19 years in France, I was intrigued by the depth of Sicko. My 3-nation observation.*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Sicko is a great documentary, very much worth the watch. Painful and heart breaking for a nation. What bothered me was the math. It doesn't add up. Navigating health insurance in America is treacherous. True. Health insurance is expensive and denies claims easily. True. The poor thus are not cared for. False. Immigrants and the destitute are covered, of course costing the hospitals a fortune.The NHS in England is free of charge. True. Prescription drugs cost almost nothing. True. The system works. False. As in France, the NHS in England is bankrupt. The English NHS is accessible. False. The English system has waits of sometimes 3-9 months. Doesn't add up quite as Moore says. France has it better. France has immediate medical attention, your doctor of choice, cheap, almost free, but bankrupt. Paid for by huge taxation, a taxation that makes gas cost $8 a gallon, etc. Moore's first 40 minutes roll off in a wonderfully clarifying manner. But then it gets bogged down into politics of the right and the left, "riding onto the scene as a health care messianic medical horseman."Moore's strong suit is that he is a warm guy, walking with us into discovery. But watch out for the math. He left out the cost of debilitating law suits in the USA, which don't exist in France and hardly exist in Canada or in England. Part of the cost of insurance, research and billing must include the cost of law suits, unless things change. The math matters as well as the shocking images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done but completely biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously this movie was very well done in order to achieve its goal. However, would someone care if the facts are true? I cannot say how good or bad the US health care system is even if I have lots of friends living in US and some of them being doctors and what I know from them is far from being as things are depicted in this movie. But I know very well how things are in Canada and a pretty good idea how they are in Cuba and I have to say that regarding these 2 countries Moore completely mystified the reality. In Canada things might be OK as long as you don't need to go to Emergency or you don't suffer of cancer or other life threatening illnesses. For instance if you go to Emergency over night (to a large hospital in Toronto) you have best chances not to see any doctor until morning comes. Even if you are during the day, it will take a minimum of 2 hours to see someone (who will assess if it is an emergency or not). If you are suspected by cancer or something else and need an MRI or CAT scan you will have to wait at least 3-4 months to do one. If you need appointment with a specialist you need to wait for months too. For cancer surgery you have to wait even longer. For cancer suspected patients, summing-up all these waiting times it would take up to 2 years until they will go for surgery but the problem is that within this time they may die or their cancer becomes inoperable. Even if you want to pay for these procedures you cannot do it. So many such patients who can afford it, chose to go to US where they pay and do the tests within the same day (i.e. why I did not appreciate at all the "joke" with the US cancer patient coming to Canada to cure her disease). Regarding Cuban health care system, as one who leaved in a Communist country all I can say is that is laughable at best. First of all you cannot make a movie in a Communist country without being authorized and you can film only approved places. What they filmed was for sure the clinic dedicated to Cuban Nomenklatura. All other hospitals, for ordinary people are like this: you need to find and bring your own drugs, food and you have to tip doctors and nurses. Even if you do this, you will not be able to bring the equipment they miss. I would never wish someone to end-up in a Cuban ordinary hospital - I guarantee it will be a nightmare. However, I don't deny they don't have good doctors the problem is that a good doctor without proper equipment and drugs is powerless. Why should I really believe what he said about the other country health systems if in these 2 cases he was just lying? So this is a good movie as long as you realize is a fantasy. But if it is a science-fiction movie, can it still be called documentary?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I have to say is wow! What an eye-opening experience. It was amazing to see the benefits and drawbacks of a government run health care plan! If only this film had received more attention, perhaps the health care topic in the debate would be easily decided. I was amazed at the quality of life shown in other countries which instill a government run health care plan. Provided that it is implemented in the correct way, I feel that Americans could surely benefit from a similar program. Health care costs are a top reason for citizen bankruptcy, and if some of those costs were eliminated, not only would stress be reduced, but also people would have more funds to return to our flailing economy. Why not give it a shot? Great job Michael... very well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were to describe my political affiliations I would probably avoid using the word 'Liberal'. Moore's 'SiCKO', or just plain 'Sicko' in some regions, is in unashamedly shallow and biased piece of 'liberal propaganda'. But so what? A finely balanced, meticulously researched argument, delivered in a not partisan way by a drab man in a grey suit would not be half as entertaining as this is; However there are some pretty blatant flaws in the movie which for me where most obvious in Moore's glowing portrayal of the British NHS and the French healthcare system and that nations wider social model.Firstly on his visit to London, England and particularly Hammersmith Hospital, Moore waxes lyrical at the "free" healthcare the patients receive. Now, I'm very proud of the NHS, I think its fantastic, but Moore never mentions the hundreds of thousands of people who needlessly die because of poor hygiene standards in the NHS or any of the other serious issues that our system is faced with.Also Moore meets a doctor who earns in excess of ?100,000 a year and Moore seems to present this as a good thing. Considering that the average wage in this country is around ?17,000 a year it's obscene to pay doctors (with tax payers money) such a large amount for working in a system that lets them do less hours and be paid more. Yes, they should receive a decent wage that is well above the national average, but that doesn't mean we should make them millionaires by the time they reach 45.The most interesting part of this segment of the movie for me was listening to Tony Benn talk succinctly and with great passion about the principles on which our system of universal healthcare was founded (again not a hint of the problems it faces).On his trip to Paris, France Moore shows us new mothers with their government sponsored home helps and a group of American ex-pats praising the French social model, yet there is not mention of the failing economy that it is paying for these initiatives. In his romanticised vision of French society there is no hint at the high levels of unemployment or widespread race riots that have gripped the country in recent years... just lots of shots of wine drinking Frenchman and their beautiful bedfellows. Isn't France great? Yes Michael, it really is.This is not a well balanced movie, and it doesn't claim to be, but Moore's expose of the American health care system is as times both shocking and moving and it elicits more than a hint of disgust as we listen to testimonies from wives and mothers who have needlessly lost husbands and children because the healthcare companies do everything they can not to pay out when something goes wrong.Even though some of the figures don't add up and the argument lacks depth the message of the movie is a valuable one; societies are not built, and do not flourish on the strength of individuals but rather how we treat each other.The movie grips throughout, the testimonies at times bring a tear to the eye and the images of destitute and disorientated patients being dumped on the sidewalk by hospitals that are supposed to be caring for them will live long in the memory.It's a shame then that 'SiCKO' ends with a gimmicky trip to Cuba where 911 rescue workers (suffering from such ailments as ground down teeth) receive medial care from the pleasant people at Havana Hospital. Overall though it's hard not to recommend the movie and I feel like those who criticise its shortcomings are kind of missing the point; people are dying to maximise profit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have good health insurance and do not worry that I will be treated for any illness that I have. Why is that not the same for every American? The fact that we treat the prisoners in Gitmo better than we treat the heroes of 9/11 says it all. We should be ashamed.The tour of the Canadian, British, French, and Cuban system is shocking to those who think that we have it better. The statistics on infant mortality and longevity show that we do not have the best system of health care in the world - far from it."If we can find money to kill people, you can find money to help people." It is not a matter of not having the money, it is that the rich want to have it all. Keeping people in debt and afraid of losing what little care they have makes it easier for American businesses."An educated, healthy and confident nation is harder to govern." We do not have a democracy, because a democracy would not put up with this system."They think of 'we first,' not 'me first'." This is what it is all about. The countries mentioned believe that they have an obligation to care for their fellow citizens. Isn't that funny? The most so-called Christian nation in the world doesn't even follow a basic commandment given to us by Christ himself - when I was hungry, you gave me to eat; when I was naked, you clothed me:...When I was sick, you gave me the care that I needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far and away his best movie - although I was blown away by 'Roger and Me' many years ago. A lot of the information in Sicko was obvious, and some was very transparently biased and one-sided. Moore chooses to interview those that agree with his message with no statistics or attempts at fairness ? but he must certainly realize that. Moore is not trying to be fair. He hates Bush. His goal is to present one side of an argument ? and why not? It's a good argument, and parts of this movie are really well done. His visits to Canada, Britain, and France ? especially France ? were very good. Moore's purpose is to show that these countries have better health care systems than the US, but he does a lot more than that. He presents the opinion that average people in Europe have less debt, work less, travel way more, live longer and are generally happier than Americans. This happens because their government effectively takes money from the rich and redistributes it. The French not only have free health care. They have free day care, college education, two years maternity leave, five weeks holiday minimum, a thirty-five hour work week, and unlimited sick days (if you're sick you're sick :) To us this seems ridiculous. How, in such a system, can we separate the hard working people form the slackers. To the French our work hours and required expenses are ridiculous. Their average 35-hours x 40-weeks a year is productive. Hard work (within that timeframe) is rewarded. But it's just work. And their society has decided that even slackers deserve free health care and other basic human needs ? like a month and a half of 'formal' rest. If you disagree? ask yourself this: How many lives do you get to live? But how do the French get their government to take from the rich and redistribute?. hmmm. Doesn't that pretty much define democracy? Power out of the hands of the elite and into the hands of the average person. Moore asks an old British politician what would happen if Tony Blair decided to take away National Health Care, the man smiles and responds with: "We would have a revolution". Their government is afraid of the masses (not vice versa). Every citizen is a shareholder ? and they demand benefits.I am Canadian but I believe that I am very pro-American. I have never known one that I disliked. But their politics are tragic. The power and the money is all tangled up and the average struggling person has been made helpless by a mass lack of knowledge. And every government has its own issues. No system is perfect - Italy and Spain are hilarious to read about - but to assume that Canada or the US has it right or that every democracy is identical is ignorant. Doesn't the North American government 'help yourself' attitude makes elections pretty much pointless? France is obviously more socialist, with higher taxes and more government services, but it is far from communist. You might insult a Polish person who is clad to be free of communism if you treat it so lightly - commies don't have elections. American libraries and police stations are as socialist as any other socialist thing. Americans take free library books and fire-fighting for granted ? the French feel the same way about free college, a free house call from a doctor, and many more things.But how much can a government afford to do? Here's some silly hand waving math - prove me wrong. I think that the $40 billion yearly military budget of the US is enough money to buy every single American who turns 16 in that same year ? a new car. And if you think that's just plain stupid ? what if I make each one a Chevy ? and see what it does to the US economy. Or a Chevy-hybrid if you're concerned about the weather.I apologise for getting off track. Moore's movie is awesome.jmagzy@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore delivers another powerful documentary tantamount to the emotion of Bowling for Columbine. Moore's investigation into the United States health care system reveals hard truths of capitalist societies, and the governmental propaganda and arrogance towards socialist ideals. It compares the United States to semi-socialist states - and demonstrates the overt discrepancies within the United States system and the incessant drive for profit. Using archival footage and Guantanamo bay for leverage, Moore successfully renders an accurate insight into the underpinnings of HMO, and the limited value of human life.It triggers numerous emotional chords, ranging from humor, depression and pity.I recommend this movie for anyone who's interested education, politics or sheer humanity. If you've never been dubious of the United States, then this film will change your position.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko is Socko!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his latest documentary, Sicko, controversial director Michael Moore is up to his old tricks: use of rapier comic thrusts to make a point, anecdotal support rather than statistical, feigned innocence, and good old fashioned showmanship. If the issues weren't as serious, the film might be dismissed as another example of "wretched excess". Given the state of the American health care system, however, quibbling about Michael Moore's shortcomings as a filmmaker seems to be somewhat not the point. The main premise of Sicko is dead-on accurate ? the American health care system and the profit mentality it reflects are flawed, tragically flawed, and in need, not only of stop-gap repairs but of major overhaul.Moore is not as in your face personally in Sicko but the broken system is. The film is not only about the 50 million Americans who cannot afford health care but those who have it and have been jobbed by the system. We see a man with severed fingers having to choose between spending $60,000 to repair his middle finger or $12,000 to reconnect his ring finger, a Hobson's choice if there ever was one. If Moore's technique can be compared to Barnum and Bailey, then the people who have been denied insurance for frivolous reasons who come before the camera to tell their stories are Moore's chamber of horrors.A woman, unconscious when discovered, cannot recover the cost of an ambulance ride to the hospital because the trip was not "pre-authorized"; a man is refused coverage for a bone marrow transplant because the procedure is "experimental" regardless of the fact that the treatment could save his life; a family with six children who paid into the system all their lives are financially devastated when he has a heart attack and she develops cancer and must move into a crowded basement room in their daughter's home. Moore does not hesitate to tell us that HMOs profit margin is based not on the number of patients they successfully treat but on those who are denied and former insurance claims executives confess their culpability in the cruel denial process.As to how this got started, Moore lays the blame on Nixon and Erlichman, two easy scapegoats, while ignoring the role played by the labor movement and FDR in refusing to buck the medical establishment and the insurance companies many years before. Moore is on less than solid ground when he paints an idyllic picture of universal health care as practiced in Canada, England, France, and especially Cuba where one patient is able to buy an inhaler she pays $240 a month for in the States for five cents, another patient gets free dental implants, and another receives an MRI which correctly diagnoses a misdiagnosed problem. However, even from the limited evidence we are shown, it is clear that we have not been told the whole truth about the bogeyman known as "socialized medicine".While it is not as Utopian as pictured in the film, having lived under both private and government-sponsored health care in the U.S. and Canada, on balance, I would not hesitate to choose the Canadian system. Both my wife and brother-in-law were diagnosed with cancer this year and both had to undergo surgery. My brother-in-law, living in California, had some of the best pension insurance available, yet still had to pay $40,000 while my wife only had to pay for parking. Are there waiting lists? To be sure but the absence of wait lists is not worth $40,000 (there are waits in the States as well). The truth is that my brother-in-law could afford his share of the cost, but there are others who are in desperate need, cannot afford it, and are often refused treatment.Indeed, Moore shows us how a woman with broken ribs was put in a taxi and dumped, disoriented, in front of a rescue mission in a seedy part of town. Yes, there's a lot of grandstanding in Sicko but, if nothing else, it will stimulate people to discuss the issue and, if it can change an unjust system, Mr. Moore, for all his problems, will have made a major contribution. I for one would have liked more balance but Moore's films are not about balance but about passionate muckraking for worthwhile causes, in this case a simple one -- a society based on compassion. If one is less than thrilled with his techniques, show me another filmmaker who is making a stronger impact in the world.</fullReview>

Why isn't anonymous picketing HMO's?""Just watched SickO by MM. Lived in France for five years so nothing I didn't know. A circle of Ignorance and arrogance if you ask me.

		<shortDescription>HMOs and the health mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For better, or worse, Michael Moore, is the "enfant terrible" of the American documentary. "Sicko", his latest effort, presents his views on a terrible, and sad, phase of this country's health care. Mr. Moore's role has always been to provoke, in order to awake people to pay attention of his latest crusade. As such, "Sicko", is part fact and part entertainment.One of the most effective part of the documentary is the conversation between Richard Nixon, the then president who is partly responsible for the mess this country is in matters of health care, and his aide John Ehrliman as they discuss the problem. Another great moment arrives when a witty Hillary Rodham Clinton is about to be grilled by Dick Armey in Congress at the height of the Clinton health plan. She outsmarts this once powerful man with her wit and dry sense of humor.In a way, one has been told about the problem with the health systems in different countries, Canada, being the best example. In order to dispel fears, Mr. Moore embarks in a journey to explore the myth and the result seems to he in his favor. Other countries are examined as well, England, and France, countries where if one is to believe the people interviewed, seem to have excellent health plans deal that give people a handle on this important problem. These systems aren't inexpensive. To keep these plans alive, the European societies are heavily taxed to cover the free medical coverage.The most fun in the film involves the Cuban episode, where Mr. Moore decides to take a few people with medical problems to Guantanamo naval base, where if one hears the Washington politicians, the so-called terrorists are treated much better than regular American citizens. After not being admitted in the base, Mr. Moore must find a ride to Havana to bring his patients for treatment for their different ailments. Of course, this sequence is not real because we know of people with Cuban relatives who must send medicines to Cuba because of the lack of it in the island, despite of what is given freely to these visitors Mr. Moore brings to the biggest hospital in Havana. That's the most unrealistic part of the film, as far as we are concerned.Having had the experience of being hospitalized and incurring the high price for the care received, seems almost an indecent price one has to pay in order to be well in America. The documentary ends in a funny note as we watch Mr. Moore climbing the steps of the capitol to bring his dirty laundry for the congress to clean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Canadian view on "Sicko"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well Michael Moore, Love him or hate him is this time RIGHT ON THE MONEY, my American friends. Speaking as a Canadian I have always been appalled at the US Healthcare system. I for one would never visit the US without health insurance. This is yet another point that Michael doesn't bring up PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE US DON'T WANT TO VISIT THE US IN THE OFFCHANCE THEY GET SICK OR HAVE AN ACCIDENT. I can't believe you drop patients off at the side of street corners! That is absolutely abhorrent! Granted the Canadian system is not perfect (wait times, etc). But that is because politicians up here cut the funding and they had to close down hospitals! I live in Calgary, Alberta and the provincial government radically cut funding to health care forcing hospital closures and long wait times. Then our population in the city ballooned from 600,000 to over 1 million in the space of a couple of years, due to our booming economy. Imagine the problems we have had due to this. However even with these problems we would never kick people to the curb who didn't have coverage! I also thought I would NEVER see the day that the Canadian Dollar surpassed the US Dollar, but it has. Your economy is going down the drain my friends, thanks in most part to Mr Bush. You can thank him for playing "Toy Soldier" in Iraq while his own economy is going down the drain at home, not unlike the company his ran into the ground years back, the one that was given to him. Funny, how history always repeats itself. Even our most conservative politicians would not support him on the war and Alberta is a conservative bastion. The only reason France is criticized is because they wouldn't support the war, NO OTHER REASON and you cannot deny this.I have to give Michael Moore top ratings on this film. He has been noted to embellish and distort in the past but the facts of this film are so undeniable that they cannot be dismissed. I think the American populace is waking up and no longer accepting the baloney propaganda being thrown at them by Washington. Your remarks are welcomed.Best Wishes and Seasons Greetings.</fullReview>

I don't know why some Americans don't like Mr Moore, I know the truth hurts...but I don't think that the truth that helps you hurts that much...if I, a foreigner, would listen and do something, or at least watch, this movie, why do you Americans sit and do nothing?

		<fullReview>As I watched this documentary, I felt more and more happy and some what privileged to live OUTSIDE of America, more specific in Denmark. In Denmark we have a health care system, very similar to the British and French, where everyone is guaranteed treatment, and the whole system is run by government, payed by taxes. We have free education, and you even get payed to study. (I get payed round 1000 dollars a month, to study at Copenhagen University) I really felt sorry for my fellow human beings, who accidentally were born in America (this is putting it on the line, but I actually mean it..). A nation where the simple fact that you are a human being, is reason enough for you to be treated like one.. And not rejected medical treatment, because of lack of finances. It is such a natural part of my life, and my concept of how life should be, that everyone deserves free medical care.Another thing that stroke me during the movie, was that I just knew how the most stubborn, so-called patriotic Americans would react. "He is lying!" "You cant trust Cubans!" "The french are just lying to us!" And surely, as I read other comments on IMDb, people are furious with the fact that Moore went to Cuba and France, and actually found out that IT Wasn't THAT BAD!! To cut it out for you, one could say, that what Cubans lack in for example TV networks, and malls, and what not, they have in medical treatment.. A lot of bad things can be said about Fidel Castro, he is not a saint, but a fact is that Cuba has the highest amount of Doctors, compared to number of citizens, and this is because he believes in a healthy people, Whereas the American government always he believed in a wealthy country, FOR THE WEALTHY! I'm sorry.. i got carried away, but truth be told: I AM A LUCKY SON OF A BITCH, NOT LIVING IN America, BUT IN EUROPE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my work as a professor, I have studied the health-care system and know something about health economics. Although I favor universal (and single-payer) health care for the U.S., I was dreading seeing this film, because I feared that it would be irresponsible and would distort the facts. It did neither, at least not in any major way. Mostly it presented cases of people who got the raw end of the U.S. system, and it compared how these people were treated in the U.S. with how similar people were treated in other countries, such as Canada, the U.K. France, and Cuba. The mere existence of 911 rescue workers from New York, acknowledged to be true heroes, not getting care for the serious health consequences of their heroism, is shocking. Statistics almost don't matter. (That said, I do think that some of the statistics were presented without necessary qualifications, but they just weren't an important part of the movie.) This sort of abuse should just not happen at all. Same for many other cases.I gave the movie a 10 as a movie. It was impressive how Moore put this all together, including a trip to Cuba. This guy is amazing at getting things done. I can think of a lot of institutions that could use his talents, but they are well used here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people have a strong dislike of Michael Moore. Even though I believe in what he does, I see why people feel that way; it's easy to get heated about something you believe so much in. What I like best about this documentary is the fact that it isn't based on how bad a president sucks or things along those lines. Moore really took the time to give you the opinions of different people from different countries and the personal stories of some fellow Americans. Obviously there are two sides to every story but his presentation of this side is so wonderful. It goes deep, makes you think, makes you laugh, makes you want to cry... no matter your feelings towards him or your political party, this is a must see. Even if you leave still hating him, at least you had the opportunity to open your mind for two hours.Personally, I hope something changes. I made me embarrassed and sad that 9/11 workers got help in Cuba, a country that "hates us". I beg someone in Washington DC wakes up and helps fix this problem.</fullReview>

You might feel the need to research one specific issue yet the movie stands as a conclusion in itself: the medical system in the US is targeted towards profitability whereas Health should not be a business.

He offers facts and statistics to back up his contention that Americans pay too much for what healthcare they have (or THINK they have)...and the health insurance industry is fleecing us out of billions of dollars that often end up in the pockets of departing CEOs, rather than being used to improve their "product".Tangentially, Moore brings up facts that ought to make us question the ethics of making huge profits out of other people's misery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sicko is the latest documentary from filmmaker Michael Moore which examines the problem that is the American health care system as we hear many stories from average American citizens who could not afford medications and/or surgeries and what ends up happening to them. Moore tackles these issues with facts and statistics while also showing how health care is different and a lot better in different countries such as France. There are enough people who do not like Michael Moore or his films calling them unpatriotic and basically just a crock. I however have always loved Michael Moore's documentaries and they always end up being one of my favourite films of the year in the year they are released. In this new film Moore brings us a lot of very devastating stories from people and their issues with health care which makes for really compelling viewing. When he starts getting into the facts and statistics that is also very interesting and to top it all off Moore manages to add humour, sadness, truth and in the end making a powerful, thought provoking and entertaining documentary. I myself think Moore is a really good guy with his heart in the right place and I do not think he hates America at all. I think his main goal is to change things with the country to make it better and to further bring the viewer's attention to these issues to reinforce his goals of a positive change in America. Sicko is one of the most powerful films of the year because of the stories and people that we see in the film and how drastically things need to change in the states, so everyone will be able to live a healthier life. The fact that everything we see is real further makes this more heart wrenching and powerful. Some have also accused Moore of trying to further embellish the truth and make these people sound worse off than they really are. I don't believe that for a second. I think these people are just average human beings trying to tell their story to better themselves and the country and if this causes some people to be sad or disturbed than so be it. I personally find the more powerful a message that is coming across the more I think about it and the more effect it has on me and I would guess that would be the case for most people as well. Sicko is a great piece of documentary film-making that is interesting as well as intriguing and sad and full of Moore's trademark humour and as any good documentary filmmaker should do, Moore makes the subject interesting and accessible to all who will watch it. Sicko is one of the most thought provoking, powerful and genuinely interesting movies to come out this year and also one of my favourite films of the year so far. I hope that the health care companies and the American government will see this film, so that in my lifetime there will be a change to the health care system and so that this generation will end up being okay and that things will be a lot better for our future generations as well. Sicko is a great film with a great message and great ideas and I hope people see it and I thank Michael Moore for trying to make a positive change in this world. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Ignites a Sharp Exposé of the Dysfunctional U.S. Health Care Industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret what a travesty privatized health care has become in this country, but leave it to political firebrand and social provocateur Michael Moore to present our dismal situation with his unique combination of passion and insouciance in this compelling 2007 documentary. Coupled with his innate showmanship, his dexterity in making his viewpoint seem like the logical one is what makes his films resonate in ways that make more fair-minded filmmakers pallid by comparison. This time, his target is almost too easy, that the entire health care industry needs to be overhauled. In order to prepare for his film, Moore made an open online plea to Americans to share their own health-care horror stories, and in turn, he received over 25,000 e-mails.The film's first half dives into the most egregious cases of those who paid their insurance premiums to feel secure about their medical coverage only to discover that their insurance companies abandon them when they needed them the most. Several of these accounts are inevitably heartbreaking, and Moore is wise to let those victimized by the system speak for themselves without his prodding. The capper is the 1996 Congressional testimony of Dr. Linda Peeno, a former medical examiner for Humana, who confesses that her top priority was to save the company money and how in turn, the company rewarded bonuses to examiners who denied the most number of claims. The second half shows Moore in more familiar form as he acerbically visits Canada, Great Britain, France, and Cuba, all countries where free health care is freely available.The international section is where Moore makes his most pointed jabs in showing how socialized medicine has worked almost too effortlessly elsewhere. Although he does not divulge the substantial amount of government funding needed to subsidize these programs, Moore successfully makes the intentional oversight beside the point, as these nations simply emphasize how dysfunctional our HMO system has become. Former Member of Parliament Tony Benn is particularly insightful in explaining the rationale behind free medical care in the U.K. and how it was borne out of the ongoing bombings going on during WWII. The most interesting and controversial sequence is when Moore takes a group of perpetually ill 9/11 volunteers by boat first to Guantanamo Bay to see if they can receive the same medical treatment being received by the terrorists imprisoned there and then to Havana to get the health care they have been denied in this country.The filmmaker somehow manages the precarious balance between funny and poignant throughout the film. He, however, is not without his self-aggrandizing moments, for example, in taking the occasional potshot at Bush, which while funny, is not terribly relevant here. What is pertinent is a taped conversation in 1971 between Nixon and his chief aide John Ehrlichman about passing legislation which would give birth to the current, profit-seeking concept of HMOs. Moore couldn't help himself by mentioning an anonymous $12,000 check to the Webmaster of an anti-Moore site, who could not afford his wife's mounting medical bills. Naturally, the anonymous donor was Moore. Regardless, he hits his valid points about the U.S. health care system hard and with both emotional precision and idiosyncratic finesse. For that alone, this film is essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a film close to the truth, which I had found in my life. I lived 30 years in the U.S. and several years in foreign countries with socialized medicine. I recently moved to Europe again and am glad I have. Nonetheless, I was able to get a copy of the movie and I must say that he was being too kind! Europeans pay half as much overall for their health-care in Europe and it is sooo much better. I am sure its from the efficiency, not because they get less care. I feel much better treated by the doctors. In the U.S., so much time is spent on things related to the insurance companies and getting paid. It seems the doctors just rushed me and in fact, the U.S. leads the world in the number of misdiagnoses, I think cause they are too focused on the business aspect of it. Moore left that little fact out! I lost two relatives to misdiagnoses in America. Its funny, cause I sometimes hear Europeans complain about their health care and I even heard one say that the U.S. health-care system is so much better. When I hear their complaints, I have to laugh. They are so spoiled! They don't know how good they have it. But in general, the people who complain the most, get the better country. So, keep it up Moore, maybe people will learn to demand more from their government. Good luck U.S.!</fullReview>

If universal health care isn't the answer, then what is? Anything has got to be better than leaving it to corrupt and greedy insurance companies that really only care about profit. We've been conditioned in the U.S. to believe that taxes are bad and that high taxes are even worse. The loudest argument I've heard against universal health care is that it would raise taxes too high. A British politician talking about when universal health care was first instituted in England had a great quote in this movie that literally made the theater erupt in applause: If we can find the money to kill people, then we can find the money to heal people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the documentary SiCKO was very well done. Mr. Moore takes us down the road of the current status of what the medical care is in this country and other countries he travels to places like Canada, France, Great Britian, and lastly Cuba. His statistics are fairly accurate throughout the whole documentary (according to news reports that I have heard) that runs about 2 hours long and does a wonderful job of interviewing many people in this documentary so you have the opportunity to hear their views. This documentary is NOT ABOUT Mr. Moore but rather ABOUT the people that are affected by the medical care that they get or give in this country and abroad.I could not believe the number of 1 star ratings that are ahead of me. Their feedback is full of bias and hate towards Mr Moore calling everything he does propaganda thus their feedback is very opinionated and unintelligent. This is proved by the feedback on the readers of these posts (for example: 19 out of 136 people found the following comment useful) These people are just plain Michael Moore haters, period! Maybe these one star posters are from the medical insurance companies or from the right wingers but you can see all the readers feedback sending out a strong message to them here. Please keep an open mind people when posting feedback from a movie you have watched and give feedback pertaining to the movie and not your personal opinions on Michael Moore. I genuinely think Mr. Moore cares about what happens in this country and to the underprivileged and he has a constitutional right to express his opinions in whatever documentary he releases. Good for him. He is practicing capitalism with these documentary movies. You know, the thing that Americans love to do? I'm sure all of you one star voting people have had to deal with the health insurance companies at one point. I know I have.I'm not going to talk about this documentary too much because by the time you've gotten to my feedback here, I'm pretty sure you have a good idea of what this documentary is all about. I truly recommend that everyone see this, myself. It will put you through an emotional roller-coaster ride of how patients in the USA are treated and, or, denied medical care.Lastly, to critique, I think I Mr. Moore missed on a few very important issues.I am a 50 year old man and I pretty much know how the American medical care system worked before the HMO system was put into place and the status of where we are now. This is what Mr. Moore missed putting in his documentary or left out that would have made a big difference and here they are:1. Doctor abuse. When I was young, a teen-ager, I remember that doctors were abusing or charging the insurance companies for performing unnecessary procedures or charging for procedures that weren't performed. Add to that the over-prescribing of new and expensive medications and referrals to specialists that cost a lot of money. This was happening in large numbers by doctors all across this country. It was total blatant physician greed to make most dollars and it was getting WAY OUT OF HAND. As a result, the insurance companies profit margins were were getting eaten up by all these crazy medical bills. Medical insurance companies had to do something to combat their profit loss. So what they did was to pass this increase in cost to their policy holders causing employers to pay more then, eventually, making their employees pay a co-pay and contribute to annual deductibles. I remember this vividly. It was broad casted on the news all the time back then. This brought about the need for medical insurance companies to take control over these cheating, corrupt and greedy doctors. Thus the birth of HMO's (managed health care) came about like Kaiser Permanente and the like were put into place to control these outrageous doctor bills that insurance companies had to pay. Mr. Moore neglected to mention that fact. Now that medical insurance companies are now in charge of everything, the shift of blatant greed for money has gone from doctors to HMO's. 2. I would have liked to have seen a paycheck from an average middle class citizen in Canada, France, Great Britian and Cuba showing how much they have to pay in taxes towards this National Health Care system. He did not do that thus we don't have a picture of the costs involved per individual. 3. Lastly, I would have loved to see Mr. Moore interview the citizens those 4 countries on why they hate the National Health Care system so they can provide us two perspectives on a tax paid National Health Care system.With these three things missing, the documentary is sort of one-sided and doesn't give us two sides to the story. This is where Michael Moore fails and I hope he can learn from this omission. I gave this documentary 9 stars instead of 10 because of the 3 missing things I mentioned above.Even with the 3 missing things I mention, SiCKO hits its mark. Michael Moore is brilliant, successful and he cares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a great filmmaker, one of the best. When I see his movies I laugh, I cry, I am educated, I am outraged. My mother-in-law won't see his films because Fox News has convinced her that Michael Moore's films aren't "fair and balanced". This is nonsense. Both CNN and michaelmoore.com show the facts and their sources for this film and, of course, "balanced", like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.One of the many things I like about Michael Moore is that he and his staff are always digging up great information. In this film we learn that on February 17, 1971, Richard Nixon met with John Ehrlichman to discuss the Vice President's position on health maintenance organizations. The next day, Nixon called for a "new national health strategy" that had four points for expanding the proliferation of health maintenance organizations, or HMOs. Seeing Nixon's hand in the creation of the health care mess really puts the whole issue into perspective. Health care is a huge issue to tackle so I did some of my own research. Moore says that the U.S. spends more of its gross domestic product on health care than any other country. CNN confirms that's true. The United States spends more than 15 percent of its GDP on health care -- no other nation even comes close to that number. France spends about 11 percent, and Canadians spend 10 percent. As Michael Moore points out, more money does not equal better care. Both the French and Canadian systems rank in the Top 10 of the world's best health-care systems, according to the World Health Organization. The United States comes in at No. 37. The rankings are based on general health of the population, access, patient satisfaction and how the care's paid for.So, if Americans are paying so much and they're not getting as good or as much care, where is all the money going? "Overhead for most private health insurance plans range between 10 percent to 30 percent," says Deloitte health-care analyst Paul Keckley. Overhead includes profit and administrative costs. "Compare that to Medicare, which only has an overhead rate of 1 percent. Medicare is an extremely efficient health-care delivery system," says Mark Meaney, a health-care ethicist for the National Institute for Patient Rights. Moore never tells us this important information. With the purpose of debunking socialism, we are asked to think about government services like the fire department and the police department but most of us really aren't happy with the job the government does with schools (drop out rate around 25%), the post office (takes too long to mail a package), highways (too congested around every major city), the I.R.S. (taxes are way too complex). Congress has a current approval rating of just 14%--a point below the current approval rating of the H.M.O'.s 15%--so maybe we should have been told about how Medicare might be expanded rather than asked to think of the things the government already does that anger us.In U.S. medical schools, students training to become primary-care physicians have dwindled to only 10 percent. The overwhelming majority choose far more profitable specialties in the medical field. In other countries, more than one out of three aspiring doctors chooses primary care in part because there's less of an income gap with specialists. In those nations, becoming a specialist means making 30 percent more than a primary-care physician. In the United States, the gap is around 300 percent. Moore never tells us this and this is really important information. Why doesn't the U.S.A. have more primary-care physicians for the prevention of disease? Why are specialists in America able to make 300% more than general practitioners under the oversight of managed health care?Moore also doesn't touch on the mental health aspect of our health care problem but then I guess "Psycho" has already been made. He also doesn't say much about health-care in the United States military which is what I would guess is similar to the government plans he shows us in Canada, France and Cuba.As to style, in the documentary "Michael Moore Hates America", I learned that a film director is God unless the film is a documentary, then God is the director. Michael Moore has a point of view, and wants to be part of the solution, so he takes many liberties with this genre and acts more like the "Director God". However, I will give up the true documentary style for a movie with heart. As a man who once thought about becoming a Catholic priest, Moore works from the heart at the expense of satisfying my frontal lobe. "Sicko", as well as all his films, has heart. From the sounds coming from the audience we were very touched by his message.A great moment in the film is the interview with former British MP, Tony Benn. Most of it is already posted on YouTube: "In the 1930s we had mass unemployment but we don't have unemployment during the war. If you can have full employment by killing Germans why can't you have full employment by building hospitals, building schools, recruiting nurses, recruiting teachers. If we can find money to kill people, you can find money to help people." "Keeping people hopeless and pessimistic--see I think there are two ways in which people are controlled--first of all frighten people and secondly demoralize them. An educated, healthy and confident nation is harder to govern." This film has a great ending and the Cat Stevens/Yusiuf Islam music is perfect! Thank you Michael Moore.As for Michael Moore himself, I hope he takes Ralph Nader's advice or he won't be healthy enough to make many more films. This would be truly a loss to America and to cinema. Michael, if you can hear me: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A noble effort by Mr. Moore. Beyond the expected childish political polemic from people who will not even watch this film and the expected counter-attack from the moneyed interests this is a good film on a horrible and sad system.Health care should not be a matter of finance, it is a human right. The health of Americans is simply a profit motive for immoral companies getting rich on the suffering of people, of you and me. Doctors play along as they get rich and forget the oath they once took and the responsibility they have to cure and heal and treat, not enrich.One walks out of this film profoundly sad and ashamed to be part of a sheeplike electorate too hypnotized by propaganda to see what is being done to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made me wonder, yet again, why Americans haven't taken to the streets demanding real, not imagined, freedom. You cannot be free in a country that refuses to care for you, and in turn, only cares for corporate interest and earning. Personally, I know very few people who have not been scorned by our health care system. As an American, I feel fundamentally disappointed in our country, and I hope that this movie will help to wake people up so that health care reform can finally take root-without the insurance companies. While we're at it, maybe we can tackle free college, free nursing homes, nation-wide required recycling, and maybe we can even bring back the train lines ripped out by the car companies so long ago...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Must-See Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of how you feel about Michael Moore, his politics, or how he crafts his documentaries, you absolutely must see this movie.Being someone who hasn't had health insurance for over five years now, I was almost dreading this movie. Now that I've seen it, I feel compelled to tell everyone I know to plunk down the 7 or 8 bucks to see it. It's compelling, disturbing, bi-partisan, sometimes funny, and completely necessary to identifying what we need to make our country a better place to live.Michael Moore seems to be the only filmmaker who has the vision to, not only point out what's wrong with the picture, but make reasonable suggestions as to how to fix it. Unlike some of his previous movies, he skewers anyone who has had a hand in the way our health care system works (or doesn't), and that means parties on both sides of the political aisle.The greatest amount of attention recently has been focused on his trip to Gitmo with a boatload of 9/11 rescue workers, and the federal investigation that inevitably followed. I have to say that it is one of the most compelling segments of the film, especially since it follows a slew of stories from Canada, England and France, detailing how great their socialized health care programs are.There's a lot more to say, but please just go see this movie. It's too important to ignore. Even if you don't agree with Michael Moore's style, it's a subject that will be debated for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a heavy fan of Michael Moore, usually finding him inflammatory and one-sided. I think Moore had a good idea behind Fahrenheight 9/11 but ruined it by loosing all objectivity. But, SiCKO seems to show the maturation of Moore as a journalist and filmmaker. Other people have accurately noted that this movie is wonderfully nonpartisan and everyone should see this movie. What a fair number of people fail to realize is that by improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare, that cost reduction might be realized through fewer visits because people are healthier. It would also mean less missed productivity due to illness. The one thing I wish Michael Moore had placed a larger emphasis on was the pharmaceutical companies focusing on symptom mitigation versus cure. I wished he had pointed out the big pharma knows there are no long term profits in cures for conditions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magnificent film America's media doesn't want you to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has created a masterpiece called "Sicko." Any American capable of sitting through this film without wanting to immediately vote out all of their representatives in the US Congress is beyond hope.A pathetic health care system is America's great shame. Moore simply shows the fantastic success of the universal health care systems in England, France and Canada - and even poor &amp; isolated third world Cuba - and as you realize how much we have been suckered, you feel enormous shame to be an American. We have been lied to by almost all of our mainstream media, and we have paid an extraordinary and horrific price for this.The media appears to be attempting to get film reviewers to write negative reviews of this film so you will not be enlightened by its information. For example, the Washington Post's review by Stephen Hunter states that no doctors are interviewed in Moore's movie in order to convince readers that the film lacks depth and merit. He says: "He never interviews actual veterans of the system: doctors, nurses, administrators -- only the victims." This is a lie. Moore interviews MANY doctors and some very important administrators of our health care system. So why is the mainstream media willing to lie to keep you from seeing this film? Moore's film is deliciously entertaining, and yet packed with information. FACTS. Facts like you will never find in America's mainstream media, let alone reviews of this magnificent film.This may well be the most important film ever made in America... at least for Americans. If we can not respond to the call to do something made by this film, we are truly beyond hope.God bless you, Michael Moore, for trying and trying to make our country a better place for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an American living in Canada and I can say how blessed I am to be here. This movie shows the problems with health care in its fullest. It is not about the people who can't afford and don't have health care. Its about the people who do have it and the problems with it.You know the United States is one of the worst countries in the world for health care. Its true. How much did you pay for your last doctors bill? Think about it. Then watch this movie and see what other people are paying. Or not paying. By the way this movie is probably one of Michael Moore's least George Bush Cricizing movie. So people who are more pro-Bush won't be too offended by it. I'm not very good at writing so please don't think that that last sentence is being mean to anyone.I wonder how Michael Moore does it. Many people made fun of this movie and said it was Jabba the Hut giving health care advice. That is not true. Watch it and you will see.Oh and by the way. This movie did have a lot of controversy around it. It is fine for kids though there is one bad swear word in it. I won't say how it is used because that would be considered a spoiler, but it is the "F word" and it is written on a piece of paper that they zoomed up on so you can read it. But that was about the only reason it was rated "PG-13". Oh and the music was really funny. I hope they come out with a soundtrack.Peace Out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like Fat Man, the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9th, 1945, "Fat Man" filmmaker Michael Moore drops his own 21 kiloton bomb on the American Health Care Industry in his latest pseudo-documentary, SiCKO. Make no mistake, this is a provocative, powerful, persuasively structured polemic that blasts privatized health care providers and their profiteering agendas. Moore's manipulative machinations hit the mark and, surprisingly, they do so with far more heart than hostility.Over 500 hours of footage was shot during the making of SiCKO. Moore has deftly edited this down to a running time of approximately 120 minutes -- it is time well spent. Especially effective and poignant is the footage taken in Cuba where Moore first tried to get a number of ill Americans free and much-needed medical attention at Camp Gitmo ("the only place on American soil with universal health care.") This, of course, failed -- but not without making a key point and doing so with both humor and pathos. Moore and his fellow Americans, including three 9/11 rescue workers who have been unable to get their medical needs taken care of in the U.S., then head for Havana where everyone is treated for free. The sheer audacity of orchestrating something like this is what "Fat Man" does best -- it's definitely worthy of a fine Montecristo Panetela and a ice-cold Mojito at the very least.

		<shortDescription>Moore Scores Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The United States "the greatest county that has ever existed" has one of the most awful health care systems in the world, and that is the point of Michael Moore's Sicko. Moore throughout this exhilarating film asks the same question over and over again, "if the Canadians, French and English have Universal Health Care Systems, why can't American have one as well!" and you know what Michael is right. It is with a heavy heart that we look at the state of America in 2007. We have a war raging out of control in it fifth failure ridden year, we have a dim bulb President who seems to think that Jurice Prudience is the Aunt of the Hardy Boys, and we have a health care system that resembles a plane wreck. That is where sicko comes in and basically puts the US Healthcare system over its knee. Moore wisely focuses on the insured instead of the uninsured and demonstrates that even if you are lucky enough to have health insurance all these penny pinching tight wads want to do is save money. My only complaint is when Moore goes to France, England, Cuba, and Canada to examine their social medicine programs he refuses to mention the long waits and the many other things that plague those systems. Despite the candy coating I am in complete agreement, the US needs some form of social health care and now. We liberals need Michael Moore he is our propagandist just like Fox News is the Conservatives Progandists, and while we know not all he is saying is true. We love him for saying it in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unscientific study, but the message is clear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about Moore, he obviously chooses stories to fit his agenda and has a point that he's trying to get across in whatever way he can find, scientific or not. That being said, Sicko highlights the worst-case scenario among even those people who can afford insurance in the US, while presenting the general way of life in countries whose medical industry is socialized. He does this in an effective and entertaining manner that is both informative and thought provoking. My only complaint would be that he does not make the obvious connection between capitalism and the problems with privatized health care. While pointing out that the insurance companies should "have a conscience," the film neglects to explicitly say that capitalistic society is the root material cause of these and other problems (including the imperial 'war on terror'...) In this way, Moore does not provide a compelling reason for why things are the way they are or for how we can work to change them (short of emigrating). But regardless, if you are open-minded enough to examine the way things are, or are simply fed up with the status quo and are looking for some more information; this is a good 2 hour intro to the health care industry and that distinctly American brand of pulling yourself up by the poor's bootstraps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey.... this movie is GREAT.The horrors exposed regarding the health care and insurance industries, however, weren't necessarily surprising, as I - and most folks I know - have had SOME rather negative experience with the health care/insurance industryin the USA. Nonetheless, you can call me naive, but the degree to which SICKO demonstrated that outright corporate greed has lead directly to innumerable death was saddening and tragic. Particularly heart wrenching for me were the comments of the HONEST folks who had worked within the industry and who could no longer live with themselves and continue to do so.On the other hand, there were moments of pure uplifting inspiration as well. And as always, Michael Moore manages to cast a humorous eye on the subject matter to keep it from wallowing and sinking under its own weight.Obviously, Mr. Moore DOES put his own slant on the narrative. He manipulates the facts to serve the drama and omits those that don't serve his objective. But, as adults, we should know that about him and use our BRAINS to synthesize our own truth. Michael more is a DOCUMENTARIAN.... and a liberal one. He is NOT a reporter of facts. He has a very definite and well-documented point of view, and isn't obligated to be even-handed in expressing it.Having said all of that, I think SICKO should be his most acceptable offering in terms of appealing to an audience from a broad political spectrum. While I can easily recognize the very liberal slant of ROGER AND ME, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, FAHRENHEIT 911, etc., the subject matter of this film has a greater degree of universality. You don't have to be a liberal or conservative... Democrat or Republican to have had (... or know someone who has had...) a nightmare experience in health care.And while we may subscribe to different solutions for the health care crisis we face, I think most recognize that the system is BROKEN and we ALL know that SOMETHING must be done to fix it NOW.With the assistance of Michael Moore's phenomenal movie, SICKO, maybe at least the DEBATE that has been lacking can begin a bit sooner than might have otherwise happened.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko shows us what an Elite Few don't want you to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the main criticisms of this film is that it is really not a "documentary" because it doesn't give equal time to all viewpoints. You will find very few (if any) documentaries that do. Does the documentary showing the poaching and bludgeoning of baby seals present and give equal time to the viewpoints of the poachers? Would you want to hear them? Of course not. Well guess what folks; 99.9% of us ARE those baby seals, and the rich and powerful are the ones holding the clubs! And they will do everything they can to keep it that way.They have brainwashed many of us into believing socialized medicine is communism. That is pure hogwash. As the film points out, if you believe that, then police and fire departments, schools, libraries, and any other government funded services are communist entities too. How on God's Green Earth does it make any sense to have the health and well-being of our people run by for-profit corporations?!? By design, their primary goal is maximizing profits and the bottom line, not making people well (which costs them more money and reduces profits).Many also make the case that we pay so much more than the rest of the world for medicines because the big pharmaceutical companies put so much into research and development. Well... to start with, the vast majority of new medicines are created in the labs of medical and scientific universities, not drug companies. The pharmaceutical companies then simply buy the patents (so the universities have the money to fund their next project), and then reap huge profits off of them. Honestly, what do you think they spend more on, R&amp;D, or political contributions (making sure things stay the same), or the 5000 "Ask Your Doctor" ads we're bombarded with daily? And if our American companies are indeed the ones who manufacture and hold the patents, why don't they cost MORE in other places, instead of less? Why would the inhaler that costs FIVE CENTS in the movie in Cuba (apparantly what it actually costs to produce), cost $120.00 here?!? Don't you think that 24,000% profit - yes, TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT - is just a bit obscene??? The time has come for us to take back our country. Let the politicians know that the The People are going to run this country once again, not rich and powerful corporations and corrupt politicians. This movie is nothing short of a call to arms! Mr Moore is a true patriot. We need a lot more men like him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sicko isn't going to convert any of the Michael Moore haters. If you want to spit on the ground and kiss your Ronald Reagan wallet photo anytime you hear Moore's name mentioned in public, this film isn't for you.After watching his movie, you'll also be able admit this film contains a touch of Moore's opinion spread amongst its facts. In some ways, the film fails as a documentary. However Sicko, is the closest thing Moore has made to a true documentary in years. Possibly ever. Only Roger &amp; Me comes to mind as comparable work. In spite of a few flaws, Sicko is brilliant. One of the most levelheaded pictures Hollywood has put on the big screen in years.Sicko does run long in the tooth during a middle act occurring in France. Moore could have trimmed ten minutes out and achieved a more concise documentary. Seeking to bring a point home that providing one additional service will not bankrupt the United States, he unintentionally roams from his health care theme. During the middle act, his intent seems to border on, "we're still in Iraqi, we should have listened, France is our friend, and all of France's socialist services beat the USA government easily." In spite of his deviation, Sicko continues to progress and manages to tell an enthralling story.Moore manages to take a few Ground Zero workers to Cuba in his last act. He stages what borders between an opportunistic photo op and outright exploitation of the Ground Zero workers, while on a boat near Guantanamo Bay. Even so, Moore salvages the last act of Sicko, in such a dramatic way, it could almost bring a tear to a normal person's eye.Nobody is spared from Moore's look into the American health care system. Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline feared what their employees might say to Moore while he worked on Sicko, instructing their employees not to have any contact with Moore. He tells the story of friend and foe, avoiding shots at Bush for the most part, and tries to stray from influencing the film's eventual outcome. He fails at times and succeeds at others. But his narrative way produces a movie that entertains, examines an important issue, and could bring this issue back into the next election.Moore is often criticized for being anti-American or unpatriotic. After this film, you might leave with a new found respect for Moore. He's transformed himself into one of the biggest political activist for working class Americans. Any guy that uses the Bill of Rights and defends them, can't be all bad, regardless of what Fox News tells you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart-wrenching testimonies and remarkable facts form an important wake-up call...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sicko is substantially different from Moore's earlier work, although it's equally powerful. Bowling for Columbine was mainly powered by heart-wrenching testimonies and stories, Fahrenheit 9/11 was mainly about remarkable evidence; Sicko uses both elements optimal.He does a great job convincing his audience using his 'average Joe' logic. Of course he's helped by the mass amounts of evidence that is produced by a failing US health care system. People's testimonies will remain on people's minds the longest but I think the rock-hard and not ignorable evidence and unbelievably strong facts in Sicko are the most important. Nixon's fragment in particular is unforgettable. I don't think anyone knew Nixon actually gave the entire US Health care system in the hands of Kaiser Permanente knowing that they stood for the following: All the incentives are toward less medical care. The less care Kaiser gives to the patients, the more money they make. Also the testimony of Linda Peno( you can read more about it here after seeing the movie http://www.fenichel.com/Ganske.shtml)can never be erased from my memory. I think the great thing about Sicko is that Michael Moore actually explores concrete solutions to the problem,although he does not go in great detail of course. Moore's views are idealistic and Utopian(on a short term) but that doesn't make them less noble and beautiful. I'm an idealist and an optimist and I think the French perfect system is possible in the USA if they'd just get their priorities right. Hundreds of billions of dollars go into warfare while their own people are being left out in the cold. There's something so disturbingly wrong about that. Not only are the US killing people in Iraq and Afghanistan but they're also killing the Americans they claim to defend in the first place. I hope Sicko will finally change most Americans minds about US's Health Care Policy and set their priorities right. To outsiders, like myself, it's easy to see that privatization of health care is wrong since the government system works so well here. Health Care isn't free here but a lot the costs of minor conditions are paid for by the government and mayor conditions are paid in full by the government.Sicko is Moore's most important film in the sense that this problem affects millions of people on a daily basis. I truly hope Sick will lead to the appropriate political debate about Health Care and I truly think Sicko is the beginning of a better tomorrow for the US citizens. If the people realize that they have the power, if they'd break free of the chains of fear and demoralization, a brighter future is possible. Because 'Governments should be afraid of their people' and not the other way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>point of view from someone who has experienced both privatized AND socialized healthcare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see SiCKO knowing I would more or less agree with Michael Moore. I am an American citizen and not long ago I was able to spend a few years in the United Kingdom, so I have experienced both socialized healthcare and privatized healthcare. I think the UK's NHS (National Health Service) is a great system and I definitely prefer it over our current system. Like lots of Americans, I don't think I ever questioned our system - I thought, that's just the way it is, and I assumed other countries did things the same way. When I moved to England I realized there could be a better way than private healthcare.I am sure a lot of people will write this movie off just because it's Michael Moore. I personally agree with him sometimes, and sometimes I don't, and his "style" doesn't always appeal to me, but I am VERY glad he has tackled this issue. This is an issue that should concern EVERYONE old enough to have to pay their own bills. We all have health problems and/or we will in the future and/or we all know someone with them.I don't think I've ever cried so frequently during a film. Some of this was VERY hard to watch and heartbreaking. Showing the hardships and struggles endured by Americans with poor or no insurance compared to the pleasant success stories of patients in other countries was quite effective. It is hard to believe that there are still people in this country who believe that health care is a luxury rather than a right. Of course, everyone is terrified of socialism, so the term "socialized medicine" sounds pretty scary to middle-American ears, but MM raises a good point that there are other commonly-accepted socialized institutions in America. Like public schools. You know, if we had bureaucrats saying that basic education is NOT a right that every child should have - only the children of lucky parents or well-off parents - people would be FURIOUS. Why is it so different with healthcare? Not everyone uses the public school system - people without school-age children, or those who send their kids to private schools - but everyone pays into it. Like it or not. Why? Because it benefits everyone to have a well-educated society. Guaranteed, universal healthcare would work much the same way - you might be perfectly healthy right now, or you might choose private services, but you'd still pay into the system and you'd always be free to use it if needed. Why? Because it benefits everyone to have a healthy, vibrant society.Sometimes MM gets ahead of himself and begins attacking other aspects of American government and life - and that's not to say those things aren't worth discussing, but at times he risks losing focus of the issue at hand.I greatly enjoyed the segments shot in other countries. I especially loved the bit about the the UK's NHS, and he made France look like a utopia! Although I'm sure nothing is that perfect and France has its own set of problems, but at no time does MM suggest we copy any particular existing system. His point is to look at what works best for other countries and take those good aspects and adapt them for an American system. I've heard of Canada's problems with healthcare and MM glosses over these - however, I don't think this is bad film-making. There simply isn't enough time in a documentary to explore every issue of every socialized healthcare system in existence. It was more like, "Hey, look at how these guys do it, and it works better than our system in this way, so maybe we could borrow some ideas".I didn't especially like MM's use of the word "free". Nothing is free, not even socialized healthcare. He did mention the dreaded T word here and there (TAXES) but it gets lost between everything else going on - maybe that was a good idea, Americans hate taxes. However by saying FREE over and over again he makes it sound too good to be true and that isn't the case, this CAN be done! And OK, medical treatment would be "free" at the time in that no money changes hands when you get treatment. But yes, socialized healthcare would be paid for by taxes. No, these taxes aren't necessarily enormously crippling. It was probably cheaper (definitely not more expensive) for me to pay into the NHS there than it is to pay for my medical insurance, my co-pays, and all my treatment that is not covered by my insurance here.MM gets his point across rather well - the film ends with a few unanswered questions about what he's proposing. But his case is made, and you are left with the feeling that only someone with a heart of ice could be satisfied with the system as it is. I would say it's not a perfect documentary, but it is a very successful one.The film ended and a round of applause went around the theatre. I left in tears and thirsty for the blood of HMO CEOs. I sat in my car and texted some people and asked them to see this movie and to tell everyone they know to see it, too. Let's not waste this momentum and opportunity for important change. I want to believe that the American people can demand better for themselves and get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remedy for health care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Canadian What can I say? Michael Moore does a great job of showing how the American free enterprise health care system does not work, that government run health care systems do work, and that none of the myths Americans believe about government run health care are true.Moore shows us problems with the American system, and shows us what is right with systems in Canada, England, France, and, with great irony, Cuba.Moore, of course, is not trying to be fair to both sides since his point is a polemical one. Most people with health insurance in the States do not have adequate coverage, even when they believe they do. Insurance companies are too quick to deny care for all sorts of reasons, and people then have little or no recourse.One of the big objections to universal care is that taxes will be high. There are two answers to this. One is that health care taxes are probably less than private health care premiums, and in the countries where there is government health care, while we are not told what the taxes are, people clearly still have enough money to live comfortably. And, of course, they do not have to worry about health care costs.The film has great whimsy as well as tragedy. And Moore makes his points with great accuracy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This two hour documentary holds your attention and is very entertaining as well. I found myself wiggling in my chair, not because I was bored, but because one foot was trying to run to Washington and kick the living crap out of every politician that is working for the insurance and drug companies not me.Moore compares Universal health care in other countries and exposes the years and years of untruthful propaganda that has been shoved down our American throats.There are many sad stories about individuals that were totally done in by HMO's, Politicians and Drug Companies, there loved ones left to die not by omission but by design.The last part of the movie involved Moore taking a group of 911 First Responders with health problems to Cuba, was embellishment but very entertaining. He does have a set of brass ones and it was absolutely fantastic watching him pull up by boat to the Us Guantanamo Military Base, megaphone in hand, shouting at the guard tower that his 911 people just needed equal health care as the Al Quida prisoners were getting.Filter out about 25% and you have the raw truth like it or not. This movie will go down as one of the most significant films that changed American Health Care and is well worth saying you were there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Michael Moore's SICKO. Having seen all his other films, I'd have to rate SICKO probably his best, certainly his most restrained and poignant. It was hard not to tear up watching the segment filmed in Cuba. When one of the 9/11 rescue workers found out, at a Cuban pharmacy, that an inhaler she pays $120 for in the U.S. could be had for about 5 cents in Cuba, she just started crying--in rage, frustration, and shame for an American health care system grotesquely distorted by psychopathic levels of greed, mean-spiritedness, and bureaucratic indifference. Moore's film eloquently argues that the present system, so deeply and cynically dysfunctional and exploitative, needs to be dismantled immediately and replaced by something recognizably just and humane. Americans must truly be a despairing, browbeaten people to put up with this cruel joke of a health care system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back a little while ago from catching the late (21.30hr)show of Michael Moore's latest "joint", 'Sicko'. I first heard the buzz about this film a couple of years ago, when Mike was refused interviews from the major insurance companies (and who's employees were told not to answer any of Moore's questions,if approached). I can now say that the two year wait was well worth it. 'Sicko' manages to once again convey that the United States is the laughing stock of the rest of the known (or even unknown)world,in terms of it's health care system (or in this case,the lack of,thereof). Moore manages to interview several victims of the sorry excuse of insurance companies/HMO's (or as Moore calls it, "hand the money over"). All I know is, after seeing it, I just want to move to Europe (or for that matter,any country that has a functioning national health care program that works). If you've seen any of Michael Moore's other films (including his one fictional film, 'Canadian Bacon'), you know what to expect. For those who hate Moore, don't bother,just stay away &amp; don't ruin it for others (and you know who you are).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Michael Moore takes it to the Health community and the pharmaceutical companies. Absolutely wonderful movie that will have you laughing ( only a few times) and mad as hell at the industry and our USA policy of no health care for nearly 50,000,000 people. You will cry as well.Michael will surely change the way we think and get us to move against the health care industry and the pharmaceutical people.Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*WARNING! HERE BE SPOILERS*I watched this film with no real knowledge of how the American health care system operates, I'm unlucky enough to suffer a life long health problem but lucky enough to live in the UK and am very well looked after by the NHS. I found the film frightening, for me to see others, with life long health ailments like myself, having their entire lives ruined because of those ailments was scary to say the least. Moore does an excellent job of showing what happens when you turn medicine into a business...people suffer and people die, it's really that simple. The sequence where he visited a British hospital looking for the area where people pay their bill was hilarious and when he visited 'Evil' Cuba was an eye opener. Moore's films tend to lack a grey area when he is debating issues but in this film I don't think there was ever a grey area to find. All in all a film that everyone in the world should watch, if only to thank God that things aren't like that in their country like I did. Oh and the final moment when he reveals he helped the guy that runs the biggest anti Moore website in the world by paying his wife medical bills so he could carry one running his site...that's how to show your enemies you're a bigger man than they are and how to do it with style :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Movie in Years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have a health crisis in this country. About 50 million Americans are uninsured but it's not about them. It's about the insured like myself. After leaving my previous position in a public school district because they refused my request for an unpaid leave of absence as a clerk-typist (the only way I could get a leave of absence is if somebody is ill or I'm pregnant). My reason for leaving a steady job was to do student teaching coordinated by my college. Kind of ironic that a school district wouldn't have approved such a request. The motive was the monthly payment to the insurance companies. Anyway, I'm paying COBRA which costs almost 600 dollars for one person. The documentary is not about the uninsured but about insured patients who aren't getting their coverage. Like the man who wanted his daughter to have both cochlear implants in both right and left ears, the insurance company only wanted to approve for one ear of this very young child. Anyway, the man decided to take action by contacting Moore with information and documents concerning his daughter. Luckily, the insurance company changed their minds. I think the most heartbreaking story was the Kansas City woman whose husband, Tracy, had kidney cancer and his only hope was to have a bone marrow transplant with his younger brother. The woman's employer and the board at the hospital declined the procedure which resulted in the man's death. Moore goes to Canada, France, and England. Too bad, he didn't go to India where many American pay cheaply for good health care. I got dual citizenship with Poland because I feared that health care in this country was deteriorating in 2000. In France, the French citizens or denizens are given free health care, university schooling (only if you pass tests), 5 weeks vacation, 35 hours per week workload, pensions, government assistance, family care, government nannies, etc. It makes you want to pack up and move to Paris. Although Moore does leave out that France does have problems of their own. I didn't like any Americans at the café who boasting about their lives in Paris, France maybe it's because I envy them. I know Michael Moore says that America is the best country around but not in health care for it's citizens. In fact, most Americans are overworked, exhausted, tired, stressed, and strained from being American because they worry about health care, pensions, and the fewer options. Look at the couple who became bankrupt because of having health insurance or the woman who would marry a Canadian for health care. The insurance company didn't believe that she had cervical cancer at only 22 years old so they declined her care. She headed north to Canada for health care. The politicians and the health care industry are milking the profits for themselves. Look at Los Angeles where hospital dumping of homeless and mentally ill patients are routine at the mission without warning or care. I bet most drug addicts suffer from depression and illegal drugs are cheaper than the legal drugs. When the 09-11 volunteer, Reggie, learned that the same breathing inhaler in Havana, Cuba costs about nickel when in America, it costs about $120.00. Moore's genius is getting people's attention to see, learn, and experience what most Americans are going through. It's not a non-partisan issue that Americans aren't getting health care and suffering for it. Just realize that 18,000 patients die yearly because they can't afford or receive their proper treatment. Think about the 79 year old supermarket worker who is working for his prescription plan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SICKO is a very important film in regard to the health-care industry in America and how Americans need to wake up and say,as in the fabulous film NETWORK,"I'm mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore" in addressing the serious issues of how managed care is ruining this country. Michael Moore has produced a brilliant film in SICKO which I hope all Americans will see when they think about their future health-care in this country. Bravo Moore! As a past patient as an American in a London hospital from a traffic accident while living there, the patient care I received was tremendous and I am grateful to my Sisters and GP's for bringing me back to health. Moore shows in the film Americans in France, British care and Canadians, all benefiting from national health-care. The film also gave us again what Hillary Clinton attempted to do to reform our health-care, but was shot down by the vampires who rule our government. Thank you London for what you gave me as a patient and Michael Moore for showing an American audience British care on the screen.SICKO's final scenes with our heroes of 9/11 finally being treated as patients in Cuba really was a wake up call to the lies our government have fed us about Cuba, and what a joy to see the fireman come together as "brothers and sisters" in a global reach for mankind. I can only hope that SICKO will awaken Americans to health-care reform and better health-care practices by the medical association in the United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grape-6, I can't believe some of the manure that you have just spouted:"It's illegal in Europe to protest or speak out against their current leader. Americans have that right (1st Amendment.)"Maybe I am wrong, but wasn't there about a million people marching through the streets of London a few years ago. Must've been some large prisons to house all those criminals then eh? Where in Europe are you not allowed to protest the Government? Albania maybe? It seems that it's the US where protesting the Government is not allowed. In a country ruled by corporations and the religious right, there are many ways round the 1st Amendment - ask the Dixie Chicks."Europeans don't have the right to protect their lives or property from criminals. Americans have that right (2nd Amendment.)"What is this stupid assumption that the only way to protect yourself is with a gun? Why is there more burglary and armed robbery per head in the US than in Europe? Yeah, the right to bear arms really does work."In Europe, the government can (and does) forcibly sterilize those that they deem should not reproduce. This was made illegal in America three decades ago (9th Amendment.)"Sorry, has Adolf Hitler risen from the grave?? Where are you getting this from? Mein Kampf?"In Europe, the government can (and does) restrict artistic freedom of expression (1st Amendment.) The current example of Germany outlawing the most recent Tom Cruise movie due to its religious themes is a timely one."Wait a minute, what's the difference between a government banning things, and corporations bowing to religious zealots in the bible belt and refusing to show films, play music etc? (See 'This divided state' or 'shut up and sing' etc)"In Europe and Canada both, there are long waiting lists just to see a doctor."Nonsense - I called up to arrange an appointment with my GP on Thursday (this is Friday night). My appointment is for Tuesday at 9:00am. If your GP refers you to the hospital, it may take a couple of weeks before you are seen - not that bad. If it is an emergency, you can go to the hospital straight away."One of my husband's relatives in Canada needed a simple but life-saving heart valve replacement. She was on the wait list for three years when she died."Isn't it better to be on a waiting list, rather than have no chance at all? As Moore's film shows, millions of people miss out due to having no insurance. Also people who do have insurance miss out because the companies just refuse to pay for these ops, claiming existing conditions etc.Think I'll stick with the good old NHS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not about socialism: it's about humanity?and good sense?versus rapacious greed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's polemical documentary 'Sicko' focuses on the heartless nature of the United States health system?it's inferior in that respect to those of Canada, England, France, perhaps even Cuba, he says. Infant mortality is lower and the life span longer in those four countries and others as well, compared to "the richest nation in the world." The problem with the American system is it's designed more to make money for the providers of care than to make itself available to everybody as tax-based government systems are.'Sicko' is no more cool and unbiased than any of Moore's other documentaries. It's what he means it to be: effective fact-based 'agitprop. He doesn't present downsides to the non-US health care systems he looks at. But he still makes a strong case in showing in the first half what's wrong with the American system. A well-off Canadian Moore interviews says he's a conservative, but the national health service is an essential given. Can we ever get there? Moore is a provocateur; he also has the ability to speak with the down-to-earth populist voice of the ordinary man of good sense. His obesity may even help him with poor and working class people. Though it's a problem he's privately working on, it keeps him from looking like a sophisticated rich guy.People tend to respond with scorn or loud applause to Moore's provocations and his methods. This time he's been accused of mindless absurdity for the way he keeps asking Canadian and then British patients and medical personnel what they pay or what they charge when under a government system the answer is always "nothing." These questions didn't seem excessive to me. Moore's point is that Americans are so traumatized by a system based on HMO, insurance company, and drug corporation greed that they simply can't believe the luck of countries where universal health care is granted with no questions asked. There's got to be a catch?the kind of hidden clause, rule, or exception that he's shown the Kaisers, Aetnas, Cignas, Humanas, and the rest in America dream up to make more money for their shareholders and bloated CEO's and allow a baby to die of a fever and a father to die without a bone marrow transplant from a brother. (These two tragedies both involve black people.) Anyone who sees 'Sicko' will remember the man in England who lost most of the fingers on one hand and got them put back on for free, versus the American given the choice after a saw accident: sew back the end of your middle finger, $60,000; of your ring finger, $12.000. Having to rely on his own savings, he went for the ring finger.'Sicko' goes further afield. Not only England but also France comes across as paradise compared to the injustices of the USA. Moore films a gathering of Americans who live and work in France to speak up about how generous their work weeks, vacations, maternity leaves and medical care are over there. One woman at the all-Yank Paris dinner says she feels guilty about the good life she can live just by virtue of working in France when her parents back home have struggled so hard and yet still have less. The government even provides in-home nannies; and people (again in Paris presumably) can get an "S.O.S." doctor who makes free house calls in a shiny little white car; Moore goes around with him one night.Moore doesn't go into detail about the disadvantages of other systems than the American one. In response to some usual criticisms of government medicine, he shows an English doctor who lives well working for the National Health and a Parisian family that is comfortable and happy paying French taxes. What 'Sicko's'' facts and arguments put across to the viewer is that modern health care in a world where America ranks somewhere around the 2000 WHO report's 37th, government-sponsored universal medical treatment isn't about democracy, socialism, or capitalism. It's more about humanity?and good sense?versus rapacious greed.'Sicko' shows how volunteer post-9/11 World Trade Center helpers suffering from respiratory and PTSS problems have been rejected by the US system and he takes them in a boat to Guantánamo after Congressional testimony stated the prisoners there get better treatment than some in the US. This is one of Moore's old practical joke gestures that leads into a visit to Cuba where the 9/11 volunteers actually get some free diagnoses and treatments, no questions asked. They enter a spectacular marble-lobbied hospital (the Cubans were obviously glad to show off the best of what they've got) and all they need to give is their names and dates of birth.For some mainstream viewers, the Guantánamo trip or at least the Cuban one might be alienating. But then, there are the heroes of 9/11 along with Moore to validate the journey and say: See how bad US health care is? We have to go to Havana to get help! Medicare, it seems, may not save you with really serious health problems; even for minor ones, government payment of 80% of the bill isn't enough for poor people.Since Medicare is all I have, 'Sicko' left me feeling not only depressed but vaguely afraid. And Moore has inserted several key allusions to fear. In an interview the retired English socialist MP Tony Benn says a ruling class tends to control the poor through keeping them demoralized and scared. Later Moore himself generalizes that in France the government is afraid of the people, but in America the people are afraid of the government. Insofar as that's true, it helps explain why Europeans have social services Americans lack. Never having had medical insurance, I feel lucky to have had a lifetime of good health.But with the technology and education and?yes?the health care system we have in the US?were it more available to all?luck shouldn't be so necessary to have gotten through. The system we have isn't right.</fullReview>

Only the benefits, never the costs. The message of the film is: "Come get the Free Lunch".There's a whole segment of people who've never run a for-profit business who believe that business is evil and things would be better if the state took care of everything.

		<fullReview>It is worthy of Moore to bring attention to the issue of Health Care in the United States. But the big mistake here is dancing around about European health care.The NHS in the UK is at breaking point and there are enough horror stories to make Sicko 2. More to the point, many UK people I have come across have ended up scratching their head and some even are starting to get a grip on the level of manipulation that goes into a Moore production. In France, their system is coping a little better, even though it relies upon obsolete medical technologies and most of the great French medical inventions are being snapped up by the US for development. Then 10 years later, no doubt, they sell that technology to France at a healthy premium, if you'll forgive the pun. Not just that - the tax system in France is so good and bad that, yes they can afford universal health care, but unfortunately they absolutely skin you alive to flip the bill. In the wash up, it would be cheaper and better for French people to completely privately insure themselves than give away huge blocks of tax dollars to finance what they have.It is not that the US system beats this. It is more that Moore is showing people the worst case situations of the US health care system and the best case scenarios of European health care systems. Omission on both fronts amounts to manipulation.One side issue completely avoided is the drug industry. The US have a dramatic demand for new and stronger drugs, which in turn, costs the government billions. In fact, drug companies get more out of the government each year than insurance companies. It would appear that they are above criticism.Similarly, there are many people in Canada with money who head for US hospitals for treatment and pay upfront, citing the poor standard of care and long waiting periods involved with the "free" Canadian medical system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unarguably good film-casting, indecently hypocrisy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pretty sure there is one reason only why Mr. Moore is so influential. Well maybe two. He is very artful in making people believe that he's so genuinely impartial. He really acts like someone who collects so much data from so many sources. And indeed he does, however there's a trick which is pretty guessable among the other things. Try to imagine someone who wants to deny the validity of the hydrogen economy just because he's not convinced of it. Well he will find plenty of data to support his idea. Plenty. And then he will show them to you as the only ones available, like if there's no convincing evidence for the contrary. But there is, and maybe plenty of it, maybe 10 times more data than those he collected to prove his theory. And this is what Moore did with this movie (and others). It's a pitiful behavior and it's not nice of him. As a journalist and, most of all as a director with such influential power, there is a high bill to pay, at the end, Mr. Moore. For presenting twisted facts. You have more responsibilities than others. And you are no way different from many politicians that make their campaigns just like you do yours. You're no cleaner. You call for a better America but then you are the first one eating hamburgers made with cows and chickens minced alive together with their scat. It is horrible. Because you speak and show what you say to be real facts. Had you at least the decency to shut up, you'd still be excused. If you show real facts, you don't show all the facts. Come here in Italy, man. I'll show you some facts that you don't know anything about, evidently. There's places where you get back home after a surgical operation with scalpels forgotten inside your liver or your bowel. In Italy the public health assistance you can get for your teeth is one only: removal. If you need to treat a cavity you have to pay a private dentist. If you need a crown replacement you have to get a loan to pay the private dentist, I tell you. If you need a surgical operation of any kind, you may have a 6 month wait list smiling at you. Or maybe you are lucky enough to reach a hospital where they treat you immediately and all doctors are extremely caring. You just must be lucky enough. Need to be in the right place. Or need to know where the best public hospitals in Italy are. Or you're lost. And we are in position #2 after France? Enough said. And I love my country. I'm not pretty sure you love yours though, because what you want to transform America into, is everything but America. To improve means to change things. Dramatically change some of them, yes. But you don't want that really. What you want is Mooreland. Help! Oh, I forgot to say the second reason why Moore may be so influential. Many will hate to hear this, however there's lot of people who smoke, drink, eat junk food and then expect a public health system to fix/replace their lungs, their livers and their hearts. Capitalism may not be heaven on earth Michael, but rest assured that the society you want will make people more and more irresponsible and "everything-is-owed-to-me"-oriented. That's not heaven either, Michael. I understand there's times where you are born sick, or get sick in life although you live a healthy lifestyle as much as possible. Okay, I totally accept free health assistance for those cases, especially when you can't afford it. Especially when you're a 9/11 hero and you should be treated with the utmost respect and care, just like Vietnam veterans should have. So what? Work on that specifically, if you really want to change something, Michael (and provided you're able to). Focus on those cases and don't point the finger blaming the American system 100% . This is unfair and biased. About the ignorant Americans as you depict them to us Europeans and to Canadians, those Americans who don't know where UK is, which seems so unforgivable in this globalized world... well, Michael, I personally think that there's wonderful people living in deserts in Mongolia or in Sahara (and in the US, evidently) and who don't even have an idea of what is the state name continguous to theirs. But they eat healthy, they are in good shape, in good mood, they are not ambitious and are enough content with their job which may be a 8 hours job and they just take life easy and don't criticize every second of their lives the government they are ruled by. And, yes, more intelligent than you. Even if they don't know where UK is. And they may help the US more constructively than you do. You even show the website of one of your detractors. This is another hypocrisy of yours. You want to show that you're even willing to help those who are totally against your ideals by paying for their health so that they can continue to run a website against you. I really mean it: you wanted to show it. It wasn't really necessary, considering the thousands and thousands of e-mails that you received, so why showing such a website? Just so that people will cherish such an open mind, hm? If that is not propaganda, you tell me what it is. Not to talk about the Cubans helping the 9/11 heroes. Excellent thing. Nothing to say against it or against Cubans, except one thing: what an unmissable occasion for them to show something to Americans, huh? C'mon, Cubans, let's show the yanks what we can do! I respect them 100% for taking this chance, but you can't deserve the same respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely nothing funny here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie I became 'sicko'. The realization that people would do this to each other and find it easy to side-step responsibility by blaming a nebulous 'system' only highlights the fact that each and every single unconscionable action really boils down to what an individual would be willing to turn a blind eye to. Capitalism usurping the Christian values we here so much about. So, if you accept this movie's allusions as factual, then this nation should be ashamed. My knee-jerk reaction was to book the first flight out of this country. And yet, I believe Michael Moore continues to claim his citizenship. Thus, I have a quandary to deal with. If you have to rate a movie on the overall impact it will have on you, then it should be rated very high. It sticks to you and you will continue to dwell long after viewing. If ranked on factuality??? Well, the facts are there - those that serve the political agenda of the movie and its maker. What I didn't see is any real confrontation. Moore was willing to get into the corporation's face in 'Roger And Me'. Considering that the 'heartless' corporation that was cabbing sick people and dumping them on the street was just down the block, and Moore didn't even try to take his case to their door makes me scratch my head and wonder why not? I felt that Moore missed some opportunities here - and others. But then I am watching an old 'House' episode where a man is losing his home because of the bill to sew back on his severed thumb. After some 'beat around the bush' dialog, Cuddy finally turns and says that if she has to take the man's house to pay the bill, she will. If that didn't send chills down my spine....because this is considered normal here - and it shouldn't be. I give this a 7 because I felt Moore could have done more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scathing truth on America's twisted health-care system. If you're a big baby who simply can't stand have anything related to America scrutinized (so that it can be improved), just cover your ears, and shut your eyes and go "BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH _ I CAN'T HEAR YOU!" while everyone else learns something from this great flick. I think this is his best movie to date (and I've liked all his films). The treatment of the 9/11 rescue workers is a very bitter pill to swallow, but like all of Moore's movies, he gives you a big teaspoon of sugar to make it go down easier. Funny in parts, very sad in others, and enlightening all the way through. Bravo, MM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know that Moore is prejudiced. Yes, I know that Moore introduces health systems around the world according to his goals. Yes, I even found the movie too cheesy and focusing solely on the emotions of the audience several times. However, most of the Americans understand and care of the problem only if it is shown this way. They only care about attitudinized movies. And yes, the last part about Cuba was like a far too emotional show.Anyway, the core of the problem was still introduced to the U.S. "average" people. And they needed it. They are so much brainwashed, thinking that U.S. of A. is the only country where human rights exists and also the greatest country of the world... Yes, that made me sick to the stomach...Been there, done that.How about not only looking at the U.S map, but buying a small globe??? It would help tremendously for your children to find countries that are outside of the U.S., although still are significant. As Germany or Japan, for example. Can you find them on the globe without hesitating? You should.Make some Google search if you don't believe what the film stated. If you have some more money, do some traveling and check it out for yourself. (By the way, not without a U.S. travel insurance for the first time.) For the second time, you will be persuaded that you'll never need it during your future travels because we tried (and to some extent managed) to respect God's order about helping the needy.Do we pay some more taxes? Yes, though only a little more to excluse worrying.Do we have to wait for treatments? Yes, though only in cases that are not urgent. ER is quicker than in the U.S.There were heart-wrecking examples: the guy that was to make a decision whether his ring finger (12k USD) or middle finger (60k USD) should be repaired: that's one of the most inhumane things.Do I have to pay 60k dollars to repair my middle finger in Europe? No, it's free. And I don't have to choose. If had been there and this accident had happened to me, I would have said: "F'"k that, don't do anything for me for that amount of money and shame on you."Rob from Hungary, Europe (EU)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't get to play democracy with health care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review since i became registered. I went to see this movie yesterday and after reading so many confused reviews I told myself i had to post my side of the version.First of all, I am not going to praise or bash Moore. I was well aware of his film-making since Bowling for Columbine but a lot of issues back then were a little hard to digest by an European (i.e. the concept of being a ''freek'' if you didn't have a gun of some sort - it's illegal here to even have a weapon; police officers have guns with...compressed air and not bullets, hence not deadly but fierce enough to immobilize the bad guy).Second of all, I'm an inside man - a social worker who knows his country's health system and yes, we have universal health care for everyone. This time around, Moore depicts the American health care. He takes poignant cases of people who've had encounters with the insurance health system and creates his case. I've read reviews (a journalist's, among others) that say he didn't document enough for his documentary but only presented what could feed his anti-capitalism propaganda. I tell you he didn't have to dig any deeper than he already did. There are cases where you must rely on statistics but this is not one of them. So what if, statistically, 98% get medical care as long as the other 2% get thrown out of a hospital and are willingly left at God's mercy? (There is a horror scene in the movie where the old sick woman that needed treatment is expelled from the hospital for not having insurance and she is being wished "take care of yourself"). That means that there is a breach somewhere in the system. ALL people (that is 100%) must receive medical treatment.I praise freedom and liberty of choice but you don't get to play democracy when it comes to people's lives and health care. If two thirds are content with the system (the majority), is it OK to completely disregard the other third (the minority)? Moore portrayed the American full reluctance towards socialized (mistakenly confused with communism) medicine. The scene with the horror portrayal of the reap and hammer (popular symbol in communism ideology for "reap what you saw" and "the more you work, the more you'll be rewarded") comes to confirm it. Socialized medicine does not mean communism. It has absolutely nothing to do with government taking control of your life or refrained personal freedom. In fact, Moore doesn't use even the words "public" or "private" through out his entire film.Universal health care does not come into conflict with either one of the two concepts nor does it take sides. Public and private can actually get along quite fine and this is the key to efficient universal health care. This is what's happening in most countries where universal health care is installed. A good balanced mix of public and private to prevent any kind of abuse. Perhaps Moore avoided getting into the "public/private" polemics because it was off topic - the film is about people's lives and health care. And thus it may seem that he omitted parts of the story.You might think this is a pro Moore review. I am actually siding with those in need, with those people who are here and now at their most desperate times of their lives and need guidance/treatment/care. It's even more true if they represent a minority (those 2% I mentioned). It could be me or you in any of these cases under the same twist of circumstances.It's un-Christian, it's immoral, it's wrong to gain profit on other's health problems, to take money for a service and then refuse to honor it. The aim is to cure and provide care for *everyone*, not only for those who don't undermine the profit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not "sick"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sicko" is the latest Michael Moore doco, this time putting the torch to the American healthcare system. He highlights all the massive flaws in the system, focusing on some people who have learnt the hard way that the system ain't that fair. He then looks at some other Western countries who have comparatively awesome systems eg Canada, Great Britain, France.This movie is a little different as he doesn't really act like Superman as much (except for some 9/11 volunteers he helps), and doesn't attack George Bush as much. Generally he just seems to be highlighting some big problems in the US...yet it seems unlikely this film will do much about it.It's reasonably entertaining and informative, and the content will make for some great "showing off at dinner parties" chat. Not his best film as a complete work, but decent enough and certainly better than wasting a night watching "I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore isn't exactly known for being objective, but Health care is a far less politically charged issue than the terrorism he attacked in Fahrenheit 9/11. I think it's the lack of political rhetoric that lends this film one of its many strengths.I am Canadian and I watched this film with my American fiancé. As we watched, we kept a running dialogue going about the differences and our own experiences in our respective health care systems.The Canadian system is not as perfect as Moore depicts, we have problems with health care too. However, we are miles ahead of the U.S. and after watching this film I felt so thankful to live in a place that offers universal health care. However, I was also tempted to move to France.A government should take care of its PEOPLE, not its CORPORATIONS. This is what the U.S. has backwards, the government exists only to benefit profit driven corporations.The story of the man who was denied his bone marrow transplant or the little girl who died because the hospital the ambulance took her to would not admit her made me want to put my foot through my TV in anger. Had I grown up in the U.S. I may not have lived to write this. When I was 4, I had a high fever, similar to the girl in the film. Doctors told my parents I could have easily died if I hadn't been treated right away upon reaching the hospital. By the end of the film I was extremely thankful for our imperfect yet universal system and my American fiancé was in tears at how poorly her own people were treated, especially after watching the segment where the 9/11 rescue workers were sent to Cuba.Cuba is only an enemy of the U.S. because the U.S. Government tells the people that country is evil, the truth is far different. Excellent film that everyone should see, if you aren't much of a Michael Moore fan.</fullReview>

In one way they are close to being heartless criminals. Do something about getting rid of the private insurances and make health care a governmental issue. HMO's should not be a business when it comes to people's health.Oh yeah, and once more; get rid of that Bush guy next time round, will you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Moore film...so expect the good but also accept the bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Taking a break from Bush-bashing (don't read too much into that!), Mr Moore returns this time to cast a critical eye on America's health care system, where many can't afford to be cared for and the one's who can aren't much better off, being denied urgent treatment and being billed for the most ridiculous of things. Despairing at the system in his own country, Moore travels to Canada,Europe, including England and France, and even Cuba (which America has always tried to convince it's citizens is hell on earth!) where 'socialized medicine' is the norm and seeing how much better it seems, wonders why things aren't the same in the States.Balanced isn't a word Michael Moore tends to consider when making his documentaries, as past efforts have shown, so it's best to approach Sicko with a fair pinch of salt. Once again, he's hammered his own views across for two hours without showing that he's at least considered the other POV.All this seems pedantic as you can't fault the guy for devotion to his art. Clearly very passionate and dedicated to his work, he just takes that step further doing what most others do which is to believe their own views are right. And there is a lot of truth and wisdom in what he says.But, for instance, while he likes the idea that you don't have to pay for treatment in the UK, he hasn't considered how irked some might feel having to pay through their taxes for those that either can't be bothered to work or have ended up in hospital for things they have brought on themselves (smoking, alcohol, over-eating etc...) who many understandably might prefer to have to pay in the American way. Or that you get what you pay for, and while it no doubt is very expensive to get better in the US and the middle-men and drug companies no doubt are very greedy and unscrupulous, at least you don't hear about that many ancient, run-down American hospitals riddled with MRSA and c-difficile. There's good and bad either way, but you must at least weigh up the pros and cons.So, then, this can best be described as a typical Moore film. Very one-sided and hardly any room for balanced debate, but undoubtedly well-made, thorough and passionately forcing it's beliefs down the viewers throats. ****</fullReview>

All this nunsense about not enough money is a very good propaganda tool to keep most people struggling to really live and enjoy it too, to keep them in the dark about the real potential of this sociaty. somewhere along the line a stupid man or few with a big fear of people started oppressing people for there own benefit, and then began making laws to go that way, and then propaganda came to support these laws, other people then followed, people which are not happy enough,(otherwise they will think of the greater good and not only of themselves) and we get what we have today, people bust their butt to earn a living and live through paying the mortgage and other payments. so it is really possible and pretty simple too, we just have to fight for it, so to all of the Michael Moores out there, keep pushing, we'll make it happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to change the social order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would agree with anyone that states that Moore clearly loves his country. I am a big fan of social commentary, unsurprising then that I love the comedy of Bill Hicks. I feel that both Moore and Hicks love/d the best parts of their country but refuse/d to gloss over the worst parts and try in their own way to break down the lies told by governments to protect their own interests. Although Moore doesn't always get his facts 100% correct they are usually 99.5% correct. He does omit to mention that the system in the UK is a hybrid system, although we all pay tax. And he conveniently forgot to mention that the reason why Cuba is such an impoverished nation is because the U.S. spat its dummy (pacifier) out over the revolution (the U.S. stops trading with Cuba because the Cubans didn't want to be another Vegas, corrupted by U.S. influenced gambling, whore houses and drug smuggling. Lack of trade killed their economy.) In my opinion the Cubans had every right to chuck out the U.S. Hell I seem to remember from history that the U.S. didn't like being an extension of England, so didn't they declare their independence? But anyway a good documentary, didn't surprise me at all, I have a good understanding of American culture and have a lot of family over there. My dad's cousin in Tenessee works for blue cross, she already mentioned this sort of thing to us a long while ago. Actually seeing the lives of people it has affected though... - it's tough to watch at times, but necessary. I did enjoy seeing Tony Benn on the film, a rare example of 1 of politics least corrupted politicians, even if "they" (the powers that be) did their best to discredit him during his political career. I was also glad to see Hammersmith hospital there, whenever I see a portrayal of the English health system in U.S. media its usually some Victorian - Esq torture chamber! I'd just like to end by saying that America STILL deeply saddens me for a number of reasons, but my number one at the moment is the fact that you STILL have New Orleans on your doorstep, it is STILL like a frigging 3rd world country out there and yet YOUR government persists in spending TRILLIONS of YOUR TAX DOLLARS on fighting wars + for what? If you want to go after evil dictators that really f*ck things up - let's go get Mugabe his crimes against humanity are far worse than Saddam's ever were (yes I include the alleged mass genocide of 100,000+ people by chemical weapons in that.) + it would be easier to do. You all do realise now, surely, that Saddam and Iraq WERE NEVER A THREAT TO America. Hell, you just can't throw rocks that far. And if you weren't spending money on that (over 25% of US GDP goes on defence) imagine what you could spend that on, underfunded schools, universal health care, public services... :-) just my 2c.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's movies are not without flaws...he definitely edits selectively and stages some events with a publicity savvy worthy of PT Barnum.Having said that, Sicko is a great, well rounded assessment of how our medical system falls down on the job here in the U.S. We have allowed our system to be privatized, when in reality like education, the police, fire, etc. it should be a public institution. (Can you imagine calling the police while you are being mugged and having them run your info through to make sure your taxes are up to date before sending out a car?) He also does a good job of deflating critics who say that universal healthcare doesn't work in other countries. It doesn't work perfectly 100% of the time, but on average it's working out a lot better for those people than it does here at home.He shows that British doctors are well paid, that Canadian patients are treated fairly and that even that commie Fidel Castro manages to get good quality care for his people. He demonstrates how France walks the walk when it comes to "family values" by providing support and childcare for new parents. He shows how in general other countries treat their sick so they can return to being productive members of society.I'm not 100% sure I buy into his premise that this for-profit system was created to keep us weak, docile and not voting....I think it was created for profit and if they really wanted us weak and docile, they would privatize the police, so we were prisoners in our own house and education and libraries, so we were illiterate. In particular I've come to believe that the Bush administration is so inept that they couldn't find eggs in a honchos, so the idea of a conspiracy on this scale, I'm not sure they could manage it.This movie will move you from laughter to tears, often in the space of a few minutes. The end is upbeat, pointing out that we all have power (via our vote) to change the system. So...let's go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The United States is rich and prosperous compared to other countries and gives billions of dollars to the likes of Iraq and Israel, yet according to this film it unjustly fails to provide proper health care to literally millions of its' citizens who deserve better.This is an informative and well presented 2 hour long documentary and gives us an insight into one aspect of the meanness and inequity in American Society. The documentary shows numerous real life case studies of individuals (who are often real patriots) and according to the stories about them in the film they have been denied health care by the greed of companies and individuals and by an inequitable system.There is a comparative study of health care systems in Canana, the UK, France and Cuba who all compare more favorably in how they treat patients than those in the States. The film maker also makes the highly valid point that detained terrorists have proper health care available to them, which is denied to some who actually should be getting it.In my view one of the problems with the States is it is a society controlled by grasping greedy people including a powerful group of extreme religious fanatics. They see profits ahead of people, and a lot of these "controllers" are anti-gay, anti abortion etc and want to impose their madness on the rest of society as well as their cruelness. Media crazies like Fox News propagate this evil agenda, which is often using scare tactics, hence the likes of George W.Bush gets elected.If there was any factual inaccuracies in this movie then cannot say I have heard or seen any serious rebuttal.At least the picture does exemplify freedom of speech, and Michael Moore is deserving congratulations for this excellent film.8/10.</fullReview>

Because the nations that have universal health care are the ones where the people are more politically active. That's what we see on this excellent documentary. It's not only about voting, it's also about principles, about protesting in the name of our collective existence, and Moore does it like no other filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fire-engines are OK - but is it a sick society that maximises profits on medical emergency calls?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As cinema fare, documentaries are rarely crowd-pullers. A few that make it are maybe exceptional. Should you bother to see this one? Michael Moore films tend to be pretty divisive. Some people avoid them on principle. He is not known for taking a balanced approach, for meticulous arguments, or openness to views beyond his own. You'll probably find a more impartial appraisal of health care systems on Wikipedia.Sicko is not documentary as we know it. Maybe not documentary as we want it. Yet Moore is getting better at what he does best. He uses every trick in the book to excite the audience. And that's it. He is like a shot of concentrated emotion supercharged with adrenalin. If you didn't feel passionately about health care systems before seeing this film, the chances are you will afterwards.Even the most uneducated viewer will recognise that Sicko portrays non-US health care systems through rose-coloured lenses. Does this make you angry? Calmer viewers may say that is not the point ? and I agree. Moore is not making academic comparisons. Sicko is a vivid and emotional polemic. It's not even agit prop, as he has neither agenda nor solution. He simply wants to alert the viewer that there is something sick in the way the US delivers medicine. The U.S. is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not provide universal health care. Whether you are from the US or from elsewhere, Sicko is perhaps the most startling 2hr illustration of this. Even given that millions of folk that he doesn't mention are no doubt pretty happy with it.What I found most worrying were the political scandals he uncovered. Widespread contributions from companies that would lose out from reform. Politicians moving to highly paid jobs in the health industry after a political stint. Barriers to getting reform passed in such an environment would be enormous. And without adequate safeguards, the remedy could be worse than the cure. (Moore's preferred option, digging down through his website, seems to be H. R. 676, "The United States National Health Insurance Act." He is critical of most politicians who talk of universal health care ? talk, he suggests, that is a wolf in sheep's clothing.) An advantage of Sicko, when it comes from such a flamboyant director, is that the official website contains plenty of references and resources. This is an improvement on his earlier work. I am starting to think this overweight, antagonistic man actually cares.But don't expect him to stop being Michael Moore . . . Early in the film, we have a mother who blackmails her health insurer by mentioning the movie. Towards the end, Moore takes 9/11 volunteers to Guantanamo Bay and thence to Cuba. He uses the Cuban health care system to get them treatment for their 9/11 related illnesses. He sends an anonymous cheque to his main detractor, whose medical bills are threatening his ability to attack Moore online. The blackmailing mother gets a vital ear implant for the young daughter. The 9/11 rescue workers get $120 medicines for a few cents (as well as free hospital treatment). Moore's opponent gets to pay his wife's health care. But without these fanfares would the picture have gone beyond little-known festivals? And were these things wrong on balance?He might be flashy, opinionated, even obnoxious, but I think I might start to like this man. He stood up to his own producer and financier, Harvey Weinstein, who wanted a scene critical of Hillary Clinton deleted. He risked seizure and prosecution over his visit to Cuba. He's soft on teenagers who download pirated copies of his film. The Urban Institute, a non-partisan policy research group, had mixed views of Sicko, but commented, "Though Moore is not interested in the details behind the outrages he has assembled, many of his fundamental points are nevertheless accurate." Which also seems to me quite a good assessment.The moans we have about the UK healthcare system suddenly seem pretty minor. The problems of third world countries hardly make the real problems of first world countries insignificant. And there are enough problems of a historical scale highlighted in Sicko for the intelligent ? perhaps more intelligent than Moore ? viewer to be worried. My own worry is that The United States of America has maybe already passed the point of no return. It will often lead the world in technology ? whether medical or military ? but the humanitarian hopes of the Founding Fathers have maybe been sunk beneath an impenetrable bureaucracy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard truth, is always tough to swallow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Sicko last night. I have watched all Michael Moore's movies from The Big One to Farenheit 9/11. The film and its subject matter looked aqs if it would be hard going for the viewer.I don't think anyone could say it was impartial or objective, it wasn't! The whole point of the film was to start a clarion call for Universal Healthcare in the United States. As an Englishman, the film serves to remind our own citizens the way we take our health care system for granted. To project the NHS as free is not exactly true. The Health Service is paid out of a National Insurance scheme on top of our PAYE taxes. However, the system is available, free at the point of need! We don't worry about affordability or bills, if we need acces to healthcare in an emergency.It is tempting to gloat to our American cousins, about the benefits of Universal Health provision. A provision that is socialist inspired and is probably the most humane aspect of our society. Polls after polls which features pride in Britain, the NHS is always guaranteed a top 3 placing. The system is by no means perfect and is always being under-mined by right-wing Tories who feign how much they care about it...but always push forward proposals that undermine the Institution with words like "independence" or "choice". Using spurious and calculating arguments to wheen people off their collective instincts in relation to healthcare.The criticism that can justifiably be aimed at MM, is that yes Universal Healthcare is humane, rational and more efficient in covering people's healthcare needs....unfortunately, it is a system that is always subjected to the whims of "democracy".In Britain, we had to learn the cruellest lesson, that if you want low taxes, don't expect high standard services! Now, people are looking to repeat that mistake, as people grumble about taxes, but also grumble that their taxes are wasted. Even though the evidence is overwhelming, that Britain has cut heart disease, cancer (many forms of..) and other illnesses substantially.I hope this film is seen by all...and all the people of Britain. Forget the rosy tint spectacles of MM...but what he did achieve, is that the NHS is something to be proud of and supported. That collective interests/concern &amp; action do make societies function far better, than crass individualism and the pursuit of profit.I notice in the forum, the quotes of Winston Churchill. However Churchill is a person who ordered the shooting of striking miners and he expended thousands of lives on the beach head of Galipolli. Yep, he was a great War Leader...but he was know friend to ordinary hard working people. It was those very hard-working people that removed Churchill in 45...to reclaim democracy and establish "our" NHS!The film came to its climax with the veterans of 9/11 obtaining medical treatment in Cuba after refusal from Guantanomo and its free healthcare facilities...OK the irony was compelling. The Fire crew in Havanna...well, I'm not ashamed to admit, but I wept.It was a human display..a display of empathy, solidarity and the potential of human beings to break down their barriers of citizenship &amp; Nationhood...and feel...for one moment!!! A true citizen of the world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AT&amp;T can be added to the SICKO list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i was able to see this movie after having a personal experience with AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T outsources their responsibilities to non AT&amp;T companies to do their work for them .Therefore, since they are not AT&amp;T employees they do not give a damn and are not flexible and understanding as a real AT&amp;T employees. as in my case AT&amp;T created a financial hardship.they outsourced to a company to pay employees on LTD at the end of the month,when i would receive my pay before the 15th of each month. that means that in December 0f 2006 i would received less than half a check( had to call mid January 2007 to receive the December 2006 pay). AT&amp;T and its new outsourced supplier expected me to pay the December 2006 and January 2007 premium of $412 for each month and to be received by them by January 1, 2007 when i was supposed to be paid on January 31,2007 which i received on February 5,2007.and the same for February 1,2007. as a result of not being able to paid and they did not receive the payment on the due date but was received 32hours at 8:13am and was internally processed by them 96 hours later, my dependents medical insurance and supplemental life insurance was canceled. i appealed and they denied reinstatement and i lost the security for my family of $112,000 life insurance upon my death since i suffer from primary pulmonary hypertension which has no cure.AT&amp;T teaches employees in quality, commitment,loyalty,customer satisfaction and to give your maximum, your their most valued asset but when it come to the employee it another stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very great movie on how we can fix the US health-care system woes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is why I adore guerrilla documentaries. Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9-11" and "Bowling for Columbine" were his best of the guerrilla documentaries he made. But "Sicko"---well, it is only slightly better than his former movies; yet even so, he scores again as the best alternative filmmaker not only in the United States---but perhaps the world. That is why the Cannes Film Festival adores him a fair deal.The flick goes into the severely crippled capitalist world of its current United States health care system. The system is described is coming very, very close to being dead-on-arrival because of spiraling costs, an exponentially exploding U.S. population, and the widening gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" when it comes to the right and the privilege to get health care. Especially when you get into the health insurance industry...where sometimes, one of the tricks of the trade insurers use to save money is the deny applications if you even have one "pre-existing condition." It is understandable. One example of a pre-existing condition is end-stage renal disease, because you have to be on dialysis, and dialysis treatments run about $40,000 a year in 2007. Yes. They are trying to save money, but denying too many applications will end up costing more people who don't have health insurance much more money in the long run.The best part of the flick was when Moore attempted to go from Florida---to Cuba---in order to find out what the health system in Cuba is like as it is compared to the United States. Obviously, with the still extremely tight restrictions on all American travelers going to Cuba or doing any business on Cuba, it is understandable that he was going to Cuba without the U.S. government permission. Yes, Moore was extremely desperate when he took himself and about 10-15 of his American strangers on a boat to go from Florida to Cuba. The restrictions against Americans---as well as the fears that socialists from Cuba could infiltrate the U.S. (and this is a normally fearful reaction after 9-11 happened) meant that the U.S. government censored filming of about 99 percent of his boat trip to Cuba in the film. The possible reason is that Moore could spread socialism in health care....and I can remember in another part of the flick when Hillary Rodham Clinton---one of my most adored political ladies---was awashed by a very special "code of silence" only reserved by the mafia and street gang members...where Moore stated that Clinton had to keep silent indefinitely about anything related to an universal health care system after Hillary went on a public crusade across the U.S. to fight the ravages of the U.S. health care system.It is like using marijuana in the U.S. Both actions are generally illegal. Currently U.S. travelers going to Cuba without governmental approval face fines as high as $10,000 and/or possible jail time, but I was astounded that he and his travelers were able to go close to the infamous Camp X-Ray in Guatantamo Bay, where Moore decried that their health care system is excellent despite the bad raps of inhumane treatment at this military prison, while across the U.S., health care is mostly terrible--especially for the poor and the working poor.If this film is enough to beckon a lot of Americans to create an universal health care system...this might be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched SiCKO and I am so glad we live in Canada. We don't have a perfect health system I'll admit it but if I had lived in the USA, I'd have been long since dead. Our system works great thank God. I was most saddened by the poor 9/11 rescue workers who were totally abandoned by the HMO's and the whole 9/11 social net and by your government. I recall Bush saying no one would be forgotten, well he missed out big time. To have to bring them to Cuba was such a coup, brilliant and how sad to see your very same 9/11 prisoners treated to only the best of care! Anywhere else that would be treason! I should start my own HMO in the USA...my company would only make 8% profit (subject to any audit) and the excess would be returned to the insured as proportional value credits. We would drive costs down, open more access and send people abroad if the rates to help them were too expensive in the USA. It could easily be done, in fact maybe I will start a HMO. Banks started out much the same too. We would send mobile patients to Canada and then on to Cuba for treatment and help out Cuba's infrastructure. If HMO's can make obscene billions of dollars ripping people off, imagine what I could do making a mere 8% profit and divesting the rest to shareholders (insured members). I'd design it like a credit union.Who wants to join my Health Medical Co-operative HMO? email me: paulcf@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Nixon be defended?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having heard the tape in the beginning of the film with Nixon declaring that he loves the prospect of a health care system that will result in not providing health care I really didn't have to see the rest of the film.The rest of the film is a swift political statement and hopefully an eye opener for many, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm able to see consequences and Nixon's words literally punched me in the stomach.The issue at hand is a serious one, natural selection as part of human evolution. I guess, had Himmler spoken in full sincereness, I'd rather have heard that than Nixon making fun. When it comes to natural selection there are dark and bright strategies. Universities for example, the best thing they do is to allow bright people to mate. That's a bright strategy. Testing for inheritable diseases and consecutive sterilisation, well, that's a dark strategy. So much introduction into the issue at hand.Of course, the less health care, the larger the chances that undesirable genetic developments are stripped from the blood stream of a people. In this light the Christian ideal of helping your next is nothing more then a willful poisoning of a people's health.This a dark strategy and I used a dark vocabulary to describe it. There are actually films that show some sympathy for this kind of view, like Lawrence of Arabia or Dune, but they too are by far more likable than Nixon. To strive for excellence is human too. It's not a crime as such, no, certainly not. In this respect though the question must be posed, whether this totally unhonourably killing off of people in need doesn't do more for the worse than for the better.How can the strive for excellence prevail? Only through honest admiration. When a society cannot open heartedly admire any more, what chances are left for those who live for excellence? They don't accumulate treasures and they don't accumulate friends, if anything, they accumulate people who are envious of them. And if there is no counter weight to those, no people who look up to them, they are lost, simply lost.Whether a person can take it some more or whether it can't take it any more, the person itself knows best. By spilling hatred around, you'll harvest its echo. Will a person who otherwise would consider not to have children because of its defects still consider it if it is convinced that it belongs to the moral elite of humanity? If you cut off a tree, it will grow back manifold. You don't smack other peoples' inferiority in their face like that! It's not to the good. By providing fair conditions those who are fit will have advantage enough to prevail, that human is a social animal and helps its own kind might turn out to be a considerable evolutionary advantage, since good genes that happen to be mixed with bad genes might, by virtue of this aid, be given enough time to separate themselves from bad genes in one of the subsequent generations, hence allowing for faster positive mutation.So, there's a lot to be taken into account and Nixon not even trying can certainly not be defended in any way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does one watch a film that challenges oneself to question the values of his/her society. This is definitely one of the most important films in that genre. When he asks us what kind of people are we, one has to look within his/her soul to answer that question. Michael Moore, that vilified documentarian by certain parts of society who proclaim family values, puts forth an argument about the need for a national health-care system by looking at the history of our system, the cold-hearted faults of that system, the systems of other countries, and the treatment of our true heroes and simple middle-class families by our own government and the health-care system that partially owns our government. He lays out his argument in a wonderful style that debunks most arguments that detractors have been using for years. The coup de grace is the ending in which Moore puts his money where his mouth is. It literally had me crying in admiration and wonder after sniffling in shame for our profit-at-all-cost attitude throughout this country. If you did not know anything about Moore before this movie, you would be an admirer. If you disliked him before now, you would be hard-pressed to argue with him after this wonderful work of art and social conscience. Families, companies, and organizations that employ workers are finding that the time has come to include a national health care plan as a part of their family values as the costs are overrunning them all. They need to look no farther than this film for the strong argument for starting the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must-see for every American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a big fan of Michael Moore's since his first few films. As a writer and former news broadcaster, even the sometimes silly way he presents things, never changed my level of support and belief in his work. I believe that Fahrenheit 9/11, whether one is a Democrat, Republican, Conservative, Liberal, Libertarian, Independent or nothing at all, is a film that could benefit every American, including students. His latest film, Sicko, is the same type of expose style he is known for, but the difference is that it is a completely bipartisan approach. Thus, the audience that it will appeal to and benefit, is much larger.I do not believe that any intelligent person would not understand or resonate with the facts presented in this film. Moore was careful to fact-check the data presented, and when he came tow-to-tow against CNN (a news organization that I regularly watch) - I was impressed with his bravado and fearlessness; the fact is, that CNN used different data than he did, to evaluate some of the statements in the film.Sicko may be considered controversial, for its unabashed peering into our decrepit health care system - a system that ultimately exists only for those who are fortunate enough to have a decent employer-paid plan, afford them on your own, or have so much money that you don't need a health plan.France, Canada and Cuba - made great showings for their health care system. While nothing is perfect, those countries seem to get the idea that taking care of their people is a priority; that health care should not be a privilege, but a right; and that it should be given to everyone, regardless of race, heritage, employment situation or social status. No intelligent person could really argue with that. I have always felt that tying in health care to a job was ridiculous. People become unemployed through no fault of their own, and whether or not they have health care, should not be dependent upon that.Moore does a fantastic job in explaining how America's lack of enthusiasm about a universal health care plan affects everyone negatively, and how ridiculous it is that getting sick in this country, results in the financial ruin of so many people, many of whom wind up dying due to lack of care.The correlation between the corporations behind the big drug companies and our government are astounding. It is evident that it is the reason why this nation does not believe it is a priority to care for its own people, unless there is an election and someone can get a few votes if it is addressed. That is a pitiful reason for our government to care.Sicko is probably the most relevant, informational documentary that I have seen in a very long time, and I see a lot of documentaries.Moore deftly handles a very serious matter, with shrewd accuracy, sensitivity, and humor. The balance was needed, or the film could have been too depressing to view.The bottom line, is that as great as this country is, we always seem to find money for the greedy echelon; the caste system is set in stone in this country, as evidenced by always having enough money to continue to reward people who do not deserve it (such as CEOs who do not perform; government officials who have been convicted of crimes, and pouring money over celebrities and sports figures simply because someone believes they are selling movie tickets, shoes or some other silly non-needed item).I would recommend this film for every American, particularly those entrusted with our government, and health care workers. We should be uniting on this issue, making health care the top priority in this country, that it deserves.(copyright) Susan S. Davis, 2007</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore was absolutely right in all that he documented.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I had to live some decades in the United States before migrating to a semi-socialist country, Australia. We have universal health care and it is vastly superior health care to anything America can produce. I know the English and French systems from practical experience and all those commentators who say that people do not know the true evils of socialized medicine do not, by my standards, have any idea of what they speak.I expected Moore's movie to focus much more tightly on the topic of American health care, or of greater input, its lack of health care. However, I was struck in the final section of his documentary about the longer bow he drew when he began to illustrate the pernicious disinformation that was spread by the health companies to discredit any governmental action that could alleviate America's extraordinarily bad economic system in general.The elites will stagger over themselves to portray any attempt by any level of government to alleviate personal distress as socialist or even worse, communist. This charade being bought by the companies would be bad enough but those same companies have managed to sell this disinformation to the majority of America. All of this sell in the name of exaggerating big-taxing federal governments, anti personal freedom, commie propaganda, bleeding heart social programmes is, in short, false information.To my mind the best segment was the interview with Tony Benn the retired English Labour leader. If anybody cares to understand what Moore is about, that short interview will isolate perfectly why the world, and I do mean that in its broadest sense, think the US is crazy--they are right.</fullReview>

The sound track is well matched to the film and should be enjoyable for anyone.on Politics; unlike F' 9 11 this is not a partisan film. While Michel is a liberal and the film can be seen to lean to the left, he has tried to make the film on the side of ordinary Americans and their health care needs. He is not calling for a Canadian system he is calling for a better American system. Conservatives I think should be able to view this film, see whats wrong with government and come to the table ready to make a better health care system for America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has bought the anti-Michael Moore PR, I pity you. You've missed out on one of America's greatest assets, who manages to find humor in our darkest side while giving us the information we desperately need to improve. Keep in mind that behind every topic he takes on are millions of public relations dollars to keep us in the dark. The best way to counteract truth-telling is to attack the character of the messenger. National health-care has been defeated whenever it arose going back to the days of Roosevelt. Moore's latest is provocative, insightful, and brilliant. If you live, see this movie, especially if you live in the US. The only thing he doesn't get into is how much the HMO industry and the AMA and big Pharma has not only controlled the delivery of health-care, but also what constitutes acceptable medical practice. You can only fit so many windmills into one movie I guess. Kudos Michael.By the way, it was Donald Rumsfeld (then president of Serle Pharmaceuticals) and Reagan who are responsible for giving us aspartame, a chemical that causes brain lesions. The FDA scientists were overruled by the politicos to obtain approval, when the science said no way. Not in 'Sicko', but 'Sweet Misery'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore does it again and even if 10% of what he says is true...it scared the hell out of me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have issues with Michael Moore. I think he spins very serious issues to best suit his own beliefs. To a certain extent he is pompous, outspoken, relentless, and I also think he thrives on exploitation. Some of this stuff is not a bad thing to be and Michael Moore is not a bad man and in fact one of his goals and one of the things his films always manage to do is WAKE US UP. This is never a bad thing. I've just grown accustomed to the fact that you have to take what he says and shows and creates with a grain of salt because there is definitely some meat to his films and SiCKO is no exception by any means. The beautiful thing about SiCKO is that you don't have to be from The United States of America to watch this film, appreciate this film and have it literally scare the pants off of you. I am in fact a proud Canadian and I am very scared right now for our own health care system in Ontario but I vow that I will NEVER complain again after seeing the condition of the U.S. Health care but instead I will look for a more creative way to prevent our own system from coming even close to the dangerous, life threatening system US citizens live with every day.Moore has this brilliant (and always entertaining way) of villain-izing those he disagrees with (ie: Bush, Republicans, past Presidents) he adds in the villain music that would normally be saved for epic battles or old Spaghetti westerns. He streams in black and white comedy bits or old movie clips that perfectly make his point or make you laugh or find humor and disgust in those he's referring to. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, in fact for media purposes it has made his documentaries uniquely very mainstream and very watchable. SiCKO has been classified by most as a 'comedy' but upon seeing it you won't find a lick of information that is funny in any way. And yet Moore's sarcasm and presentation at times makes you laugh...and that's what makes his documentaries so acceptable by the main stream public. Unfortunately SiCKO does in some ways fall victim to the negative aspects of Mr. Moore's clever film making. The stories are told from a small group of people in the same type of situation, with the same problems with the same group of people (in this case HMO's.) It's comparable to going asking a group of men or women who have just been apprehended following a bank robbery what they think of police officers. Chances are you're not gonna get a balanced nor positive response. In this, Moore even ventures to other countries in this case France, Canada, England and Cuba to weigh out their 'superior' 'free' health care systems. By the time you finish watching SiCKO you will believe France is the promised land where treasures are heaped onto you bountifully. Having lived in Canada my entire life I can tell you his view of Canadian Health Care was biased and not entirely correct. Our Health Care for most base needs as well as severe diseases and necessary medical treatments are entirely covered but we are also, in Ontario, having an emergency shortage of Doctors and Nurses, hospitals being closed, wards shut down, people being turned away not because of lack of insurance but lack of space in Hospitals that are only at 40% operating capacity. He asked patients in a London, Ontario hospital how long they waited to which they responded less than an hour, fifteen minutes...I can promise you in our local hospital (the biggest one in probably 200 square miles) a 5 hour wait would be a dream come true. Granted more serious problems are seen first. I also have to book an appointment with my family doctor at least 2 months, usually more, before getting to see him for 5 minutes and desperately trying to get him to listen to me because he is SO overbooked with patients. Moore visits France and tries to address your immediate thought of 'their taxes must be through the roof' by visiting ONE, UPPER CLASS family with NO DEBT, making well over the middle class wage who are living the high life. I also find it improbable and impossible that he took a group of American Citizens to Cuba where they were treated like gods and given the utmost Health Care at a moment's notice. So I have to assume that his blanket coverage of the miraculous French and English and Cuban health care systems is also not quite as balanced as he would have you believe. But nonetheless his coverage of US Health Care is disturbing. It scared me to death and I am scared at the thought of traveling to the United States and being denied Health Care. Moore still did something that many documentary film makers or protesters spend their lives doing and that is got his point across and made me and likely many others aware of the very dangerous situation that the US health care system faces. If only this speaks to a few politicians to not give up. And hopefully Moore instills a little hope and word of mouth for a very important fact. Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from SiCKO is very important, very fascinating, shocking, funny and one of the best documentaries of the year for certain. 9/10***Upon writing this review and watching the trailer I noticed something. In the scene where Moore states that the United States is 37th in the world for Health Care just above 'Slovenia.' You'll notice that below even Slovenia in 39th place is listed CUBA...the very place where Moore ends his film ranting and raving about how terrific Cuban health care is and where all of his followers are treated like gold. Something to consider!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary was engrossing from start to finish- not a single low point and Mike Moore's humor and wit were in top gear. Although much of it was extremely depressing, there were moments that really touched and moved me. For example, when the Cuban firefighters honored the American firefighters for their efforts on 9/11, it was heartfelt and deeply respectful. They said that all firefighters around the world were brothers. It was very touching. Also the treatment the Americans received when they were in the Cuban hospital made me cry. I felt their relief at finally being treated like human beings instead of a monetary expense and nuisance. A little love and care goes a long way in healing the sick so the barbaric system here is probably responsible for worsening people's health much of the time through the stress it creates. I also appreciate that Mike Moore celebrated Hilary Clinton's past efforts in trying to change the health care system and gave her the accolades she deserved at that time. Yes, she was sassy and sexy and she really believed in something great. However, it is a pity that Hilary has now forsaken her ideals and has accepted funds from the insurance companies. It seems that America makes it very hard for people to stick to their ideals because the bottom line is the dollar. I applaud Mike Moore for his work. And I thank him for opening our eyes to the injustice and lies of the ever grinding, mulching, merciless machine of Health Insurance companies. They are monsters that should be destroyed before they destroy us.</fullReview>

I could not help but shake my head at the stupidity of the majority of the USA and the unabashed cockiness of our legislators.

Times like these i feel very fortunate i am not a US citizen. But at the same time i feel very sorry for the people in the US. It's like this lady said in the movie, here in France (and most European countries) the government is afraid of the people. People get on the street if they are unhappy with the government. In America it's the opposite. It's the people who are afraid of the government. Dammit you Americans what's wrong with you people, why are you keeping up with this atrocity??

I have never seen such disgusting factors of our country.I have two small children of my own, and watching this made me choke up, cry, and sick to my stomach, thinking to myself, "is this what my family is going to have to go through".As of right now, my fiancée is insured through his job, my children through Mass Health, and no insurance for me. They denied me because my fiancée makes to much at his job. Now i don't see how this effects me, seeing how we are not married. How does his income allow them to deny me? During and even still after the movie, i asked my fiancée if we could move to Canada. I am scared! In fear for my children and family's well being and over all health.Our government sucks, and are a bunch of lying selfish thieves. I myself am ashamed to be part of this so called "free country". I mean why should we fight for a country who wont even stand up for us and our health. The more people die due to denial of health care, leaves the government with one less vote. Shame on YOU!!! And as for Micheal Moore, i salute you, and am glad to know that at least one man has the balls to stand up for whats right and show us "blind" Americans, whats really happening. Thank You, and keep on coming. If you don't do it, who's going to?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He has opened our eyes yet again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why the whole of America dislikes Michael Moore. It's not because he is dead wrong, it's because he's trying to make the blind see. The movie opened my eyes to many things unjust about the American health care systems. For some reason, Michael Moore promoting the HR 676 bill just seems frightening to most Americans. By God, why in the world would we want free health care? That just seems more complicated then being denied ANY health care. If I found out I had cancer, would my insurance cover the medical bills? Probably not. But in Canada, France, Britain, Norway... even CUBA, I would be able to receive the medical attention that I would need.These countries have longer lifespans, fewer death rates, more healthy babies, all because of their belief in a free health care system. The medications that we pay hundreds of dollars for, we could get for a few dollars in other countries, if we even had to pay at all. These countries believe in unlimited paid sick days, because when we get sick, we can't control it. These countries believe in free college tuition, so that those people that have the urge to help others heal, can do so. They have people that actually CARE. They WANT to make you better. These people believe in having paid maternal leave (up to a full year in some countries), so that way we can raise the babies to health and happiness. Children are our future! Why should we be denying them any kind of care? I encourage everyone who has not seen this movie to watch it. I know Michael has a tendency of blowing things a tad out of proportion, but he makes a valid point. From a man who had to decide which finger was more important to have sewn back onto his hand, to a mother who lost a child because she was denied care because their insurance did not cover it, to a man who lost his life because he was denied the care for his kidney cancer because it was considered "experimental", to a few of our own heroes from 9/11 who were given so much respect then, and now not getting any treatments that they deserve. Your eyes will be opened, you will laugh and you will cry. And you will learn to appreciate the country....of Great Britain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Michael Moore's best film/Docu to date and in my opinion should be nominated for an Oscar it was truly excellent.The film underlines the definition of the term 'healthcare' with the word 'Care' being seriously absent from the U.S. system. Morally, as a human being, I cannot believe or comprehend that such a greedy self centered system would inflict such pain and hardship on it's own people and their attempts to live just a normal life.I felt very saddened for those American's and the traumatic stories they have, it underlined the 'Profit before people' syndrome which is at the heart of the American society since the election of Nixon and it was not surprising that it was he who gave the thumbs up to this system,something I didn't know.If such a system was attempted here in Ireland their would be uproar,even though our system isn't perfect it's nothing like that of the U.S. Well done Mr.Moore you are doing your country a Brave service.Keep up the good work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sicko" - What's the diagnosis?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And the answer is: America, we DO HAVE A PROBLEM!!! RIGHT NOW!!! AND WE NEED TO FIX IT!!! My own personal stake in the story of Michael Moore's new movie "Sicko," which examines the declining health-care industry in the United States, is that I have an aunt who has Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and is frequently in &amp; out of the hospital for various illnesses, including stomach problems, infections, she can't walk on her own, and (what's most bizarre) is that her knees have started bending backward (like the extraterrestrials from "The Arrival" - didn't think that was possible). What's paramount, is that you can bet that her medical bills are through the roof since it seems that every so often she's in the hospital for something. Moore knows that America is sick in "Sicko" and in a whirlwind tour that spans the United States, Canada, Great Britain and France, sees why we are the way we are how we got that way. Moore's hypothesis is that in the richest, most thriving Western nation in the world, the insurance companies and medicine companies (in a not-so-subtle connection with the U.S. government) are so sick with greed, trying to line their pockets, that they forget their commitments to help the very people that pay them thousands and thousands of dollars on a yearly basis to take care of them when needed. It's sickening, and Moore, much like he did in previous happy-go-lucky patriot-fests "Bowling for Columbine" (2002) and "Fahrenheit 9/11" (2004), crafts a funny, heart-warming, and frightening expose of America's health-care system. Quite simply, "Sicko" is Moore's most universal film yet because as an American, the problems he tries to uncover here are something that ALL Americans can relate to. From a critical standpoint, the film is even better because Moore is mostly off-screen, providing an angrily humorous narration that is alternately angry, cynical, and hopeful. Toward the middle of the film, there are scenes where Moore is on-screen as he talks with Americans living in France and is embarrassed by the news that American expatriates there don't have to pay for college, health-care, or insurance. Moore is known for his outrageous stunts, and his well-publicized trip to Cuba with sick 9/11 rescue workers has landed him in a hot tub of legal trouble for reasons that to me, are still very unclear. Moore's answer, it seems, is universal health-care. But that would be bad, because it's socialism (oh, no!). "Sicko" is without question one of Michael Moore's best movies, maybe even better than "Fahrenheit 9/11" (which happens to be my personal favorite of his). The prognosis is bleak, unless we find a way to help those that can't help themselves simply because they can't afford to do it. And in the richest Western nation in the world, aren't we supposed to be the shining beacon of helping out others?My diagnosis:10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel a little odd writing this because personally I am a little wary of Michael Moore and the stuff he produces, I thought perhaps inevitably his astronomical popularity would affect the content of his films ... That he would continue to go for 'shock value' ...... couldn't have been more wrong.While I felt uncomfortable at Bowling For Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11 as it seemed perhaps SLIGHTLY exploitative of the Americans within, Sicko is a very different piece. I found it hard to connect with the people in BFC and F9/11 as the people in them seemed to be used dramatically to attack the US government for its ever escalating series of crimes against its own people. In Sicko, I was profoundly moved by the stories of the people involved. Moore wisely sticks with a few Americans (who genuinely provide the beating heart of the piece) and tracks their progress throughout the film, building to a deeply touching and heartwarming conclusion in Cuba. Moore himself seems different too, happier to stay behind the camera and allow the INTERVIEWEES to explain why they feel so betrayed and helpless at the hands of the government and the HMO's. His more observant demeanour is an entire turnaround too, he comes across as less of a flag-burner and seems genuinely involved and moved by many of the stories.While Moore does interview some aid workers who helped at ground zero, it is perhaps the singular focus on the despicable acts of the large health organisations that makes the film more involving. Not terrorists. Not disturbed teenagers with guns. Not shadowy government figures (while no doubt the latter have MUCH blame to take for the state of US health care). The focus here is on the despair brought on by faceless companies who told their customers they would protect them, help them and make them safe.The brief interview with Dr. Aleida Guevara (daughter of Che) pretty much sums it up:"Cuba is a little island in the Caribbean with little to no resources. We can do a lot to improve the people's health. This does not happen in the United States. Why are we able to and you are not? There's something to notice there, because the more a country produces, the richer it ism the better it should take care of its people".So Mr Moore, I bow down in praise for creating a genuine masterpiece. Sicko is a true study of human strength and despair, and I test anyone who claims to have a soul to not feel deeply moved by the conclusion in Havana hospital, where all those Moore had met are astounded to be provided top quality, free health care by caring and professional doctors ... an almost acid bite to the US. I hope something more substantial happens as a result of this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing! Point of view, no need to accept it and say its right...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I passed trough the comments here and what I see? Well , as much hate as understanding. This movie is not about how bad HMO is or how bad life in USA can be, but about how better it can get! Its about true stories so thats why many people don't like it. Truth is hard to take . We don't respect and don't appreciate our health and our styles of life when we are well and when we have a fine job. It takes a split second to loose everything and see the movie from different angle. There is no need to hate Michael Moore for what he thought should be good to be shown. Im coming for a small easter European country, which I bet 95% of Americans will NOT find on the map, but after watching this movie I realized Im blessed being raised there. Even that we are post communistic country we have benefits regarding health care. We have free dentist check ups and some free treatment per year. We have discounts when comes to buying pills and staying at the hospital. Even so people keep complaining, but thats another story. I lived in UK for short and when I went there I didn't have any medical insurance neither worked there and paid taxes, but once I got sick I got all the needed attention. So that made me believe in this movie. Yes, there was a skeptical point, but once it comes to the facts the movie truly touched me. Suddenly realizing that all these what we have been taught about USA is simply a dream. Not the "American dream" thought. Brilliant movie ! American should not hate him , but try to accept him. He is representer of the true. And yes HEROS are heroes, but any of us could get sick and become nobody. There is a saying in my country : when u are up on the stage everybody is your friend, but once you fall you are alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed this movie, although it is very sad. It shows the corruption of the American government and the American health care system is worse than that one many third world countries. People, including children are left to die because they can't pay thousands of dollars required by the insurance companies. Theses companies are making absolute millions by playing "God" with people and deciding, almost in a random way who gets treatment and who dies. It is sad to see how the Americans are being used and betrayed by their own country. It shows the capitalist character of America and its appetite for money over anything else. M. Moore is very entertaining and uses well researched information as always. The contrast with the European health care system is socking. It makes me feel proud of being European. I hope that Michael Moore starts a revolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is truly Michael Moore at his best. I think the way he portrayed other countries universal health care systems was very accurate. I live in the UK, and I felt like he portrayed the health care here very well, and accurately. I also believe that other health care systems were shown for what they were.I recently heard some things, Hannity and Colmes showing their side of the Cuban health care system, trying to debunk Michael Moore. Of course Hannity and Colmes would put something like that on their show, because the system works for them. Also I hear reports that people in the UK died because nurses didn't clean their hands properly. And that shows what the health care system is like? No, does it hell. It's just some nurse who was negligent and didn't take proper care, and that is on them and no one else.Don't listen to the debunking of news reporters, or the scathing criticism of journalists, the American health care system works for them, but it doesn't work for everyone, and that can't be ignored, that is what this film is about, whereas other countries have health care systems that work for everyone, and not just some.This film was truly entertaining, and I am not a crazed Michael Moore fan, I fell asleep during Bowling For Columbine and I never did see Farenheit 9/11, but this film was entertaining, informative, and very well done. Michael Moore truly is an auteur and his movies deserve to be seen by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whew!! Made my blood boil, and, personally, considering my vulnerability as an aging, far-from-wealthy, soon-to-be retiree, scared the bleep out me. This is not the country one would logically choose to grow old in. I left the theater with smoke coming out my ears ?like I'm not angry enough already? Imagine being the guy in some (I've forgotten which) U.S. Midwest city who cut off two fingers and couldn't afford to have them both reattached, so had to choose the ring finger at $12,000 over the middle finger at $60,000. (An added irony is this guy is a guitar player and the injury was to his left, fretting, hand.) Meanwhile, a guy in Windsor who cut off all his fingers had them all reattached, followed by a program of extensive rigorous physical therapy, without one Canadian cent of personal expense. Imagine being a retired aging Midwest couple who have raised a family, paid off their mortgage, and suddenly lose everything when the husband has back-to-back heart attacks, and the insurance company cancels their policy. Imagine being a surgeon who is forced to deny care to a terminally ill patient because his insurance company won't cover a procedure that would save his life. Imagine being the wife of that patient with a small child who must watch her 30 year-old husband die as a result. Imagine being a claims adjuster for a multi-billion dollar health-insurance company whose primary mission is to save the company money by denying coverage and claims, and who winds up needing her own expensive medication and treatment when she finally collapses from years of guilt and stress associated with making those decisions. Imagine being a renowned physician who sells her soul to a large HMO, climbs the corporate ladder with a high six digit annual income by helping set claims policies that result in an unknown, but probably large, number of deaths, then, inconsolable and heavy with guilt and grief, breaks down and bares her soul to a Congressional committee on national television. Imagine being a young G.P. in Paris who makes more than $200,000 a year, and works in a system that rewards him with bonuses when some of his patients quit smoking, lose weight, come up with lower cholesterol or blood pressure, a young G.P. who frankly tells Michael Moore, "I could not be a doctor in the U.S. I could not deny people care for any reason, certainly not because they can't pay for it." All of these scenes, and many more, come to life in this really powerful, not to mention entertaining, movie. What Michael Moore has put up there on the screen is not fantasy, it is not fiction. If you define "criminal" behavior as making decisions that knowingly lead to illness and death, bankruptcy and despair, for thousands of people, then the insurance-run health care industry in this country fits the bill. Watching this film brought tears to my eyes more than once. The Havana scenes were very powerful, the meeting between NYC and Havana fire-fighters nicely capturing the potential for a real marriage of justice and brotherhood. And the gratitude and relief displayed by the New York Hispanic woman whose throat got chemically fried doing rescue work at Nine Eleven's Ground Zero is unforgettable when she finally receives the care she so desperately needs in Havana and couldn't get in NYC, where, instead, she lost her job, had to sell her house and move into a shitty little apartment to survive, and had to pay $125.00 for each breath-giving atomizer that cost her exactly 3 pesos in Havana. (She presumably brought a large boxful back from Cuba.) What's different, and perhaps better, about "Sicko" is that, unlike his other movies in which Moore goes for the collective throats of the capitalist creeps ruining people's lives (not that I mind that), here he indicts the American health-care industry by simply contrasting it to the health-care industries of Canada, Britain and France (and Cuba). Footage of villains like Dubya and his pack of greedy crooks is notably absent. That's a good thing inasmuch as it helps mollify reactionary workers who don't like to see their political heroes savaged, and lends the film a calmer, less fanatical, more even-handed atmosphere. It's a bad thing inasmuch as I personally love seeing footage of Dufus Dubya with his foot in his brain-dead mouth because I love to hate the bastard so much (and there are a couple very funny clips of the moron at work ...watch for his comments on obstetricians, for example). But this particular documentary strategy works well because it presents a scathing critique by simply contrasting two radically different approaches to national health care. I'd say the difference between the U.S. system and those of other industrialized western countries is obvious and dramatic. Here the system is not geared toward saving money (or lives) through ongoing preventive and preemptive care. There it is. Here the system, which is more expensive, leads to more illness, untimely death and despair for millions. There it provides universal, cheaper (and better) care and the peace of mind that comes from knowing you'll get treatment without selling the farm to get it. The statistics and testimony of millions of satisfied people prove the case. I mentioned how much this movie scared me, and, really, sparked a jealousy of the British, French, Canadians, actually the folks in every other western industrialized country, who don't have to face my fears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie while on vacation in Florida. I was enjoying the weather and the welcome I received immensely and did not really feel like going to a movie which could possibly harm my excellent impression of the US. On the other hand, it did offer me the possibility of discussing health care first hand with native Americans and comparing the system with that which prevails in my own country and the rest of Europe. The fact that I calculated that in my personal case compulsory health insurance combined with a voluntarily acquired supplementary insurance whereby all expenses relating to medical care, hospitalization and eventual surgery are included and which amounts approximately to the total of 900 dollars per annum, seemed downright incredible to the many people with whom I discussed the issue. Health care undoubtedly seems to constitute a major problem in the US and is certainly one of the darker sides of an affluent society. I fully understand at present why it will constitute one of the major themes the Democratic party will focus on during the next elections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong documentary with very important information</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant documentary that discusses a "hidden danger" (well, for upper middle class professionals, that is) in our seemingly perfect "American Dream." This is probably one of the best Moore documentaries, and is definitely done more even handedly than "Farenheit 9/11". While Moore still uses some cheesy tricks to toy with the emotions of the audience, and some flashy stunts that are completely meaningless (the beginning of the Cuban section), the true stories of all the people who got denied life-saving medical procedures from the HMOs were heart wrenching.I understand that the national health/medical insurance system in Canada, England, France, and Cuba aren't as "perfect" as the documentary portrays, but just from talking to people who are from those countries, they are a huge step ahead of our privatized system. Yes, implementing a national health care system haphazardly would probably hurt more than help people (i.e. poor doctor's pay, no freedom of choice, etc.), but if the plan were implemented thoughtfully (I really enjoyed hearing how the doctors' pays are determined in England based on their performance), a government controlled system would be better than what we have today.Maybe it's because I am lucky enough to work at a big company that the HMOs treat very well (so far haven't gotten any medical treatment requests denied, knock on wood) that I haven't paid much attention to how pathetic our health system is, but this movie definitely woke me up. There could be one day where I'm in need of a huge medical procedure and I'm either between jobs, or the HMO decides to deny that procedure just that one time, and I would be royally screwed.What can I do about this? At this point, I don't know, but knowing that the problem exists is part of the fight. I strongly encourage everyone to go see this documentary, filter out the "stunts" that Moore often likes to use, and understand that we HAVE a problem with our health care system. Be aware of future local or national politicians who pledge to fix the problem, and try to support any cause that will lead to a reformed system. If anyone has a better suggestion, please share it with all of us, as we need to stop the practice of "sacrificing" a life for better profits that the HMOs are doing right now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the bad news: Some of the interviews go on a tad too long. And yes, Michael Moore gets a little ponderous on screen. He could have minimized himself a bit.Now the good news: Like so many of Moore's films, watching SICKO is like hitting your funny bone ? you don't know whether to laugh or cry. That's the kind of reaction one should get from any good film. Great comedies make you laugh till you cry. And great tragedies sometimes force you to laugh, albeit weakly, just to relieve the tension they produce.Moore gives us both in spades in this documentary, which speaks very, very frankly to the ridiculous and totally inefficient way we deliver health care in the U.S. If anyone wants to learn more about this issue, I strongly recommend reading Kip Sullivan's THE HEALTH CARE MESS, available online at authorhouse.com.THIS FILM SHOULD BE SEEN BY EVERY POLICY MAKER AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. Unfortunately, not all will. And undoubtedly, the ones who most should see it won't. That's too bad for this country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Prescription for Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, filmmaker Michael Moore courts controversy and hits one out of the ballpark with "Sicko," his stinging and often heartbreaking indictment of the largely dysfunctional American health care system.In his new film, Moore has toned down much of the inflammatory rhetoric and personal diatribes that defined his earlier work - although he is certainly not averse to employing the occasional bit of theatrical grandstanding or the intermittent cheap shot if it helps to more effectively get his message across. And the message here is that the medical system in the United States is seriously ill, if not, indeed, on life support itself. As usual, Moore personalizes the issue for the audience by focusing on a few specific people who have fallen victim to the bureaucratic nightmare that is the American system of managed care. Through an accumulation of largely anecdotal evidence, he shows how working-class people are often driven to near-bankruptcy by the enormity of their medical bills or, even worse, how they often get sicker or even die either because they have no insurance at all or because the insurance companies refuse to cover the operations or medications the patients need to get better. Moore is always at his most convincing - and his least polemical - when dealing with these individual cases.Having completed his "diagnosis," Moore next moves onto the "cure," which he sees as a universal health care program run by the government. This, of course, is where he gets most into trouble with those on the Right and the powers-that-be (i.e. the insurance companies and corporate CEO's) who have the most to lose from any kind of system reformation. To prove the superiority of "socialized medicine," he takes his film crew to Canada, Britain and France to check out the medical systems there. Not surprisingly, he encounters only the most glowing reports from doctors, patients and the average man-on-the-street concerning the quality of the medical treatment in those countries. Finally, in his most blatant example of political theater, he rounds up several 9/11 rescue workers, all of whom have developed serious illnesses as a result of their time spent at ground zero, and takes them to Cuba to receive the medical treatment these modern American heroes have been denied in their own country. Moore's in-your-face style may not make for the most impartial examination of the issue, but it does make for one heck of a compelling human drama.Moore is not a "documentarian" in the egalitarian sense we have grown accustomed to from television. He doesn't study both sides of an issue, and he feels no compunction to provide a reasoned, carefully balanced debate that allows differing opinions to be expressed. Instead, he is a man hellbent on a mission, an individual deeply concerned with righting the wrongs that he sees in his society. He also just happens to be an artist with enough film-making skill and talent to be able to convey his passions in a clear and largely convincing way to a mass audience. "Sicko" is a much less "playful" movie than either "Bowling for Columbine" or "Fahrenheit 9/11." Moore doesn't indulge in as many self-aggrandizing stunts or parlor tricks as he did in those other films, and he is more willing to move off into the background to allow the people in the movie to speak for themselves. The tradeoff for this approach is that there is also a lot less humor.All throughout the movie, Moore is constantly appealing to our better angels. How, he wonders, can a people as great and generous as Americans tend to be, allow their fellow citizens to go on suffering when the remedy seems so clearly in their grasp. Whether universal health care would be just another panacea, or whether it might actually turn out to be the cure for what ails us, only time will tell. But Moore's point is that the time has long since passed for us to do something serious and concrete to address this problem. "Sicko" may, indeed, be "propaganda," but, if it is, it is propaganda in the service of a salutary purpose. And, after all, Moore's is hardly the only voice out there debating this issue, for there are powerful and well-financed forces lined up on the other side. He may, at this point, be just one little David facing down the Philistines with their corporate lobbyists and special interest money; but Moore has faith that a citizenry, armed with righteousness and passion, can slay a whole army of insurance company Goliaths - if they just put their collective minds to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a provocative film. As a single, middle-aged, highly educated woman who was once self-employed with a thriving consultancy, I am now forced into a full-time job for an employer, just to have decent health care benefits. Otherwise, I cannot afford my own health care insurance with all my serious chronic illnesses and pre-existing conditions (would cost me at least $700 a month to cover myself), which means I can no longer be self-employed at the age of 52. My dearest friends in Britain, Australia and Germany, my colleagues, are all doing well as self-employed talented and gifted single women, who don't have to worry about their health care coverage. I have had "bag lady" fears, and felt bitter about what I have had to endure to slave away my best hours of the day to get health care coverage, when I have devoted my life to being a writer and speaker who should be working for herself, writing books and doing research. But like so many other talented Americans, especially as single/divorced women past our 50's, we must dumb ourselves down and do some stupid job instead of following our callings, or living up to our full potential, just to have our medications paid for and our health care covered....and even then, some insurance company could just deny us at any point...hardly any security. (Pardon my long introduction, now I'll get to Sicko.)When I saw Sicko, I felt so very validated and supported. Michael Moore does a fantastic job showing his viewers just how Americans (including middle class, insured, educated ones) work ridiculously hard,compared to most advanced industrialized countries, just to have the most basic human safety nets of health care,child care, family leave, vacation time, and higher education. Our quality of life is NOT so good! Nor is our quality of health care, that is, if you are outside of the top 20% income level. Most Americans just don't see that, but Sicko does show a glimpse of this.Thank you, Michael Moore for giving mainstream Americans a chance to see that our way of life is actually somewhat backwards and lacking in basic human values and human rights for health care. I agree with him, and I am so sick of the selfish, sink-or-swim, in-your-face, do-it-yourself American mentality. He proposes a "we" mindedness, rather than a "me" mindedness. I hope Universal Healthcare can become a reality within the next ten years, but I must admit, I see a hard uphill battle for that.</fullReview>

Everyone knows Moore is liberal and a big supporter of socialism, and this films pokes plenty of fun and exposer on the right wing again making a mock of president George W. Bush, and even propagandizes former Republicans legends Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon(who's credited with starting the corrupt HMO's and other health organizations). Yet during it all Moore shows the common man from people without health insurance to people with insurance that have fatal illness like cancer and tumors, but yet their insurances don't cover enough of their treatments due to outrageous cost which bankrupts and has many to relocate which is sad. Many scenes and stories from the film are sad they make you want to cry just like the ones that involve kids and the poor it really makes you want to cry that insurance companies turn people away. Moore is brilliant by showing the differences in the health care systems of other countries like England, France, and Canada with interviews from the citizens in those countries and other experts it shows just how well socialized medicine is proving democracy unites people and organizational government sets people free, because they can speak and think on their own. Plus it's free! You name it medicine and everything the government even does citizen laundry and doctors make house calls can you believe it! Moore really tops it off by taking now impaired 911 rescue workers to Cuba for medical treatment, to show in contrast just how better the medical care is in Cuba under the supposed mean Castro, when oddly enough they couldn't qualify for benefits under our money hungry and selfish government. As always Moore provides pop culture mixed in with humor, but really his message is strong what has America came to he really proves in this film that government and medical insurance companies go hand and hand in being corrupt and all they care about are making a buck and keeping you sick in the meantime. After watching this film you will believe health care is a crisis in this country and needs to be fixed with both political and social reforms. It's sad that something so important like health care has became nothing more than a big money making business as one sees greed corrupts. It's nice to have a Michael Moore around to make film like this he's clearly an inspiration at a time when many inspirations are running out. "Sicko" will leave you thinking about how important life is and feeling concern for people and hoping for a change in America's health care system. Way to go again Michael Moore keep up the great work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my teenager. I want to see it again with my whole family (husband and two younger kids). There is a larger, more spiritual, "we are our brother's keeper" message in this movie, that is far superior to Michael Moore's other films. I left feeling encouraged that finally, someone is going out on a limb saying we should care about those less fortunate than ourselves. Michael Moore's courage and convictions never cease to amaze me. He may be hated by hard-core capitalist profiteers, but he speaks truth and LOVE. The man has heart. The movie is funny, educational, spiritual, and thought-provoking. I think this movie is a must see for anyone with a conscience.God Bless the USA and GOD BLESS MICHAEL MOORE.</fullReview>

Talk about a smoke screen to help the rich get richer and the powerful get more powerful. How can you stand it?Maybe the French example from the movie of protest leading to real democracy is the answer.

		<fullReview>A less strident Moore this time around is just as successful in getting his message across. I don't know how people can think we have it so good after seeing how other countries handle health care.The audience of most older folks clapped at the end, which was surprising given I live in a rather conservative area. Several people were infirm and one was even on crutches. I have a feeling these were real examples of the problems many face with health care in the U.S. I don't suppose we go to see a Moore film for a laughfest, but he does show that humor, biting though it is, is a wonderful way to make a point. I highly recommend the film, even for Moore's critics.</fullReview>

But wait, maybe he would of wanted me to watch it for free on these "underground" websites; after all, it is what any anti-corporative person would do, right? Anyways, this film brings a very sensitive, compelling, and impartial look of how America is slowly becoming a nation of "structural corporatism" (if there is such a definition), specially towards the services, WE the people need and should demand as a society that repeatedly calls its self "free" or "truly democratic". Through the service of Health Care -and its comparison with other nations worldwide- he manages to bring a message far beyond its apparent intentions: Make the American people raise from their comfortable chairs of ideologies and re-unite each other as a nation, fight for what WE need, and return democracy by making a government that will follow our demands -not the other way around. Thus, I highly recommend it (specially for those who work in a health insurance company ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bowling for Columbine was really good, Fahrenheit 9/11 was OK. Sicko, was brilliant.Sicko brings up a very important issue in the USA today, one that has gotten very little attention, in comparison to its importance. Although this movie is about a serious problem, it still has those witty feel-good moments that Michael Moore provides. They provide a light in the dark, so that you don't feel depressed and spend the entire movie sobbing (although there are a fair share of moments where it's hard to keep yourself from crying), but rather you feel inspired to want to change the situation.He points out how the people in France protest to make their lives better, instead of fearing their government. He shows Americans what the true meaning of democracy is.In short, this is a great movie, which, hopefully will change the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scathing Indictment of Health Care in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to separate the controversial, hot-button ticket issue of American health care and the cinematic production of a documentary on the same topic. In characteristic Moore style, Michael Moore is back using a wry humor that hurts to get his message across, using along the way testimony of the common average everyday people as well as a few other professionals. What I've attempt to review is Mr. Moore's ability to keep the information interesting and relevant, meaningful and accessible. The use of music is good. The pacing and tempo usually exciting. There were a few points in the movie where my mind wondered and the scene just wasn't as compelling. But the emotional connection, the suffering observed in America in contrast to Canada, Britain, France, and even Cuba seemed like a slap in the face for America. Some of Mr. Moore's manipulated, soft-touch seemed a bit amateurish (perhaps to offset the potential seriousness of his actions). Overall, the movie flowed reasonably well, the brief stories mostly fascinating and told well. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most fascinating thing about this movie is that people in this country react to it as if it said something wildly novel or controversial---like, say, that they found intelligent life on Mars after all, or the proof that God exists. Instead, it just elaborates a few simple observations that are most likely familiar to anyone who doesn't have their head way up their rear end. To wit: (1) The American health care system is monumentally effed up, it serves the interests of the haves, and leaves the have-nots fall by the wayside. (2) There are different ways of doing things, which serve the general population significantly better. (3) Superior alternatives have been adopted throughout the civilized world.I mean, c'mon, can anyone in all honesty even dispute those things? Apparently, they do. I suppose you do not know just how bad you have it until you familiarize yourself with how good other people have it, and many people seem reluctant to do so, either out of sheer disinterest or ignorance, or maybe because of what they may find---that they have been duped massively by their health care industry and the politicians on its payroll, and that health care is another of those significant aspects of life where America is not #1, not even close in this case.In that regard, this movie is an important one---it shows to people in this country what they could be shooting for, and how miserable their situation is by comparison. Whatever one might think of Moore or his style of making his points, he picked an important topic, he picked the proper point of view, and he made an engaging movie about it. That's what he gets most of my 8/10 for.Personally, I am not a great fan of Moore's style of making his point, I prefer a more intellectually honest style of debate that strives for more "water tightness" in the points it makes. However, he does show some improvement on this front, although I have no doubt that many of his points will be (probably have been already) picked apart by his detractors.Nonetheless, his main thrust is of course quite on target, and if this movie helped stimulate discussion about this issue it has made a bigger contribution than most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of SICKO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The intent of the film SICKO is quite clear. It describes how the United States citizenry is befuddled into believing that universal health care (AKA "socialized medicine") is a communist plot. This mindset is so prevalent, so mainstream, and so immovable that it forced Hillary Clinton to give up her fight for universal health care in a trade for affordable health care, a plan that appears to embrace the current lobbyist-sponsored health care insurance scam. The film successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) campaign against a clearly workable solution to providing quality health care for every citizen in the United States.The film has some humorous elements in it, and is not as crass as I thought it might be. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are millions being spent to promote the governments new drug plan, marketing group coverage, and promoting the "free market" health care system that makes billions. I think that Michael Moore presents some very compelling arguments for socializing health care. It is easy to dismiss Michael Moore as a muck-raking, anti-American, Upton Sinclair Jr. like propagandist. We owe it to ourselves to be skeptical of Michael Moore because he has millions to gain from scandal and public outcry. We also owe at least that much skepticism to our politicians because of where their campaign contributions come from. I think we should be at least that skeptical and our traditional media outlets, who's income depends entirely on ad revenue and who's objectivity wanes with every Tele-Com merger. Who is going to tell us the truth about the dark side of Capitalism? If there is a lesson we should have learned over the last 6 years, it is that complicated issues can't be solved by only talking to those who already agree with you. All sides need to be considered and carefully examined. In a county as rich and powerful as this one, the voices of the weak and poor are increasingly faint. We need to honestly examine if we measures up to the ideal of "One Nation, under God with Liberty and Justice for All." If this is the kind of nation we truly want to be, then we need to be informed without self-righteousness, vigilant without paranoia, strong without cruelty, and generous without fail. This movie suggests that there can be vast improvement in our system, and we need to give the ideas and plights of the people in this film our attention, even if it fails to win our agreement.</fullReview>

It looks into the history (past and present) of the healthcare system in the US, as a result, it exposes the grave inhumanity inherent to the current system. Healthcare in the US is without a doubt the most expensive in the world. Just like any other US institution, the primary focal point to is generate capital, not help people. The movie also does a good job when it comes to comparing the US healthcare to that of other socialist or communist countries. I grew up in a "third world" country, while the country was poor, healthcare and education were mostly free. Medication is cheap as well. It is ironic and sad, that the most powerful country in the world barely takes care of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great choice of opening night film at the Melbourne International Film Festival. Controversial, entertaining, socially and politically relevant, it had people in their seats in animated conversation after the film ended, continuing to the after-party. What more could you want?Michael Moore is always good value - when he's good he's good, and when he's bad, he's better. A buzz preceded the film and for good reason. No doubt the buzz will grow locally.Ever since his 1989 debut with Roger and Me, continuing with his TV series The Awful Truth (which screened here some years ago on SBS) and his more recent Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 911, Moore has shown he has a knack for making serious social and political issues accessible and digestible for cinema audiences. Using irony, sarcasm, humour and entertaining visuals along with serious explorations of the truth, he has been credited with a major revival in documentary. So much attention does he command that now a documentary has been made about him: Manufacturing Dissent: Michael Moore and the Media, also screening at MIFF, challenges the methods used by Moore.The failings of the US health system are reasonably well known ? the wealthiest country in the world does not provide adequate care for the health of its citizens to the extent that life expectancy is relatively low (just above Cuba). Some may question how relevant a film about the US health system is to us as Australians? Well, quite a lot, actually. More on this soon.The film starts off with a few case studies of individuals who have been denied cover by their health insurance companies. Moore's methodology is similar to that employed in Bowling For Columbine. All his films could be called 'agenda films', but like Columbine, there was a lot of investigative work in order to uncover various rorts, bad practices and political conniving.Hilary Clinton put much effort into promoting a national health scheme in the early days of her husband's presidency and was subjected to a massive demonisation program by the conservatives that basically killed the idea. "Terrible waiting lists", "poor standards of health", "lack of choice of doctor" were various doom and gloom predictions by the Republicans.Much of the film is spent demonstrating how false this propaganda was. Moore travels to various countries interviewing families, patients and medical staff to get their perspectives on the local health systems. This is where the relevance to Australia comes in. The systems in Canada, England, France and even Cuba are all better than ours ? but are strangely similar to what we once had. Under the current government (though certainly not started by it), we are clearly moving in the direction of the US model (and not just in industrial relations). We have much to fear.There were many profound moments in the film:* A young French man who had lived all his adult life in the US but found he had to move back to France when he was injured, in order to get medical treatment.* A community of Americans living in France who couldn't believe how good the health and social welfare system was compared to home (Moore suggests this may be why the US is quick to alienate or denigrate France). One woman was brought to tears when she described the guilt she feels for accepting the benefits that France provides. As someone with a strong attraction to France, this gave me even more reason to want to go there.* One of the most profound moments was when a group of 911 volunteer rescue workers travels with Moore to Cuba, and the reception they received from this so-called evil nation. It brought this writer to tears.There are many criticisms of Moore's style, and no doubt many of them are valid, if not over-stated. We are subjected to daily lies in our media that don't get the same scrutiny that Moore does. Why? He is a thorn in the administration's side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know just how he feels...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My work colleagues always know when I've been dealing with our health insurance company. They come into my office and find me weeping (usually tears of frustration) and quietly walk out again. And frustration was also a feeling I had by the end of Michael Moore's latest offering, Sicko. It's almost very good, but his tendency to go completely over the top, stops it being the truly damning analysis of American health care that it should be. Moore has a tendency to lose objectivity when he needs it most, which dilutes the effect of his otherwise powerful films. This irritates the hell out of me, and I'm on his side! What Moore gets very right in Sicko, is the decision to concentrate not on the millions who have no insurance at all in the USA. That course would have left the way wide open for opponents of universal care to insist that those with no cover are slackers, the undeserving poor, or people who are incapable of managing their lives adequately (not that I'm suggesting that's true! But I've heard it said many times in this country.) Instead Moore concentrates almost entirely on those who have actually done everything right, got jobs, paid into their system, been pillars of society who thought they'd be OK, then, when they found themselves 'on the sharp end", actually needing serious care, been totally let down. The mother whose baby died because she was turned away by an out of network facility, for instance. Don't get me started on 'in' and 'out' of network?..arghhhhhhhhhh!!!My son recently broke his wrist. Did I rush him to the ER? Did I hell. The first place I rushed was my insurance company's website to find out which was the "In Network" facility. THEN I phoned the insurance company just to double check, THEN I phoned their 24 hour nurse support line, described his symptoms, and got someone the other end to utter those magic words "You should take him to the ER" (I got her name of course and made sure they were monitoring the call, "for quality assurance purposes".) My son stood limply by while I did this, clutching his swollen and painful wrist. Don't worry ? I'd given him a couple of aspirin, I'm not completely heartless. And yet still I got the bills, because it's quite possible to go to an In Network facility and be seen by an Out of Network doctor. Many phone calls and several icily polite but insistent letters later, I have got the bills down to a "mere" $800. Not pleasant but at least I won't be losing my house, (unlike some of the poor b*^@*tards in Sicko who had the temerity to contract cancer or liver failure.) And I reiterate, I HAVE health insurance. The only answer it seems, is to take your laptop to the ER, hope they have WiFi, and check every doctor's accreditation before you let them near you. But as my insurance company actually once referred me to a doctor who had died (he was still listed on the website), I'm not sure even that would work. And for God's sake don't lose consciousness. You really don't want to be attended to by an out of network doctor while you are out cold. That could bankrupt you. As Moore shows, the policy of American health insurance companies, is to deny almost every claim. If you are tenacious enough (or just bloody minded and persistent like me), you will probably get most of what you should in the end, but it will be very hard work. And you will weep.The main reason why I am persistent, is because I come from part of the developed world where "evil" universal health care is the norm. I'm a Brit. The National Health Service (NHS) is far from perfect, you may have to wait for non urgent care, but mostly you'll get excellent care, and no one will ever ask to see your check book. Moore wandered around an NHS hospital in an amusing scene, asking people leaving with their new infants, how much they had paid to have a baby in an NHS hospital. Bemused new parents laughingly replied "Nothing of course". And in that bastion of wickedness France, you can even get after-care when you get home with the offspring. The only finance office he could find in the NHS, was paying the patients their fares home! AND the doctor still had a beautiful house and a smart car. In America, the infant mortality rate is shaming, and every ER room is full of people with sniffles who should be at the doctor's office instead ? but they have no doctors because they have no health coverage..... and on it goes.Then there are whole aspects of the lack of universal health care that he ignored - presumably for lack of time. People who stay in jobs they should really leave, because they don't dare lose their health insurance. Considerate employers - yes there are some - who put off firing inadequate staff, because they know these people, and their children, will lose their health care. This does not make for an efficient economy.Finally, where Moore failed most with Sicko, was in his attempt to shame the US government by taking a group of 9/11 survivors to Cuba for treatment. I know how he feels, but the sequence was way over the top, far too emotional, totally subjective, too long and left him wide open to criticism that the Cubans had suckered him. Moore's problem's that he just doesn't know when to stop. Which is a pity, because the USA needs people like Michael Moore, who are not afraid to put their head above the parapet and make a noise, at the risk of being labeled unpatriotic. With a little more discipline, he'd be a great film maker. He's not quite there yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is the best at taking a nationally crucial issue(child violence, terrorism, health care) and shaking it for all the entertainment value it is worth, and whether he states a fair argument or not, it doesn't seem to matter much to him in the end as long as he makes his biased point. And, he makes big money either way, and it makes me really wonder if he cares as much about the issue he is promoting than the money he is making, as everyone is corruptible if the price is right, and I mean all of us. I can see Moore now after the success of his previous films......"what other crucial issue in America is obviously unethical and ridiculous, so I can make a one-sided movie about it that is a big crowd pleaser and makes me lots of money too".Moore did a lot of things right in Sicko, and made an impressive argument for national health care here as he compared our profit-based system unfavorably with the National Health Service in Canada, France and the UK. But, he left out the one crucial point that would have helped convince me and most discerning others that it would be the best way to go in America. America really hates high taxes, so he steered clear of what it costs in those other countries to pay for their national health care programs in individual taxes. Not one word about actual taxpayer costs was said, and many thousands of words about how much the citizens love their NHS. That was a big mistake for viewers like me who need to see a fair argument from both sides before judging. I truly loved the reality of medical pros in those other countries doing their work due to actual medical need and standards and not mainly for the big money it makes for the medical/insurance community here, as I do think we are approaching critical mass in America in our selfish and greedy pursuit of the capitalistic buck over everything else, and think our money-driven system is as well on its way to collapse as the earth is due to global warming. Neither cannot go on much longer as is.During a vacation in New Zealand, which has the same NHS that Canada and the UK has, I needed a crown fixed. It cost me all of $20, and I was not even a citizen! It would have cost NZ citizens $0, and would have cost me at least $750 here. Aother American I met there broke his arm skiing, and it also cost him $20 to get it taken care of. And, there were great nationalistic attitudes in everyone we met too, even with their high but proportionate taxes, as those high taxes make for a more egalitarian society that cares to take good care of everyone. Kiwi's actually like their gov't and how it serves them! What? How's that for an eye-opener compared to here? That makes a strong argument for NHS there. But, NZ has a manageable 4 million people...would it work in our 300 million person USA? Not a clearcut issue at all, at least not yet. We are nearly out of control in everything social, so I am doubtful.However, regarding Sicko, anything and any way that makes Americans more aware that we must first control and then stop our throw-away and senselessly selfish way of living is crucial to display worldwide for all to see, and Moore is doing his part there and I applaud him for it even if I disagree somewhat on the details in how he does it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosive, yet entertaining, expose of U.S. Health Care; sure to ignite controversy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We can always count on filmmaker Michael Moore to address pressing social issues, and to try to convert audiences to his point of view. Sicko, which deals with our country's health care system, is no exception. Although he does not appear in the film until the halfway point, his narration and methodology conform to his earlier films like Bowling for Columbine (about gun violence) and Fahrenheit 911 (dealing with the 9/11 disaster, the Saudis and the administration.) As before, he interviews people adversely affected by how health care is administered in this country.In researching the movie, he used his website to ask people if they had any complaints about their health care providers. In one week, he received over 35,000 responses, most of which dealt with how patients died or were required to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses for medical procedures. Providers routinely denied claims for life-threatening injuries or diseases that were pre-existing, were not preapproved or were experimental, and rewarded employees for doing so. What shocked me was that Sicko dealt with people who were insured, but vastly underestimated how much their costs would be from deductibles and co-pays, and wrongly assumed life-saving procedures would be paid for at all.Mr. Moore visits other Western nations with national health care like Canada, England and France to compare them to our system. He explores issues like average life spans in those countries, salaries and lifestyles for doctors, waiting times and the costs for people using the system. The findings are startling, even when he visits Cuba, in violation of U.S. restrictions. (We're all waiting to see if and how he's penalized for going there.) All of this is presented in a very down-to-earth and humorous manner.Some of the more interesting interviews involve Americans living in France, volunteers working at Ground Zero rescue operations (also known as heroes by our elected officials), uninsured Americans, doctors providing care to suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, survivors of insured patients who died after being denied care, and insured people bankrupted by medical expenses.Sicko shows testimony before Congress on methods used by HMOs and health-care providers to maximize profits at the expense of patient care. We see how much Members of Congress receive campaign contributions from the health care industry, only to be rewarded with high-paying jobs in the companies they were supposed to oversee. In fairness, this rotating door whereby Congress is rewarded with industry jobs when they leave office for delivered legislation is not limited to this industry. Is there a political bias to this story? While the movie praises Hillary Clinton as being the pioneer in trying to introduce a modified national health-care system, it later points out that today she is the second highest recipient of campaign funds from those same folks. (In reality, her president husband deserves credit for the 1993 effort, not her as his designated representative.) Mr. Moore shows that privatizing health-care did not begin with the current president, but can be traced back to Richard Nixon recorded on tape. We see film footage of our president's father warning about the dangers of "socialized medicine," and a recording of Ronald Reagan warning of the dangers of government coming between you and your doctor. This argument suggests that it's bad for the government to intervene between you and your doctor, but OK if the HMO and provider does it instead.I would have liked to see Mr. Moore interview opponents of national health-care and to address or rebut their arguments. This could have included Health-care industry executives, elected officials or editorial writers. One such contrary view appeared in the Wall St. Journal, where a Canadian doctor laments about long waiting times for procedures and reforms in other countries to privatize more government provided health-care. I'm not sure if this was because they refused to be interviewed or were not solicited, but we do not get to hear the other side.Whether you agree or not, the issues addressed are real and frightening. Sicko warns us that a medical emergency can bankrupt you even if you are covered by a health-care plan, and your net worth is a few hundred thousand dollars. Even I became frightened, and more determined than ever to take great care of myself and avoid being entangled in the system.When I saw this in my neighborhood, sometimes referred to as the Upper Left Side of Manhattan, the audience applauded as the closing credits were shown. I welcome feedback on how moviegoers elsewhere would respond. Nonetheless, Sicko is a compelling work about a national priority that will be widely debated in next year's presidential race; it's also funny and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time for a Change in Healthcare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was easily Michael Moore's best film. While there might be an argument about gun control or how 9/11 was handled, there is no argument about the United States healthcare system. Moore does a great job of showing just how broken the system is.Through examining the healthcare horror stories of US citizens and talking with British, French and Canadian citizens about how pleased they are with socialized medicine Moore paints a great picture of how flawed healthcare in the United States is. It was disheartening to see the obscene profits that the healthcare companies are taking in, especially after seeing their questionable ethics. It is unbelievable to see some of the claims that insurance companies are able to turn away.It was great when he brought the rescue workers to Guantanamo Bay. We provide the prisoners there with quality healthcare which demonstrates that we feel it is a basic right that even a prisoner should have. How can we consider ourself a world leader when we have one of the shortest life expectancies and highest infant mortality rates of any industrialized country? Through some form of socialized healthcare and a focus on preventative medicine we could certainly improve our quality of life.I honestly feel it would be un-American to not see the film and develop an opinion about the healthcare. The majority of Americans are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to healthcare while some fat cat gets rich. I applaud Moore for making this film and there are even some good laughs in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr Moore writes movies for the underdog, you know the people that don't have FOX news in their pocket.The people Murdock wants to silence. The common people have again been represented fairly in in a Moore film. As a union member that will most likely go on strike over medical benefits next year this problem dominates quite a lot of thought time. Rates for the lousy rip off insurance we and our strapped employers are paying for have went up over 70% since 2000. I think this movie simply forces us to focus on the situation, certainly not what people in the hugely profitable health care industry want us to do. I was delightfully surprised at the means Moore used to convey his thoughts, and found it entertaining and thought provoking. This movie kicks off a summer where Medical Insurance will be the focus in discussions everywhere. I believe it is an historic film and will be remembered as a part of the summer of 2007 in our bleak, new, life is for the privileged American history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth and So Much Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie makes a point that people in this country need to be a little more involved in their healthcare. As a physician myself however, I disagree and agree with many points that are brought up in the film based on observation. 1. Medicare Part D should not exist. That is a whole lot of money going away from the providers and patients. Generic drugs are the way to go as long as they work, and as physicians, we should have the right to prescribe the newer drugs as needed. 2. Insurance companies and for-profit hospitals are the worst middlemen. They charge people a lot for services rendered, and on the other side, they give the provider very little of that. Example, ER visit costs 650, but the doctor himself may get 25-50 depending on the billing. Where does the rest go? 3. Cuba does not have better healthcare. That is a fallacy on a report. I personally know someone who actually came from Cuba, and most people get access to care but it's much worse than our county hospitals. The people who can pay get better care. People with money will always get better stuff. ACCEPT IT. Equality doesn't exist because there will never be equal motivation to succeed. 4. Our mortality and morbidity figures don't seem to factor in our cultural setbacks. We eat a lot of garbage, and it's funny how Mr. Moore has NOT tried the Jared diet yet but wants free care. He is a walking time bomb like many folks nowadays. So when did it become the government's problem that you don't watch your weight or exercise? High risk individuals are causing a problem in these utopia countries as well and now they are forced to redo their budgets. 5. He doesn't explain what Americans need to give up to have such a system. Higher taxes. More rationing of care meaning your 70 year old mother gets her plug pulled when she is really sick unlike the current long-term ventilator treatment, which I don't necessarily disagree with because I think it's wrong for families to keep patients alive to make themselves feel better. Once again, another cultural setback.BIGGEST problem with the movie: Moore doesn't address any of our problems. We pay A LOT for tuition meaning 200K at now 6.8% interest thanks to Dubya. Then, people expect us to train for another 4 years on a 35-40K salary working 80hrs/week and when we finish, make like 100K. People would avoid such a path if ROI was not good especially with a litigation crazy and lazy country. Being a physician is NOT easy, and I guarantee if this society puts us on the short end of the stick, you're just going to wait in line longer or have your services go offshore like everything else in this country.I encourage every American to step into my shoes and experience the crooks who take away from both me and you. Actually, Mr. Moore that would be a better documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am unsure of whether or not what I have to say will be taken as a spoiler or not, but I'm not gonna risk it- this is my first entry.In the newest of his series of captivating documentaries, I think Moore will have a lot fewer critics. While opinions on The President, the War, handguns, and corporate shutdowns tend to be split opinions, health care in America affects every last American. And who hasn't had a complaint? Whether you are unable to obtain it, or have it and are dissatisfied with the service, the way the system is run does affect -across the board- the Wealthy to the Poverty Stricken. Even the people you will be the most disappointed with throughout this doc. are in one way or another affected by these decisions.Throughout the film two things really struck me- One is a direct betrayal by an already infamous former President who audibly contradicts himself in 24 hours.The other is Michael Moore's kindness toward a critic of his. And I cannot wait to find out that critics reaction to this film.I am a fan. I don't think he is anti-American in any way. I think he is trying to get us closer to being the Democracy that we WERE when the Declaration was signed. And he uses his Celebrity to do that. The same way that famous PeTA members use theirs to get us on the bandwagon. We all still have the right to our own opinions. They just try to sway us. You don't have to jump on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's critics will most certainly question his methods in making this movie and how it is presented to the viewer. I agree his methods are unusual and maybe sometimes unethical or politically incorrect at best, but so what? Anyone interested can check the facts presented for himself and reach his own conclusion. It's not the rednecks Moore tries to convert (they won't budge anyway), but to present the issue to a public that has been ignoring the problem or looked the other way for far too long. In this the film succeeds brilliantly. If a documentary is about a political issue and not taking sides either way it would be pretty boring to watch. I presume it would be rather difficult for a "counter-documentary" sponsored by the HMOs to discuss away the cases presented by Michael Moore.After viewing the movie I find myself lucky to live in a country with a nationwide-health-insurance - the way it could be if private health insurance companies got their way is definitely not something to look forward to and should stand as a warning to politicians trying to weaken such a system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to say exactly what makes this film, in my opinion, better than Moore's others. I think part of it was the simple act of his extensively comparing our country to other countries, which he did fairly effectively in Bowling for Columbine...but there he only really compared the US to Canada.I guess another thing is...we probably take it for granted that there's a conspiracy of some level going on behind any major war (Farenheit 911)...this is not particularly unique to the US. But that the most powerful country in the world should deny health care to its OWN CITIZENS in the way the U.S. does is just too cynical to be believed.The Richard Nixon tape played in the movie really sums it all up, and nothing has changed since then.I've left every other Moore movie discouraged about the state of our country, but I can honestly say that I left THIS movie thinking that the United States government is absolutely evil and by far the worst (partly because it could easily be the best) on the entire planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore has constructed a highly damning and effective review of US health care. Yes, his critics are right when they point out that the picture he paints of places like Canada, the UK and France are somewhat Utopian when it comes to health care. Being Danish Canadian and having lived in London I have tried many different systems (although thankfully never the American) and none of them are perfect (long waiting lists, slow new drug review process to name but a few). Another valid point which Moore doesn't touch upon is that universal health care costs big time and that the countries he describes in his movie pay a lot more taxes than the US. But he rightfully points out in his movie that people in these countries are never turned away because of money and no matter what any critic of Moore contends; the fact that the world's super power does not offer health care to all of its citizens or health care companies turning down people for treatment are not only sad statements of fact - it's downright immoral! The US has many great things going for them and I've traveled around your country and met many great people with kind and open hearts (heck, I even have family in California) but I will never understand how a country with such an abundance of wealth and ingenuity cannot figure out how to care for their own and downtrodden?!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment may contain spoilers about certain observations made by the film Sicko.I am Canadian, so whatever damning commentary this film has is not really directed at me. And yeah, the movie did put the best possible face on socialized health care. The Canadian system is not perfect. If you need immediate care, your going to be taken care of. You do not have to pay for it either. But if you have something that 'wont kill you' immediately, (ie, a bad knee), you can end up waiting a long time for it. But I think that our system is better than the American system. I may have to wait, but I am pretty sure I will get it.The real question that this movie puts to a US viewer is should be this: Is socialized health care something worth paying for? I would answer yes. And anything worth having is worth paying for.In France, their citizens want to have days off, paid day care, free health care, and free / cheap education. In the U.S, people in general want to have more money.Who do you trust more with your life? An insurance company trying to maximize its profits? Or a Government trying to keep its costs down? At least with the government, you could vote someone out of office.END COMMUNICATION</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore again advancing the genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is truly incredible to see how "Infotainment" can be so grabbing and carrying while delivering you with interesting comparisons. Michael Moore rather digs into the basic moral of a human being than trying to demonize larger corporations leading our medical lives.I saw the movie at a Sneak Preview and was not prepared for it. At the beginning I was deliberately moaning to the dislike of the rest of the audience. More and more embarrassed I was when it started hitting me. Yes, there are people out there in our very own society that don't get the medical treatment they deserve... And of course they only are a minority... Well, obviously not. I can only thank for not ever sustaining any serious injury but I just don't wanna know what happens if I do.The film really plays with that thought and juggles it around the continents. By doing so it really delightfully plays with the human emotions and introduces us to a number of REALLY sick people who don't receive the care and treatment that they need and deserve. If you look closer its formula is very similar to the ones of popular propaganda films, just that in this case the message really makes sense. Actually it could even be considered as some kind of revenge to its "bad brothers" but Sicko really transports a thought which should (!) be taken for granted and even though the movie is almost too heartwarming at some points it understands to be what it tries to make us understand: human!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sickening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago, Michael Moore set out to produce a documentary about the American health care system and how that affects both those with and without insurance. In 1999 though, the Columbine shootings redirected his focus towards gun control and teenage violence. The health care project was put on hold and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was made and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary. Hollywood had found a new spokesman and Moore rode that wave for as long as he could. He was about to return to the health care project when the war in Iraq began. Again, Moore felt his efforts would be better put to use elsewhere. FARENHEIT 9/11, part expository documentary, part slander campaign to ensure George W. Bush would not be re-elected, became the highest grossing documentary of all time. He may have had notoriety like he had never known but he also had an increasing number of angry detractors. Moore's success was inflating his ego and that ego was taking up more screen time than the subject matter itself in his films. Well, Mr. Moore has heard your complaints and has redirected his focus once again by removing it from himself and placing it back on the subject. Eight years after its original conception, Moore is finally ready to give us SICKO.While Moore's mug does still find its way into the action and his voice guides us along our tour of the world's hospital waiting rooms, he is less invasive and more sympathetic in SICKO. In fact, we don't even see him for the first third of the piece. Instead, real people with real horror stories of disappointment and struggle put a face to the bureaucracy. Having no insurance, Rick must make a decision between reattaching his middle finger ($60,000) or his ring finger ($12,000) after the tips are sliced off in a buzz saw accident as he cannot afford both. In her 50's, Donna is forced to move in to her daughter's storage room with her husband because their medical bills have far exceeded what their insurance will cover. The American people already know that their health care system does not work for everyone so SICKO ensures that people know the desperate realities of those that are left behind. Moore makes sure to get all his pills in a line by giving historical context to the deterioration of provided health care and establishes profit as the unsurprising devil. There have been so many stories of death and unnecessary suffering by this point in the film that the tears come naturally when you see the livelihood of real people being cast aside for profit expansion.Yet through the tears, there is laughter to be had in SICKO and most of it is directed at Moore himself, as an American representative. Moore leaves the USA to explore whether socialized health care is as poor and pathetic as the American media and American Medical Association would have you believe. In Canada, he meets a hockey player who sliced several fingers off while playing and didn't have to choose between having any one in particular reattached nor did he have to pay a cent for the operation. In England, he meets with a doctor who still earns a strong six-figure salary that affords him an Audi and a million-dollar home despite the government signing his checks. In France, he meets with a group of Americans who have relocated to France and are now enjoying social health benefits like 24-hour medical service that comes to your door. Moore seems as if in a constant state of shock and awe as he asks patients leaving hospitals what their bills cost. The response is always nothing but not before they have a good laugh at how ridiculous his question is.When the initial urge to laugh has run its route, SICKO reminds us that we are laughing at how dire this situation has become. How else can one describe it when homeless patients, clearly without insurance, are dumped in front of shelters after being forced out of a hospital and forced into a cab? Moore still can't resist a cheeky, sarcastic turn but his film-making is maturing. While past efforts struggled to maintain their objectivity, feeling at times like one man's personal vendetta against the powers that be, SICKO is more like a rallying of the people, exposing many Americans' selfish motivations to look out for themselves above all else as their ugliest problem. Instead of yelling incessantly at the Bush administration and the corporations that pull the strings, all Moore seems to be concerned with is how the American population is still allowing for a world where the weakest among them is left to die in the streets.</fullReview>

Ooooh if we could only have a single payer system in the country! I don't think it will ever happen because of the way we've sold out our government to the big business interests of the insurance companies. Michael Moore is right, and at least somebody is saying it. The greater message of the film is that in America, we keep our citizenry scared and in debt and enslaved to paying for things that we, as a very rich country, should provide without profit. But I think America (a country I love) LOST that battle about 20-25 years ago. It is breathtaking to see how well other western industrialized civilized countries genuinely care for their people. Even Cuba, where they are so poor and in need of the most basic necessities. But us? In the US? It will never happen. I wish I was as optimistic as MM.</fullReview>

Donating blood, helping victims of disaster, mission trips to 3rd world nations, cutting checks to Red Cross, you name it! Americans are always there to help. We're awesome. So when the issue of paying taxes that go to the healthcare and well being of our fellow man comes up, why the struggle? It's the same thing. Of course, I have issues with the government being in charge of anything. Somehow I can suspend that principle. Afterall, I have my own health care nightmares.Shame on him for Fahrenheit 9/11. If he was planning on producing his best work after spending years of his life polarizing himself then shame on him.Sicko is hands down his finest achievement. This isn't a democrat or republican issue. It almost seems like he goes out of his way to not spend time on republicans! He shows the many politicians lining their pockets with health care money, but he focuses on Hillary Clinton as the biggest turn coat in history on this issue.Again, after watching Sicko (which I intend to purchase a ticket for (as well as the DVD) to compensate for seeing it at my friend's house who illegally obtained a copy) I can say this is easily his best work.Our own health and well being is not a political issue.

		<fullReview>To say that Sicko tugs at your heart strings is like saying an aircraft carrier leaves a wake. Moore is a master of both sob-story revelation and factual selectivity in the service of powerful messages, whether it's corporate perfidy (Roger and Me), national politics (Fahrenheit 911)[1], gun policy (Bowling for Columbine), or health care issues (Sicko). Sometimes, as with the Charlton Heston footage in Columbine[2] the selectivity is outright fraudulent. But even when he crosses the line, Moore excels at generating sympathy for real people.[3]The primary technique for creating misimpressions that I've seen, however, in Moore's movies and other mockumentaries from left or right, is to trick the emotional-perceptual mechanism. For example, the movie The Corporation I reviewed had a sequence describing a plant that was generating toxic waste... ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I have to say is that after watching this amazing film I feel as if I am serving my children an injustice by Not moving to France or the U.K. My children deserve all the best life has to offer and unfortunately is appears as if the u.S.A does not provide those privileges(which in some countries are a right). I will spend my life getting my family to a place where we come first. You will see me abroad for my families sake. They deserve it and by God so do all of us. God Bless and I hope to see you where the government cares more about us than how much money the big companies can provide them. Thank you Micheal, for the insight and the drive to do all I can to give my children a life they will NEVER get here</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very shrewd film maker; good watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, I like Michael Moore, I like his work, so it's probably pure bias that makes me watch this film and rave about it - no, hang on there, it's not. We have all had some dealings with insurance companies in the past, and we all know whose side they are on. This film is shocking and worrying and with an election up and coming in the US it's time the politicians realised who pays their wages - oh silly me, it's not the taxpayer anymore is it? Proud to be a New Zealand/British person, it was great to see how our countries measured up - I have to say France impressed me no end.'Free' healthcare is never free, we all pay for it, but life is a lottery and if you need the free care it's there. There may be waiting lists and imperfections, but that's a small gripe compared to a 79 year old gentleman working to stay alive. Keep up the great work Michael!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko rips your heart out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore leaves most of his bombast at home in favor of a measured, fairly evenhanded look at America's health-care industry as compared to those in Canada, England, and France. Although pocked by spurts of pomposity, Sicko uses the "cruel to be kind" method of educating its viewers about the issue of universal health care in the United States. "Look at the other civilized countries," Moore says; "their systems work. When other countries make better cars, we drive them. When other countries make better wine, we drink it. So how come, when other countries have better health-care systems, we don't adopt those systems?" Moore's plea to the American consumer is an emotional roller coaster, and that's understating things. Excluding people who have no health insurance at all, he describes the difficulties of several individuals across the country, all covered by health insurance, in receiving adequate medical attention. Heart-rending stories are told about people denied tests and procedures that would have ultimately saved their lives, as the HMOs deemed the efforts as "experimental" or the patients' status as "not life threatening." Moore includes sworn testimony (before Congress) and interviews of former or current medical reviewers, i.e., people who decide whether a claim will be rejected or accepted. It's pretty damning stuff.But of course, it's the health-care system of other countries that are sometimes held up as the ideal to which America should aspire. But that's socialist propaganda, you say. Government-supported health care? Bah. Socialized medicine is just another way for the commies to get to us and destroy our way of life. But it turns out that's not quite the case; Canadians, for instance, pay nothing for health care and still enjoy comparatively low taxes while living longer than Americans. Oh, and they have a lower infant-mortality rate too; but then again, so does nearly every other civilized nation. Things are bad enough in the US that Moore's Canadian relatives get temporary health care before visiting him in the US, just in case something goes wrong. And some American citizens steal across the border to get themselves some of that free medical attention when they can't get it here.Moore also examines, in a touching, gut-wrenching look, the plight of many September 11 first responders. As most people know, the air around Ground Zero in New York was dangerously bad for quite some time after the attacks. Many firefighters, EMTs, and policemen risked their lives to pull others from the wreckage. But there were also many volunteers who happened to be in the area who ran back to the flames and into the smoke to help others. These people, says the government, aren't eligible for much care related to their injuries. After having been constantly lauded as heroes for months after the attacks, many of the first responders were ignored, left to fend for themselves as their health slipped further and further. One man - a man who risked death to help strangers - has two bad lungs and must cart around a breathing apparatus to survive; he can't even sleep on his back or stomach, because he just can't breathe.The only true instance of bombast on the part of Moore is when he takes a few of these 9/11 workers to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to receive the same level of medical treatment as the "enemy combatants" in the prison. He's denied, of course, so he traverses Havana for help and easily finds it. An inhaler that costs one of the 9/11 workers over a hundred dollar - when several are needed monthly - costs under one dollar in Cuba. Same inhaler, same medicine for a fraction of the cost.I realize that even though this is a documentary, Moore does have an agenda to push, as he does with all of his films. But what is his motivation? Is it merely to poke fun at big, bloated insurance companies and the government? Or is it to raise awareness of a national crisis? Moore's point isn't that health care should definitively be offered to everyone for free, it's just that there are a huge number of people in America who are actually covered but can't get proper medical treatment. It's a national disgrace, Moore implies, and he's precisely right. Understandably, we often have to throw money at war machines to gain a political edge, but in doing so we tend to completely neglect the sheer humane practice of making sure everyone has the opportunity to get well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing is certain- this is not a documentary concerning only health crisis in the US, you can be sure that after having watched this one you will be richer in a full sense of this word. True people, true situations and appropriate music to say the least. Pursuit of money in US have gone completely out of control. Michael More shows in a great patriotic style not only the dark side of American Health System but presents the ways to make it right. Traveling through countries where Health System is really healthy More wants to prove America that it is doable. There's no doubt that American people are capable of the greatest actions, history has proved it many times. Right now after having watched this documentary I must honestly write that I feel fortunate that I'am not an American citizen. The big change is before this great nation, I hope it'll manage.

		<fullReview>I know this is redundant to say by now, but spot on! Although Micheal Moore has a bias for a highly personal angle on the stories he tells which give them a feel of not being very balanced at all and rather biased on emotions. He does however get his points across in very clever, thought inducing and provocative ways! Bringing the 9/11 workers to Cuba for the health care they were denied in the US was simply brilliant, and I think that goes double for Americans who actually view Cubans as enemies. Time has come to rethink a few things no? And I don't think anybody can argue with that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another thought provoking movie by Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me start by saying I am a physician who is for universal health coverage by the government not by the private sector. The private sector is interested in profits not care. It is ashame and Moore does a good job of pointing out that the US is the only industrialized nation without universal coverage. I know that the powers that be hated this film especially the parts shot in a country we're not suppose to go to. Those portions were the only part of the movie that was a little suspect (I am probably being cynical) its was too pat, too sweet. One more thing I have to point out it seems that the doctors were happy and I believe that we would be if we do it right and not the way we've done Medicare and Medicaid i.e. cheat people out of care and caregivers out of a decent reimbursement. One thing you should think about though as you watch this film. Look around at the countries these people visit and then look at them. The Americans are all overweight. Until Americans start taking control of their own health i.e. eating healthier, scaling down on fast foods and exercising instead of looking for the quick fix from the healthcare industry things won't get any better with universal coverage. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great documentary from Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Michael Moore's documentaries are fascinating because they work as a beginning to think and investigate the themes they have.With excellent results,Moore has analyzed the attitudes his government had after the attacks of the tragic September 11th from 2001 in Fahrenheit 9/11 and the North American violence in Bowling for Columbine.And,now,with Sicko,he analyzes the medical industry in the United States with great results again.Sicko stayed with me a long time after the movie finished and it left me thinking.That's something great and that not all documentaries get.Also,Sicko is always fun and never boring.The documentary is wonderfully divided on three parts:on the first part,we see the stories of various North American citizens who tell their bad experiences when they wanted to be correctly assisted by hospitals and insurance companies.The second part takes Moore to Canada,France and the UK to compare their medical services to the ones in the United States and it's incredible to see that smaller countries,with less resources,have a universal protection system which covers their population.On the third part,we learn that the terrorists and the enemy soldiers in the prison of Guantánamo have a better medical assistance than the North American volunteers who helped to rescue survivors after the attacks in New York.So,Moore goes with three yachts with sick people and he puts prow to the military base of Guantánamo to ask for medical assistance.The results are totally surprising.The only failure I found on this movie is that,on some parts,it's a little bit manipulative with the spectator.Sicko is a totally fun documentary which makes us think.And,few things are better than entertainment endorsed with reflection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, although willing and prepared to present facts at times out of context and it is rather one sided which prevents it from being of any real use.It should be pointed out that PRIVATE health care in Britain, France etc is ALSO available if you don't want to wait. Moore doesn't address this, I think it would have been useful to include this fact. A lot of people after watching the film think it's one thing or the other in Europe when there is both.The collectivism slant in the movie could be described as propagandist, but its heart is in the right place, but then that's Moore's style. It's entertainment through anger, outrage or disbelief and for it reality gets distorted as in most movies.It's difficult to know how much info is relative and what the real US health care situation is outside of the presented flaws in the system. However if you're European, or agree with collectivising health care, then this movie will bolster your belief, if not it will make you angry to change the system, or angry at Moore for being so good and being on the other side. Perhaps with Sicko the establishment in the US is getting a piece of its own medicine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plutocracy in action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I became a follower of Michael Moore's work when I saw the Awful Truth series circa 2000. And have seen/read everything except Canadian Bacon and the soldier's letters collection. To be honest he was probably at his creative peak in the mid-90's but his more recent films are still entertaining and informative about aspects of American society. The Awful Truth introduced me to the approach American insurance companies take to healthcare, with a guy who was denied coverage for a kidney transplant. He was basically waiting for death to arrive at any moment until Moore successfully pressured the company into covering the procedure. I have also seen current affairs stories which told of how people were accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt after being treated by "county" hospitals that are required to treat people regardless of their insurance status. The medical system is improperly funded which results in huge fees to cover the gap.Sicko gives us some good stories of people who have fallen victim to the U.S. healthcare system. What became apparent to me was that the insurance companies were having their cake and eating it too by being paid for the insurance, then not giving payments. This goes against the whole principal of insurance but apparently they are free to twist the rules as they see fit due to political lobbying and contributions. People don't fall through the cracks, "a crack is created and they are swept towards it". But like the downsizing corporations, they are simply following the guidelines they are issued. It is top-down corruption from the U.S. plutocracy: Nixon signed into effect the current system under the guise of a new era of healthcare while at the same time universal healthcare was associated with paving the path towards communism (and what a trumped-up threat that was). Moore presents a first-person perspective of universal healthcare as experienced in Canada, Britan and France. This is where Sicko becomes a bit weak as an informed viewer will be aware that he is only presenting the best face of these systems. I wouldn't expect him to travel to Australia where State/Federal divisions in tax revenue distribution has resulted in crumbling infrastructure and staffing levels in public hospitals. Or poorer, more isolated parts of the countries he visits. But the point that Moore is trying to make is that universal healthcare can work, and (speaking from my own experience) even when it is underfunded it is still a far more humane approach to healthcare.As an attempt at humour Moore tries to get some people some treatment at Guantanamo bay, which has better healthcare than US citizens can expect probably because it would look strange to the international community to treat them the same as the average uninsured US citizen. They didn't even get close, they were kilometers away from a watchtower and scurried when they heard a siren. The real purpose of the trip was apparently to get treatment at a Cuban hospital but again they don't pick a random hospital, they apparently received treatment at the best hospital in the country. But it was slightly amusing to see citizens of the richest country in the world weeping with gratitude for treatment they were generously being given by a poor country.Ironically the U.S. may get universal healthcare in the near future as the major Presidential candidates from the Democrat party have policies to introduce it. Speaking of politics, how the Republican party has received wide support after introducing the current system and actively defeating an effort to introduce universal heathcare in the early 90's is beyond me. Maybe the populace has been prevented from being "educated, healthy and confident".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore's latest biting, witty, heartfelt polemic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):Love or hate Michael Moore, it's difficult to deny that he knows how to make a persuasive and entertaining documentary. Moore's latest film, Sicko, a scathing commentary on the American health-care system, seeks to return Moore's acerbic wit and relent in pushing the political trundle-wheel.Moore's jovial tone is very much abundant mere moments into Sicko, highlighting the absurdity of the American health care system with his customary whimsical flair ? the fact that a man had to, through financial constraints, choose to re-attach only one of his two severed fingers, is both disgusting and preposterous. Thus, Sicko is a darkly comic pastiche, a sprawling portrait of a number of deeply unfortunate individuals dealt a foul hand by the health-care system, voiced by Moore's usual sarcasm and inquisitive sentiment.The film also seeks to infiltrate those within the insurance and health-care industry. Do all of these persons advocate the unfair conditions of the system itself? No, and Moore is smart enough to reflect this balance ? we meet the seedy, dirt-slinging bureaucrats, as well as the sympathetic individuals who are themselves disgusted with the current system.Moore is masterful in his exposition of the down-right disturbing ? those in positions of power in this system are gambling with people's lives ? the stories we are told are truly heartbreaking, and one must question the morality of those high up in the industry. As the few individuals with consciences step forward to atone for their acts, Moore asks us ? what is the price of a life? Perhaps Sicko's only faux pas is its insistence to approach the rather disinteresting conspiracy angle. Fortunately, Moore doesn't dwell on it long enough to become trite and tiresome, promptly returning to the real meat of the documentary ? the very intimate, personal, and touching stories.Whilst it serves Moore well to consider the health-services of other nations, such as Canada, the United Kingdom and France, Moore's visits to these locales are fleeting and serve as little more than supporting statements to his original argument. Moore fails to point out any inherent flaws in these systems, but he can be forgiven considering that, even with their flaws, these systems clearly put the American one to shame. As Moore points out ? the French, even with their penchant for fatty foods and wine, live longer (on average) than Americans. Their health care system, compared even to the British and Canadian systems, is delightful, second to none.Furthermore, I have to commend Moore's attempt to usurp the antagonistic relationship between the French and Americans, even positing that "perhaps we're told to hate the French because we might like what we see". It's a wonderful concept, and considering the diametric opposition of their respective health-care systems, the precept holds a surprising amount of weight.Moore does wield an emotional meat-hook in the latter parts of the film, introducing us to a number of maltreated September 11th voluntary rescue workers, yet the nature of their work is ancillary to the point Moore is making, and the point he makes (that not even rescue workers can receive adequate health-care) is highly relevant, and moreover, highly disturbing. Moore possesses the intellect not to dwell on the actual events of September 11th, and even when he does so, it is contrasted with a considerably more substantial loss ? the tens of thousands of Allied soldiers lost in World War 2. Never does Sicko become a sickeningly-patriotic or jingoistic attempt to validate the American tradition, nor douse itself in political values ? Moore, for the most part, tells it how it is, with little bias and genuine sympathy.Moore is no stranger to making bombastic, overblown statements, and Sicko is no different ? he illustrates the irony of the American system by visiting Guantanamo Bay, whereby suspected terrorists receive greater health-care than the aforementioned rescue workers. Moore takes his point to its most ironic, hilarious and extreme, yet once again, he raises a valid point, doing so in a way that is both memorable and easy to digest.In less cartoon-esquire fashion, Moore and his cohorts visit Cuba, where a considerably more worrying and taxing question is raised ? in a country with only a fraction of the resources of America, how is it that everyone can receive adequate, affordable health-care, whilst Americans still struggle? It raises questions about the bureaucracy of the American system, and for a fleeting moment, causes Moore's conspiracy theories to seem slightly less futile. Moore's visit to Cuba, through its shocking slap to the American face, disgusts, and frankly leads one to enjoy residing outside of America.By its end, Sicko does delve into sentimentality, rather dramatically displaying a stagy meeting between the Cuban fire service and the American voluntary rescue workers. Yes, it borders on saccharine, and diverges almost entirely from the purpose of Moore's documentary, yet as with the French instance, it seeks to bridge the cultural gap and say "we're all human beings, and we're all in the same boat". It's a nice idea, and whilst Moore needn't break out the violins like he almost does, it doesn't leave too sour a taste in the mouth, and certainly doesn't last for too long.Michael Moore's Sicko is a very inverse, inward criticism of America's health-care system. As with even Bowling For Columbine, it's not perfect ? Moore omits certain facts in lieu of fast-paced, memorable sound-bytes, but his various set pieces are more often than not amusingly unforgettable, as well as entirely relevant. Sicko delivers a crushing blow to the current system, and very clearly illustrates that this system is in much need of an overhaul. Moore's finest moments are the personal ones, speaking to those well and truly devastated by the existing precedent, and they certainly provide the most weight to his cause. Moore is a true voice of our time, and his latest polemic is a welcome installment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably's Moore's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that Michael Moore inspires passionate feelings in people, both positive and negative.It's easy to discuss SICKO merely as a brilliant expose of the sham, the deceit, the criminality of the health care system in this country today.But, as this is also a site for film commentary, I have to say that I was very impressed with SICKO the *film*, and Moore's achievement as a filmmaker.First of all, he took himself out of the film far more than he usually does. It worked wonderfully in ROGER &amp; ME and later films, but I appreciated how he stepped back in this one and let the stories speak and breathe.It gave this film a narrative that is the sign of the best documentaries.I strongly recommend it -- Obviously for it's educational and enlightening message. But also for it's lesson on great documentary film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's best movie so far, although it's not about a global problem. Only about USA.He interviews people being mistreated in the richest country in the world and the worst scene is probably the one with the lady who is dumped in the street, just because she cannot pay her hospital bill. You think Dickens lived 150 years ago and you're right. But we need him now.But Michael Moore is not a bad substitute. You may of course object that he picks out individual cases and what does that say about the system? In my opinion, the individual's fate says pretty much about the system. Moore also compares with the situation in Europe and USA's neighbor country, Canada. That says even moreYou may think this is propaganda, but it's very strong propaganda indeed and Moore truly achieves what he's up to. That is what makes this an extremely good documentary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie really has a message, mostly directed at Americans or citizens of countries with a similar Medical Insurance system. I realize Michael Moore put a lot of work into it, and that is probably really hard to release this kind of movie in the US. I really hope he's going somewhere because what happens there is really evil. It's also easy too watch, it means it's well directed and you don't get bored easy... it's perhaps a bit too long, but worths watching. Specially for those whose this information is new for. It's a shame, that he faces each problem with extremism and everything has to be so cheesy. Everyone on the US was sad, everyone in any other country had a smile... is not real, and because is it not, some people wont trust the content of this movie. But perhaps cheesiness is what takes for Americans to pay attention... it ruins the movie for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: SiCKO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Won't we like to visit a doctor, and be provided preventive advice during a regular checkup. Or how about instead of worrying just how much those consultation charges are going to be, we get a world class doctor who basically just cares and is genuinely concerned with our well-being, and getting us cured of our sickness?That's the kind of feeling you get when watching Michael Moore's latest documentary SiCKO. While he rages on and uncovers the deficiencies in the US healthcare system, he waxes lyrical about the free healthcare systems of various countries, while at the same time, comparing how doctors under different systems fare. We all know that doctors make a lot of money, but some make a lot of money because they are specialists and charge sky high fees for their services, that you can't help but wonder if it's money over patients. Then again, in what is termed the socialist medicine model, where doctors are akin to civil servants, being paid a fixed salary with variable components tagged to the welfare of the patients, you wonder too if that is probably a better system altogether, that those genuinely want to heal people, get into the profession, and those who want to make money, well, go work at the pharmaceutical companies.In any case, Moore dresses his documentary up in his usual sexy manner. He again drums up and creates a rally behind his objectives, and it's easy to fall prey to his viewpoint. There are merits to the better models he presented, or how non profit organizations, for the love of healing folks, can come up with 24hr on-call services, truly making healthcare not only affordable, but within physical reach. And he contrasts this with the cold, calculated way in which Americans are treated.And there's the flaw with privatizing healthcare, leaving it into the hands of, god forbid, insurance companies. It's almost common sense that premiums are always easy to pay, provided you satisfy many of the pre-conditions, but when it comes to the claim, that's where the real problem starts, as you'd come to expect delays, challenges, combing the fine print for some ambiguous clause just to starve you off any legitimate payback. I seriously hope we don't get our monies trapped in such schemes (ahem, annuities?). And when we're talking about life and death, it's ideal to leave little room for contracts and negotiations - life takes priority.In that sense where security and education comes into play, we leave it to the powers that be, and shouldn't healthcare be so as well? Short of labelling it as the restriction of freedom and choice as some would have it argued, it actually comes with widespread social acceptance, and of course, taxes. You must be willing to pay to receive subsidized, or even free benefits. Otherwise, where do all these funds come from? And this is where Moore conveniently skips, or mentions in extremely brief passing. There's no such thing as a free lunch, though neither is it a zero sum game, and there will be two sides carved out - those who just want to enjoy the benefits without contributing to it, and those who resent paying for someone else's welfare. Not everyone can be like the Canadians :) Different strokes for different folks, depending on which set of values one subscribes to.So as Moore uncovers ideal benefits in the healthcare systems in the UK, France, Canada and even Cuba, he doesn't address the other social ills and resentment that comes along with it. But of course, since this is a documentary, and naturally the points that make the final cut must all support the filmmaker's vision. If compared to his earlier works, SiCKO comes across as more mature though, with its sexy arguments made against a very serious presentation and tone, void of all the quirky animations, and have rather limited snark remarks, not that they're not present.But the best bits about it, is how he pieces together the corruption in the whole system, including those in seats of power. As we know, some politicians can be persuaded with funds to assist in their respective lobbies, and it is no surprise where these healthcare insurance companies put their money on. Politicians on payrolls, in a nice way, are nothing new. And seriously, nobody can fault a private enterprise into achieving its prime objective in a market economy, and that is to maximize profits. Money can be used to cover the heart and soul, so why not use it to an advantage.SiCKO is crafted shrewdly in the hands of Moore, and frankly, brought its points out rather well. The much anticipated Guantanamo Bay excursion though was much ado about nothing, given the widespread publicity of the potential trouble Moore might get into. But the real gem of the movie though, is the lesson on how to shape one's arguments - place incessant focus on the good parts to debunk what currently doesn't work, because the bigger picture will always be able to puncture arguments presented within a 2 hour picture. It's never easy to find a right balance for any social issue, or life for that matter.I just have to make sure, as I told a friend, that I have a plan on what to do if I'm diagnosed with a serious condition, given rising health care costs here as well. And by the looks of it increasing in time to come, the plan definitely includes the reluctance to line the coffers of the doc treating me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the Prescription for Our Diseased Health Care System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore, known for such films as "Bowling for Columbine" and "Fahrenheit 9/11", takes on an issue that we can all relate to: health care in America. He addresses the HMOs, the insurance companies, the government and other factors that go into our relatively low quality of health care compared to certain other countries (England, France, Canada and Cuba).Although I generally sympathize with Moore, I have never been a fan of his methods. He plays loose with facts and sometimes presents things in a very questionable manner. And he is highly partisan. But "Sicko", while still coming fro ma left perspective, takes on an issue that most Americans can agree with whether they are left, right or center: we need to get quality and affordable health care. He doesn't bash Bush (although Republicans Reagan and Nixon do get some smears), he doesn't go after gun companies... he goes after people who are hurting all Americans.This film made me cry visible tears, the first time I recall doing so since seeing "A Walk to Remember" in the theater (although I may have just forgotten). The real stories of families denied coverage, or only covered for certain surgeries, is telling and appalling. The money is in the system -- we do not need to suffer in our darkest times.I especially enjoyed the historical approach. I didn't know the histories of American or Canadian health care systems, and while I am sure some of it was left out (the film can only say so much) this was a good start. I had no idea Nixon played a central role in modern health care, or that the Canadian system is as old as it is. In America, universal care is still "in the future" while many countries have been embracing it for decades.I can't think of a good reason to not see this film. If you don't have insurance or pay too much, or you have elderly parents or young children.... you need to know the risks you run simply by being American. Do keep an open mind and remember Moore focuses almost entirely on his side of the issue, but don't ignore the facts and figures just because he may have some bias. These are facts that need to be a part of the bigger debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you'd expect and nothing you could predict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie highlights a great deal of damaging, terrifying details about the American system of health. There were lots of facts I was aware of and many more that I suspected, but nothing can prepare you for the sheer depths plummed by insurance and pharmacological companies to maximise their earning capacity. It is everything you'd expect and nothing you could predict...The fact is I must warn you of something... Every time I see a Michael Moore film for the first time I tend to relapse to my late teens/earliest twenties during the height of my anti-Americanism. George Bush had stolen an election, fearmongering was reaching a level not seen since Goebbels and we, the UK, were entering no less than two wars, one of which was in a country renowned throughout history for being unbeatable and the second was in a place we'd encouraged to revolt and depose their leader ten years before only to allow Saddam Hussein to remain in power and gas/helicopter-gunship those would be freedom fighters... And we were being told that the people of both those countries were going to welcome us as saviours from oppressive Muslim regimes.At times like that it is easy to let yourself go with the counter flow and label the likes of America with all sorts of negative adjectives, some more succinct than others. Around five or so years ago I did so gladly, almost rejoicing as the USA blithely rushed into war with the kind of rhetoric more indicative of insanity than foreign policy. It fed my superior view of America as a rednecked backwater of almost bucolic stupidity.Things have changed for me, not least because of the 7/7 bombings. I have come to remind myself, not learn or accept but remind, that America has its fair share of brilliant thinkers and wonderful people, perhaps even more than its share. Sure it has its idiots and bigots and what have you, but so does England, France, Cuba and the rest. The only problem with the US seems to be that it gives its fools marginally more airtime than they deserve, but that is a personal opinion rather than an informed judgement. Regardless, America is the biggest, most important country in the world, at least till China gets its act together internationally, and sneering at the US changes this not at all, it only leaves the people doing the sneering looking very stupid when America gets things right.But Moore tends to make this clearer thinking fall by the wayside when he opens up another front on the American dream, because there is no piece of propaganda more invasive and sickening than the American dream. Its capitalism as spun by the billionaires, the people with the biggest interest in keeping capitalism going and an almost pathological desire to make more money regardless of the moral and ethical principles they lose on the way.Moore's gift is that he hits back at those people themselves, naming names and shaming everyone from Congressmen to HMO CEOs. Yes he may use spin to suit his needs: the NHS is wonderful in the case of acute trauma and disastrous at long term, chronic disease particularly in the elderly while the French do lose a great deal of their income to taxation. But explaining all that away takes time. Entire books can be churned out on either of those subjects, something which does not lend itself to aggressive documentary film making. In order to get his points across, Moore has to hit fast and keep things interesting which does leave him open to charges of data cherry picking and other such allegations. However, he is pretty much the lone recognisable voice IN THE ENTIRE WORLD telling this side of the debate. Who else is prepared to criticise America in such a public way? Who else can fill cinemas with eager viewers hoping for a new perspective compared to the government endorse 'everything's fine in modern healthcare' message touted to the world? Certainly not the Democrats, who are just as indebted to big business as the Republicans. And certainly not the medical profession in America, who have the carrot of massive wages combined with the hefty stick of professional suicide, perhaps even assassination by their colleagues, should they speak out.So I am prepared to forgive Moore his extravagances, as they are minor indeed with respect to the massive misdirection, chicanery and outright lies perpetrated by the businesses and governments in power... just hearing that politician going on about how much he loved his mother in order to justify freeing up regulation of prescription charges to the elderly... well, it made me sick to my stomach.Sicko is a distinctly worrying documentary. Fahrenheit 911 hi-lighted Bush's inadequacies in the face of his daddy's cronies and Bowling for Columbine exposed the depths to which the government spins the US into bewildered, fearful submission... but those are both transient issues. Health is something that will affect every single organism that will ever lift throughout the universe. We will all die of something. You've just got to hope the doctors won't be sitting around debating your HMO while a preventable ailment to you or, God forbid, your child takes hold and kills or even maims you. This is why Moore should continue to be heard, on this and his other subjects. While systems like this continue to leech of America's populace someone has to stand up and be counted from the other side. And if it's not Moore, who will it be? Hilary Clinton?I don't think so either.</fullReview>

I, personally, would be dead by now, as I suffered a serious heart condition in 2003.While all health care systems based on universal solidarity have their weaknesses and problems (and Germany's system is certainly not on par with that of France, historically speaking we were not at all times a well-governed country), the shown inhumanity and outright evilness of purely profit-oriented health insurance companies who literally have to be dragged to court in order to make them fulfill their contracts is something that will not happen in any other civilized country.And to those who think that it is "socialist" or "communist" to have such a system: in Germany, health insurance was introduced in 1883 by Otto von Bismarck, who hardly falls under that category. Just because socialist countries have universal health care, this doesn't make it a socialist idea - Michael Moore did very right to point out that firefighters and police are also universally serving and don't ask for your insurance or money before giving you help.Thorsten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can say that again, Mr. Bush.Michael Moore's "Sicko" is one of the best films of 2007, but also a departure from the director's usual penchant for clever editing and pranksterism. Interestingly, Moore makes himself a relatively innocuous figure for a good 3/4 of the film, thus giving proper attention to people who have suffered without health care, and those who have suffered WITH health care. While he gets in his jabs at prominent government figures, it's hard for me to feel that they aren't well-deserved. While "Fahrenheit 9/11" offered a window into something most Americans already knew (that the Bush Administration is a bunch of war-mongering assh*les), "Sicko" blows the lid off privatized health care, something that--as Moore shows again and again--ultimately unites the U.S. citizenry more than anything else. The scope of the film is ambitious, as Moore visits France, London, Cuba, and Canada and gives a run-down of their policies; but America remains his axis. As I stated before, the director is a less overbearing presence in "Sicko" than his previous films, and approaches the interview segments with reverence--at times, his serious face can portend a look of revelation synonymous with the viewer's. Being an American without health insurance, "Sicko" is a mature, moving, and mind-blowing experience...thank you, Mr. Moore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, witty and touching stories. But is it enough to make a good movie ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore starts here another fight against the injustices and paradoxes of the American way of life, by filming the consequences of the disastrous US health system and compares it to other country's ones (Canadia, UK or France). And it seems that if you get sick in Cuba, you're luckier than if the same thing happens to you in New-York, especially if you're from the middle class. The all thing is really interesting, and what you learn about the US-health system is really like science-fiction for, let's say, an European citizen, and also very witty (Moore's always mixes its educational and documentary purposes with a fun package). His system is now very well prepared (and even becomes quite annoying in certain part, especially the last one). The personal American stories the movie tells are also very touching. But beside all those very interesting things, the movie isn't very ambitious from a cinematographic point of view (and it's a euphemism, believe me). If you let the argumentative goals of the movie beside, there's not really much left. A documentary has to be more than a argumentative document in order to be cinema. There's TV reportage's for that, and I think "Sicko" doesn't really fit for the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is at it again. Thus far, on the big screen, Moore had tackled GM, gun laws and George Bush. This time out his opponent is the American medical system, which seems like a pretty big easy target. This feature follows the Moore formula by combining humor with stories and interviews that range from heartbreaking to outrageous. His pace is fast and entertaining, though some of the stories are truly heart wrenching, so be prepared. Michael Moore is never afraid to tackle the most powerful institutions in America and this outing is no exception. This time the controversial filmmaker climbs into the ring with the American medical system and sends it down the canvas with a series of international comparison roundhouses and interview uppercuts with those who have suffered in the 37th best health care system in the world and the worst of any industrialized country if his facts are to be taken at face value. With Moore, that is a big 'if'. In my opinion,his heart is always in the right place, but his numbers often are not.Make no mistake. This is propaganda. Moore's point may be valid and the issues he tackles are always deserving of a hard look, but he does not present a balanced view. Any case that his detractors may present is glossed over or not mentioned at all. This doesn't make them right, but remember that his opinion is what gets airtime, here. Some question his facts and some even question his motives, but at least he makes people think about issues that politicians get paid to keep Americans from thinking about. This is an issue that the American people need to take a long hard look at, but don't take Moore's word for it, or even mine. Look at both sides and decide for yourself.(This work first appeared on realmoviereview.com)</fullReview>

'Sicko' deals with the American health care system, one which is surely an oxy-moron after watching this documentary.I don't think I shall ever criticise the NHS ever again after seeing what happens in the US.One interview feature's a woman who's husband was refused a possible life saving bone marrow transplant by her health insurers, he died weeks later.You view this and really wonder what the hell is going on in 'the land of the free', the insurance companies seem to purely operate to make as much money as possible and will do anything to get out of paying.Time and time again they check the fine details of an application looking for small details, one woman is refused treatment when it is disclosed she once had a yeast infection!!Things are brought into terrible perspective when you see the free health care available to people in Canada, France, here in the UK and Cuba, yes Cuba,America's great evil neighbour.It is here that some rescue workers from 911 are treated for various conditions, all they are asked are their names and dates of birth!After watching this you realise that the US "health care" system is one real sick joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Third great movie in a row in one night. So following Ratatouille (2007) &amp; Once (2006), here is the best one : Sicko (2007)Controversial Moore comes back for more. A little less documentary daring than in Bowling for Columbine (2002) and under fire Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), this movie has a script that could almost be a sociology thesis. Although admittedly anecdotal at parts, the construction of his social commentary is thoughtful, revealing, multi-faceted, progressive, thought-provocation, touching, eye-opening, myth-busting, interesting, unexpected and--you've guessed it-- wildly entertaining! Why does a nation as rich as the United States of America have so many real barriers to a healthy, universal health care system? Why is its population afraid of the evil word "Socialism"? Moore pushes it further and talks about free or affordable education, holidays and work hours compared to the rest of the world. He eloquently and efficiently puts it in perspective. Why do a lot of Americains work so hard and get so little in return? Who is profiting from this half a century long fear of Communism? This goes way beyond "Good Night, and Good Luck (2005)"...What if education and health debt or fear of money problem is the new shackles of this modern-day slavery where the needy are thrown out on the streets or left to die?To watch with open-minded friends and discuss at length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine film about a very important topic, but not Moore's best film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may hurt a little, Moore states in his ads. But, once the film starts, everyone realizes that the hurting in the United States is HUGE, not little. From folks with no insurance to the ones who do but still slip through the cracks, this microscopic look at the medicine show in the United States is sickening, to say the least. If you have no insurance, you face the dilemma of the man in the Pacific northwest, who lopped off the tops of two fingers while sawing wood. The ring finger got a price tag of $12,000 to fix but the middle finger would have cost $60,000. Guess who is going without the top of his bird-flipping finger? Then, there is the 22 year old cervical cancer victim who was told by her insurance company that treatment would not be covered because she was "too young" to have such a disease! From the man with insurance who passed away from kidney cancer because his health provider would not pay for a bone marrow transplant to the woman whose daughter died because mom went to the "wrong" (out of network) hospital's emergency room, this film is a litany of sorrowful bad medicine tales from the richest country in the world. Moore does provide some comic relief when he visits Canada, Britain, and France, where universal health care is a fact of life. For example, there is a cashier's office at a British infirmary, but it doesn't take money IN, only doles out transportation fare to those who can not drive themselves home! Most heartbreaking of all is the story of the 911 workers who suffer terrible lung ailments, among other problems, and the country that refuses to help pay for their health issues. When Moore goes to Cuba and gets great treatment at the local hospital for these poor folks, how can you not be moved? An inhaler, for example, that cost a lady $120 in the states costs only 5 CENTS in Cuba! How horrible, indeed. And, most importantly, drug companies, lobbyists, and insurance companies spend big money fighting those who advocate universal coverage, money that could adequately provide the funds for everyone to have the medical care they need! Although this is not Moore's snappiest or best edited film (Bowling for Columbine is a better, sharper movie), the subject matter is so important that it should be viewed by all Americans and, especially, by those who govern this country and have the power to change the situation. Let's do hope that Sicko will be the Uncle Tom's Cabin for the medical situation in these here United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Nation in Crisis..........The United States ranks # 37 on providing adequate health care according to The World Health Organization's (WHO)(http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html) ranking of the world's health systems. We rank even below several (almost) "3rd World" countries Costa Rica, Dominica, Columbia &amp; Andorra. The US are most sadly the lowest rated of all the G8 (Group of Eight) Nations.Specifically the focus is on the disparity of the US HMO system &amp; how other nation's peoples cannot even fathom the mechanism of greed, profit, &amp; the corporate "bullying" that goes on here. The interviewees (foreign residents) in this movie come short of calling our system "Criminal". They chuckle &amp; naively giggle when financial issues of HC are discussed, as they understand health care &amp; especially preventative HC should be a government provided necessity. Couple this by the associated financial abuse (insurance premiums, drug costs, etc) of our people, we see what a shocking &amp; disheartening quality our HMOs have become. Shameful.The "circus" of HMO HC in this country has become shameful. Laws &amp; propaganda are dumbing us down. It appears that as a nation we have been raped by the authorities that we elect. That is correct??? We have been raped by the whores that are being FED by the Lobbyists. Sorry Folks- there is no loyalty Here. None. Whether it be by denial of services, delay of services, delay of payment, ridiculously overpriced pharmaceuticals or hellacious co-pays- it is quite obvious that the system is very, very wrong here.HMO is actually an oxymoron for what happens here in the US. Preventative health is a very very important issue worldwide. There is so much more that goes into the HEALTH part. The movie integrates concepts of how personal indebtedness, personal powerlessness, excessive education expenses, the "search" of the American Dream, frustration of/with the system &amp; just how WRONG our system really is. Most businesses understand that: "A few bucks now saves a whole hellofalot later". HMOs &amp; drug companies are unregulated "big monster" greedy, nasty, self insured moneymaking machines. The movie made me cry multiple times, &amp; anger still resides. Moore did a wonderful presentation @ the human-side of the world- at the person level. Whether a resident of Cuba, France, Britain or Canada- we are just people who feel, &amp; breath, &amp; live &amp; Love. People. We all are (or could be) just beautiful people.We MUST consider the sources of our propaganda. We must understand why &amp; how laws that affect us are created. We must understand what the "ulterior motive" of government officials are. We must understand that in most countries the government is afraid of the people. We must be aware of issues that are being delivered. In any society when the foxes have the keys to the hen-house- this is a red flag. It is very, very apparent that these issues are wrong &amp; are not going to go away soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT Michael Moore, like all good film makers, manipulates his audience well. It really is not all that difficult. He uses the documentary format to make his point.Documentaries do not need to present both sides of each story - and this film, like his previous films, do not.In Sicko, he finds some examples of American citizens who are not treated well by the U.S. health care system. Of course we don't know how many Americans receive such shoddy treatment, but the point is, that it happens at all, when compared to other nations systems.He gives examples of other 'Western' nations like Canada, Britain and France, who's healthcare is free and available to anyone. In Canada they had a 'Greatest Canadian' contest and the most votes went to the man who started their universal healthcare system.He touches for a moment on the system that has been so corrupted, starting in congress, manipulated by powerful drug companies. But only for a moment.The real punch comes when Mr. Moore reached into the 'emotional heart of America' and pulled it out! That is, the 'heroes of 911' - the rescue workers - who were at ground zero and now are suffering the effects of inhaling the air from that area, who now cannot get the healthcare they need.But he doesn't stop there - he then takes them to Guantano Bay, Cuba to see if he can get some of the healthcare that the supposed terrorists who caused 911 are themselves getting for free! And if that's not enough there is yet another slap in the face - or punch to the gut - to America's horrible system... he DOES get the rescue workers treatment in Cuba! Where they turn down no one. Yes, this evil third world country treats them for free.In the end he makes the point very simple - if something, no matter what it is, is better else where, would we not want to adapt and change that 'thing' here? If poorer nations can do it...Finally he makes his plea... it makes sense to care for one another. A strong nation would do that.Simple compassion is all he asks for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sicko" pokes our consciences to act!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the sneak preview of Michael Moore's "Sicko." Moore is a great satirists, and like other satirists is reviled by those who can't handle the bald truth. "Sicko" reveals a health care system that has been so corrupted it no longer helps and very often harms many of the people who find themselves in its "care." The film's overriding question is why do we put up with such a cruel and inept system when there are models all around us of heath care systems that work! Viewers will have to look into their own souls for an answer to that question, but Moore speculates that we are so indentured to our debts that we have become afraid to rock the boat, to demand something better for ourselves. Moore sums it up when he says in France the government is afraid of the people and thus serves them, while here the reverse is true. I hope he is right and that it is our lack of courage and not our lack of heart that has allowed this thing to evolve. Moore's film informs, entertains, but most importantly pokes at our consciences to act. A toast to Michael Moore. I hope he and his film succeeds. We will all be better off for it.</fullReview>

It is sad, that America losing its name in the World as "country of the dreams". But it is not surprising, when such person as George Bush was elected TWICE. If George Bush is the best choice America can give... it tells much about people, who elected such person and what they deserve - big and juicy bull#hit from government. USA is big and united and that gives advantages for economy. It is scaring how man with child's brain gets massive weapons and plays with it? Blind believing and lost of reasoning thinking led to situation when government can fool all nation easily with demagogy and to bad health-care or outspread guns. Americans like to show their big guns to whole world. But it is how you get fear, not respect :). Until USA have such citizens as Michael Moore, hope is not dead :).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the dialogue on health care that occurs in the movie is one that i hear almost daily. my wife and i are constantly worried about our livelihood based on the single question of coverage. when you work in a field as an independent contractor as i do, meaning i work for myself instead of a corporation, it's nearly impossible to negotiate medical insurance. out-of-pocket coverage is very expensive. this film puts that same dialogue, a real concern of real people, on display for the world to share. seeing the film in a room with 100 or so people was very empowering. an argument against this film exists. but this one is just too logical to ignore. now i will be waiting to see if the policy-makers in the U.S. (including the new president) seize this opportunity to make right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike the other comments, I have actually seen this move, twice....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moores probe into the American health care system is more than an emotional story of patients being denied care and suffering dire consequences, in fact it is probably one of his most broadly touching movies he has made in his life. The facts and stories Moore presents do not seem biased or politically motivated unlike his other movies, yet seems to be heartfelt and sympathetic towards people who have been left behind, totally ignored or neglected by the health insurance industry. Everybody knows someone who has had some major problem with their insurance or HMO and that's exactly why Moore made this film. Although in the meantime he manages to make the U.S.'es health care system look like greed filled, patient maiming, demon, which to some it could be. One thing I liked also is Moore's ability to reach cross-generations, this movie isn't about old lady's in their wheelchairs who have been duped by Medicare, no- in fact, it presents all different stories from people with unlike socio-economic backgrounds. I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I will just say that, it is a must watch, even if you do not agree with it. People have to remember that these are films, Moore isn't a scientist, he is trying to illicit a reaction from his audience, and that I believed he succeeded wildly in doing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have three very strong sentiments about the focus of this movie: I hate hospitals (though I know they are necessary); I have a strong distaste for allopathic doctors (and seeing I have no alternatives to that, I am forced to use one); and finally I ABHOR insurance. So, knowing that Michael Moore likes to present his views in a manner that is meant to provoke a strong sentimental response from his viewing public, little wonder I had nothing but sympathy for all the subjects covered in this movie.Michael has a wonderful ability to view things through the confines of a hand held telescope. He spots his target and twists it in whatever manner he wants, omitting a vast amount of peripheral that surrounds him. Its tainted. Its annoying. Its propensive. Its relentless. It wouldn't be a Michael Moore film if these things weren't in place. He has a way of focusing on the mole just above the upper lip than just looking at the entire face and it's expressions.Michael unearths things that just rattle you. You see the stuff you just want to see or hear of. You see people getting kicked out of hospitals, people leaving the US to get the health care they need, other countries that don't live in fear of the bureaucracy of the hospital business process, how pitted the system is, and the lives of people that actually work under foreign medical systems that get paid little but live quite well. As I forewarned, I almost hate the whole thing, so when I hear of patients getting dropped off on a corner by a hospital because that person is unable to pay for proper health care or medicine, my fuel tank about explodes. It also alerts me just how placated I have become in the years where I don't think there is a damn thing that can be done until the whole system breaks down. When that happens, it will take America with it.OK, I'm in debate mode and need to move on. But just the heat generated by this review should give you ample warning that this movie hits nerves, as well as has nerve. Its not a movie I would care to watch again, I am already aware it exists. On topic, it's well focused. On production, it's edited and narrated poignantly. But for a director, writer and whatever else he is, for a fat man who eats his fair share of burgers and fries, it's quite a paradox that he chose this subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forgive me but I find it well meaning trash.But it is trash. Of course I feel for everyone and yes its clear the health care system is broken but ultimately this movie is more manipulation than anything. Yes its nice and all but it doesn't do anything. Slanted to a fault (how could it not be) its Moore telling you something is wrong but not really offering any real solutions. (Hi- your house is on fire and your neighbors isn't, you point is what?) I can see why its dying at the box office, there is nothing you haven't seen before or nothing that hasn't been discussed on TV. Fahrenheit 911 at least made you think and laid out why we were in the crappy situation, Sicko is just "This is bad". Like his earlier Bowling for Columbine the film is very much a set up, especially in the second half where Moore's antics or at least his camera crew and presence result in some staged scenes-the whole Cuba thing. My reaction during most of it was "Yes and?" Forgive me but I really didn't like the film much. I don't need a rich film maker telling me "You're doomed" for two hours and then offering no real solutions other than universal health care- which he knows will be difficult to get by congress. What can I say but it would be nice to be able to clip off a check for 12 grand to send it to some one who hates me so they can pay their medical bills.Its a well made manipulative film, but other than inducing anger and depression it doesn't enlighten or point away anywhere, well it does- anywhere but the US- then again it doesn't show you the downside of not being here.Is it worth seeing? No, not really. I think you'll get more out of a discussion on a TV news program (so long as its not on FOX)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very, very, very, very one sided view of things. This side left out a great amount of information and did not present a complete picture. Should we not keep in mind that the actors in this film are receiving a sort of "reward" for their presentation? At times, this reward had the appearance of life saving gift. Remember, we are still all mortal. Is illness better abroad than in the USA? When you are ill do you not treasure those who care around you? Home is where the hear is, shall we say? I have total and complete empathy for all involved and wish the world could do for them everything they need to find a cure for their ailments. This movie was not really a view of what should be in America to me, but more of a patient's quest for symptom relief and hope for a better future. Looking at health care with rose colored glasses isn't the way to do, in my opinion. Nothing is so perfect as the side of health care presented in this movie. It's a movie in all senses of the word movie.We all have problems that at times we want the world to help us resolve, don't we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore makes interesting films, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>just remember they are one sided from his point of view. Michael Moore does a good job in getting his point across: in this case that socialistic health care in Europe or Canada is better than what we have in the United States. He acts like it's a crime that people and/or employers should have to be responsible for paying for health insurance. I'm sure he found the most extreme cases to use in this movie and that the US system is not as bad as he makes it sound. While what they do in Europe does have advantages, you also have to wait a long time to see any specialist and operations could take months to ever get.While I think Moore picked a good topic to do this film on, it just takes something away when he opens the movie with comments from President Bush. Look, we know he doesn't like Bush, and he doesn't need to bash him in this film.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend watching this. Get a chance to see what health care is like in Europe, but just take anything said with a grain of salt because like all Moore films, this one is biased from the start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, A Joy to Watch -- And Selective in its Truth Telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sicko" is a brilliant and powerful film. Exceptional for a documentary on a painful topic, "Sicko" is also a joy to watch. Michael Moore's mastery delivers laugh-out-loud funny scenes, and, then, with the whiplash tension of a rapid car chase, it wrenches tears from the viewer's eyes. Master magician that he is, Moore educates even while he entertains. You'll know more about the American health care system after watching this movie than after reading many a newspaper article.So far so good. The problem is that, as ever, Moore is selective in his truth telling. Moore compares America's monstrous and demonstrably murderous health care system to better systems in Canada, England, France, Cuba, and Norway. Moore is correct, and statistics back him up ? if you compare statistics in industrialized countries on infant mortality, life expectancy, and level of health, by all important measures, Americans suffer from an abysmal health care system.The problem is this. Not only conservatives, whom Moore rightly blames, are responsible for America's mess; Limousine Liberals like Moore himself are *also* responsible.It is acceptable to promote an idea of national identity in Cuba, France, and Norway. If you feel that your next door neighbor is like you, and if you feel that you and your next door neighbor are part of the same team, you are more likely to pay into a health care system that protects your next door neighbor. Limousine Liberals helped to destroy America's sense of national identity, and the sense that all Americans are on the same team. Multiculturalism, hyphenated identities, and "hate America" ideology, combined with American individualism, atomized Americans. Sadly, Michael Moore is now supporting for president the poster child of hate America first ideology ? Barack Obama, of Never-been-proud-of-America / God-d--n-America / black-supremacy fame. Limousine Liberalism drove Americans apart from Americans, and that is a big reason we don't have national health care.Another key factor Moore never so much mentions, an omission so egregious it weakens his entire thesis, is the impact of the welfare state on African American families and employment, and on all Americans' understanding of national health care.There are many thinkers, including African American ones (read, for example, Walter E. Williams), who insist that welfare destroyed the black family and work ethic. Illegitimacy among African Americans skyrocketed with the introduction of welfare, and employment plummeted. Americans are wary of big government programs exactly because of what happened with welfare. Moore may not like this fact, but if he wants to be successful in making the case for national health care ? and I hope he is ? he has to be part of increasing a sense of national identity that Americans can be proud of and feel invested in, and he has to explain how national health care will avoid the pitfalls of the welfare state.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The swirl of controversy and the swill of hatred surrounding Moore's gut-wrenchingly honest and unflinchingly humanistic vision seems to get more lunatic and unrealistic with each film. He told the truth about 9/11 and Bush was re-elected anyway he points out that our Medical system is corrupt and grotesque to the point that people are being paid small fortunes to deny the poor of this "great country" basic care....and we wonder why much of the world regards us as being barely civilized.There will always be a bombastic and self righteous few who would rather run around screaming "traitor" and "un-American" like modern day McCarthys rather than open their minds or hearts. Maybe they have never been caught in the "Medicaid Miasma" or seen older people barely able to keep themselves fed because of the gouging done by our ever so "caring" drug companies ( who rank right up there with big oil and the Bush Administration as the most blindly self serving and inhuman institutions in the world today).Anyone who has ever been caught up in the horrific quagmire that passes for "care" in this country...or has ever cared about anyone who has suffered because of the systems lunacy will be moved and enlightened by this superb film...Anyone unable to see it's simple honesty is either in the pay of "big medicine" or in dire need of a heart transplant...in either case I wish them luck. The day when the "care industry" will be changed from profit margins to genuine "Caring for the general Health" will come someday. I just hope a few of us ordinary people being torn in the cogs can wait that long!</fullReview>

Even if the issues brought up are real and serious, the arguments to support them are ridiculous and superficial. However I think a lot of people found the movie inspirational and it is no matter the quality important to bring social issues in movie theaters along with all the other Hollywood "entertainment", along with all the sex, violence and fairy-tales that are promoted by the most influential film producing companies in the world.

		<shortDescription>Short on information - high on anecdotal scare stories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a review about a movie about the shortcomings of the US Health Care System, it's appropriate to say from the get-go that the US has arguably the best health care system in the world. In terms of health outcomes (treatment success rate and survival rate) the US leads in most categories - cancer, heart disease, transplants. Most people don't think of the US as the best because they see the flaws in the system and they see our #37 spot on the 2000 WHO rankings of health systems. What they don't realize is that all health care systems have their flaws and the WHO rankings rated us low because among the factors it included were cost of health services and inequality of access to health services, and WHO used life expectancy (which is skewed, in the US, by high obesity rates, driving rates and smoking rates) instead of health outcomes to measure the overall success of the system.It's because of the misconceptions about the US Health Care System that this movie was so well received. What Michael Moore effectively did in this film is to show anecdotal scare stories about the US health care system and then compare it alongside the best virtues of various socialized health care systems. What we get is a skewed perspective on both the US system and the foreign systems of Canada, the UK and Cuba that he especially looks at. One could easily find plenty of scare stories to show the flaws of these other systems. For example, people regularly die while waiting in line for treatment in Canada. Many people in Great Britain pull out bad teeth at home rather than going to the dentist. But those are just anecdotal. A real comparison would look at the situation as a whole, looking at overall statistics of prices, availability of treatments and success of treatments. A real comparison would look at Medical tourism, including all those Canadians who come to the US for treatment. A real treatment would look at medical research and innovation. Moore does not provide a real comparison.Many of the flaws that Moore sees in the US system are well taken and widely acknowledged, but Moore seems to think that the only alternative is Canadian style socialized medicine. One of the main problems of American healthcare is the cost, but how does transferring that to the government which simply transfers it to the taxpayers solve that problem? He doesn't acknowledge other ideas, like say ending employee-provided insurance or adopting a system of health savings accounts or promoting out-of-pocket payment for minor health services and catastrophe insurance for major, unforeseen problems. Since the faults he focuses on are primarily concerned with health insurance, you'd think he'd look at different ways to provide health insurance. There are many different models out there.Moore's segment on Cuba is probably the most disgraceful segment. Health care for the poor in Cuba is simply atrocious and some Cubans have been trying to raise international awareness of these detestable conditions, but the myth of Cuba's fine health care system lives on because of people like Michael Moore. He asks to see the health care that the average everyday Cuban gets and they of course take him to the best hospital in Cuba only accessible to the elite. Moore never stops to consider the lack of average everyday Cubans in that hospital or the fact that there aren't hospitals like that one anywhere else, nor does he seek to explore the conditions in rural Cuba. Even when he stops at a pharmacist he completely ignores the dearth of medicines on their shelves. Yes, Cuba has a lower infant mortality because they force women to abort bad fetus and don't count some babies as every having been born. In fact, countries vary in how they count infant mortality making international comparisons difficult.Admittedly, Moore's documentary, as always in quite entertaining and engaging. Unfortunately this doesn't make up for the shallowness of the treatment of the subject, and it comes across as more like a big summer blockbuster with lots of explosions and special effects, but not a lot of substance.If you want to learn something about health care in the US among other countries like Canada, Cuba, France and the UK this movie is a bad place to look. The data is limited and biased. Moore doesn't come across as really knowing much about health care and the relative merits of various health care systems except to say that he really likes Canadian health care and doesn't like US health care. Nonetheless, when Moore's lifetime of obesity finally catches up to him and he needs heart surgery, he's probably going to end up going to an American hospital, just like many other wealthy Americans and non-Americans, because he knows that this is the place where he'll get the best treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sicko (2007) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a troublesome evaluation to make on this film. I generally don't like Michael Moore or his scheming tactics and personally skewed propaganda, but as regards his capabilities as a filmmaker, the guy definitely had me hooked with this frighteningly hard-hitting and candid expose' on the "lousy health care system" we have in America. By watching from his very heart-wrenching angle in this film, he almost succeeds in making me despise my own country and starting to wonder if I might be better served moving to Canada, England, or France --- that is, given the way he portrays each of these countries (and Cuba too, by the way) as being so much more hospitable and caring of their patients who require health care. He makes it seem like everyone is thrilled and happy to be treated there, and that each of those places is a shangri-la, compared to the U.S...To wit: Moore parades in front of us one mentally disturbed American woman who is dumped onto the street in a skimpy hospital nightgown as captured on a surveillance camera, just because she couldn't afford medical care; we hear the story of a U.S. man who lost tips of two of his fingers and had to decide which one he could afford to pay to have reattached - $12,000 for the ring finger or $64,000 for the middle finger; we meet sad people who've lost loved ones through cancer and other tragic diseases, simply because they were rejected by insurance for medical coverage. On and on the misery goes......and yet, on the flip side, Moore takes us on a paradise-like retreat to France, where he and we have dinner with a group of young Americans who've decided to live there in Europe after happily sharing what a joy it is to get free health care, and one young woman even says it's very depressing that someone her age can be so well off when she thinks of her old parents back home in the states who've worked hard their whole lives and have nothing, least of all medical security. Moore interviews people awaiting treatment in emergency rooms in Canada, or hanging out in the UK, all basically laughing when he asks them how much they pay for treatment and they all reply "nothing!" with a certain glee and amusement at the mere idea of the need for such a question to be raised. We take a trip to Cuba with Moore and a few very ill U.S. workers who were at the site of the World Trade Center disaster on 9-11-01... and who cannot get proper treatment at home but yet can walk into this other country and receive first-class accommodations, new teeth, and as one asthma victim discovers, she can buy her inhalers for only five cents each in Cuba, where she must pay $120 a piece in America! I have negative stories of my own relating to medical treatment and indifference I've experienced here in the U.S., but I also have some good ones, too. What is the TRUTH? I am extremely mixed up. I knew that this documentary had to be one-sided, and of course it's an agenda film and not very objective, so at first I was going to give this an unprecedented "NO RATING" from me out of sheer uncertainty of the facts; the fact is, I don't know what all the facts are! So what I did the next morning was, I scoured the IMDb to look for reviews form people living in Canada and the UK... and some of them say that much of what Moore sneaks across in his movie are a pack of lies or exaggerations... for example, Canadians are saying the wait for treatment in Canada is horrific. I've read that hospitals in non-U.S. countries are badly run and are very dirty, and that doctors in other countries often leave scalpels and things inside the patients after operations, and so on.... so, did Moore simply use only the key interviews with average citizens that helped make his point? If he interviewed 10 people and only 3 gave him the correct answers he needed, did he ignore the others? How reliable is interviewing one UK doctor and one Cuban doctor, as used in the movie, posing as "conclusive" interviews? Sure, we see the revered group of 9-11 workers given the red carpet treatment in Cuba with open arms and flawless bedside manners from their foreign doctors and well-organized hospitals, but I wonder if that has anything to do with playing to the cameras, knowing they're in the spotlight, and having a priceless chance for opportunism?Who knows anything for sure? That's the trouble I have in making my mind up here. While this is undeniably compelling to watch, I'm also aware that Michael Moore is only showing the side of the story HE wants. Yet at the same time I've read reviews from people in the UK and Canada who wouldn't trade their health care for our system for anything, as well. I'm of the conclusion that we could use free health care here in the U.S.A. (though government need not do our damn laundry, which Moore also points out as an advantage of living elsewhere) but yet just which of the two arrangements (private vs. government) is the more desirable seems to be up to individual circumstances. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the film displayed many of the shortcomings in the American health system but Moore didn't show the "cons" which made this film very bias.Plus, he didn't provide information as to how much these "extravagent" health systems cost the taxpayers of England, France or Canada.I was happy, however, to see all the politicians who accepted money from the insurance companies, including Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush. He mentioned all politicians no matter what party they belong to.I did not "buy" his "unbias" interview with his Canadian relatives. As they were extremely charming people their statements appeared scripted.I'm a bit disappointed in Michael Moore. I was looking forward to this film and all I saw was propaganda for a socialized health system in the U.S.</fullReview>

Since this topic wasn't as obscure as Fahrenheit, I had an easier time digesting it, and when it all comes down to it, it was a well made film. They interviewed former employees gave stories of those who have gotten the worst of the medical care system of the US. When I first saw it, it seemed a little one-sided, however, when I heard Moore's reasoning to not go to the Insurance companies, I felt a little at eased. He did a great job with this film, and the Cuba part of the film was touching. This film is a must see for all, and although it does contain a lot of one sided-ness against the Insurance companies, it seems to be well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can it get better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dodging accusations of editing in certain ways for effect, nearly having the reel seized at Cannes I was wondering if we would ever get to see this film at all, I was also wondering that as it's about the lack of free medical treatment/health insurance in the states if it would translate to outside audiences. Well it does very well as Writer, producer and director Michael Moore travels the globe in search of answers to the question 'why is America the only country in the western world that has to pay to get better?'. Throughout the documentary he visits England, France and even Cuba to seek such an answer and it's quite a journey. The film as a whole is again delivered in the unique style of previous works such as 'Bowling for Columbine' and 'Fahrenheit 911' and weaves a stunning story filled with various ordinary people in extraordinary situations. It starts with the simple tale of a man who loses two fingers in an accident and can only afford to have one sewn back on, it moves to the insurance companies who employ people to deny peoples claims in order to make the company money and ends with several of the rescue worker from September 11th who as a result of being a 'hero' are subsequently left ill with no means to get medical help. Underneath the guise of being a documentary about the American health care system is also a side swipe at America as a country and at us as humans who can let our fellow man suffer unnecessarily. There are some very sombre stories here where the system has failed good, ordinary people so don't expect too many jokes although there are a few Moore classics in there that actually had me crying with laughter, I wont spoilt it for you but I think you'll know what I mean when you see it. Despite what you may think about Moore as a person you can't deny that he can take a serious subject matter and deliver it in such a way that it can hold your attention with the right amount of empathy, anger and entertainment for the duration of the film and get the message across. If you are unsure how you feel about him reserve judgement until you see the part in the film with the guy who runs the biggest anti-Michael Moore website it is just brilliant. Again if you prefer not being told of things that are wrong in the world, then I suggest you bury your head in the sand and avoid this movie if on the other hand you like freedom of information, being challenged and learning how screwed up this planet can be check it out. It cant be easy being Moore to some a public enemy number one and to others a necessary voice, I for one am glad we have him and that he's making films like 'Sicko' long may his work continue and lets have hope however small that his voice will at some point be heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not enjoy Michael Moore's 9-11 movie because it was perhaps a bit too much of one- sidedness. I did enjoy Bowling for Columbine so I did not know what to expect from watching his latest movie, Sicko. It was a fascinating examination of the American health system which offers some of the best care to those who have the financial backing to pay for it and offers practically nothing for those who cannot. The film looks at the health care industry from a variety of angles which is very helpful and it seems the health care industry is primarily focused on profits and not adequate health care for Americans. It is very sad. In Europe where I live we have excellent health care and while we pay for it through our taxes there is also more of a focus on, I think, personal health and wellness than there is in the United States (if those reports about obesity rates are true). One can imagine what the US health care system might be like in another 50 years. Perhaps Michael Moore will make a follow-up documentary then to see if its worse or better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's Sicko takes the slightly contrived, vaguely preachy style of his previous documentaries and partners this with some genuinely emotional human stories.Less reliant on punchy vignettes and cartoons and more focused on case studies, Moore highlights the profit-hungry world of the US healthcare system (or lack of one). To viewers from overseas, this is an extremely enlightening experience, as Moore manages to hit at the central issue of ideology that has so far prevented the US adopting universal healthcare. To viewers inside the US, be prepared for some shocking revelations as you are shown just how different it can theoretically be.Featuring some excellent contributions from real people on every side of the spectrum (Americans living in Europe etc...), and a rather staged yet emotionally effective conclusion, it is difficult to come away from this movie unangered about the state of the "American Dream".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The father of the documentary as way of entertainment strikes again in his least combative and political effort to date, offering the American people a collective groan when relaying many of the sad truths inherent in our national health care system. Of course this is a Michael Moore film, so obviously many of these "truths" will end up being heavily contested and proved false when checked against other information our American underdog probably choose not to include for the benefit of his thesis. In turn, we get a scathing, though surprisingly warm criticism of all that is wrong with United States health care as opposed to all that is right with other country's methods. The results feel a little unfair and predisposed to the oft-criticized Moore-filter which causes all of his generally well made work to be dismissed. Here, one of the world's most popular documentary filmmakers has clearly been bruised in the past by partisan attacks, and does his utmost to simply be a citizen of this country, and ultimately then, the world.</fullReview>

The problem is that people aren't motivated and can't sustain rage long enough to really keep up an ongoing attack against the powers that be.The movie has a hopeful note, as Moore's movies often do, but it may give the general public too much credit. He makes persuasive points and actually gets an audible gasp from the audience when he builds up the Clintons and then suggests that she was well paid to back off on her campaign for health care reform.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore Documentary Is Entertaining as Always, But Leaves a Lot Unanswered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's documentaries are always compulsively entertaining, but they also always leave me feeling miserable about being an American. "Sicko" is about the sorry state of our health insurance industry, and it forces us to face some very uncomfortable truths.However, what I frequently DON'T like about Moore's films, and "Sicko" is guilty of this as well, is that Moore does a lot of complaining without offering solutions. He spends two hours telling us that countries like England, France and even Cuba take better care of their citizens than the U.S., but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that information. His film creates frustration and anger but then doesn't give us any outlets for those feelings. Moore claims that he loves American and is a fervent patriot, but the message that comes across loudest from "Sicko" is a resounding "America Sucks!" Moore's greatest failing in this documentary is to ignore the responsibility Americans have to take control of their own health. Everyone in his movie is a victim of the insurance industry; the greatest defense Americans can take against becoming ensnared in the quagmire is preventive health care, but Moore doesn't address that. Americans need to stop eating fast food, they need to stop smoking. They need to stop the fad diets and lose weight the right away, through exercise and sensible food choices. They need to get out and walk places instead of driving everywhere. American corporations aren't ever going to change their practices because of whining filmmakers. Actions are always going to speak louder than words.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why people say this movie is a little one-sided since i guess the health insurance industry didn't really get a rebuttal to dispute accusations made in the film. I'd would have liked to see people who like the system say something. Also the part where Mr Moore takes the 9/11 volunteers to Guantanamo Bay was sensationalist(Rudy Guiliani style) since the sensitivities towards the victims was used to intensify the message. Another argument against the validity of the film is the use of other alleged isolated incidence where people fell through the cracks of the system. Now that i've told you my criticisms of the film this is why i think it was a great movie and an insight into the American health care system since i really had no idea before. By the way i enjoy Michael Moore's cheeky wit, it kind of reminds me of Jon Stewart Arguments Michael Moore didn't' use :1. Relying on insurance private companies Anyone who has dealt with insurance companies whether it be health, life, automotive or home you know they will find any way not to pay you. This is a business, for PROFIT, that is the main goal. Government bureaucracy and private sector bureaucracy any differences?2. Social Health Care I'm not arguing that sometimes you have to wait for an operation but if it comes down to waiting and never getting cause i can't afford it, i think waiting wins out. In Canada they have stories on the news about waits for surgeries but what they don't have is stories of people dying because they couldn't afford it. There is a priority list for those people with life threatening ailments so they will get bumped up. Also I've never heard of certain treatments being rejected. In Canada if a doctor recommends a treatment then there is no commitee to discuss whether or not to permit it ... IT JUST HAPPENS. Also the amount of taxes paid for health care cost is lower than premiums paid to HMOs. In Canada there is private health clinics which lets those who can afford to pay and avoid the line ups3. Lawyers and Settlements This point i can't argue against. American lawsuit awards are ridiculously high. You'll never see $50 million awards for malpractices any where but in the US. You should probably fix that too but doesn't mean thats the big problem with health care. If there was a cap on law suits put in place do u really think the health costs are gonna go down after the market has been set</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Michael Moore's latest has been billed as an expose on the insurance industry. A better description would be pointing fingers at the U.S. healthcare industry. I don't say that as a bad thing, only to provide a more clear definition of what I just watched.I truly admire Mr. Moore for his ability to bring issues to the forefront and get dialogue and debate started. The downside to his work is that he rarely offers any type of real solution and certainly avoids the "other side" of his chosen topic. Still, he is a master at painting the picture necessary to spur an emotional response from the viewer. The film probably accomplishes this even better than his others. Watching fellow citizens suffer is a most painful experience. To make it worse, a few of his displays are 9/11 rescue workers. How many heart strings can he tug on at once? Very effective.Still, how wonderful it would have been to have details discussed on the viability of social healthcare in the U.S. Sadly, no debate or solutions, just more examples of pain. By bashing the U.S. system and raving about Canada, Britain, France and even Cuba, Moore leads us to believe that the answer is pretty simple if not for the evil politicians in Washington, D.C. Although, I don't expect more from Moore, I certainly had hoped for it.</fullReview>

Even though I might not agree with all his points. Which brings me to my second point. I believe that every story has 2 sides. Not to say the other side of this story is the one I believe but I think that good storytelling in a film such as this needs an explanation of both sides. Other than that, it did make a convincing case for the Pro-National Health Care side of the case. A film that every American should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do we do now, though?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has a lot on his mind. His motivation for starting to work on this subject of health-care companies is well-warranted, but so broad, I had to see what he could make from all this information. I was a bit disappointed with the outcome because with all of the information that he learned, he didn't stop to think about how the United States could accomplish socialized health-care, which he sells as a good point for us to fully understand.The topic of health care alone gets buried underneath the overwhelming new (and, in my opinion, more important) problem of society in America and how we run things when compared to other countries in France, England, Canada, and even Cuba. He acknowledges that we have socialized other things in our society like postal services and firefighters, but he fails to crack open the brains of politicians in this documentary (with interviews) to at least get their opinion on whether it will work (aside from the expert who believes it will never happen in the US). He had some wonderful speakers in the movie, particularly one unforgettable British expert on economics and sociology in our two different cultures. And he's right to believe it will never happen in the US, but it would've been interesting to get some major politician to come in, get his opinion on the matter (in the US), and take off.We all have hard lives no matter the area we live in. It's a division in attitude, not just culture. Simple people live in France and swear by the treatment they get there, fine. Just as the movie says, they're swimming in taxes, which will never fly here. We expect too much for the taxes we get away with. So I fail to see the movie's point other than being a fascination piece. It lacked a lot of the fun that Fahrenheit 911 and Bowling had while talking about the gun control (going to K-Mart and watching actions taking place there) and the president's faults. It told a lot of interesting stories about case studies in the health care world and being an insured person who got faulty treatment, but that's so common that Moore goes towards the down-trodden as a cliché rather than as a novel search in life.Don't get me wrong, I love what this man brings to the table, issue-wise. He has the guts to find a way to Guantanamo Bay as a stunt to receive health care for some of the main people interviewed in the documentary, all of which is fascinating. He tries to turn Americans' heads around for a change on a broad subject, but most of the people in the theater had their jobs to get to the next day, and weren't about to drop everything and move to Canada or France to change their personal health care situations around. That's what I was missing was information on what to do with this documentary and how he expected the audience to take it. Does he expect a complete upheaval in social norms on the multi-billion dollar corporate levels out of this information that he's collected, or does he just want us to know better? I guess it's up to us to decide, but then again, it always has been in his documentaries.</fullReview>

But as a DOCUMENTARY I found it pretty lacking: you cannot base such a strong and important critique on the single stories of people! It typical day-time-TV style: get sad stories, make the audience cry, make them sympathetic. You can't make a point without figures, something objective, numbers, data! You cannot say "in Europe and Canada everything is free and works fine", because every system has its problems. On the whole, even though I heartily agree on its point, this documentary lacks OBJECTIVITY, and this weakens it considerably. That said, I hope people in the US will watch this, OBJECTIVELY, and hopefully change their minds about free health-care systems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited to see Michael Moore's new one and what I saw was one of the worst documentaries I've seen for a long time. Sure, regarding the American health care system, it was an urgent matter to expose all these disturbing facts about the insufficient medical care, but why had this to happen in such a polemic, unobjective manner? Don't get me wrong, I support what Moore stands for but not the way he presents it. He emotionalizes, exaggerates and on the whole I permanently had the impression that he just wants to convince of his viewpoint, no matter what it costs. Sometimes I asked myself, what his real intention was, since he gets side-tracked very often, for instance while discussing the French health care system he ends up asking, why the US government wants its citizens to hate the French. Of course because of their good social care! Further questions aroused while watching this film, such as: Would the Cuban doctors be that nice to the three heroes without a camera? Was it really necessary to defame Guantanamo prisoners by comparing "the evil doers'" good medical care to that of US citizens? Torture is exhausting, I would also need good medical care.I gave two stars because of the effect this movie might have on US citizens, the missing eight stars are for the mere specious, manipulatory character which is not adequate for a documentary discussing that important issues.</fullReview>

However this film is not about them but rather about those people who are "fortunate" enough to be able to have health insurance and be within the system. Moore looks at the system, exposing how the HMO's make their money, how the system may not work for everyone and also how all those other "socialist" systems work in places like Canada, France, UK.After F9/11 I was not that bothered about seeing the next Michael Moore film. OK the topic interested me but I wasn't sure how keen I was to have Moore preach at me for two hours; I mean, I agree with many of his opinions but at times he is his own worst enemy, often feeling like he doesn't have confidence in his arguments and must overcook and push everything to manipulate the audience where really the facts speak louder than his tub-thumping or theatrics. Sadly so it is with Sicko, a film that is part documentary but a bigger part opinion and personality driven point scoring. Watching it as a liberal the subject makes it interesting and entertaining because most of the time you are the choir and it is easy to agree with the logic behind the points being made. I say logic "behind" the points because Moore simply cannot keep his focus on the facts and Sicko is yet another film that will effortlessly be dismissed by the right.To some this is not a criticism because they watch the film like we all watch porn ? we love what we see and see get off on it, the fact that others might like other things doesn't concern us. However to me (and Moore) the film should not be preaching to the choir but rather making a case that those that previously disagree with the views expressed are forced to at least consider the argument. You know Moore feels this way because he believed that screening F9/11 on the eve of the last election would help push Bush out; to me this only shows how unaware he is of his own weaknesses ? and I say that as one that watches his films and agrees with many of his opinions. With Sicko he has a point but rather than focus on the facts and make strong arguments he decides to do a series of stunts to prove himself right. These are interesting enough but again those that disagree will simply point out the things he ignores about the UK system (for example). Moore loads the gun himself in this regard because by widening the subject with a cheerful flourish he undermines his own argument, and not even I will defend his crass, baiting stunt of going to Cuba with some 9/11 heroes. It is frustrating to watch because you do so wish that someone with his level of exposure would make more of a fist of impacting and changing those that currently do not ? by appealing to those that already agree with these politics he is really just further polarising politics in the US (which is not easy to do let me tell you).Overall then Sicko is either an OK interesting film or one to be instantly ignored ? it depends on your politics. If you are very much on the right then he offers nothing to convince you to watch, far less change your mind. Meanwhile those on the left or the middle will find themselves agreeing with the points made but struggling to agree with the simplistic and personality-driven manner in which Moore delivers it. Moore has always had an element of this in his work but, for all its value as an interesting piece of entertainment, Sicko proves that it seems to be getting worse the more famous he gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great First Half, Falls Apart a Bit in Cuba</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's produced a good film about an important subject. The first half of the film is a searing indictment of our current private payer model of health insurance. Moore talks to numerous people who were denied care for necessary, even lifesaving operations. He also talks to current and former health insurance officials who relate how they are rewarded by their employers for denying coverage to people. This first half of the film will break your heart and will make you question why we do things the way we do. Moore then goes on a tour of several countries with socialized medicine: Canada, England, France. These countries have world class health care and pay nothing, or only nominal fees. He dispels some of the myths that opponents of universal health care put forward, such as that the quality of care is lower, or that there are huge waiting lines. But the film falls apart a bit when Moore goes to Cuba. Moore, as the commercials show, takes 9/11 rescue workers to Cuba to attempt to get free health care at Gitmo. He fails of course and then takes them to a Cuban hospital. At this point Moore seems to lose the point of his film. The point is to show why universal health care is good in the US, not to show that Cuba isn't the satanic tyranny which generations of politicians have claimed. Moore clearly has a high opinion of Cuba, but the fact remains that this is a dictatorship which has always been fond of publicity stunts and the idea that they received the care which an average Cuban did is unlikely. Furthermore, all communist countries in history have been notoriously corrupt and with real class differences based on political standing. I suppose it's possible that Cuba didn't develop the Nomenklatura which every other communist state developed, but it seems unlikely. But beyond this the Cuba excursion will just turn off people who aren't as open minded about Cuba as Moore is. There are some other digressions, such as an early love letter to Hillary Clinton and a bizarre criticism of the US eduction system, which mar an otherwise fine film. However, this should still be viewed by anyone who cares about America's health.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally watched this movie - very entertaining nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One earlier review title sums it up - short on information, high on anecdotal scare stories. I enjoy Michael Moore as a film-maker. Canadian Bacon was fun, it was a spoof, it was fictional. Sicko cannot be described as 'fictional' but it is no more realistic than Canadian Bacon. No health care system in the world is perfect, the US is certainly no exception. But, the description of the Cuban system was so ludicrously inaccurate and misleading as to be laughable. Can a health care system, where officials of the national blood service knowingly, willfully allow HIV-infected blood to be distributed for transfusions (as was the case in France) be considered exemplary? And the greatest pressure in US hospitals to get patients 'out the door' comes not from private insurance companies but from public-funded programs (Medicare / Medicaid). Outcomes data clearly document that if you have a serious illness, there is no better place to be than the US. If a 12 year old girl severs a digit, a thumb for example, she will probably get excellent, low/no cost wound care in Canada and the UK, and grow up without a thumb. In the US she might even be able to have that thumb surgically re-attached (that is fact, albeit anecdotal), although that is not guaranteed, some insurance programs will not cover the surgery, and the success rate is far from 100%. If Moore had started with the premise, 'Who has had a fantastic experience with health care in the US', he could just as easily have produced a so-called documentary with a very different message, but which would have probably also been equally unrepresentative of reality. Enjoy the movie, but don't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, even with some wandering off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before the opening credits are over, Michael Moore tells us this movie is not for the 50 million Americans who don't have health insurance, but for the 250 million Americans who do. Actually Moore is lowballing his potential audience a little; it's more like 256 million. This, like other figures that are a bit off the mark, does not make the film the complete fraud that Moore's most shrill critics would have you believe it is. (Every politically motivated documentary does this. The discerning viewer figures out what's been fudged and what hasn't.) Moore clearly wants you to think about this: The only thing in your life that you absolutely cannot replace - your health - is being managed for profit. And while it may not happen to you, an insurance company may someday decide that your health is too expensive for them to pay for.As he always does, Moore presents his case in an entertaining way, with funny stock footage, plus light and breezy music played over depressing facts and images. (A highlight is a recording of Ronald Reagan way back in the late 1950s, describing universal health coverage as the first step to full-blown commie socialism.) The idea is to work you into a moral outrage about how we can let this happen, and that part works well.Then as he sometimes does, Moore starts reaching out a bit too much to make extra points that don't fit the scope of the movie. There's some wandering off into college loans, and how there is no more American dream for my generation. There's also a funny but off-topic conversation with some former Americans in Paris who talk about the generous maternity leave and child care options their government makes available to them. I could see him trying to connect these to his main point, but it didn't quite work for me.And as he often does, Moore leaves out some facts that make our current situation a bit better. For instance, maybe Britain and Canada and France have better health care systems than the U.S., but our standards of living are a bit higher too. (The French youth who rioted in the Parisian suburbs a couple of years ago all had health coverage - I mean, what else could they possibly need? Jobs?) Also, maybe prescription drugs are a hell of a lot cheaper in Cuba than in the U.S., but that doesn't automatically make Fidel Castro a great guy and a humanitarian. This probably could have been avoided by pointing out that we live in a pretty great country, at least until we get sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Propaganda from Moore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to make several qualifications:1. I enjoyed the film, and I don't mind the debate...Moore was at times funny, especially when dealing with Canadians (how can you not be?) 2. I work in the health-care field. Moore's distortions, misdirections, and omissions were glaring.The film itself was entertaining. I did feel that he went long, and could have easily cut the much of the "french socialism rules" portion. While he may make french socialism look appealing, a more realistic look at France could have included their near 20% unemployment (much higher if you are under 34 or a minority) and low productivity. Plus, isn't this film supposed to be about health-care?But how does Moore distort the truth?First glaring omission was that he left out any "the other side" entirely in this debate. If the actions of the insurance companies or Doctors were so egregious, he should have salivated at the prospects of putting a spokesperson for the industry on the camera about some of the cases he presented....after all, his contention is that the insurance company "caused these people's deaths." How could they explain this away? Sadly is, the only reason they couldn't was that Moore doesn't give them the opportunity to.If we are searching for truth Mr. Moore, why not present two sides of the story?We are shown one individual who dies....DIES, 5 days after he's denied approval for a bone marrow transplant, to which he had the "perfect donor" in his little brother. The insurance company surely has blood on it's hand after denying him this "life saving surgery."Or does it? First, we never get the whole story. What stage renal cancer did this individual have? What was his prognosis? Did he receive conventional treatment (there are a myriad of conventional treatments out there...so how did he find himself at a point of searching for experimental treatments?)? Was there complicating factors?What was omitted seems to suggest to this observer a very sad case. He probably had a very aggressive or was at a very advanced stage of the disease that was not responding to any conventional treatment. Sadly, when the disease advances to a certain point, and treatments are proving to be ineffective, the prognosis for the individual is certainly death.Bone marrow transplant in the case of renal cancer, even very advanced stages is certainly a new one to me. To suggest that it's experimental is an understatement to say the least. That the surgery was even offered at this late stage is mystifying, even. With the individual dying 5 days after his final denial (even considering the purported 3 week prognosis offered by his doctors) suggest that his condition was probably known to be terminal for some time.No countries health-care system, despite it's "ranking," would have likely offered this option to the patient and his family. I feel that sadly, the board of trustee's were made to be the bad guys in a case where the patient and his wife were simply in stages of denial, including bargaining and anger, and had to be the ones that gave them the sad news that "no" because he was dying.But, it wouldn't be like Moore to look at the whole picture...especially if it doesn't work toward his agenda. To add race into this case was even better (But Moore could have pointed out that in the US, blacks have better survival rates than whites with this particular disease).Was using cases like this to create a false impression of US health-care the exception in this movie? No, it was the norm. Many of the cases used had omissions similar to this. Maybe he was afraid of HIPPA? Why did he not make the case what kind of treatment these individuals would have received in other countries? Would the deceased patient above have received a bone marrow transplant in Canada?But this is Moore. He doesn't really make films to make honest contributions to debate, but to make money. He knows his base of fans will eat his stuff up, lining his own pockets with millions of dollars in the process. Does he make stuff they'll enjoy? You bet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptive mind games with a sense of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film three stars because that's about how many true statements it contains. But firstly, this director uses the same psychological machinations that the latest president's political consultants used to get him elected - cognitive dissonance (tension which comes from holding two conflicting or unconnected thoughts in the mind at the same time). The images on the screen hold very little or no reinforcement of what the hippyish narrator is saying, and usually distracts from the point. They do, however, reinforce multitudinous snide innuendos.I could only absorb what was said by not watching the screen, but only listening. Listening was made difficult because the music (also distracting and irrelevant) was way too loud. In order to hear the narratives, you have to turn up the volume and put up with ear-splitting music apparently also designed to enhance the dissonance.The "meat" of the film is that there are cycles in society which lead to war, peace, prosperity and medicinal prosperance. Guess which one we're NOT in. This doomsday presentation traces all the blame to a US generation that is easy to make fun of, with no tenable connection, for the debt and inflation explosion at the inevitable disaster. I've not read all the books by the scholars interviewed, but I'm familiar enough with the liberal organizations they associate themselves with. Economics is the result of more than just opinions, but productivity, creativity and policy. They correctly point out the flaws in the recent (post 2008) desperate machinations of the Fed and US Treasury, but offer no solutions, evasive actions we may take, or even useful warnings.I found tongue-in-cheek humor in the images that flash continuously past the viewer. Some, like a flash of suckling piglets on a sow's abdomen or the many scenes of exploding buildings, appear so ridiculous in view of the narration that if you turned off the sound, this could be an entertaining film.Expect to be alarmed, depressed and confused by this film, not enlightened or edified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm happy Michael Moore accumulated a small fortune out of $119 million grossed from his infamous documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11, a discursive screed against the neocons and George Bush. After Sicko, a trenchant look at the health care industry in the US, if he ever tries to enter an HMO-affiliated hospital in the states, he may be sent home. At least he can buy himself private care.Sicko has not the narrow-minded playfulness of Roger &amp; Me and Bowling for Columbine either: It is a measured, anecdotal reflection on the sad state of health affairs in the US for the 50 million without insurance and those with insurance who live through the calculated denials of service by companies whose mantra could be Nixon's observation, "The less care they give them, the more money they make." This time around, Moore wisely changes tactics by effacing himself in favor of the real people's words. He does appear and does a modicum of his usual grandstanding but not as the Colombo-like, shabby but savvy interlocutor. This time he is a low-key agent provocateur, letting the victims tell their stories.But even more effective is telling stories in countries such as France (rated number one by the World Health Organization), England, Canada, and Cuba, all of whose health care is happily provided by the government and happily received by a populace more at ease with their healthy future than we. Cuba, the poorest of the Western countries featured, has a healthy population living longer than the wealthy one a few miles north.I don't hold Michael Moore to the standards of research I might Al Gore, whose global warming diatribe, An Inconvenient Truth, relies on statistics to make its cogent case. Moore wants to promote discussion about our health care, and although he is certifiably liberal on that matter, he makes no claim to serious research. And incite discussion he does?our film critics talked at length after the film about the subject, not about the truth of the documentary but the truth of our own experiences and impressions of the US health care empire.Moore is a filmmaker first and an entertainer second who knows how to provoke, not a researcher trying to impress. Although he can be faulted for rarely nodding to the other side, he can never be condemned for being boring. In the end, Democrats or Republicans may equally shout about other countries' care, "Why can't we do that?" Well, Iraq bills need to be paid . . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please remember...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie predominately focuses on HMO's, please remember that it it does not reflect PPO's or the like. While socialized medicine does sound attractive on the surface..."No Worries" attitude, it also beings a hefty "punch" with it. I am a mother of an Autistic child and a diabetic. While my son would receive "free" therapy, I know from EXPERIENCE and RESEARCH it will not be the best or more pointedly what he needs in quality and technique. You (or your child) will be stuck with whatever they give you and you should be grateful because it's free. Then they will pat themselves on the back for a job well done...even if it isn't what your child needed or helped your child due to lack of technique and/or the therapist's EDUCATION. That is just the tip of the iceberg. I cannot even begin nor would I want to fathom the GOVERNMENT (because that's who socialized medicine is and who will run and control it), control my son's care after I am gone. GOD FORBID! As a middle-aged woman with diabetes, if, God forbid, I require a kidney transplant or something equally as serious, I can pretty much kiss my life goodbye. I would be considered too high of a risk or would be placed so far down on the list I would die before I got the help I would require. Who would take care of my son then? I am by the way a Registered Nurse, a non-smoker (always have been), a diet-controlled diabetic, and I (and my children) eat predominately organic foods. I also recycle, and have been known many times to help turtles and other "live-stock" cross the road or do whatever is necessary to get them out of harm's way.As part of my Nursing Degree to graduate, one out of the many papers I wrote I decided to research and focus on a comparative analysis of England's, Sweden's, and Canada's socialized health-care systems. It wasn't heartening, it was sad and depressing. You have to ask yourself, If their systems are so great, why does everyone come here to have their work, therapy, surgeries, or procedures done? Why do we have so many illegal (or legal) immigrants? Why do people seek to come here? Why do we have so many foreign college students here getting into medical school and becoming doctors and STAYING instead of going back to their home countries to attend med school or set up practice? It is because our public and private institutions strive to be or encourage the BEST... and THAT is where they want to be. From what I've researched and observed, I don't see them flocking to Canada, England, or Sweden.It isn't the best system, but, thank God it isn't socialized medicine either. I am not saying their isn't room for improvement, but, if you want to attack anyone, then HMO's are it and not necessarily the actual medical system. Doctors' increased rates usually coincides with their increase of mal-practice insurance. And let's not forget the LAWYERS part in the system, which could be considered almost a full half in responsibilities. After all, why else does the doctor's rates go up, why the mal-practice insurance rates go up? Even for the best doctors these concerns are relevant, and they become relevant to you and to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about this film, I got confused, because I thought it was about American waste disposal, but seeing this documentary about the American health care system is even better, from director Michael Moore. He basically showed us some examples of patients that had been dismissed treatment because of glitches in their medical history, they are unable to pay for the bills, or have no health/life insurance, and he also shows the consequences of these procedures. The documentary also shows some people responsible for making and carrying out these American procedures, and their consequences. But he is not just focusing on the American health service, he also came to Britain to see out free service help for the sick and needy. I hate to admit this, but I didn't realise, with the help of the NHS, that care and operations to treat, care and maybe even save a life is free, only unnecessary stuff like for example, a tit job, needs payment. France and Cuba are also focused as having either free service or great health service and facilities, even the secret and protected Guantanimo Bay is a target for Moore to help some friends who need medical attention, but can't get it in America. A good documentary that definitely shows America isn't all perfect, and they boast as the wealthiest nation in the world, well, here's a reason why. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Documentary, Features. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enter all films through the same door: the same mind and eyes. But the filmmakers enter through different doors. Some just want to mine our need for old stories for lucre. Some want to create art, which I find it useful to think of in terms of new stories.And some want to convince, sometimes through inspiration. These are the dangerous ones. They want us to come in with our old stories and leave with new ones. But unlike the case with real art, they have a goal in mind, a specific goal. This is why I am troubled by Pat Robertson's "Christian" film school. Its extremely well funded by mostly lower class donors hoping to buy themselves a place in heaven. Graduates come out ready to fight the devil by winning my soul. Advertisers want to convince as well, but the agenda there is acknowledged and we use different story- combating tools when they knock.What to do with documentaries, though? The very idea is questionable. There is no such thing as honest journalism, not unless you have a commitment from the reader/viewer to actually weigh many stories. So we are confronted with a movie like this. Do we "like" it?What does it mean to be "good?" That it convinces?Michael Moore is getting good at this game. His target stories are less bizarre than in the 9-11 movie. It would have been enough to say that Bush and company were incompetent, superficial and panicked. But he went further with the notion that W was just in it for the bucks. This spun a stronger counter-story. If that film had not been made, Bush probably would not have been in a second term.So here he sticks mostly to stories we already know. Obviously the health industry benefits from things not in the public interest. Obviously they got this privilege through bribery (or influence if you prefer). Yes, it is true that nearly every viewer has a health care horror story. Yes, we already know that every non-American city in a developed country has it better health care wise.So what story is it that Moore needs to spin? What's the thing that he wants us to use to convince ourselves he isn't just a left-wing version of a big fat right wing entertainer?Its the story that universal health care is close to what the American ideal is. Not that it makes sense in a vast battle between armies in Washington, but that it is next to why we all have a social compact, and what that compact is.I admire this film. Its effective, but that's not why. I think in his past projects, He shot from the hip. He saw a wrong and wanted to get help ? to convince viewers ? to make it right. This time he has sought advice. This time he has real storymaking expertise. Sure, he rails on about bribery and greed, but only in so far as establishing his bonafides. I worry though. The fact is that we have HMOs in the US because the bad guys used this very technique in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ads against "socialized medicine." Okay, so the other side after twenty years is now as competent. Is that enough?More precisely, is that enough to make this convincing film a worthwhile experience? Or just a social obligation?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The info shown in this documentary is Cherry-picked and does not show any of the problems of health systems praised in the movie. The main purpose of the movie was, obviously, to make money for Michael Moore, not to be non-biased and show all the facts.I live in Canada, and I also lived in the US, and I had experience with both systems.In the US, if you have a good insurance (like blue cross PPO) and don't have to worry about the money, the service is usually outstanding. You can pick your own doctor, and waiting times are non-existent. Even with good insurance, there is usually some cost (deductibles).In Canada - almost all medical care is free (but not everything - emergency costs 50$ or so, medications are not covered, etc). You cannot pick your own doctor (in theory you can, in practice only few doctors accept new patients), and MDs do not treat you as they should - all they want from you is to get in, and get out as soon as possible, so that they can get their 40-50 bucks from the government (they are paid per visit, not hourly). Rarely it will happen than some MD dedicates you time and attention. Waiting times are horrible (months for MRI, specialists, etc). Michael Moore never talks about this, and I'm sure he must have heard about it, as EVERYBODY here knows that Canadian health system is broken (when it really matters, not when you have something simple like a cold).</fullReview>

Or will a road-to-Damascus experience bring him to reconsider the sour views on American healthcare propagandized in this, his latest film.My wager is that he'll opt for the very best surgeon that privilege can buy, along with a private hospital suite, armed security guards and media handlers primed to spin away the irony.Horror stories can readily enough be found in most areas of life and Moore makes the most of suitable anecdotes, garnishing everything with cute pop musical cues. But he blithely passes over a litany of horrors long identified with socialized medicine: long waits and crowded hospital wards; impersonal service and a lack of choice in physicians; the destruction of incentives to innovate; and the staggering costs to taxpayers of single-payer healthcare.He turns an even blinder eye to that 500-pound gorilla lustily strangling our medical sector in America -- the greedy lawyers whose runaway lawsuits continue to skyrocket the cost of virtually anything connected to medical care. Trial lawyers, one must understand, are regular and heavy contributors to the Democrats ...Michael Moore ceaselessly disparages an America which produces no shortage of millionaires who infer from their own success intellectual abilities embarrassingly beyond their competence.This film will only buttress his standing among both groups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>{I don't understand why Americans hate Mr. Moore so much}I don't understand how people who do not come from a country with 300 million people can find it so easy to group public of opinion of a country that so populated. 50% of this country are against him because he is blatantly bias towards the left. People like me, an independent lefty, are suspicious of him because we know how emotions can dictate judgment... emotion should not weight over fact.. .so I watch all his movies with an open heart and skeptic mind. and I still applaud anyone for taking this on. What has long been the most embarrassing aspect of our social system, along with education, and hopefully supporters with a Republican mentality can see this and then look at their children, and wonder what legacy and protection will be left behind for them. Fact is, the only ones that him are the ones he is working on exposing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought we were rating the movie? Simply put, this movie preaches at you. It shows a number of people whom MM lamely asks questions (I'm not kidding, I laughed a few times when he tried to sound like he didn't know he was asking a loaded question) and receives answers that support his point, but don't add to the entertainment value.I'd rather just look through statistics then this question and answer format MM seems to like so much. In fact, the lack of entertainment value and content led me to wonder if MM even put his heart into this one, as opposed to F 9/11 which dealt with a much more touchy and recent topic where he was able to add at least a little satire.To further rant, I was reminded of when my grandfather was a preacher (albeit not too inspiring ;) and he would go through and make some point about a moral he said the Bible says we should follow. Take... "Love thy neighbor" for example. The day before, he would go through and highlight all the passages that support "love thy neighbor". On Sunday, he'd come up, say "The Bible says to love thy neighbor." lead off into some story and come back with "Here in book John... ... It reads "Though Whitey killed John's best friend, John realized that they were still God's children and that they should value that and thus, John again befriended Whitey" (Pardon the blasphemy if you would ;) and repeat this over and over, always saying "... And so the bible says "love thy neighbor".Now, apply that to a film for socialized healthcare, going through point by point and reiterating the same thing over and over and you have Sicko.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of which side of the political spectrum you happen to be on, you should still be appalled at the fact that this Marxist doughnut ingester cares as much about truth and factual information as Obama does about the average person. In other words, not at all. He takes the worst possible examples of our health care system and the best possible examples of the Socialist systems and presents them as if they're the norm. Cuba? Really? Do you think people flee that place because it's TOO awesome? How stupid does Moore think people are? Pretty stupid, and judging by the rating this "documentary" has on this site, he's absolutely right. Try waiting 6 months to see a doctor in the United Kingdom unless its a life-threatening emergency, and that's in a country with 65 million people. Try that same system in a country with 300 million+. Just a little common sense does wonders. Fans of Michael Moore should try it sometime. Most people believe what they believe and don't need pesky facts getting in the way. People that don't like George W. Bush are obviously more inclined to believe he orchestrated 9/11. It doesn't matter that there's no evidence of this or that terrorists TOOK CREDIT FOR IT. It's really pathetic that any leftist propaganda film made in Hollywood, regardless of how absurd, will automatically make money, because its trendy, just as voting for Obama was, and how's that working out for you?</fullReview>

A woman complains of struggling with her rent and expenses as she is now on unemployment and contributed to helping in and around the 9/11 site. In early pictures when she was "healthy", her weight looked healthy. Once she began to have "health issues" - what struck me was the size of her butt! Perhaps she could stop eating junk food and clogging her arteries and take a walk to earn some of her health back! America has a big problem and that is that the health care industry is not equipped to take care of people who abuse themselves. American people have the responsibility to eat right and exercise. I do it. It's no fun and takes time and energy to fold into your life. Please, if you abuse yourself, stop blaming health care and pharmaceutical companies for your shortcomings. America is the fattest place on earth - start changing that now and the health care industry will not be so taxed in taking care of those who take no pride in themselves.

		<shortDescription>An emotional roller-coaster that has good intentions but falls flat on its face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am a 22 year old college student with no political ties or affiliations. I simply want what most everyone else wants...the truth. Michael Moore is undoubtedly a celebrity figure who cares about our country and wants what's best for our people. He does a great job of taking us on a ride full of every emotion one could think of. The problem is that the story he tells us isn't the truth at all, but rather an uneducated, misinterpretation of the U.S. health system all together. I would love to write a 50 page report about how terrible this movie is but instead I'll take a short cut leave you with a few quotes and interesting facts that more accurately depict health insurance in the U.S.John Goodman, of NCPA (National Center for Policy Analysis - a non profit conservative think-tank), says it better: "The movie is full of errors and omissions, but that is almost beside the point?the whole purpose of the film is to compare the worst features of American health care with the best features of health care in Britain, Canada, France and even Cuba?There is no attempt to objectively compare the merits and demerits of different health care systems?There are no interviews with any health policy experts. There is not a single, practical proposal any politician could adopt." "So what is the film about? It's about psychology. It is a perfect storm intersection of three phenomena: left-wing politics, health care altruism and Hollywood. ?the one thing all these groups have in common is the rejection of the idea of incentives. Since economics is the science of incentives, this implies the rejection of economics." There is a lot more from John Goodman and others, including John Stossel's report from 20/20 that includes a point-by-point argument against Michael Moore that can be found throughout the internet.1. Nearly 46 million Americans, or more, cannot get health care because they are uninsured (a Deception ? 40.5% are young, healthy adults that choose to be uninsured; 30% meet public assistance guidelines but are not enrolled; 38% earn more than $50,000; 22% are not US Citizens. Note: The "huge" problem of the uninsured that has dominated health policy discussions for the past 5 years has subsided somewhat in recent months) 2. That wonder French health care system is already $2.6 billion dollars in debt and France is already in talks of ridding themselves of this system in favor of something more like the U.S. It's interesting that the socialist party in France also lost their last election...one would believe that would have went the other way if their health care was so great.3. A major myth that Michael Moore has erroneously eluded to in his movie is the idea that insurance companies somehow turn a large profit from health insurance. Only 3 cents of every dollar you spend on insurance turns into profit for insurers. Of that dollar 15 cents goes towards drugs, 21 cents towards physicians, 35 cents goes towards hospitals, and even 6 cents goes towards government costs. Why is the insurance industry being attacked when drug companies take 7 times more of that money? hmm...4. If the quality of Cuba's health care system is so great why did Fidel Castro fly in a doctor from Spain to diagnose problems with his digestive system. I thought the Cuban doctors were supposed to be as good as anyone in the world?What's even worse is that Moore shows the corruption of the U.S. government yet he wants the government to take over health insurance and care in the U.S.?? how does that make sense? I can't even imagine the incredible moral hazard that presents itself when you give everyone "free" health care. Hell, I might even start smoking and drinking all the time if we're going to have all this great "free" health care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, obviously, our current US health care system is severely broken and needs fixing. Although most other countries' health care systems are not quite as perfect as Michael Moore paints them, theirs are at least superior to our system. By virtue of its corrupted for-profit nature, health care in America is currently an expensive privilege, rather than the basic human right it should be. Most Americans already know this, whether we have insurance or not. Yes, our system is terribly wrong. It has been wrong for a long time, and urgently needs to be fixed. So, what has this movie done about it? How much of the estimated $24 million in theatrical profits made by SiCKO did this grade f hypocrite donate to improving the system, or to helping the uninsured in America? He conveniently leaves out several important facts which don't prove his point: this isn't a balanced debate, it's an insulting, deliberately misleading, and redundant monologue. Michael Moore would like us all to believe he's part of the solution, but as always, he's just preaching to the choir, exploiting real people with painful problems for his own personal gain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Moore seems once again to portrayal the facts with a most one-sided look. I have no doubt in my mind that what was said about the American health care system is true with the gross examples presented in this movie. And there is nothing wrong with questioning that system giving said horrible examples of a system failing. However, what Mr. Moore does when comparing the American system to other country's systems simply makes it a Lie. And this is really bad documentary making and all of you people voting this documentary anything above a 6 simply deserve documentaries like this. They are made for you, people that can't think for themselves.Believe it or not but almost all other countries in the world have problems to some extend with their healthcare system too. Certainly not all as rotten as how the American one is presented to be in this documentary, but the glorification of systems like in Canada, France and Britain is grossly oversimplifying the issue. I have nothing against Mr. Moore and I generally find his films enjoyable and important. But this documentary is simply way too black and white. I'm not going to correct Mr. Moore point for point but let me say that of course there are people in France and Britain that have been denied treatment for system technical reasons as well. And a monthly income of $8000 does not define a middle-class income.Mr. Moore's failure to present nuance in this documentary makes it hard to pick out the real facts and distinguish them from fiction or oversimplifications. He is fighting lies with lies so it seems. This subject deserves more than that.4/10</fullReview>

You are willing to take any drug without testing just because the company making it says it will work. You know what when it doesn't work or the side effects are just as bad, you'll be the first ones suing, thus driving up the Medical care prices. The costs in this country would be kept in check if everybody did not sue everybody in the medical field. Why was this part of the US healthcare system left out of the mockumentery? Oh yeah, it would actually show the truth. Your right this issue breaks party line and is all of our problems, but Mr. Moore has always only presented one side. Yes there are great health care facilities all over the world, here in the US and in countries like Cuba, but there are also places that would make a person sick to the stomach, those are left out of this film. Look at how the American government has taken care of us so far, Katrina those people are still waiting for help, and Hurricane Andrew, during the Clinton Admin, those people are still waiting for help. I constantly here people say they are sick of government making decisions for them, and we should be free to make our own decisions. Universial healthcare takes that choice away and it will only open up Pandora's box as to what we can and cannot decide for ourselves. So if you what to give up your freedoms for an easy way out go ahead, just do not complain when it blows up in your faces, and it will trust me. Look at Germany in the 30's and 40's they were promised everything, the government would take care of everything, look what that lead too. Giving a government, no matter who they are absolute power is a bad thing, look at Bush, we always here how he wants absolute power and will stop at nothing to get it. Now look at the other side they want it too. Put aside your party ties and please realize they are both the same. Giving them the power they both want is not in our best interest. If America is so bad and our systems are so bad, why is it that every day people from the countries featured in this movie are risking their lives to come here?</fullReview>

The audience was practically in tears over his soppy voice-over about the beauty of governments caring for others. What world is he talking about? The viewpoints of the foreigners are fraught with phoniness (no one explained how long it took to get an MRI or to see a specialist for surgery abroad). Overuse of technology may be another reason things are expensive here rather than just deprivation by insurance companies. Lest anyone think I am in favor of private insurance, I could have provided Moore with hundreds of insurance-sourced medical horror stories that he just skimmed the surface of.

		<fullReview>I don't buy his argument for socialized medicine. But what I do buy is his argument for corrupt politicians and for medical insurance companies not delivering to paying customers what they are entitled to.This all poses an interesting question. Mr. Moore illuminates the corrupt politicians, but in the same breath proposes that we place our health care and more taxes into their grubby little hands. You and I are already giving up a over a third of our income, just how much more would you like to see your weekly paycheck whittled down. How about half of your paycheck? Maybe more? Uh...I don't think so Mr. Moore. Oh, and name one federal government institution that runs efficiently, and at a reasonable cost - just one. Once you go government, you can't go back.There are so many problems with what Mr. Moore presents here, mostly in the way of omissions. It's very easy asking someone who is receiving something that is "free" (Mr. Moore's word) if they like it and get "Yes!" as an answer. But what is the overall cost. Nothing is free in this world. This "free" system appears to be a bit of a pyramid scheme to me. Do these countries have 12-24 million poor illegal immigrants using their health care system? Why are hospitals closing here if it is all profit? That $40.00 ace bandage that you are charged for probably includes a percentage of someone else's unpaid bill. As for people with preexisting conditions not being able to get insurance, well, that is just common sense to me. The next time you go to the races, keep putting your money down on the pony sure to lose and see what you have at the end of the day. And yes, morally it is sad.So, I have to ask myself, is there no one that got a bad turn from socialized health care? Are there no horror stories on the other side of the border? Did those "sickos" end up on Mr. Moore's cutting room floor? These appear to be all cherry picked examples of what Mr. Moore believes. Someone has to ask these questions, Moore's true believers sure are not asking them. It goes to Moore's credibility. I'm curious, what if your government health care screws up? Who do you sue?What Moore is really asking you to consider is this&#x2026;" Is socialism really so scary and bad? Come, let's start here. You will get all this free stuff." When someone comes up to you and shows you a box of free stuff, you better keep your hand on the wallet in your pocket, because it's probably about to be picked.As for going to Cuba to get health care, well, I wonder why Mr. Moore didn't ask some Cuban doctors to fly to the U.S. on his nickel. There is not a free Cuban on that island, that's why. The are all slaves to a dictator. You can have Castro's education and health care system and his cigars if it means I can't read, write and go where I want to go.You have to scratch your head at any example that uses people under a dictatorship as an example. "You better put on a good show for the American film maker or we will shoot your father in the head". And no one questions that example...Uh huh.Mr. Moore is right, something stinks here, but I am equally sure that more government is not the answer.Quiz: What year was the American Constitution amended guaranteeing all citizens and non-citizens health care?</fullReview>

I wonder if anyone can clarify this point? Another related problem: How likely do you think it is for Americans who visit Havana to travel back to the US with a year's supply of prescription drugs? I find Michael Moore's remedy of socialized medicine for the US to be a little short-sighted. Yes, a doctor in Britain can drive an Audi and live in a nice brownstone with his family and make the equivalent of $200,000.00 a year, but how much of that is taxed?

		<shortDescription>Utopia, equality, Cuba, and other predictable Moorish obsessions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, I thought the title was referring to obese Left-wing misfits who stalk kiddie parks during sunny afternoons.America may have a harsh, "faulty" health care system which favourizes those with plenty of cash, but that is consistent with its Capitalistic "may-the-strongest-survive" competitive world - and I'm all for it. Perhaps some improvements/adjustments are necessary, but equal health care for everyone is not only utterly unrealistic but a road to disaster as well: it is a blatant middle finger to the natural selection process in which the weak and the unintelligent are not supposed to procreate as much as the strong and the intelligent. (May sound harsh - but hey: I didn't create the world, I just live in it). It's the same natural process that turned us from amoebas to ape-like creatures to humans. Funny to what extent Moore's Socialist dogma contradicts Darwin - the same legendary biologist whom Leftists embrace as their own. Laughable. The two aren't compatible at all.The arrogance of Marxists and other Socialists had always been to meddle with the natural human evolution processes by forcing its gullible Utopic dream of "equality" down our throats - and with violence if need be. (And a need for violence in doing this they nearly always had.) The idea which Moore promotes in this silly little propaganda flick, in his endless naivety and ignorance, is that this alleged and hallucinatory future "perfect" society requires equal health care, equal money, equal comfort, equal happiness, equal bliss, equal everything - for everybody.Unfortunately, and I'm not happy about this either, the Universe does not care about either humans or their deluded little wishful-thinking-based "noble goals". If mankind keeps dreaming, wallowing in the mud of its Socialist day-dreams, it will end up at the opposite end of Utopia, namely in a Hellish world in which starvation and wars would make the current state of the world look like a Disney postcard.It has been proved in various studies that the average IQs in Western societies have been steadily sinking in the last century or so. Advances in medicine have a two-edged-sword effect: the flip-side is that they help the weak survive hence spread their genes with far more ease than before, and as populations of mental weaklings increase percentage-wise, so do nations become weaker and weaker themselves, decreasingly able to cope.Equal health care, along with shoving too much money into budgets for the unemployed, only serves to help the hoy-paloy multiply ever more, while the most educated strata of society, more self-centered and egotistical than ever, usually have only one or zero children. IQs are to the most part inherited, not created, hence why this worrying development is a major threat to civilization, an ever worse problem than international terrorism. Yet who addresses it? Moore? No-one addresses it because it is so appallingly un-PC. It's taboo hence everyone is pretending the problem doesn't really exist.Besides, where is all that equality-making health care money supposed to come from? Moore offers no viable solution. As all Marxists, he is an expert in critiquing, but when it comes to offering alternatives he head is a vacuum. Socialists and liberals seem to think that such money grows on trees; you just reach out and - voil? - pluck it and it's yours! The money, of course, would be provided by those same oh-so evil corporations which Leftists detest so much. So they don't hate corporations when they want their money, huh? How very interesting.Europe? That's a laugh. Germany and France, the pillars of the EU, have been continually sinking economically for years now, mostly due to the enormous weight their allegedly wonderful social systems created. Utopia is unachievable, but as long as rosy-eyed dreamers give "inspiring" populist speeches to the masses of hope-searching semi-literates, there will be Chavezes, Michael Moores and Castros in this severely confused world.Moore mentions Cuba. (That was admittedly hilarious.) If Cuba has such a wonderful standard of living why do people try to ESCAPE it - and why don't people from the States and Europe rush to emigrate TO it? Using Cuba as a positive example - for anything (apart from sunny beaches) - is about as stupid and amoral as it gets. It is utterly disrespectful to the Cuban population which has had to put up with an oppressive regime for half a century now.I don't see any of Moore's relatives or the "Socialist Weasel" himself rushing to live in Havana, in spite of the fact that they'd be treated like royalty by Castro and his monarchy.Notice how quickly Communist regimes develop into monarchies (which they supposedly oppose)? See Cuba, North Korea, Nicaragua, etc.For my fairly extensive "Left-wing Propaganda In Cinema" list, email me.</fullReview>

TAXES!!!!!!!!!What Moore failed to tell all of you liberal fanboys is that every single country above the USA on that list of "great" healthcare is also above the USA on the list of highest income tax. I'm not sure that people are aware of this, but the US has a very low average income tax compared to almost every other country. Maybe I just lack compassion or something, but I don't really want the chainsmoking hobo that lives under the bridge taking my tax money because he got lung cancer. If you liberals feel so sorry for him then YOU pay 60% of YOUR income to the government.Oh, and by the way, I've lived in England and Germany (supposedly stellar healthcare systems according to Moore's list) and I've seen cases where regular tax paying middle class people have had to wait for OVER A YEAR for vital operationsThe last time I checked the government can't do much of anything correctly in terms of money. Just look at social security. If you have half a brain you can figure out that Moore is only showing you half the picture. I'm trying to give you the other half so you can make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no more Moore please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this, but now that I've finally seen it I'm somewhat disappointed, this is clearly a dead end for Michael Moore's film-making career and a low point in his crusade for truth and freedom (of speech). First of all, it looks like a made for TV documentary, it has not the usual wit and cleverness of a Michael Moore documentary, the editing is pretty lame too, it is a mediocre piece both in content and execution. Bowling for Columbine remains Moore's best, Farenheit coming in a close second, but Sicko has to be one of his worst efforts to date. Just picking apart the life stories of a random bunch of people does nothing to lend credibility to his arguments, it simply makes it personal but not objective, it's not even all that personal anymore since he doesn't seem to be interested in the human factor but is looking for bizarre circumstances that he can use for HIS narrative (a good documentarian adopts his style to the stories of the people its about, it reconstructs their narrative), like he went to the interviews with a checklist this time. He's still out for laughs and tears, business as usual one might say, but this time it feels even more contrived than usual, more like a freak show than honest sympathy for the health care "victims", sadly he's not after a balanced representation of the health care system itself either, so what's his point, what's his motive? Could it be that although he does hardly appear on screen anymore it's now Moore than ever (pun intended) about self propagating his own persona? Crap happens everywhere, it's a law of nature, no system is perfect, and if you dig long enough, and obviously Moore by now has a large research team at his disposal, you'll find all the grotesque stories your heart and your audience desires, but they in no way will lend credibility to your arguments, and they do not justify calling Sicko a documentary, it's rather a biopic with Moore acting as his own ghostwriter. So, to sum it up, wait until it's on TV (or download it from the net if you must), just don't be part of the hype and buy a ticket for this, buy aspirin instead :) It doesn't even work as a movie this time around either, it's not a comedy, it's not a satire, it's not even good entertainment, with Moore's other documentaries you could at least turn of your brain, ignore the "facts" based side of his cinematic diatribes and just enjoy them as great pieces of fiction and a jukebox approach to modern history and politics. Sicko doesn't go together with popcorn all that well, it's an overlong session of finger pointing with no direction and nowhere to go, no wonder they end up near Guantanamo Bay towards the end of the movie, and when Moore unpacks his bullhorn and tries to communicate with a far off security tower you know you have reached the bottom of ludicrous, it's so pathetic it almost creates an image of Moore as a modern day anti Don Quijote or a fool's fool.</fullReview>

He is pointing out a seriously corrupt and messed up part of our country, but the way he arrives at his conclusions are based on twisted interviews, movie clips and audio snippets. Its blatantly obvious that the audio and some video was manipulated (albeit done in a very clever way) which just undermines his credibility. Its impossible to take him seriously as a filmmaker when you have to sort through his BS. His topics have always been spot on, if he could just manage to stick to the truth, he would be a winner in my book. Unfortunately, he is just as bad as the politicians he smears and attacks. He lies and twist the facts because he knows the average American will get caught up in the emotional aspect of being ripped off with health-care, and not stop to think logically and intelligently about the information he is presenting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I should see Michael Moore's new movie or not, even though I've generally liked his previous works. It took me about 45 minutes into the movie to figure out that this was not even going to attempt to be an even-handed discussion of the health care industry in the U.S. Of course, the insurance companies and the process of filling out forms, requests being denied, etc. all stayed true to form. I don't want to overlook every hardship case known to man pushed in front of your face as the rule, instead of the exception to the rule. The movie very cleverly and without telling you forgets to point out that a very large portion of the dreaded HMO's customer-base is perfectly happy with their current arrangements. Canada, France, and Cuba are rolled out as the countries that the U.S. should try to mimic and whose residents we should covet to be in their shoes. They have such superior health care systems that the other societal deficiencies are able to be deftly overcome through the inherent superior nature within their healthcare systems. The movie says that the U.S. is 23rd best at health care in the world. What it doesn't say is why we are 23rd. Maybe we are that far down since we eat like pigs and don't exercise. I remember when I went through France in 1999 thinking, "Wow, all these people in Europe are so thin and fit." So, in other words, if all the French people came into the U.S. and the Americans went to France, we may just have a completely different result (which is due to people's behaviors and not system design). A fringe byproduct of this movie's slants and glorification of France is that a couple friends of mine now are seriously contemplating moving to France. When will the insanity end? The little blurb at the end of the movie promoting how to cross the border and get healthcare in Canada may well have crossed the proverbial line. The French government doctor's $100,000/yr salary, living in a million dollar house, and vacationing for a month in the South of France may very well have sent even the hard-core for the door. I sure hope this movie is categorized under comedy when it goes to Blockbuster. Your money would be better spent almost anywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will begin by saying that I personally hate Moore. I think he is a communist and a liar. However, he is a good filmmaker and that shows in this movie. He doesn't really bash the government and the usual Bush bashing is limited. Moore really goes after the U.S. insurance companies for exploiting illness for money. In that he does a great job.Next Moore goes on to explain how the health care systems of Britain, France and Cuba are so much better and how the government controls everything so virtually nobody gets left behind. He shows these systems to be almost flawless and the best option to take care of the masses.He could not be further from the truth on that account. Moore never tells you that in these systems you have to wait weeks and sometimes months for treatment, even in an emergency like heart bypass. You appointments with Doctors are limited to a time slot due to Doctors being too busy or on vacation. Doctors make less, so they leave the country to come to America and work. I could go on and on.I had the same problem with this movie as I do with all of Moores movies. Ever movie from "Bowling for Columbine" to "Sicko," he only shows one side of the story... and that just so happens to be the side that proves his point. He never tells you how much taxes would be raised, how long the waits are (in every country that has this system), how thousand upon thousands of Canadians come across the boarder every year for emergency surgeries because the wait is so long in Canada, that hundreds of thousands of people in each of these countries buy private health insurance so that they can be seen quicker, etc.Great filmmaker... yes. Liar... yes. Good movie...NO! When you break this movie down, all it is, is an old style communist propaganda film, showing how "wonderful" full government control is for the people.</fullReview>

All around the world people are suffering and even dying waiting in line for "free health care," while even more people are being slowly bled to death under the burden of paying for it. Now, in some parts of the world, people are even being told that the government will soon refuse to give you the "free health care" you pay for with your taxes if you don't comply with the government's proscribed lifestyle.

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore his own worst enemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sicko is populist filmmaker and activist Michael Moore' latest assault on American society in general and health insurance companies in particular. He offers a view if the U.S. health care system in a documentary format. Join Moore as he collects half-truths from selected anecdotal evidence, filters man-on-the-street interviews, and injects his own bias to synthesize a story. In the process, Moore visits Canada, Cuba and Britain to show us how it's done. Residents tell him unlimited, universal health care doesn't cost them a dime. Ignored is that the British system has become an incubator for terrorists. The highlight of our trip comes in Paris, a Utopian Shangri-La, where we learn universal health care, plus nanny service, child daycare, 5-week vacations and a college education don't cost a dime. And, physicians earn $250,000 a year, and drive German luxury cars. Moore' sharp investigative techniques get to the bottom of Americas heath care dilemma, when he pins the tail on two people we love to hate: Hillary Clinton and Richard Nixon. The film is short on serious input from industry professionals and informative statistics. Comic relief is occasionally provided with irony. At one point, Moore brags he pays the health insurance premium for a man running an anti-Michael Moore website, so the man can continue bashing him. To his credit, he leaves us with two rhetorical questions to ponder. First, aren't we all in this together? And second, why can't the wealthiest nation on the planet care for all its citizens? Both good questions.Sicko is Moore' umpteenth film expressing his personal criticism of American society. Like the never-ending Rocky Balboa series that started in 1976 and is now in its sixth reincarnation, this film is "the next verse same as the first, a little bit louder and a little bit worse". Mr. Moore' films ---- truth be told ---- do nothing to constructively move issues forward. He is political, polarizing, confrontational and seeks conflict (and a big personal paycheck). This is not stiff for a rational discussion, consensus or resolution of the issues he exploits. Roger and Me (1989) has not improved the American auto industry or its workers. Chrysler, GM and Ford are on the verge off bankruptcy. GM has sold its most profitable subsidiaries, GMAC and Delphi (now also in bankruptcy), and merged their Saturn division into its mainstream operations. Meanwhile, the United Auto Worker (UAW) ---- the organization Moore championed 20-years ago --- is in decline and the union is now giving back hard-won benefits gained over nearly a century of partnership with auto companies. Bowling for Columbine (2002) has done nothing for more gun control. The U.S. congress, run by politicians that should know better, has yet to renew assault weapon legislation with the bill in limbo since 13 February 2007, and the beat goes on, and on, and on.Mr. Moore could move to Canada and stand in line waiting for health care while being over taxed, as Canadian-trained physician's desert the system by moving to the USA. Or, he could get low cost health care in Cuba while driving a 50-year-old American car to pay for it, as the inmates paddle inner tubes headed for Florida. Instead, Moore receives some of the best health care in the world, while becoming a multi-millionaire bashing the system that provides it (even a dog knows not to crap in it's own back yard) ------is this a great country or what? Moore is in fact part of the problem not part of the solution. He's a walking health care disaster waiting to happen, his own worst enemy. Overweight, under exercised and mentally conflicted---------Moore is at odds with his country, its society, leaders and public institutions. After he looses 100 pounds, starts exercising daily and gets his head on straight, he will have captured the moral high ground necessary to tell others how to improve the American health care system. Until then, well the word that comes to mind is "sicko".</fullReview>

Then he turns what should be just a movie into a policy statement. And he alleges (along with everyone else of any repute) that there are 45 million Americans with no health insurance. Well, turns out that of those 9 million aren't Americans, about 8 million really do have insurance (they just classify it on national polls as "inadequate"), and 18 million are young and healthy. So... what about the poor with no health insurance. Wait... hang on... oh yeah, there's medicaid! And before you espouse how awful medicade is and say universal health care is the answer, ask yourself this... if they can't get medicaid right, then how would the government get a universal health care system right??

And now he wants to attack capitalism, the very foundation of our thriving economy, through socialized medicine. Yeah, sure it works. That is if you like waiting months if not years to be seen for typical medical problems. There is a Canadian in my band, and he hated the health-care system when he was there. Think about it, the government can't even control the government right now. How the in the world do you think they can control our health-care system?

The subject turned to health care and both gentlemen told me how lucky I was to live in the States where health care was so readily available. The man from Canada told a story of having to drive 60 miles back to his former residence to get health care for his child and he had to wait months to get in. The man from Belgium talked about paying high taxes only to be declined for medical service because it was determined he could wait. Michael Moore is an American hater.

There may be lines in the movie that are considered comedic on the surface, but overall the movie and its message is far from being a comedy. That is part of what is wrong with this country today...we as self-centered Americans, find amusement in the matters that do not personally affect us. On the surface, the person who penned the plot line in referring to "Sicko" as a "comedy" may find it as amusing as a comedy, however, I don't think that Michael Moore meant it as such. Health care in the USA is a very real and very serious matter and should not be trivialized by referring to it as a "comedy" in any context.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another False Debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Sicko, and although there are some very valid points on government and corporate corruption and the lack of humanity in America, I see this film as part of the false debate.America is undergoing its biggest fundamental change in its history, and there are very real issues that need to be brought to the public. This, like many other things you'll see in the media, are only a distraction from the crucially important issues that will affect everyone's future.I gave this a 1/10 simply because a high profile man (moore)didn't use his talents and effort to do something worthwhile. It would have been better to study the pharmaceutical industry... or military contractors, or the enormous changes in human rights in America.Whatever you do... don't talk about the giant pink elephant in the room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criticism of the system without practical alternatives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always, Michael Moore selects his facts very carefully and then delivers them in a manner to persuade. This is NOT objective documentary, it is an argument against private health care for NATIONAL Heath Care.I have lived nationalized health care and it is far worse than the current system.Want to lower medical costs? Have more doctors and nurses involved in the system than Lawyers. But that means limiting lawsuits to ACTUAL damages, not inflated punitive. Punatives when needed go to the government.Someone look at the Pentagon, the IRS and the Postal Service and tell me you want the same government to run your heathcare. Look and MEDICARE and tell me you want to have it for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see this movie at one of the billions of film festivals but at a local theater. The real "sicko" is Mr. Moore himself for presenting a non-realistic view as fact. It's quite simple why health costs have soar and why so many Americans are uninsured.The gigantic awards made by legal actions with a great amount of that award going to lawyers. It has driven Doctors from private practice to HMOs. Tort reform and caps on lawyer fees could reduce visitations fees by 50%.People have the opportunity of getting health insurance but would rather rely on free medical. They spend their money on drugs, booze, and other items that they consider more important then health insurance.The purpose of the government isn't to eliminate individuals responsibilities but to ensure that opportunities exist. Free health care in most cases doesn't work. Note the number of Canadians coming to the US for proper care since it's so difficult to obtain in Canada without excessive waits.At the theater I overheard snickering at some of the ridiculous attempts by Mr. Moore to prove a point by isolated incidents; out of context comments; and illogical assumptions; etc. Mr. Moore's blatant disregard for truth to sell his products is starting to run thin.What can we expect Mr. Moore to attack next? Maybe oil, maybe religion, maybe immigration, maybe the judicial system? How about alleged film makers that make biased and fact-less documentaries for money? The movie is nothing more then a spoof. Get real!</fullReview>
