		<shortDescription>Spectacular re-telling of the Exodus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For sheer spectacle, it's tough to beat the Bible. With "The Prince of Egypt," DreamWorks makes good on its promise to deliver a state-of-the-art animated film that will compete favorably with the best Disney has to offer. As with "Antz," released earlier this year, DreamWorks has successfully resisted the temptation to populate this film with characters that can be turned into further revenue through toy sales. (I do wonder, though, if three soundtrack albums--the film's soundtrack, an "inspirational" album, and a "country" album--were really necessary.) The animation team has accomplished something truly spectacular; watching "The Prince of Egypt" is like seeing life breathed into a rich, luxurious tapestry. The Biblical story told in the books of Genesis and Exodus is followed very faithfully, with only minor changes made for dramatic reasons. The action sequences are truly exciting, overall pacing is excellent, and the miracles wrought by God are depicted with awed and respectful wonder. One truly astonishing, harrowing sequence recounts the slaughter of firstborn Hebrew children by bringing hieroglyphic drawings to life on the walls of an Egyptian temple. The voice work is especially good--Val Kilmer is fine as Moses, and Pharoah, voiced by Ralph Fiennes, positively seethes with arrogance and hubris. The storytellers wisely chose to end their tale at the climactic crossing of the Red Sea; even the delivery of the Ten Commandments is portrayed only in an epilogue vignette. (After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.) Some of the subject matter is dark and disturbing, and there is no shying away from the harsh realities of the original texts. By all means, see it with the children in your life--and be prepared to discuss it with them afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DreamWorks killed Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Mulan, Anastasia and Prince of Egypt in a row. I loved Mulan, I loved Anastasia even more, and now... Well, I must say that Prince of Egypt is probably the best of all. I'd even say, the best animation feature ever produced in the USA (aside from Batman : Mask of the Phantasm).It is a real piece of art, aiming to entertain everybody, not only act as a baby-sitter movie for kids. There aren't even any pets here. Only a great story, moving scenes, credible characters and fantastic music and storyboard. You will love this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are you sitting there when you could be seeing this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly the most astonishing achievement in animation since Beauty and the Beast (and surpassing same), The Prince of Egypt is a lovingly crafted, engaging piece of cinema. The main characters are well-realized, three-dimensional characters. The focus of the film is the conflict between Ramses and his adopted brother, Moses, set against the backdrop of the epic events in the book of Exodus. The result is a religious tale that treats the oft-ignored human element. Instead of merely relating the tale as it is, the story asks "how would a person *feel* if God appeared to them and told them to do this? How would others react?" The script is light-years beyond any past biblical epic. The animation style owes a small debt to Disney's house style, but goes above and beyond in the details in character design (the Hebrews and Egyptians and Midians are clearly of different ethnic backgrounds, and no character suffers from the doe-eyed Disney Belle syndrome). Computer Generated Imagery blends -- for the first time in an animated film -- seamlessly with traditional cel animation. The film also takes some fairly audacious risks; Moses has a dream sequence in stiffly animated hieroglyphics, completely switching animation styles for about five minutes, which I believe is completely unprecedented in animation. There are moments when the visual effects made me forget to breathe. If you blink during the parting of the red sea, you'll regret it. There is, I believe I can safely say, not a second of the film that does not offer some sort of visual delight -- from the deep symbolism of the hieroglyphics to the dizzying chariot race in the opening sequence. The music has been touted by some critics as the film's weak link; such is definitely not the case. Stephen Schwartz' songs combine elements of Broadway-esque show tunes with native Hebrew and Egyptian music. The songs are powerful and moving, sometimes no more than one verse in length, sometimes full-blown seven-minute extravaganzas like "Let My People Go." The one weaker song, surprisingly, is the theme "When You Believe." Even freed from Mariah Carey/Whitney Houston R&amp;B cheese as it is in the movie, it's a watery definition of faith at best. Still, the scene in which it takes place is powerful and the song is beautifully performed. If the film has a weak link, it might be the voice casting,Val Kilmer and Patrick Stewart in particular. The two voices are distinctive of the gentleman who possess them, and thus are distracting in this format. But such is a minor quibble, and should not dissuade anyone from seeing the greatest animated story ever told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visual Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, I have searched for a truly epic film. I have witnessed the genius of Lawrence of Arabia, the majesty of Star Wars, the pupil-dilating battles of Braveheart, but after all that war, I realize that The Prince of Egypt is a little more special than all of them.If not the best film of the year, then the best animated film ever. Its visuals simply can't be described, for its images will stay in your mind forever. They will not be seared, like the brutal images of Saving Private Ryan, but instead, simply stay with you. When you remember them, you will smile, for they are the true meaning of epic.If you don't like the film's story, or even if you don't like the film in general, you will still stare in awe at its visual images. They are the best ever. The parting of the Red Sea is just one of the best. The closing shot is about 10 seconds long and is truly mind-boggling.Animation just hit puberty, and I can't wait to see it become an adult. Go see it. You won't be disappointed, I guarantee you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Artwork, Good Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Moses is done here and, although not totally Biblically accurate, this is about as close as it gets in Hollywood. The inaccuracies are minor.The artwork was fabulous when it came out in 1999. It's still very good, but animation has improved so fast in so short a time period that this is nothing special, art-wise, these day. However, it sure was when it was released just seven years ago. It's just beautiful in parts. Some of the prettiest colors I've seen on film have been in animated movies the last decade, and this is a prime example. The parting of the Red Sea in here is awesomely-done by the artists. That scene also sported the best sound in the 99-minute film.The songs in here were nothing special but they didn't detract from the story because they were all short. Regarding the story, I only wish they had gone into detail on the plagues instead of just lumping them all together. They could have had some jaw-dropping scenes with the locusts, etc.All-in-all a fine film and a rarity: a Biblical film that doesn't offend anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very possibly the finest animation I've seen. Before commenting on the film as a whole, I want to make that clear, because in the inevitable rush to pick this film apart (the plot, the voices, the religious significance, the literary accuracy, the moral issues, the music, the comparisons with Disney and de Mille, etc...) one might easily become distracted from the aesthetic and technical triumphs of The Prince of Egypt, and that would be unfortunate. As someone who has an interest and appreciation of animation, I can say that this is the first film I've seen that successfully integrates computer-generated animation and traditional animation (and I've seen many attempts). More importantly, as someone who has eyes, I can say that the result is a visual experience of intense style and beauty. In fact, the initial depiction of Egypt is so breathtaking, that it seriously hinders the film's later efforts to vilify it.Comparisons with Disney are inevitable, especially because Prince of Egypt employs tired Disney formula in an attempt, I assume, to remain economically viable. What a shame, since Disney hasn't made a decent film since Aladdin. I am referring, of course, to the unnecessary musical numbers and the two high priests, the film's comic relief, who are drawn grossly out of proportion to the other characters. Even worse than their unoriginality, however, is the open mockery of ancient Egyption religion and culture, which these two characters embody. I found their musical number especially appalling. On the other hand, it's a story in which the protagonists succeed only through a greater capacity for cruelty and destruction and the slaughter of innocent children, so it's kind of hard to nail down any concrete moral standard here.In general, I thought the story was well told, with solid direction and a good script. The only complaint I have about the voice acting is that Jeff Goldblum's unmistakable mannerisms seriously distract from his character. I suspect that I wasn't really bothered by the others only because I hadn't seen a cast list before seeing the film. I wish they would stop relying on celebrity voices for animated features. No character can be effective if the viewer can't separate the voice from the actor supplying it.The bottom line is, despite any objections, complaints, or concerns I might have about this film, despite the moral, religious, or idealogical issues it brings up, and despite the $8 and two hours you'll spend, this film is worth seeing. It's worth seeing because of the animation. I hope it sets a new standard for feature-length animated films. At the very least, I think it will show the movie-going public what the medium is capable of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph of graphic excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the author of THE WORLD OF ANIMATION, an Eastman Kodak book which won three international book festival awards and as an animation writer-director, I have for many years longed for the U.S. animation industry to remember that Walt Disney, nor any of the pioneers of animation limited their art to children's audiences.With THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, the DreamWorks animation team has finally taken us full circle and helped the United States join the rest of the world in offering us the first U.S. animated feature since, perhaps, FANTASIA, created for mature audiences while remaining child-friendly. If you aspire to art in any form, and/or specifically love line art and graphics as I do, you must not miss seeing this film on the big screen. I applaud DreamWorks for this triumph in graphic excellence.Two brief critiques: First, the choice of story. The story is based on Exodus from the Old Testament (and other Scripture) which is scanty, to say the least. Although the studio made an effort to flesh out the story with the Ramses/Moses relationship there is simply not enough meat to go around. This opinion is debatable, a very minor aspect and only my view as a story teller. At the bottom line the overall work is so extraordinary any possible lack in literacy is more than made up for in the visual mounting and production of the film, something which is nothing less than inspiring.The other criticism is in the highly questionable use of "name" voices for casting, a puzzling development since there is no meaningful box office data supporting it. This practice is known to conflict the viewer psychologically as the drawn images begin to do battle with the ones in the audience memory with the cerebral bridge of highly recognizable photo images of known voices. Walt Disney knew this quite well and avoided it. Indeed, he used the voice of a complete unknown for Snow White, Adriana Caselotti, (who passed away in 1997). Disney was careful to avoid the existing Hollywood queens of song of the period, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin, the latter, whose prodigious vocal talent actually saved Universal Pictures from going belly up a short time later.However, at the bottom line, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT will become a true classic and has taken the art of animation up to a new threshold, a model to which future animators will aspire.Raul daSilva, New Haven, CT, USA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and powerful. "The Prince of Egypt" has taken animated movies to a new level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Prince of Egypt" is a surprisingly near perfect movie. The beautifully animated has a great story and storytelling, beautiful songs and a great voice cast.Animated movies has been taken to a new level with this movie. This is one of the very first animated movies made for an adult mainstream audience. Still the movie has some misplaced humor and 'Disney' like characters, to make this movie appealing for children as well but really this is more a movie for adults than for children. The movie has a serious undertone and some powerful moments, with the burning bush and the splitting of the red sea as the ultimate highlights of the movie.The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza. voices that stood out to me were Val Kilmer, Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Stewart. But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane. The character's movement and interacting is done really good and with eye for detail.Another wonderful about his movie is the music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. It sounds weird, songs for a serious movie but it works extremely well for the movie and the storytelling and on top of that the songs are all from a very high level of prestige.With this movie DreamWorks showed for the first time that they are a worthy competitor for Disney. The movie and its storytelling are really powerful and impressive and help to make this movie an unforgettable watching experience.It's a great movie for all ages but mainly adults.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adore the Prince of Egypt. Such a stellar cast of voices, and the names don't outweigh the movie. The music is fantastic. It has such a diverse audience, you cannot go wrong with this film. We are all familiar with the base story and we are provided a mild, interpretive, inoffensive version to intrigue and open the mind. If not, it can be enjoyed simply for the color, sound, and simple human emotions and actions that glide over right and wrong. I'm in college, and I listen to this movie while studying. I can't escape, humming in the shower, and learning calculus to the goose-bump inducing tones. The sounds of God capture all emotion and awe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film I thought 'Wow! I have to own that!' The telling of the story of Moses is powerfully done and the art is outstanding. It is the soundtrack, however, that brings this beauty together- the songs as well as the musical scores are catchy, beautifully composed and thoroughly breathtaking. The story has not been 'dumbed down' or watered down. It is accessible to children without alienating other generations and it humanises the characters wonderfully. The only thing in the entire film I found difficult was the pronunciation of Aaron's name- but that is obviously minor, it just took me a while to 'get' if that makes sense.It's amazing, beautiful wonderful the art, music and sheer intelligence of the story will blow you away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best animation ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie, from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Pictures, is a great achievement in animated movies. It tells a story of biblical proportions (literally!) about slave Mozes' life as The Prince of Egypt, and does it in a great way. The animation is truly stunning, especially the scenes when Mozes splits up the Red Sea, and when he turns the Nile into blood (which was really kind of scary). I can't really recommend the whole family (including 7-year old kids) to go see this, but if you're over 12 years old and you know something about the story of Mozes, you'll definitely appreciate this film. I give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the movie theater to watch 'The Prince of Egypt' and the money I spent was very well used,because it is a great movie and one of my favorites from Dreamworks!(And look,I am not catholic or Jew) We have, in this great story, two brothers: one is Egyptian and with royal blood(Ramses),and the other one an orphan with a mysterious past(Moises). They are best friends and they have a great life in their palace,with strong bonds. But when Moises is so arrogant as his brother Ramses,but one night, when he was walking alone at night after searching for a woman(Tzipporah) Miriam and Aaron met with him and are surprised to see their little brother so close. Moises cannot believe that he is not royal and stays angry with Miriam, but stays in doubt after some while, and reading the walls of the pyramid, he discovers the true: that he has Jew blood and was adopted. Angry and thinking that everything he always imagined to be true were illusions, he run away and starts a new life as shepherd and even marrying Tzipporah. But now he has a new mission in his life(sent by God), that is to help his people (The Jews) to not be slaves anymore and go to the Promise Land. But he will need to confront his brother Ramses in this battle, and this will not be an easy thing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i watched 'The Prince of Egypt' in the theatre, i was godsmacked by the amazing graphics. Dreamworks has made a movie, a cartoon admittedly, but this movie couldn't be made if it weren't a cartoon. This way the movie has no borders or boundries.. and the story is exploited to the fullest.The story reminded me a bit of the Lion King, the cartoon by Disney two years earlier .. also it was about a (sort of) king-to-be which goes away to another place, only to return to the hometown sometime later with a lot of vengeance towards a lot of people. This story is straight from the bible, and what book holds more amazing and involving stories as this ancient book. And this movie is all that. Even believing people, who swear by the bible found the movie excellent.'The Prince of Egypt' is a romantic drama, which draws you in and won't let you go... I described this movie as the best movie i saw in '97, maybe it's a little overrated, but that's how i felt walking out of the movie theatre. Almost whole of hollywood does a voice (Sandra Bullock, Val Kilmer etc.) and with the helping hand of Mr. Spielberg himself, this is a masterpiece not to miss !!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To use Disney as a measuring stick with which to compare The Prince of Egypt would do a disservice to Dreamworks' achievement. Spielberg, Katzenberg, et al. may have just set the new industry standard!The Prince of Egypt is a remarkably reverent account of the Biblical story of the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt, with relatively few creative liberties taken. The animation is top-notch and often breath-taking, but even better is the story development. The plot moves along quickly and keeps the audience wide-eyed with anticipation and suspense. And the all-star cast lend their voice talents superbly without distracting from the story or the characterizations (though Ralph Fiennes' Welsh accent does seem a little out of place for Rameses).This movie is a must-see for all movie buffs and students of history, not just for families with a mini-van full of kids. The Prince of Egypt has all the makings of a new classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing I would like to point out is that the Title of this Film is "The Prince of Egypt", NOT the "Ten Commandments." or "Exodus."I say this because I hear a lot of criticism claiming that Dreamworks skips over Moses' descent from Mt. Sinai, the Golden Calf, and his 40 years in the desert etc.... I don't think Dreamworks wanted to tell that part of the story with this movie. I consider the heart of the movie to be about the love between Moses and Ramses. I have also read criticism that the film centers more on their relationship than it does on that of Moses and Aaron, his real brother. If you ask me, there is more to tell about two brothers who spend their whole life together and end up bitter, albeit unfortunate, enemies. Aaron, while bound by blood, is unemotionally attached when they meet. I found it impossible to hate Ramses, and applaud Dreamworks for making him a person, not a stereotype.That said... I loved this movie. I will be VERY disappointed if it does not do well at the box office. Dreamworks is taking a big risk with this movie, which will hopefully set the precedent for every animation to follow. Disney beware! Or take notes.One of the previous comments states that Dreamworks takes no risks in "Prince"... I can't believe someone thinks that... With all the crap that Disney has thrown at us lately, who can not be impressed with what Katzenberg has done? I can cite many examples, but one will do. Disney would have NEVER attempted the scene where Ramses son dies, and the audience sees his lifeless arm fall through the open door... let alone the next scene where Ramses drops the cloth over the boy. The sight of a very young corpse (and it is painfully obvious that there IS a corpse under the cloth) is very effective. Ok, I'll mention another, but only because this second one is so very obvious. What about the Risk of making an animated film about one of the most important stories in the Bible, knowing all the while that you could offend scores of people's religious faith?I would also like to say that the animation impressed me more than either of the "insect features" that came out shortly before this movie. True, they are completely different styles, (and very wondeful) but nothing in either of the previous blew me away quite like the parting of the red sea... or many other wonderful examples throughout "Prince".I need not review the Story, but I would like to say that the person above who calls the plot lame.. or something like that... just is not thinking. That's a lot like saying the plot of Les Miserables was lame. Sure, the movie COULD have been lame, but the plot has already proven itself to be a classic. As it is, I don't think the movie was bad. In fact, I've never been this excited about animation before in my life... This coming from an animation major in college. I don't think I can say enough in praise of Dreamworks efforts, so I'll let it go at that.</fullReview>

My favorite part was when Moses saw the burning bush, and when he parted the Red Sea. It was all drawn so well, that you could automatically lose yourself in the movie, and not want it to end.

Most movies now portray a lot of negative goals like selling drugs is cool, or being in a gang is cool. This movie would be enjoyed by every one from 3 years old to 93 years old. I hope the continue making more positive movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A feat, truly. I'm not a religious person, by nature, but the story of Moses is truly NOT a religious story. It's a tale of humanity and identity; the fact it's one of the bases for world religion is secondary. The telling of the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt, through animation, makes the story accessible to all ages. Brilliant animation, a talented voice cast, and a well-written adaptation of the scriptures make it a genuinely profound movie. I make a point to watch it if it's on, for the animation, the music, even the story...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classic tale of Moses freeing the Hebrew slaves in Egypt was one of favorite Bible stories when I was a kid - and still is. The story had adapted in many films, including the well-known 1956 film The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston. Now, DreamWorks with stunning art, animation and music by Hans Zimmer, bought the story to a new level.Everything about this movie is so beautiful - the animation and the music. And I love the films main girls, Miriam and Tzipporah; I wish DreamWorks would make more 2D films with the same scope as this film. So I love both beautifully animated film and The Ten Commandments, as to which film version of the Exodus I like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Prince of Egypt at the cinema. "OK", I thought, "it's a well-made cartoon. Better than the average Christian movie, but not worth recommending to anyone".And then I bought the soundtrack CD, and it's one of my top five favourite musicals of all time, a powerful story told in music that ranges from heart-wrenching to inspiring, right up there with Les Miserables and the rest. Now whenever I watch the film, I imagine I'm watching a musical being performed, and from that point of view, the cartoons work just fine ... for what else are actors in musicals but two-dimensional foils for the music? (Well, maybe the fat lady who sings isn't exactly 2-D :-) ).A couple of points to note: it's not an evangelical Christian movie, it just retells the Old Testament story that stars Moses, Pharoah, and God, with a few embellishments such as a chariot race. In fact, the DVD points out that the filmmakers consulted with Christians, Jews and Muslims to make sure the script fitted all traditions. And if you do buy the CD, make sure you get the Prince of Egypt Soundtrack, not the Prince of Egypt Inspirational.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. I'll admit that this movie won't appeal to everybody. It's not exactly a great movie to show to young kids, and it is slightly about religion. The attempts at humor in this movie were rather hokey, and some of the songs were kinda bad. It's also too musical. The computer images were overdone, and there was a tad too much Hollywood in it. But once you push all that and the voice acting aside, this is an awesome movie. Some of the scenes are breathtaking and awe inspiring. Other scenes will move you. Still other scenes will invoke sheer terror. Despite what many people say, watch this movie for yourself if you haven't already. Odds are good you will like this. It may not be perfect, but it is still awesome.</fullReview>

If you happen to already know the story, you might find a few factual errors, even though you have to look very closely to see them. And maybe the vocal talent was a little to hyped. Who cares if Val Kilmer is in this? It's JUST HIS VOICE. But overall even if you aren't christain/jewish, it's still an enjoyable story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Songs were wonderfully inspiring. They contributed to the flavour of the movie instead of being distracting. They continued to tell the story instead of being used strictly for entertainment purposes. No hokey happy 'Disney' songs which would have completely ruined the atmosphere.Yaayy! It got the PG rating it needed! Parents need to be aware that their children will have questions, that this is NOT a happy-go-lucky Disney cartoon. It is a though provoking, question raising Dreamworks animation that was wonderfully done. Obviously not a 100% accurate retelling of the story in Exodus, but it's a feature film, not a bible study class. :-) Although there are some pretty good study guides for those that want to use it as such.So.. Please DO let your children see it, but give them a little background first. Tell them the basic story behind it. And ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not fault this movie whatsoever, and I am shocked at the low rating. The animation is jaw-dropping, especially in The Plagues scene, which is still for me visually and musically one of the most haunting and evocative scenes in an animated film, and the part with the Red Sea splitting. The songs and music(by Hans Zimmer) are phenomenal. "When You Believe" is a standout, as is the title song. People complained about the story. There is nothing wrong with the story at all, other that it is complicated, but it is a biblical story after all. The voice talents are superlative, here we have Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Steve Martin and Martin Short voicing fairly complex and beautifully-drawn characters flawlessly. I tend to worry about A Listers in animated films, but this, people, is a truly talented voice cast, who are truly excellent when they are given a good script, which was exactly what they got. All in all, a superb animated film, which isn't to be missed. 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only decided to comment today after rewatching it today and reading the comments on rottentomatoes. Obviously, i am unable to say anything there. And the rating here isn't as high as it should be either...Many comments stated that the movie "took itself too seriously" and was probably "too boring for children". I watched this movie 10 years ago when i was 7. And it was not boring to me even then.First off, the soundtrack moved me nearly to tears, though i was a child who did not easily. The lyrics and the melodies touched me so much. Perhaps there was not much humour, but the hopeful melodies roused me from my seat. The scriptwriters were careful not to write the speeches of the people as too melodramatic and so inserted important facts such as the plagues in the lyrics of songs and through swift scenes without dialogue.The amazing animation should also be commended. The scenery is beautiful and realistic.Overall, my favourite part is the soundtrack of the movie. The compositions strike a nerve and inspire faith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably one of the best Biblical films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, or at least most recognizably, there was The Ten Commandments. The one problem with that film? Although Biblically accurate, it seems to follow too closely to the myth of the Exodus. This leads people to forget that these aren't just historical figures; these were real people with emotions and internal strife. In that, it fails as a story. But where The Ten Commandments fails, The Prince of Egypt succeeds. Prince of Egypt, while on the surface seems little more than another Disney rip-off to those who haven't seen it, is actually much more mature than its look gives. The first, and most important, difference between this film and Heston's film: the role of God and religion. In Ten Commandments, Moses is a harder man, more religiously devout; thus, the film emphasizes the struggle of Moses, the religious figure. Prince of Egypt, however, gives God little more than a bit role. Although still important to the story, He-Who-Is-I-Am is more detached from the rest of the plot than in previous renditions. The reason? Prince of Egypt takes a different turn than the classical view of "Moses as The Great Prophet," and looks more at "Moses as The Man."Throughout his whole ordeal, Moses is unsure of himself, even at times loathing of himself for the pain he's caused to both the Hebrews and to the Egyptians. He's, at first, a goof-off, never taking anything, or anyone save for his father, seriously. Later, he's plagued with self-doubt and remorse for what he's done to his Jewish brethren. Even his quest has very little religious undertones - one can see that mostly he does as Jehovah commands in order to reconcile for his past. And through it all, he is tormented that he has to fight his beloved brother, and best friend, in order to set their world right. This story, while perhaps not as religiously powerful as its Heston predecessor, is without a doubt, its spiritual superior. It reminds us that these were real people, with real emotions, dreams, and vices; in doing so, it leaves us with perhaps more respect and understanding of them than any sermon or preachy, Biblically-correct film ever could. A definite must-see for everyone of all ages, especially together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Applause to Dreamworks for this beautiful tribute to Exodus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is probably no greater literary classic than the Bible, and as such it is an obvious choice for Hollywood. But why then are there so few attempts to bring the stories we grew up on to the Big Screen? A very simple reason. In filming a Bible story, producers tread a very thin line. They know they have to make the story interesting, the graphics new and innovative or the movie will flop. But they cannot tamper too much with the original for fear of upsetting those who hold the story dear to their hearts. Unbelievably, Hollywood has finally managed to tread that thin line in 'The Prince of Egypt'. At the very beginning of the movie, a beautiful worded statement appears on the screen, and as I cannot possibly say it better, I will reproduce it here. "The motion picture you are about to see is an adaptation of the Exodus story. While artistic and historical license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. The biblical story of Moses can be found in the book of Exodus." Now that was just a classy thing to do. Yes, they did tamper with the story ever so slightly, but they never did anything to mess up the main storyline. They took some liberties with the character of Zipporah, Miriam, etc., but they never messed with the core elements of the story. Some of their changes are debatable, but not to the point of destroying the main point of the story. As a strong Christian, even I found nothing whatsoever to complain about in their telling of it.Technically, the film is a triumph of computerized animation. The chariot race scene is revolutionary in that the "camera" is able to move around within a moving frame. It is one of the many subtle ways that this animated movie hardly seems animated at all. The parting of the Red Sea was enough to take my breath away, and the Plagues of Egypt sequence was also very, very good.There was obviously a lot of research that went into the making of 'The Prince of Egypt'. Many of the monuments, frescoes, pieces of furniture, statues, etc. are genuine and can be found in the real life Egypt. Somebody did a lot of studying on Hieroglyphics and Egyptian paintings, as several specific scenes in the movie can attest.I'd also like to say a few things about the meshing of music with the story. In general, when somebody starts to sing a song, the action stops. Not so in 'The Prince of Egypt'. Indeed, almost the opposite usually occurs. Time compresses within the song, with the action happening at almost double the speed of non-song time. For example, one song covers a span of approximately 40 years, from the time Moses first arrives in Midian to his burning bush experience. In this way, the guys at Dreamworks got the nuts and bolts of the story compressed down in order to give themselves more time to develop characters and other things necessary to make a good movie. I was very impressed at the subtlety of this approach. And the songs themselves are very well done. The soundtrack is a great mix of reverence, ethnic flavor and adventure. Various themes associated with certain events and people wind their way through the music in a better-than-Wagnerian fashion. Moses' mother's lullaby is especially poignant - bravo to the composer. It actually made me cry.The entire movie is a masterpiece. I'm so glad it made money and did so well. I hope that its great success will allow the people at Dreamworks to make another Biblically based movie, hopefully as good as its predecessor. 'The Prince of Egypt' is not only a great story, it has the advantage of being "true". The tone is very religious, while not being preachy. The burning bush scene is absolutely beautiful. Watch the movie just for that, and enjoy the rest of it as well. The Death of the Firstborn is very dramatic, but not creepy like in 'The Ten Commandments'. I was thoroughly impressed. But above all, the story is interesting, fast-paced and engrossing. The characters are real and their problems are very relatable. There are marvelous moments of comedic relief and moments of terrible mental anguish. This is no dry story from some dusty old book. This is a living, breathing, story. 'The Prince of Egypt' has become one of my very favorite movies and one of the few "cartoons" that continues to be frequently reached for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamworks deserves a standing ovation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I definitely did get more than I bargained for with Prince of Egypt. Very elaborately thought, this movie is a must, I say, for every kid who has ever heard of Moses and the Red Sea, and for everyone who wants to see a state-of-the-art animation film. Two scenes especially, cause gooseflesh: the slaughter of the firstborn and the opening of the Red Sea. With the Ten Commandments as the only movie before to depict these, it was eccentric to see an animation cause such emotions. One more thing worth mentioning; how can one make such a beautiful dream sequence? How can one reflect inner conflict so successfully?Some say that Steven Spielberg payed tribute to his Jewish heritage with this animation. Well, they may not be wrong. But perhaps he was entrapped at the paradox between the Bible's depiction of Moses, the prophet, and his feelings probably as a child towards Moses, the Prince of Egypt, a human being with feelings and emotions. He is not to blame. Who would have thought before that the Pharaoh with whom Moses fought was the very guy who was Moses' step brother?All in all, this film inevitably makes the viewer go home, grab the Bible and go over Exodus again. A standing ovation for Dreamworks, and pathetic remarks for Disney, for falling way behind their biggest rival.Lastly, for those who have doubts about Hebrews working as slaves in Egypt, well, both the Bible and Quran say so, "if you believe".Oh, and Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are terrible performers with their song while Ofra Haza just beats them by herself. The difference is apparent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing The Prince of Egypt last weekend, and I was astonished. I must say that this is the greatest animated movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies period. I say this not only because of its artistic value, but also because of the impact it makes. The Prince of Egypt is not a child's silly cartoon; it is the exact opposite. The Prince of Egypt is a tale of hope, faith, and dread. The film gets very depressing at times. Dreamworks has made a movie that will surprise everybody and crush all animation cliches. Now let's talk about the movie itself.The Prince of Egypt will hook you from the first minute. The title will appear on the screen in complete silence except for the sound of the wind blowing. Then the clouds slowly move away to reveal the horror beneath. Slaves. Thousands of slaves, working on an Egyptian monument. It then shows troops running through the town and stealing babies from their mothers. The pharaoh Seti has ordered that all Hebrew first borns be executed. A mother manages to slip by the troops unnoticed and places her youngest son in a basket. She sets the basket on the river and it takes the baby to the palace of the pharaoh. The pharaoh's wife finds the baby and names him Moses. This movie shows the life of Moses. That is all I'll reveal.The Prince of Egypt is very thematic. It is intense at times and I don't recommend it to children under 7. I can't explain this movie without telling you about it, so I'll say this. Go see the Prince of Egypt, or you will be missing out on one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the years, I've watched many animated films, from Shrek, to The Lion King, to Mulan II. I've seen some really great stories, and some really terrible ones. And I can say with little hesitation that this film is my favorite. The story is well-told. The pacing is good, taking time to build the characters as relatable (if often flawed) people, but not slowing down the story. The plot is a lot darker and sadder than typical animated fare, with a bit more violence than most of us are used to seeing in animation. This isn't a bad thing by any means--it gives the story a bit more impact than it would otherwise have.The visual appearance of The Prince of Egypt is gorgeous. The characters are emotional and believable, and the landscape is huge and impressive. I won't tell you any specifics in case you don't know the story of Moses and don't want spoilers, but suffice to say that it all looks incredible, especially the miracles.But what really pulls it all together is the soundtrack. Without it, the film would still be good. With it, the film is outstanding. The songs fit perfectly, whether they're about desperation, or regret, or hope. They sound as huge and majestic as the animation looks, or maybe even outshine the animation. Whether you are Christian or not, you can appreciate this masterpiece. It's a Bible story, sure, but Dreamworks made a great effort to adapt it in a way that respected the original, while still appealing to those of other beliefs as well. They succeeded. The Prince of Egypt is an excellently told, powerful story that anyone can love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most heartwarming animated biblical masterpiece since the landmark of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Amblimation got shut down in 1997 due to the lukewarm reception of Balto, a new animation company was made and was joined by the great Steven Spielberg along with Jeffrey Katzenberg (who quited his job for the Disney company after the release of The Lion King) known as Dreamworks Animation. After making their very first CGI animated film, "Antz", they released their very first traditional animated feature, "The Prince of Egypt" before making recent franchises such as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon.Almost based on the Ten Commandments, it takes place in Egypt, eons of years ago where Pharaoh Seti commands all male Hebrew babies to be drowned. A desperate mother places her son in a basket and lets the Hebrew god guide it along its way on the river. The basket is found by the Queen, and Moses is brought up as a brother to the heir of the throne, Ramses. Years later, the brothers, who grew up happily and wealthy, are split by Moses' recognition of his true heritage and the suppressing system his brother is about to inherit, willing to carry it on. Fleeing from the city in despair, Moses finds himself being called by God. He is given the task of being the messenger in order to free the Hebrews and to lead them into a country where milk and honey flow.While Disney films only focused on fairy tales, myths and legends, this is the first non-Disney animated feature to take place in Egypt while telling a religious story about Moses, but not only that. It's Dreamworks Animation's astounding achievement since this is their first debut in the animation genre.The story is heartwarming that mixes drama, love, and faith so perfectly. It's almost based on the Ten Commandments, but compared to the 1956 epic, it doesn't have to be. While Disney's films have darker tones, this movie has the same along with mature tones as well. The animation, like all of Disney's films, is an example of pure beauty with astounding visuals including the look of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, the river of blood, a whale in the Red Sea, and the Burning Bush (even the character animation is pretty good).The voice acting is excellent. It has a killer cast including Val Kilmer, Michelle Pfieffer, Ralph Fiennes, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Steve Martin, and Martin Short. Their performances are great and portrayed the characters beautifully. The music from Hans Zimmer is beautiful and the songs written by Stephen Schwartz are compelling (which means very convincing) in a Disney-esque style. "When You Believe", "Deliver Us", "Look Through Heaven's Eyes", "Playing With The Big Boys Now", and the rest were great. Even the songs in both the ending credits and music videos were pretty damn good.The Prince of Egypt became the start of Dreamworks Animation's attempt to make three more traditional animated films (1998-2003) before making successful computer animated flicks (1998-present) and will always be recommended to the animation industry as a masterpiece since the landmark of Disney. A perfect thumbs up from me.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid and effective animation whether you believe or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moses grows up as the son of Pharaoh and brother of Rameses but it is not until he accidentally kills an Egyptian for beating a Hebrew slave that he discovers his true identity ? that of a Hebrew orphan taken in by the Royals as a baby. When God speaks to him his destiny is decided ? to lead the chosen people out of captivity and into the promised land. However, returning to his brother Rameses with this request provokes only anger and stubbornness, leading to a series of plagues from God to try and change the mind of the Egyptian ruler.A strange but worthy mix this film. On one hand we have the pressure of genre conventions requiring a modern jokey air that sees exciting chariot races and amusing minor characters but then on the other we have a story that deals with the death of children and plagues punishing civilians over the hard heart of their ruler. Wisely perhaps the film errs on the side of caution and delivers the story mostly straight, with only a few adventure or comic asides. To some children this will weaken the film as it is less "fun" however for my money it makes it a more reliable and sturdy film. I'm not necessarily saying this from a biblical point of view but on that regard it does provide an accessible telling of a key story and I know that several local churches block booked cinemas at time of release to show their congregation.Outside of this area though the film still works as an engaging film even if you do not believe that it is a true story. Others have advised that this film is not suitable for children but I think this depends on your view. To me this is perfectly pitched. It has dark elements and it cannot get away from that, but it delivers these in such a way that is menacing without overdoing the scares ? I do believe that children need to have darkness in their films and should not be unreasonably shielded from it. The animation has of course been surpassed by technology but it is the quality that stands up, with depth and atmosphere being delivered rather than just technical value.The voice cast work reasonably well even if they do come over as being stars rather than really performing. Kilmer is perhaps a bit too overawed by his characters but he is still effective enough. Fiennes is better as he has more to work with and less fear of upsetting people I guess. Pfeffier, Bullock, Mirren, Stewart, Goldblum and Glover are a bit more cast for their voices but they work well, with each providing weight just by their voice work. Not too sure about Martin and Short ? the film doesn't really make the most of them for obvious reasons and they come across as being left out in the open by the material.Overall then a professional and engaging animated film. OK it is a bit dark for some young children but I think it is not unnecessarily so. Audiences will bring their own agenda to the film and will take away what they will but in my view it is strong enough to work as a accessible telling for those with faith and a solid story for those without.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The animation of this film is spectacular. Some of the scenes will make you hold your breath in awe. However, the story is flawed for the first half of the story. It almost seems like a musical, with so many (useless) songs cluttering the story. But the second half is a combination of music and animation brilliance. Two scenes ranks among the highest in animation. The first is the sequence of plagues. It starts with the frogs leaping out of the water. The songs over that scene are incredible. The other sequence is the parting of the Red Sea. Nothing in the film will prepare for the majestic split, as water shoots upwards. The vocal performances are great, with Ralph Fiennes coming out on top. He seems to be at his best in bad characters (remember Schindler's List?).</fullReview>

Prince of Egypt is not one of these animated features.There was one tiny thing that kept throwing me out of the movie. I kept thinking, 'Why are Rameses and Seti British?'. I love both Patrick Stewart and Ralph Fiennes, but it seemed odd. Mostly it was Seti that I was thrown out by. Ralph Fiennes' accent wasn't as strong as Stewarts.Some of the music was really annoying and I was worried during the first 10 minutes that it might be nothing but music. I thought the animation was well done. I was most impressed by a scene near the end where Rameses was shouting 'Moses'.</fullReview>

From an artistic and a design standpoint, each shot is wondrous. The dimension, light and space that's been created here is richer and more convincing than any animated piece I can remember. The character design is impressive as well...idealized Egyptian features strongly echoing the human faces one sees on hieroglyphs, yet at the same time surprisingly versatile and encompassing of a full range of emotion, despite their spare lines and sharp angles.Awesome! I don't know how this film fared in comparison to The Iron Giant, another great but woefully underviewed animated feature that EVERYONE should see, but they are both absolute masterpieces. Particularly spellbinding scenes in Prince of Egypt are the parting of the Red Sea, and a segment depicting the dream of a young Moses, which has to be one of the most creatively designed sequences I've enjoyed in ANY film, animated or otherwise. See it (and the Iron Giant while you're at it)! Go! Go! Go!</fullReview>

From the water of the Red Sea, which looks so real, you'd want to touch it, to the incredible mastery of Moses' dream sequence composed of Egyptian drawn figures... you'll only know what this movie can show you if you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final refuge of the American musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got in to see Prince of Egypt this weekend, not expecting much based on some of the negative comments here. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did I find the animation several notches above par and all the big "production numbers" (parting of the Red Sea, plagues, etc.) as good as I'd heard, but I was also extremely impressed with Moses' hieroglyphic-inspired dream sequence.Several people have mentioned that the animated film is the last refuge of the American movie musical, and this movie shows why, on the whole, it will continue to be a safe refuge. The music was inspired and often touching, and the person who decided to cast Ofra Haza as Yocheved (Moses' mother) gets a gold star from me.Perhaps best of all is one of the most positive portrayals of God I've seen come out of Hollywood in the last 50 years, neither overdone nor effete. Although some license was taken with the Biblical story, it was on the whole accurate to the spirit of Exodus and would be an excellent way of injecting life into older children's understanding of the scriptures. I'm so pleased an American company has finally begun to understand that animation isn't just a tool for pumping out poor-quality kiddie movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful and uplifting story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most impressive quality this film has other than the fact that it was based upon a true story was its soundtrack. There are two songs that came from the soundtrack that I fell in love with after listening to it for the first time. 'When You Believe' and 'I'll Be There For You' came from musicians in two different music genres. The former was performed by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey who are in the Pop/Rock genre. Jessica Andrews is a country artist who performed the latter of the two. These songs are very touching ballads about the human spirit. Jessica Andrews is only a teen herself and a newcomer to the world of country music; she will be one huge star. This true story about Moses really taught me a history lesson that I won't soon forget. The fact that it tells the story through animationis so much easier to grasp. I've always enjoyed how directors of animated features use songs to tell portions of the story. I'm I went to see The Prince Of Egypt because I probably would have remained completely ignorant to the story of Moses. After I saw this film, I have a new appreciation for history brought to life through the magic of movie making. I got interested in seeing such movies as Schindler's List, Patton, JFK, and Nixon because of seeing The Prince Of Egypt. I highly recommend this film to everybody since there is something in this film for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty and Emotion, Well Done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt, explored so many new artistic avenues, it would be impossible to list them.But, what impressed me the most, was the extensive production design and character development of the film. Great movement in the animation. The opening sequence of the basket on the river is a perfect example.The story doesn't drag anywhere!! Very well written, great dialog. There is humor, sensitivity, drama, a touch of magic and a great deal of majesty.The story has morals we can all share &amp; follow, as well as heart wrenching emotions. Makes you think about your own family and faith. Made me reconsider some other world issues of present dayand how history repeats itself.Seeing how these two brothers related to one another and then seeing them being torn apart, lost to each other was extreme, but real. The scene of Ramses at the end when he cries out for Moses, was one of pure despair, the look on Moses face, when he heard his voice is the evidence of how much they both lost.Moses may have freed his people, but he lost his childhood friend and brother. Consider Rameses. They were both tied to fate. Great Sacrifices.Between them there was an obvious element of respect, love and loyalty.Something that got lost in the Ten Commandments. With this I wanted to re - read the Bible, something I haven't done for a long time.What DreamWorks did was invite us to consider how far would we go, to protect something we hold sacred?The imagery, story and music (all the various versions) are exceptional. These talented Animators showed us how to push the envelope.It will be interesting to see how DreamWorks tops this Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Musical Experience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read several of the comments about this movie and as usual see both sides. I loved the movie and it was actually much better than I thought it would be. The thing that impressed me the most was the music. I love it's mournful sound and good themes. However, the "Playing With the Big Boys" song was not included with the rest of the music though. That song and scene did not work for me, but all of the music besides that was incredible! I also did not like the chariot scene though, finding it very unbelievable, overdone, and unnecessary. I am a great lover of score and music from movies, and this one is my present favorite. I was proud that Dreamworks was not afraid to keep the religious nature of this story without stepping over the line and push any particular religion. It was an uplifting movie and definitely not a children's movie. As also said, this movie should not be compared to the great epic The Ten Commandments. It is focused on Moses &amp; Ramses' relationships as brothers and not on the children of Israels' journey to the promised land. The special effects were wonderful as well and the movie really impressed me. I feel like the best scene in the movie though is the opening with the song "Deliver Us." It was a great opening and really got you into the movie. If you haven't seen this movie, GO SEE IT!!</fullReview>

Ordinary human beings, just like us... who just happened to have lived extra-ordinary lives. The idea that they hurt and have situation and personality conflicts just like everyone else's makes them more real! ^_^. Seeing a fresh perspective on an age-old story definitely rekindled my interest in the scriptures.Being an animation buff as well, I am EXTREMELY happy to see that the animation story telling has been brought up one notch higher. I think the music, specially "Deliver Us" and "The Plagues" were sensational... though I was a bit disappointed that the movie turned out to be another musical. Well... at least we don't have any talking animals! ^_^.Don't care what other people say! "The Prince of Egypt" gets a perfect 10 from me! And I will definitely go see it over and over again! ^_^.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "Important" Cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The criticisms people have leveled at this movie perplex me. "Too religious", "too Jewish," "not enough of a family movie." Many of these criticisms take issue with God Himself rather than the quality and content of this film. But then, that's probably a good thing, because it means the film has served one part of its purpose - to draw attention to the nature of God, and His interaction with man."The Prince of Egypt" presents the story of Moses, taking some artistic/dramatic licenses but remaining true to the spirit of the original story, as stated in the beginning of the film. This is a movie which was made with integrity, artistry, and goes farther than many other attempts to present Biblical record have done.Expecting such a film to gloss over the "religious stuff" is akin to watching opera and wondering why everyone is singing. It misses the point.As has been mentioned by many here, the animation is superb, utilizing a caricature-style evocative of Egyptian hieroglyph (especially in a brilliant dream sequence). If you are a fan of musicals, the songs in this movie easily equal the fare found in most Disney movies, but, in my opinion, surpass them with far more meaningful and significant lyrical content.This film stands with few others (Princess Mononoke/Mononoke Hime, for example) as a shining example of what can be done with the medium of animation. The perception of animation as "only for kids" is a uniquely American conclusion, and movies such as this defy this artificial limitation with class, style, and depth.DreamWorks should be applauded for tackling this work and doing so with such integrity. It could be argued that the qualities which have made Disney animated movies such stereotypes (a musical with a coming-of-age story and talking animal comedy relief sidekicks) pop up in some degree here - the closest we come to that style of comic relief are in the Egyptian magicians, or in the opening chariot sequence - but nonetheless, "The Prince of Egypt" doesn't compromise in presenting the not-so-pleasant yet important aspects of Moses' story - the Plagues and their aftermath, in specific. Again, this is done with sobriety and drama, neither exploitatively and overly graphic, nor antiseptically "kid-safe." This is not to say your children shouldn't watch it, but rather pointing out that these things are presented for a reason, and this movie was not designed for "substitute babysitting". It's something you should be there to watch *with* them.I was particularly impressed with the interaction between Moses and God at the Burning Bush - this scene managed to capture the frightening glory and power of God as well as His fatherly love and desire for us to grow and mature. Far from being a contradiction, this scene establishes that God wants us to know His true nature, complex and constant, and understand our place in the Universe, regardless of whether it's comfortable or convenient for us. Moses's fear, awe, wonder, and excitement are completely understandable when presented to us in this sequence.My only disappointment with the story was the drastic reduction in Tzipporah's role in the second half of the movie, but, again, that wasn't really the point of the movie, and I'm pleased with the role she did play, as an active partner in their marriage, accompanying Moses on his trek rather than remaining behind and/or being a passive or reclusive subordinate (an unfortunate portrayal of marriage I've come to expect from most Hollywood productions).Musically, I find the original musical numbers superior to the pop renditions featured on the CD Soundtrack, especially "When You Believe" (which actually has Michelle Pfeiffer singing Tzipporah's part). Also outstanding pieces are "Through Heaven's Eyes" (for its lyrics, if nothing else) and "The Plagues" (which is one of the two sequences most evocative of Broadway productions). Also, I credit this movie with introducing me to the extraordinary talent of Ofra Haza, whom I wish had more songs on the CD.This can be considered a family movie, in the sense that your children will have questions during and after their viewing. As has been mentioned, be prepared to discuss it! Some associate the term "family films" with bland, uninspiring, nonconfrontational fare, devoid of any kind of meaning. This movie does bring a family closer together, by inspiring interaction, and a discussion of values and beliefs. For this reason as well, I feel this is a worthwhile movie. I'd say it was "important", but I don't want to sound pretentious. ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest animated movie EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that every year and a half or so, Disney brings to the big screen an animated feature film that although is very good, leaves adult audiences trembling in fear that they would have to take their kids to it again and again and again while not being entertained themselves. Not me personally, as I have come to look forward to Disney's latest releases with baited breath. Usually satisfied, (i.e. "Tarzan", "Alladin", and "The Lion King") but sometimes disappointed. (i.e. "Pocahontis"). But DreamWorks may have finally begun a long journey to maybe knock Disney off as "King of the Animated Hill". The Prince of Egypt is just shy historical accuracy and animated perfection. I say this because, well, never mind. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. But as far as the overall product, it was a pure masterpiece. I was particularly impressed by the fact that it was done by an all star cast, yet only one was very recognizable. (Patrick Stewart as Moses' father. But then again, Stewart is steadily rising up to the Sean Connery level of 'most distinguishable voices in a crowd' category.) But overall, the story is about 95% biblically accurate. And if you're like me, you need to give a LITTLE creative license to any historical movie, although the TV version of "Noah's Ark" was just this side of blasphemous.Prince Of Egypt- ********** (10 stars out of ten)</fullReview>

"deliver us," the seven-minute piece that plays in the beginning of the movie, is a phenomenal piece to open the movie with. its theme leads us through the entire movie until the ending theme, which is a spectacular piece.- the animation. using the latest high-tech animation techniques, we see many camera shifts and special effects. one of the greatest special effects is the splitting of the red sea towards the end of the movies. additionally, there is a very cool scene that we see that involves animated hieroglyphics. excellent uses.- the actors. this movie has just about the greatest cast. the main voice - moses - is played by the very talented val kilmer, who has an excellent song titled "the plagues" with ralph fiennes, who plays ramses. sandra bullock and michelle pfeiffer also give us their voice-overs, among many other people.in my opinion, this is an excellent movie. don't overlook this movie the next time you go to blockbuster or somewhere to rent a movie. it's well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful and Moving Depiction of Moses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapting the story of Moses seemed a risky venture for Dreamworks to use as its foray into the lucrative family animation market dominated by the Mouseketeers. Dealing with a religious icon, especially in a film intended for children, is bound to offend lots of people. (By contrast, 20th Century Fox made a much safer bet by doing "Anastasia.")The resulting work, however, is beautiful. It treats its subject with the due respect and resists the urge to sugarcoat the politically incorrect elements of the biblical story. "The Prince of Egypt" does make changes in the story for dramatic purposes, as is stated in a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie. (The disclaimer gently advises interested viewers to seek the biblical Moses in the Bible.)The movie focuses on Moses transformation from a Prince of Egypt to the leader of an enslaved people. Moses' mother sets the infant Moses adrift in a basket to save him from the slaughter of Hebrew children ordered by the Egyptian pharaoh Seti (Patrick Stewart). Ironically the foundling is adopted by the pharaoh's wife (Helen Mirren) and raised as a prince. Moses is close to his older brother Rameses (Ralph Fiennes), the heir to the throne. They are a rumbunctious pair constantly in mischief; when we meet them they are engaged in a chariot race that floods a temple with sand. Prince Moses (Val Kilmer) is spoiled but basically a decent guy. When he is given a slave woman (Michelle Pfeiffer), Moses allows her to escape. He also follows her and runs into his real siblings (Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum), who reveal the truth about his heritage and the horrible crimes of his adoptive father. The revelation propels Moses into a moral crisis that will lead him to murder and a flight into the desert. There he receives a message from God and returns to Egypt to free the slaves."The Prince of Egypt" has many elements of the Disney model. It's a coming of age story about a misfit having an identity crisis. It teaches the power of positive thinking (specifically, that your life may seem meaningless to you but it has great significance from a divine perspective). It is a musical and includes comic relief. Those last elements seemed forced to me. I've never been a fan of musicals (animated or otherwise) and could have done without characters bursting into song. And, while some comic elements (like the chariot race) are important for character development, others (like the high priests voiced by Steve Martin and Martin Short) seem inappropriate.Regardless of those flaws, though, "The Prince of Egypt" is a magnificent spectacle. Egypt's palace is gigantic sprawl of monuments. The miracles of God, particularly the parting of the Red Sea, are beautifully done.A word of caution: some of the actions of God may raise troubling questions for children, especially His slaughter of the first-born sons of Egypt. But I think "The Prince of Egypt" deserves applause for having the guts to raise those questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best I've seen! The story line is great. The minor changes that some people are irritated about, made it shorter and more understandable for kids. The animation is spectacular. I especially liked the plagues, bush and red sea. None of Disneys movies come close to the realistic graphics and movement of Prince of Egypt. For those of you who think the characters aren't drawn well, take a look at Disney's geometrical barbie doll like figures in Pocahontas. Humans are very hard to animate and get the movement right on. Dreamworks did the best I've seen. Other movies such as Beauty and the Beast, Anastasia and Aladdin used 3d in a forced way; just throwing in a shot here and there to make you go "wow". This movie used 3d so much that it seems like your really there. The parting of the Red Sea is something you won't forget. This movie gives God power that no live action movie could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Need for a Retelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Universal Picture tells the story of Moses from the Book of Exodus. There have been many adaptations of this story to the big screen, most recently Exodus of Gods and Men, but this animated picture will forever rank number one. The story is amazingly well written with flowing scenes and excellent dialogue. The voice actors on cast were superb: Val Kilmer and Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Rameses and Patrick Stewart as Seti were the standouts. Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah, Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Jeff Goldblum as Aaron, and Danny Glover as Jethro were amazing compliments to the cast. While other renditions of the story of Moses and the Exodus play heavily on the violence in the story and the plagues as a centerpiece, The Prince of Egypt focuses on the relationship between Moses and Rameses and how Moses handles the mission as bringer of God's wrath to the place he once called home. The Prince of Egypt does not shy away from slavery and crimes against the slaves that occurred. Quite admirably it depicts it in a very artistic way. The scenery is top notch and the music numbers are quite good. Many may think of this movie as one to let the kids see but for those adults who watch it they will be happy they did. After seeing film there's there's no need for a retelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest casts in movie history and a faithful adaptation from The Bible. What more could you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney had always been the driving force of animation, but in the late '90s it began to lose its way. Step forward Dreamworks with an amazing adaptation of one of The Bible's best-known episodes.Well animated and a voice cast (Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Steve Martin, Helen Mirren, Danny Glover &amp; Patrick Stewart) that even the biggest Hollywood blockbusters would struggle to get, this is a classic in every way.The story, in case you've lived your life in a cave, tells of how a prince, Moses, learns he is not of royal birth but is in fact a Hebrew slave who was chosen by God to free his people from Egyptian slave-drivers by enacting a series of ten plagues until the Pharaoh agreed to let them go. It's the first 15 chapters of the Biblical book of Exodus that acts as the source material, but some creative liberties have been taken since this is a film.To adapt a story that is central to the faiths of every single Christian and Jew that has ever lived and make it accessible but not dumbed down is brave, but it works and gives us a good film with an incredible cast and soundtrack alike that will be rightly remembered as a classic.Whether you believe the story (as I do) or not, what we have with this film is an excellently realised take on the story of a man with a special purpose. Moses was far from perfect when God found him - He was a murderer on the run - but, though he was initially unwilling to do what was asked of him, he managed to be brave and save millions of people who would establish a nation that still has descendants to this day. Inspiring stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exodus Is Not Only Adapted, But Improved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with even the best religious films is that, if you don't adhere to the faith, there is little to be extracted. Some stories have universal value. The Prodigal Son comes to mind. But I can't get behind faith, love of God, chastity, and conservatism.Prince of Egypt dodges those stereotypes. Its still a religious movie, but it doesn't insult those who don't believe. There's more focus on the fight for freedom, and the conflict between former brothers. The interpretations of the biblical characters give them more emotion, making them more relateable and dramatic. Moses is more sensitive, even regretful that God must bring plagues upon Egypt. Ramses is more human, ambitious, traditional, with a love for his people - and apathy for the Jews. Even this slight ambiguity is enough to make me care far more than in church.Few films use animation better than this one. Its smooth, colorful, and detailed, with amazing backgrounds. There's also a level of creativity that seems to be lost in today's Dreamworks films. The scenes of the burning bush and Passover are particularly beautiful and haunting. The soundtrack is also great. Its a favorite among many animation buffs. I still listen to "Through Heaven's Eyes" and "The Plagues".I've gotten a dozen VHS tapes of Christian cartoons growing up. They don't hold a candle to The Prince of Egypt. Trust me, you don't have to be part of an Abrahamic faith to love this. Its Dreamworks's best work, and one of the best animation has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy and evocative tale that hits all the marks and deals with Moses , the Hebrew lawgiver .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spectacular cartoon adaptation about known story , it focuses Moses , the Hebrew leader , leading the Jews out of Egypt and realized in musical style . This is the wonderful story about an extraordinary man receiving a holy calling , and follows his life from birth , abandonment , slavery and trials in leading the Jews ; this is the greatest event in cartoon motion picture history . Biblical story developed in on an animated great scale though no such as the classic Cecil B. De Mille's version . An Egyptian prince named Moses (Val Kilmer provides a voice for both Moses and God, Charlton Heston also played both parts in classic adaptation) who is adopted and brought up in the court learns of his identity as a Hebrew and later his destiny to become the chosen deliverer of his people . This vivid storytelling although fairly standard follows appropriately the Moses'life , the son of a Jew slave, from birth and abandonment on a basket over river Nile , as when the Pharaoh Seti (voice by Patrick Stewart) ordered the killing of all newborn babies , being pick up by Egyptian princesses and he's raised in the royal court , becoming into Prince of Egypt . One time grown-up Moses embarks a supernatural mission , as the Egyptian Prince , learns of his true heritage as a Hebrew and his divine mission as the deliverer of his people , getting the freedom for Hebrews . When his Hebrew origin is revealed , Moses is cast out of Egypt , and makes his way across the desert . Then , Moses retires out of Egypt where meets Jethro (voice of Danny Glover) , marring him with his daughter Sefora . The stoic Moses along with his brothers Aaron (Jeff Goldblum) and Miriam (voice of Sandra Bullock) confront Pharaoh Rameses (voice of Ralph Fiennes who was considered for the title role of The Saint, which went to Val Kilmer) . Moses asks Pharaoh to liberate them but he refuses, causing the Egyptian plagues : invasion of locusts , fogs , epidemic , water become in blood and death of the first-born . As Moses instructs the slaves to put lamb's blood above their doors for protection and in the night , the angel of death comes , and passes over the protected doors . In the homes of the Egyptians where there is no protective sign , the angel kills off the first born children of Egypt, including Rameses' son . Moses goes to his brother after this , and is given permission to take the Jews . Moses takes charge of God's people and wrests them from Pharaoh's punishing grip . Moses like liberator of the Jewish leads his people throughout desert battling enemies and with holy intervention (when Moses and God are conversing, Val Kilmer is actually talking to himself) . Finally , Moses climbs the Mount of Sinai bringing the holy tablets , meanwhile Jewish people worshipping the golden calf .This is a monumental animated version of the Biblic book of Exodus  with drawings carried out in utter conviction and impressive special effects , including the computer generator parting of the Red Sea ; in spite of making by means of usual C.G. ,the effects still look great . The production team conferred with roughly 600 religious experts to make the film as accurate as possible . Sadly , the movie was banned in Malaysia and Indonesia , but later released in Video CD format . Lavishly produced by Dreamworks , the Production Company created by Jeffrey Katzenberg , David Geffen and Steven Spielberg . Producer Jeffrey Katzenberg constantly pitched the idea to the Walt Disney Company while he was working there , but Michael Eisner didn't like the idea . Obviously changes were made to the story to make it work as an animated feature , in fact , there is a short list of differences between the movie and the Biblical account of the Exodus . This movie was the most expensive animated feature ever made at the time, being beaten out by Final fantasy . However , the film being necessary to see it in big screen , watching in TV it makes lost most really spectacular scenarios on the small screen . The picture is suitable for family viewing and religious people. Other adaptations told in compactly form about this biblical story are the followings : classic mute (1923) by Cecil B. DeMille with Theodore Roberts , Charles Rochefort ; the second handling and the greatest , made in a gargantuan scale by Cecil B. DeMille (1956) played by Charlton Heston , Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter , Debra Paget , John Derek , Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price . Furthermore , TV rendition (1975) by Gianfranco De Bossio with Burt Lancaster , Irene Papas and Anthony Quayle , a new take on titled In the beginning (2000) by Kevin Connor with Billy Campbell as Moses , Christopher Lee as Seti and Art Malik as Rameses . And television rendition (2006) by Robert Dornhelm with Dougray Scott , Susan Lynch , Naveen Andrews , Paul Rhys , Omar Sharif , Linus Roache among others .</fullReview>

However, in my opinion, "The Prince of Egypt" was way much better than Antz, having an incredible visual style and a memorable story, which has all the feeling of the classic religious epic films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with lots of memorable scenes and great songs. The combination of CGI and traditional animation is simply magnificent, being quite impressive even by the standards of modern animation, with lots of technological advancement. Also, the character's designs were stylish and original: Most of the animated films that were released in the nineties tried to imitate the Disney's aesthetic in order to emulate the success that this company was having in the same decade with modern classics as "The Lion King", but unlike any of those productions, this film tried to do something completely different. Even the musical numbers were quite different of the ones that appeared in Disney's movies. In many ways, this was the most risky production from DreamWorks.But all that beauty would have been meaningless if that same level of effort wasn't put in the story and the characters as well. And that's why this movie it's more effective than most of the other animated films released by DreamWorks: The characters have lots of deep and development, feeling as real human characters instead of flat caricatures. Their conflicts and emotions are believable, and the epic setting of the story serves to make all those elements into something unforgettable.Too bad that DreamWorks doesn't make this kind of movies anymore. I don't have anything against animated CGI comedies (Actually, I loved some of them, like "Kung Fu Panda") but it would be nice to see that studio producing something risky and epic as this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DreamWorks should make more films like this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this "The Prince of Egypt" a lot of times when I was a child. I first saw this movie when I was in school and I loved it. I then bought the VCD and I think that VCD was one that I ended up using regularly. After many years, I decided to watch it again. And I'll say this: The magic hasn't been lost. I still love this film. It's amazing. Seriously.I'd like to believe that this movie can be enjoyed be anyone and everyone. I do believe in God, but I am not overly religious. However I still enjoyed this movie immensely. I think that even non-Christians or atheists will still enjoy this movie. This movie may scare children. I know I got creeped out by one or two parts when I was younger. But other than that, it's fine.I love the soundtrack of this movie. All the songs (except for one) fit in with the movie itself and helps make it perfect. The songs aren't at all distracting and they don't just happen out of the blue. There's build-up and the songs just really go with the flow of the movie. The songs actually MAKE the movie what it is.After watching this movie again after many years, I think that I was able to understand it more and I also got to really appreciate the brilliance of it. The characters, for instance, were really written well. Especially Rameses. (SPOILER:) When I was younger, I hated Rameses. I thought that he was evil and deserved everything that happened to him. But now, I found that I was actually sympathizing with him. I mean, think about it. He was under a lot of pressure that was put onto him by his father. He just wanted to make his father proud by making Egypt great. Then suddenly, his brother, one that he grew up and shared many memories with, turns against him It must have been hard. I don't blame him for his actions. (/SPOILER) He was a well-rounded coin. There were two sides of him. I think more movies need to make their villains like Rameses here.This film was brilliant. I can't think of a simpler way to put it. It's really moving and is just amazing. DreamWorks should make more movies like this. This could rival many of Disney's films and actually level with Pixar's. Watch "The Prince of Egypt" now if you haven't yet.Viewed on: April 18, 2011</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great!!! Beyond great actually. It was inspiring and after watching it, it made me want to become a better person. It was incredibly moving- I even cried!!one of the few animated movies that have had the ability to actually make me cry- if not one of them, the only one! the characters have so much depth. and if you ask me, it's the characters what make a great movie not the story. But this one definitely had a great story. this is a universal story for goodness sake. Best version of the story Moses yet!!! it's fun and you learn the moral of the story too. Best animation movie ever!! way better than Disney. Disney movies brainwash kids and make it seem as if life is a freaking fun house. In the end, all that is left is a kid with crushed dreams and a broken heart. but this movie is REAL- if you get what i mean! it gives you the real answer to everything and that is faith and God. if you have those 2 things in your life, your set man. oh and this movie really made me contemplate a bunch and reflect on myself. at the end of the movie, in one way or another you become more religious and spiritual. hope this helped!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Prince of Egypt" is a great movie that my daughter also enjoys. The beautifully animated has a great story and storytelling, beautiful songs and a great voice cast. My daughter also has the soundtrack to this. This is one of the very first animated movies made for an adult mainstream audience. Still the movie has some misplaced humor and 'Disney' like characters, to make this movie appealing for children as well but really this is more a movie for adults than for children. The movie has a serious undertone and some powerful moments, with the burning bush and the splitting of the red sea as the ultimate highlights of the movie. The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza. Voices that stood out to me were Val Kilmer, Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Stewart. But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane. The character's movement and interacting is done really good and with eye for detail. The music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz are wonderful. It sounds weird, songs for a serious movie but it works extremely well for the movie and the storytelling and on top of that the songs are all from a very high level of prestige. With this movie DreamWorks shows that they are a worthy competitor for Disney. The movie and its storytelling are really powerful and impressive and help to make this movie an unforgettable watching experience. Great for all ages but mainly adults. Happy watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Adaptation of The Exodus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Prince of Egypt' is a spectacular adaptation of the Exodus. The breathtaking animation reminded me of the beautiful movies Disney used to make. It's pretty much state of the art. The story is very familiar yet wonderfully told. I remember how strongly the film was promoted during its time of release. The magnificent voice casting includes Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Martin Short, Jeff Goldblum, Helen Mirren and many more. The songs go very well with the story (I'm glad they didn't put the Mariah Carrey- Whitney Houston version of 'When You Believe' in the film because that would have just interrupted the consistency of the film). 'The Prince of Egypt' is one of Dreamworks's better animated feature. After viewing it, I had the same feeling after having watched a Disney classic. Many seem to have disapproved the amount of violence shown but why would one expect a romantic violence-free version of the Exodus? For children, it's an informative movie. Yet, one does not have to be religious in order to appreciate it because it has a universal message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful, visually stunning masterpiece - One of the greatest examples in modern animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt (1998)Top 5 - 1998 The biblical story is given a ravishing animated nature and is narrated with finesse, exquisite style and beautiful music. Extracted from Exodus, the second book of the Jewish Torah and the Christian Old Testament - the story of how Moses led the enslaved Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness to Mount Sinai (after crossing the Red Sea).The Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest animated films of the last 20 years, because it achieves what many of the classic Disney films did; it translates love, passion, story and song so beautifully through the characters and the settings. This is very much a great classic; in strange way it is reminiscent of the old Cecil B. DeMille studio epics such as 'The Ten Commandents (1956)'.Visually breathtaking, featuring the Academy Award Winning song 'When you believe' sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, The Prince of Egypt is entertaining and still manages to inform.A formidable achievement.9/10</fullReview>

First, as Amon Goeth, in "Schindler's List," and now as Ramses, the pharaoh who wouldn't let the children of Israel depart from Egypt.Gone from this production is Nefertiti as well as the Hebrew overseer Dathan. How could the story be told without these two central figures?The songs are just lovely. In this version, pharaoh is not immediately angry with his brother Moses. Also, the expulsion of Moses from Egypt is self-imposed.Nevertheless, the basic elements of the story remain and are beautifully depicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is beautifully done. Even though I'm not very religious, this movie still takes my breath away. One of Disney's greatest masterpieces, it actually sent chills down my spine to watch the legend that is Moses discover who he is and what his destiny is. I started watching this movie as I watch most movies: while on the computer, eating lunch, distracted by a million different things. As soon as the first scene opened, I forgot to continue eating. My computer went idle. All of my attention, for once, was fixated on this beautiful masterpiece that is the Prince of Egypt. The soundtrack for this movie is heart-breaking, and the bittersweet ending sent tears down my cheeks. Every scene in this movie is riveting, crafted by passionate emotion and faith. I had not seen this movie since I was a young child, and did not expect to like it: after all, I'm not particularly compelled by movies solely based on religious matters. But this movie is not about a particular religion, as I thought it would be, but solely the act of Believing in something, and in Trust, and Beauty, and Love, and most of all, in Freedom. You cannot help but love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a father of three, the content is becoming more difficult to intercept, screen, and filter what my kids watch or listen too. Even religious values in our family have to be safe-guarded considering how studios cater to scripts that focus on ratings, and not the written truth.With the release of The Prince of Egypt, the sensitivity to the story, staying in line with the biblical standard, was refreshing. Although every story written about this story has some embellishment, the focus in this movie highlighted the characters, plot points, emphasizing the human factors, and genuinely developing understanding.My first impression when the movie opened was the rich musical scores that propelled the story. Aside from the visual presentation, the songs leaped out at me, lifting my soul, reeling me into the story, and nearly giving me the sense that I was experiencing it first hand! Our family thoroughly enjoys this movie, even today, watching it often. I have the soundtrack and listen to it while trucking around the nation. I'm especially thankful for all the artist that contributed their talent to this movie. Aside from the opening titles, I'm impressed with Michelle Pfeiffer's signing talent in the song, When You Believe. The lyrics alone are written to inspire. When Michelle Pfeiffer sings this song, the message comes alive, echoing truth, emphasizing on the strife, and reveling in the human condition.There is so much to say and yet the best has been noted. The score, movie, and voice-overs is by far, the best presentation on film, in a very long time. If you haven't seen this one, make the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the Best Exodus...yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to believe that people are bashing this movie for one poor reason or another. Don't trust these reviews. It seems as though these people are doing this simply because this is a biblical story. Two words to these people, "Grow Up."I first learned of this film when the trailer came out. During the trailer I was wondering what was this film going to be about...then at the very end they showed the parting of the Red Sea (the most awe inspiring scene I have ever seen) and I knew right away I was in for a treat.I gave this film an 8 out 10 not because of the voices or because I didn't agree with the history or because I didn't like the songs...I gave it a ten because I was displeased how they changed the Exodus story. For instance: Aaron was depicted as Moses's antagonist (along with Pharoh) instead of being the "right hand man" that he was in the Bible. I was also displeased with the "burning bush" scene...I was hoping for it to be longer and I don't recall "God" ever saying the most important line, "I am what I am." Also they left out the sign were Moses makes his hand leprous (but I guess it was sort of appropriate to leave that out consdidering it would have been gross). I felt that the Ten Plagues would have been better if they were all shown in chronological order instead of being all lumped together in a single song (but to do that the movie would have been too long, oh well.) Those were my main gripes and why I gave the film an 8.The story is still true to the "spirit" of the Exodus, but it is not the Exodus.What I especially enjoyed was seeing a new twist to the story. Up until now, Rameses and Moses have been shown as enemies since they were children...but what if they were no enemies but the closest of brothers. This provided a unique chance to comtiplate exactly what did happen during Moses's early years. The Bible doesn't tell us of his childhood so we are left to speculate.I thoroughly enjoyed the music, especially the opening before we meet Moses's mother. The music flowed with the story nicely and I find nothing wrong with them...maybe they are too long but what do you expect from a musical?Animation was superb...enough said.I will reconmend this for anybody. If you have seen the Ten Commandments, don't expect to see a remake of it here. This is a totally, and I think better, telling of the Exodus story. Parents watch this with your kids, they will ask questions during and after the film so be prepared to answer them. </fullReview>

This animated story of Moses (though minutes into the movie, you almost forget it's animation!) is told in such a unique and refreshing way which adds new life to the Biblical story yet sticks with it well enough to convey the same sense of power and inspiration. The animation is impeccable and the music (after a few listens/viewings) will stick with you for days on end. The Burning Bush and parting of the Red Sea scenes alone are worth the price of the movie ticket.

		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt is mightily impressive. Although an unexpected story for Dreamworks to embark on, they do a fine job of it. The animation is astonishing and the characterisations are great. I will not add further mention of how inappropriate 'You're Playing with the Big Boys' song is. Dreamworks must now set a different path from that of Disney. To avoid the inevitable comparisons, Dreamworks should continue with the idea to produce animated motion pictures equally for the adult because there IS an audience for such a genre. Additionally, I don't know why no one has picked up on this before, but songs in cartoons suck. With the exception of the River Lullaby and When You Believe (Pfeiffer/Dworsky), there is no need for the others. This is the same for all of Disney's animations. On each of Disney's films, who can really remember any of the songs besides the main piece? The lesser the amount of ridiculous songs the better the animation. All kids really want to see is the animation and action - not the silly songs. Disney discredits kids too much - kids are much smarter these days. The Prince of Egypt is wonderfully told and the actual line drawing is marvellous. It is great to know that Fiennes and Pfeiffer sang their parts. If movie studios are going to get celebrities to be the voices of characters and are still willing to persist with silly songs - the least they could do is make the actual actors sing the songs - or alternatively let the singers SPEAK the parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose some people try to find something to complain about when viewing a film, but as I sit here reviewing this splendid film, I cannot understand the comments made as to the power of the message of the picture. Having being done before, this retelling of the story of moses stays close to the biblical tale as told in the book of exodus. What we should be talking about is the magnifiient animation of the burning bush, the chariot race, the plagues, the dream, the opening of the red sea, and the splendid musical soundtrack, theme, and songs, which I am now humming. OSCARS await this outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Movie for the Whole Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie, even though I don't like musicals. The singing was really great especially since I thought all of the leads sang their own roles, and the artwork was excellent. The charactarization of Zipporah, based on Michelle Pfeiffer, was especailly vivid. Patrick Stewart Helen Mirren, Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Sandra Bullock were all beautifully cast.The movie tells the story of the life and spiritual awakening of Moses and how he led the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Exodus. There was a bit of glossing over of history as there would need to have been if we were to ever have left the theatre, but the story as presented was very, very inspiring, non-denominational and clear in the telling.The music was a big hit with the under 30 crowd too, many of whom stayed until the last note was sounded. I recognized Boyz II Men, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Babyface and many others. My only regret was that the plagues were a bit rushed and there was no whirlwind of clouds by day or fire by night as I had always pictured in my imagination. The telling of the tale was completely non-threatening even though violence was shown very briefly in the movie. Even the babies in the audience appeared to like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say, I went into this movie with some mighty high expectations; somehow, Prince of Egypt managed to exceed them. The animation -- stunning, spectacular, any other really good adjectives you can think of. It is possibly the most visually beautiful movie in ages. The voice actors are excellent, particularly Ralph Fiennes as Ramses. The one flaw is the half-hearted attempt at mainstreaming that is "You're Playing With the Big Boys Now," a rather embarrassing and stupid song that disturbs the overall feel of the movie, but only briefly. Beyond that, the songs are always beautiful if not memorable; they function more as atmosphere-inducing background music than as show-stopping numbers. Overall, a near flawless picture that stands out from all other animated movies like a grizzly stands out in a pile of teddy bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "The Prince of Egypt," DreamWorks is embarking on a quest against the mighty empire of animation, Disney. They have been successful with this, their first animated release, and I believe it's the finest animated movie ever created. Lovingly crafted by talented people, it was bound to be a winner. Perhaps not the biggest financial success of all time, but certainly a cornerstone in the movie industry.

		<fullReview>Although I did cringe at some of the liberties taken with the biblical account, I was impressed with the way the story was told using Dreamworks fanatastic animation. I was also impressed with the inclusion of the disclaimer at the beginning of the film about the liberties taken and the suggestion to read the actual story in the book of Exodus (reading Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy would also be profitable). This film and the companion merchandise will cause children and adults to investigate the fascinating story of the Jewish people and their establishment as the first "Nation under God". I applaud the filmmakers willpower to resist the temptation to include talking animals (they could make a film on the Book of Judges which includes a talking donkey and not be out of line with a talking animal) which would have severely abused the original history and cheapened the message of the Moses account. I do criticize the closing song about believing in that it wasn't clear enough that the faith involved was faith in "I am" (YHWH) not just some sort of magical self-centered believing which the song seemed to convey. Nevertheless, I hope Dreamworks is successful with this film and look forward to more biblical theme movies from them in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been so enthusiastic about a movie, before actually having seen it. When the Prince of Egypt soundtrack was released, I bought it immediately and listened to it over and over again. It was so incredibly wonderful, it really made me want to see the movie as well.And it was such a wonderful experience... I have never experienced this amount of emotion and power before in an animated movie. I am a really big fan of animated movies, and I love Disney's animated features. DreamWorks' Prince of Egypt really is such a wondrous movie, it really improves on a lot of Disney movies, in my humble opinion. The story is so strong, and the Moses and Rameses characters are so well developed, the animation is awesome, and the music.. Well, that is really something I will never forget. Hans Zimmer and Stephen Schwartz have done their most wonderful work so far. The score and songs are truly unforgettable. And when you hear the music and experience the animation together, you have the movie that is called Prince of Egypt.Truly a wonderful movie! And my alltime-favorite movie so far. Well done DreamWorks! Many thanks for making it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than just the story of Moses, "Prince of Egypt" is the tale of a voyage of self-discovery, as a man learns that all he is and all he has ever known was based on lies. Loosely following the Biblical story, the movie follows Moses from the baby pulled from the river, to growing up alongside Rameses, to discovering who, and what, he truly is. We see Moses challenged again and again in his quest to fulfill a destiny he is only just learning about, and the pain he suffers as he sees what destruction his new God brings down upon his former family.Look beyond the Bible, and see the story behind the story: that man is willing to sacrifice all for the simple right of freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt was quite an experience for me. If you're looking for your typical Disney style animated movies, you'll be extremely disappointed. This movie has a much serious tone, and deals with situations such as death, torture, and plagues. Unlike Disney movies, there are no talking animals or candlesticks etc... The humor in this movie resides in each characters jokes and silly actions. The movie doesn't really have too many catchy melodies like Disney movies, but it makes up for it in the visual department. The special effects in this movie are unlike anything you've ever seen in an animated flik. Scenes such as the parting of the Red Sea and the Rain of Fire kept me in awe. There are many scenes in here that will take your breath away. The scene that amazed me the most was when you could see the whales swimming in the ocean while the sea was parted. Amazing. This movie is a must see, and is one of the year's best. 9/10</fullReview>

Boy was I wrong.Not only is the story [for the most part] biblically accurate (according to DreamWorks, some changes had to be made to make the story a little more interesting for our modern culture), but the animation is outstanding! We get so used to the typical Disney animation that when we see something that's not Disney, it takes us a little while to get used to it. Once you do though, you will LOVE this film!This is by far the best animated motion picture *I* have ever seen. The special effects are right on par with sci-fi movies like Armageddon or Men In Black.I'm sure there will be some people that will find this movie dull or stupid, but this is a MUST SEE at least once for everyone...

		<shortDescription>more than I bargained for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt, as presented by Dream Works SKG, would make Cecil B. DeMille and Andrew Lloyd Webber proud. First let me say that the soundtrack was reminiscent of a Broadway show. The music was well written and presented and relevant to the movie. The presentation of the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea were spectacular. The animation both close-up and distant were excellent. The close-up showed the wide range of emotions albeit in an "animated" way passion, fear, pain, anger, love, and joy while the distant shots of the mass of people looked real. The water in the scenes was perfect especially the parting of the Red Sea. The voices especially Mr. Kilmer (Moses) and Mr. Fiennes (Ramses) were well done. The relationship between the two characters is the real find in this film. The movie makes this conflict between brothers as well as friends central---love that cannot be. In some ways the movie makes Ramses a character for which you can sympathize. A story where people are caught by the role they must play. This applies to Moses as well. Oh, I forgot the animation in the building scenes with the intricacies of the scaffolding--impressive. This was a great movie with a great story to which the author of Exodus, Moses, could relate. I know some artistic license was taken--I think in the killing of Egyptian by Moses--but all in all it seems to be a fairly accurate telling of the story. I would like to thank all those involved and it was one of the longest credits I've seen. This movie may well become a classic. Four stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "prince of egypt" today, and i needed to dread the word. As usual i see a movie on opening weekend to see it and form my own opinions, well, it has been exactly a year to the day that titanic was released. And i saw it before it was"the greatest movie ever" I enjoyed it greatly. Well, i believe(catch the pun) that the prince of egypt is the best if not second to best animated feature ever made. I am not a religious person at all, i have never read the bible and have never heard until today, that the prince of egypt is a retelling of these stories from the bible. I found out that this movie is based on the bible when i proceeded to explain the plot to my mom, she then began to tell me what happened next, i was like "mom how did you know that?" well she told me it was from the bible, i was surprised but i felt kind of good inside.. anyway instead of telling you about me, let's go to the movie.. It was very coherent, the music interlaced seamlessly with the movie, and the animation truly is the pinnacle, better than any other hand drawn movie. the look is very modern, the characterization shows many sides of their personality, unlike titanic which had a few flat characters. And the message is evident and clear,,,the movie is intriguing and interesting, you forget you know that it is a cartoon and if you read the bible, that you know what will happen (again like titanic) this illustrates that this will have box office GOLD, now i have a flaw to discuss but it is invalid, because it describes that some voices are anachronistic but then again, "do we want them talking egyptian and hebrew?" well other than thatPLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Although I thought some of the actress choices were poor, the overall acting and singing is wonderful. The animation and artwork is beautifully done. If you go in with an open mind (and no religious biases), the story is lovely. It is appropriate for children five and older who would be able to understand some of the more dramatic points (the slaughter of innocent children).

The movie teaches children a great history lesson along with moral values. The musical numbers in the movie help keep the audience's attention while incorporating bible verses and values. The quality of color, animation and sound in the movie is excellent. This is a movie that the entire family can sit down and truly enjoy together. Children of all ages can relate to the characters and the dilemmas these characters experience. Most of the facts presented in the movie are accurate. Thus this movie is an excellent representation of ancient Egypt and is a great movie for the entire family to watch. The Prince of Egypt is as great of a family movie as, for example, Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat. Both movies teach the same history and values. When, in the future, I wish to educate my children about the first testament, Passover, or Moses, I most definitely will show them this move. I feel that, by watching this movie, not only will they be entertained, but my children would have gained knowledge about Passover and the culture of ancient Egypt, and that we would have spent an amazing hour and a half together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic tale from B.P (Before Pixar)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, not quite. Pixar was very commercially established, if not quite a household name when Dreamworks invested in Prince of Egypt, but it was the Disney model they were seeking to emulate, and basically outdo in this retelling of the story of Exodus. Looking back on it, it is something of a shame that it represented one of the last of a breed of somewhat serious family animation films combining the look and feel of cel animation with the best that computer animation technology had to offer and that point. Since that point, and in the face of diminishing returns for traditional stories retold in animation, the Pixar/Shrek model has been dominant and looks set to be. However, Prince of Egypt will remain a classic, whatever trends and fashions prevail. Its pastel colours and pencilled line make it feel like a breathing, moving version of those kids bible stories books you may have been given in your youth. Throughout there is artistic and stylistic inventiveness, from the hieroglyphic dream sequence to the Magician's production number. The narrative, if there was any danger of it being dry and dusty is remarkably robust and the adoptive brother and demanding father angles play to modern sensibility, along with a moral racial subtext that is quite definitely late C20 America. It is the set pieces that propel the movie into a special place. Behold the power of CGI! Enabled to part the Red Sea in a moment of climactic spectacle Cecil B De Mille could only have dreamed of. But there are more subtle, equally powerful sequences like the depiction of the burning bush and the plague on the first born that are about as affecting as a cartoon can hope to get. See this movie even if the subject matter has no apparent interest for a masterclass on feature-length animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt is a good attempt to bring the story of the Exodus to the screen in a fresh new way. The animation is quite good and many of the songs are enjoyable, if not quite up the level we have come to expect from the Big Dogs over at Disney. But then, this is not a Disney film, so there you go. Despite some rather pedestrian dialog and a few minor plot alterations, this film succeeds well enough to get a favorable review and multiple-viewings. If you are looking for a fun film that has some real heart and some great sequences, this is your movie, despite some reviews here-in that claim the film has done great injustices to the story. In particular, the review contributed by Emma (Angelfalls916) has missed the point of this movie. As with all films, the first desired effect is to entertain. And as entertainment, this movie is great. Sure there are nit-pickers out there who will look for the flaws, but all movies have mistakes. Just ignore them and enjoy the show. But if you are going to pick out the mistakes, then at least get them right. Emma states that she didn't like the scene depicting Ramses being thrown out of the sea. OK, but it is not as though anyone can say what really happened back there, right? Many Christians believe that Ramses died in the Red Sea, yet most historians and biblical scholars believe that the Ramses of the Exodus story is, in fact, Ramses the Second, who's mummy has been touring the world for the past few years, so he couldn't have died in the Red Sea. And for that matter, it wasn't the Red Sea, either. The Hebrews crossed the Reed Sea. And what about the mistaken translation of God's name (Ehyah-Asher-Ehyeh) as "I am that I am" when a more correct translation is "I will be what I will be". No one is complaining about those mistake. And before you go and blame Disney for making the mistake that have so upset you, Emma, I would like to remind you that this is NOT a Disney picture. As a person of Jewish heritage, I am more than pleased with the result of the film-maker's efforts, despite the film's flaws. I sincerely hope that you can look at this picture and see the entertaining and well-made product and not just a few mistakes.</fullReview>

Here is a movie that accomplishes everything a great movie is supposed to do, and does it incredibly well without the advantage of having a brand new story. Let's face it... EVERYONE knows the story of Exodus. So how did Dreamworks take one of the most well-known stories of Western civilization (a religious story, at that) and turn it into a hundred minute animated feature?Beautifully.The vocal talents of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michele Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Patrick Stewart, Martin Short, Steve Martin, and Helen Mirrin are some of the finest vocal casting ever done. The performances are incredible. The writing makes the story accessible to everyone. There's plenty of humor to keep things light. There's grandeur on a scale that few movies have ever matched. Yet, in spite of all, the story remains about people. You care about these people before the movie's done, even Rameses the pharaoh.The animation is equal to anything ever done, even though the movie was released six years ago. The special effects used are truly breathtaking in the way they're presented. You would never confuse this movie with any other version that's ever been done.But of all the things that make this movie great, it's the music that turns it into something magical. The musical score is beautifully integrated with the story, expressive and evocative without ever drawing your attention away from the tale unfolding. And the songs are some of the best in any movie. The incredibly beautiful "When You Believe", sung by Michelle Pfeiffer and Sally Dworsky (Sandra Bullock's vocal double) won the Oscar for Best Song. But if you can, get the DVD and listen to the same song presented in multi-language format under Special Features. It's the same song as before, but with each phrase presented in a different language from the international releases of the movie. Words can't describe it. Don't worry about understanding the lyrics... just listen. It's worth the price of the DVD alone. Correction: the two phrases sung by the Japanese vocalists ALONE are worth the price of the DVD. The rest is gravy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out. The Prince of Egypt was on t.v. the other night, and my children were able to watch it for the first time. My 6 year old was fascinated. He has a children's Bible that he pulled out and had read to him during the commercials to hear the story of Moses. This movie created a great moment for my family to have a serious discussion about Faith. The color and scenery of this movie is breath-taking. Absolutely beautiful.The characters are very detailed and well thought out, the voices suit the characters perfectly. Prince of Egypt really gets into the emotional aspect of Moses and Ramses. The one thing I did not agree on was the aging of Moses. He was 130 when he found the Promised Land, the movie does not age him at all. Other than that, the movie is one of my all time favorites and is a great way to start children on a journey of Faith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rousing telling of the Exodus story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just about every year I watch "the Ten Commandments", it is a great epic, but one thing that I have always thought is that it lacked heart, it was more about the spectacle of the story than the actual meaning of it. Then came "Prince of Egypt", an beautifully made, incredibly underrated animated masterpiece. Animated films never get the respect they deserve because most of the moviegoing and critics pass them off as pure entertainment for children, true they are targeted for a young audience, but in the case of this film, the story of Moses has enough for any adult to enjoy. The movie focuses on the relationship between Moses and Ramses, and the other part of the story most of us are familiar with is told in a fresh way, the animation is as good as anything that has ever come out of Disney. The movie does have comic relief, but it never resorts to the "cute and funny" sidekick formula that is so common in animated films. It is entertaining, and it is meant to be an adventure, but the subject is presented in a serious way, the filmmakers have a great love and respect for the story. The voices are done by very known actors, but Val Kilmer as Moses and Ralph Feinnes as Ramses stand out in their roles. The movie can be called spiritual, but I wouldn't call it a religious movie. It is a great retelling of one of the great stories of the Old Testament, done with great heart and respect.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, I loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I'd like to say is that although I won't point fingers, I'm actually quite surprised to see some very harsh undue criticism leveled at this movie. While I'm not saying they should have liked it, I'm surprised to hear how much they apparently DISliked it. The Prince of Egypt is the story of Moses, savior of the Hebrews. If you don't know anything about him, you might wanna try the Bible, as his story begins on, like, page 7 or 8. In all fairness, I'm not a very religious man, but I still found this to be a very enjoyable (I hesitate to use this word...)cartoon. You don't have to be a catholic or jew or very religious to even enjoy it, as it isn't the kind of preachy cartoon you'd expect to see exclusively in bible stores (not that there is anything wrong with that, just not my thing). POE tells a very human story about a man born into a noble family who must decide what to do when he is apparently visited by God and given the great responsibility of rebelling against his adoptive family.While some have complained that this movie is a blemish to the actual biblical story, I believe those people are overreacting. The film is 100 minutes long, and not designed to document every aspect of Moses' very long life. It retells the widely known (and often retold) story of his most widely known accomplishments, and it does so with common cartoon precedents. This does include songs, but no cute talking animal mascots here. Instead, POE does what it suggests it will: In its time frame, it gives us the aspects of Moses' life that most people are familiar with, and it isn't trying to be a lengthy documentary the likes of the Ten Commandments (though I love that film as well). No, POE is just an animated treatment of the tale, and a good one at that. The production values are high, the animation is definitely on par with any other animated (not COMPUTERIZED) film, and in my opinion the songs were actually enjoyable.The film introduces us to Moses and Rameses in a lighthearted way, and it first seems as if this'll be a common kiddy movie. But once Moses is exiled and encounters God, the tone shifts dramatically and we see nothing lighthearted again. The Nile turns to blood and the plagues are shown, including the death of the firstborn. For a cartoon, it takes its subject matter quite seriously (hence the PG rating).How can I change the minds of those who tear this movie apart for its supposed mishandling of the sensitive and beloved subject matter? I don't want to. I'm glad they have their opinions. Still, I do wish they wouldn't take the film so personally or be so judgmental. Compared to any film, let alone cartoon on the subject, POE is one of the most mature and honest in its look at spirituality. And simply being compared to other current cartoons, POE holds its own just fine. In my opinion, the acting, animation, lighting and shadows, and music were excellent. I honestly left the theater very moved, and I respect the film for being what it is, an animated and good-natured look at how Moses freed the slaves. If at the very least this film brings the story to a new generation of people, Its done its job just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ?Prince of Egypt? is based on the bible story of Moses, one of the greatest prophets mentioned in the Old Testament of the Bible, also found in the Torah. The Pharaoh of Egypt orders all male infants under the age of 2 to be killed, thrown into the Nile River, fearing the growing population of the slave race, the Israelites. Unable to bear having her child killed, a mother weaves a basket, places her baby in the basket and tells her young daughter, Miriam to place the basket in a stream. She hopes and prays that the baby will be safe and fortunately, the basket it found by the pharaoh??s daughter, the princess. She takes the baby in, naming him Moses. Moses grows up in the palace, with his younger brother. He is always getting into trouble and seems as if he doesn't quite fit in well among the other Egyptians. After he is grown and reaching adulthood, he sees hieroglyphic writing on the walls of the palace showing the annihilation of the Israeli baby boys. He finds out that he is actually an Israelite and he leaves after being convicted as a murderer. He moves far away, marries Zipporah, and has children. Moses works as a herdsman but is called on by God. He eventually obeys, going to Egypt ordering his ?brother? who is now pharaoh, ?Let my people go.? The 10 plagues follow, and it was amusing to see the pharaoh??s magicians attempting to perform the same miracles that Moses does. In the end, the Pharaoh gives up but later changes his mind and the parting of the sea occurs. This movie is a good family film, but definitely not a masterpiece. The climax was well displayed and it??s a good animated film for children and their parents to watch. Since it??s based on a bible story, it??s plot is developed and clear. Overall, this movie gets a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Prince of Egypt" features an all-star cast, including Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin and Martin Short. One of the most interesting aspects of this film is how Dreamworks Pictures got such a talented crew to star in an animated film, much less an animated film with morals and a Christian message. Following the Biblical story of Moses, "The Prince of Egypt" does take a few creative liberties, but compared to so much other Hollywood garbage based on Bible stories, this film is very true to its roots. Another thing that amazed me about this spectacle was the animation. Over the years, Disney has gone from great animation like "Snow White" to films like "The Emperor's New Groove" -- good story, but the animation is just too "cartoony/ish," if you know what I mean. However, "The Prince of Egypt" does not follow Disney's regress. It marks a revolutionary breakthrough for animation, and will hopefully boot Disney up a notch, as I've heard it has already with Disney's newest animated feature, "Lilo and Stitch." If you are in the mood for a true, amazing, family-oriented animated motion picture, see "The Prince of Egypt," which also boasts excellent songs and characters, worthy of overtaking Disney stature.4.5/5 stars --John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a wonderful version of a classic story that far exceeds the Cecil B DeMille films. I suppose some puritans will disagree, but I thought the way each of the characters were fleshed out and made to argue his/her case was an example of great dramatization. The best examples are the performances by Patrick Stewart, Ralph Fiennes, Danny Glover and of course Val Kilmer.The best segment is the way they use the hieroglyphs to present Joseph's back story. That is a truly brilliant (dare I say inspired?) idea to tell the story. And the chariot race and walk through the Red Sea are breathtaking.I think no matter what your own personal theological or spiritual stance is, you should be able to enjoy this masterful presentation of a classic story. And you really can't ask for much better than that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not partial to animated movies, much less Disney-style animated flicks (with the singing anthropomorphic animals, objects etc) so this was a rather pleasant change from the standard fare. Although there was singing, and it was boring, it was bearable! The design, especially of Moses' and Co's faces, which seemed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphics, was very effective. This was well done, probably better than Disney, and it depicted Moses life in an interesting way. Such as his time living as a prince of Egypt then in the desert as a Hebrew. And considering this is an animated feature!There were events in this film that raised it above your average Disney flick. Examples include Moses' dream when he was a young man and he learns about the persecution of the Hebrews. When he encounters god in the form of the burning bush. And of course, the parting of the Red Sea. This last piece of animation is the best I have ever seen!! CONCLUSION: This movie is not just for the kids!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest Story Ever Told ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of exodus from the Biblical angle. This is the future of animated films, this is a real story told through action and the pictures add to that story telling. It is a reflection of how good the film is that it is easy to forget that the film is animated at all and just be caught up in it.Three things leap out from the film to me, firstly the burning bush scene, breathtakingly done, one could palpably feel the effect this scene had on the audience. This was a mere taster on what was to come with the parting of the water. Nothing I have seen of the screen has had such an impact on me.The third point I wish to make is more controversial, and that is about the perspective and portrayal of Egyptian society in the film. Contrasting this film with the Christian Jacq series of books about Rameses is an enlightening experience in terms of image and portrayal. I am no historian of this period but thoughts raised include: Were the Hebrews enslaved or paid well and thought of highly in Egyptian society? Were plagues miraculous or natural phenomona? Finally the indiscriminate killing of first born ( and innocent ) children from a God of love and forgiveness is very hard to reconcile.I feel a more balanced portrayal would have made a film more lasting, but as to that history itself will be the judge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read some of the comments on this site, and there seems to be a lot of controversy over it about either its animation, approach at the story, or the fact that it is a Biblical story, but most of the people actually have given it good reviews. Personally, I think that it is the best animated movie ever made. All the voices did a great job, especially Val Kilmer as Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Ramses, and Patrick Stewart as the Pharoah. The animation was excellent, especially at the water parting, burning bush, and plague scenes. I almost fell out of my seat the first time that I saw the water being parted. I have seen it three times now. Everyone else I saw it with thought it was excellent also. I was moved by a lot of the emotional scenes between the two "brothers." The film really let the emotions be shown and felt by the excellent musical score and acting. Getting a little bit off the subject, I think that the Nasville album sucked. Back to the movie, though, the only two movies that I have ever seen and liked better were Braveheart and Titanic. It is one of the all time best movies. I recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie, and I gotta be honest, I liked it. If you accept that it is entertainment, and not a biography, you can enjoy it. Being a Christian, I have seen nearly all the biblical movies that have been made. From the excellent "Jesus of Nazareth" to the absolutely abysmal NBC's "Noah." And, I have to be honest, nearly all of them tinker with the story a little bit for dramatic effect. As long as it is done in tastefully and not taken as the truth, like constructing a probable storyline for Moses in the original "Ten Commandments", and not having two arks like in "Noah." This movie isn't the best example for the true story of Exodus, but it is a nice movie. The animation is excellent, the music is pretty good, especially the sequence with the plagues, and the voices are really well cast. Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very underrated animated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt has always been one of my childhood favourites because I remember even seeing it in the cinema, and even back then I thought it was a great movie. But I can't imagine why it's so underrated. I mean sure, it might've been a hit when it first came out, but pretty much everything about it is just epic: the story (even though it's taken from the Bible), the animation, the characters, the music, the visuals, songs and even the voice-acting. I mean a lot of big actors like Val Kilmer, Sandra Bullock, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Patrick Stewart all starred in this movie.I think one of my favourite things about this movie is how the characters develop, particularly with Moses and Ramses. Like Moses starts out as a goofy, reckless, young prince who likes to play pranks. But when he finds out that he's Hebrew, he becomes more of a sympathetic and insecure character. But when he is to return to Egypt to free the slaves, he becomes a very determined leader. As for Ramses, he starts out as young prince who wants to live up to his father's expectations. But since he loves Moses as his brother, he can also be sympathetic as well. But when Moses asks Ramses to let his people go, he becomes very much like a villain; hostile and ruthless. Also the conflict and relationship between Moses and Ramses adds to a lot of the drama into the film because it's like something from a Shakespeare play. They're both brothers and care about each other, but they reluctantly have to against each other.One of my favourite scenes in this film is the burning bush scene because it's one of the scenes that shows how beautiful and impressive the visuals are. I mean it doesn't really look like fire, but it looks like something not of this world and the voice-acting by Val Kilmer(who also plays Moses) is very well done because he makes the voice of God sound very powerful but also loving and caring and soothing at the same time. But one of the things that bothers me is that the plot seems a little rushed, but that often happens in animated musicals. But the songs help tell the story and tell what the characters are going through. Also, The Prince of Egypt is a lot more dramatic and darker compared to other animated features, like there's not much comedy later on in the film but not like that bothers me.All in all, The Prince of Egypt is a powerful, beautiful and impressive epic that should be more appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt (1998): Dir: Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, Simon Wells / Voices: Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum, Sandra Bullock: One of the greatest animations ever made. From the point of view of Moses Egypt is the rise of the poor through the power of God while Rameses reveals how power can be overthrown. It is the story of Moses who is found in a basket in a river and raised in a kingdom. When he learns of his birthright and the slaughter of his people he flees. He finds shelter in a village and eventually encounters God through a burning bush. With God's power he approaches Rameses regarding the release of his people. Rameses refuses and the destruction of his city follows including the exciting climax where the Red Sea parts. Enchanting animated masterpiece directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells and between the three of them they bring out the best in animations. Val Kilmer leads the voice talents as Moses while Ralph Fiennes voices the corrupt Rameses. Michelle Pfeiffer voices Moses's wife who escapes slavery. Jeff Goldblum voices a fellow slave who sheds insight into the treatment of these people. Sandra Bullock voices Moses's sister. It not only gives highlight to a Biblical account, it also translate as superb entertainment and storytelling. It is an outstanding animation about God's awesome power. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Egyptian prince discovers his true identity as a Hebrew, and becomes the chosen deliverer to lead his people to their promised land.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt directed by Simon Wells, Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and produced by DreamWorks Pictures is an engaging animated film adaptation of the Book of Exodus from the First Testament of the Bible. It provides an accurate portrayal of the story of Moses leading his people to freedom from Egypt, mixed with original songs and compositions that help compliment the theme of the film. While the length of the film may be too long to hold a child's attention, it's still a thrilling, beautiful piece of work. It chooses to focus on Moses's family relationships, and how he is torn between the life he always knew as an Egyptian prince and his true roots as an Israelite. The film also adds in the familiar sibling rivalry theme between Moses and his Egyptian brother, Rameses II, allowing the audience to find a sense of reliability in it, and to form an connection to the characters. The music was stunning and beautiful to listen to, and the added Hebrew lyrics in certain songs create a sense of authenticity in the film. While there was a certain song during Moses's return to Egypt that I felt was not necessary, and almost forced into the film, DreamWorks still managed to put together an amazing musical film adaptation of the Exodus story. The directors also chose to have a named pharaoh, in contrast to the Bible where the pharaoh is unknown, and to have said pharaoh have a direct connection to Moses in order to create a more dramatic setting when Moses realizes the full extent of what the Egyptians have done to his people. The film also chose to have Moses in the dark when it comes to his true identity unlike the Bible, which also added to the drama in the revelation. The film keeps some quotes from the actual Exodus chapter, including "I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3:14) and "Let my people go" (Exodus 5:1), along with "Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I?" (Exodus 4:11), but left out the second half of the Exodus, after Moses and his people flee Egypt, choosing to end the film directly after Moses receives the 10 Commandments. While much of the important historical context is within the second half, it did make sense for the directors to omit it as it is most likely not suitable for children and difficult to condense. The film took a careful approach when it came to creating a portrayal of God. Instead of giving him a powerful, booming voice like most people might imagine, his voice came out as a soft whisper that radiated power and authority. This is just one example of how DreamWorks attempted to give a careful, accurate story while trying not to offend anybody. It also made the Hebrew people much more hopeful and faithful than they were in the actual Bible in order to make it more suitable for children. The film also decided to have Moses speak for himself instead of his Hebrew brother Aaron in the Bible, giving more focus on Moses's transformation into the leader he was born to be. Overall&nbsp;The Prince of Egypt&nbsp;is an excellent, accurate, easy to understand film telling the story of Moses, incorporating messages such as having faith in the future and looking at your life 'through heaven's eyes,' as nobody can measure someone's worth. The way DreamWorks chose to create these messages, through engaging songs, is a clever way to help the child audience fully understand them.&nbsp;The Prince of Egypt&nbsp;in general is a careful, detailed film and a clever way to help children understand the general concept of the Exodus story.</fullReview>

Anyways it was interesting to find out that Moses was a Prince of Egypt and he was gone from it by accidentally killing a man who abused an old Hebrew slave. I think in my opinion,he should've stayed as a Prince because he wouldn't get the opportunities as a Hebrew man would. Although that means, he wouldn't be able to marry his wife and rekindle with his sister. I wonder what had happened to the brother or was that man the brother or her husband? They really didn't introduce each other properly haha!I wouldn't call this the best but hey, if you're into biblical stuff, check this out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Ten Commandments" Animated-But Not For The Kiddiewinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As was mentioned in Wikipedia, this movie is an animated remake of "The Ten Commandments". The movie has songs and special effects, but it is not in any way cutesy-it tells the story of Moses in full harshness. We see the brutality of Egyptian society and of the gods, and the attitudes of the people of the era.It is the story, as told in the Biblical Exodus, of how a baby was put in a basket in the river to escape harm, and was found by the royal rulers of Egypt. Moses would adopt the attitudes of his adopted family-until he is forced to learn of his relationship to the enslaved tribes of the Hebrews.The movie is more morally ambiguous than most. There are no true heroes and villains, and Ramses, though technically the bad guy, is simply the natural product of his society, with the attitudes he was raised up on. Meant for the older children, rather than the tots who will find the subject matter harsh and frightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good animation and a serious treatment of the material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DreamWorks does The Ten Commandments. It's an adaptation of the Book of Exodus. The Queen finds a baby in a basket floating in the Nile and adopts him naming him Moses. Moses grows up along side Ramses as brothers and best of friends. However Moses' past would lead them on their separate paths. It builds to the climatic parting of the Red Sea and quickly ends with Moses coming down Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments.It's a good looking animated movie. The CG scenes give the animation an epic scale. It treats the material seriously. It is still animation but it keeps the needed adult themes. As for music, the songs are Broadway-like but none of them are memorable. Overall, this is a deserving rendition of the biblical tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While, I'm not really religionist; this movie did delivered. Delivered us to the promise land! Thank God! It was amazing. Amen for that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really hard to make a good religious movie, these days. Most people have a love/hate relationship with religion. It's a sensitive topic, but this in my opinion, this movie is probably the best retelling of the Bible, Book of Exodus on film, to date. I found this movie to be accurate and faithful to the original story. Yes, they change, a few things, but all the changes work for the better. A good example is making the characters younger. I think it's a brilliant example of how you can take artistic license with the scripture and still remain true to the spirit of the source material. Yes, it still have some inaccurates, but at least, it's not mindless theology propaganda drool. I think this movie is even better than director Cecil B. Demille's 1923 &amp; 1956's versions of the Ten Commandments. Don't get me wrong, both 1923 &amp; 1956 versions are classic films, but Prince of Egypt commands attention. It try to do something new, with the source material with its animation musical style. It made people think about their beliefs, by showing the negative effects of the child murders, slavery, and gruesome acts, commit by God and other human beings, more. This was a bit risky. After all, this movie got banned in two countries, on the grounds that the film depicts Islamic prophets. In Prince of Egypt, we get a more human portray of God through Moses. We see, both the warm, and caring side, but also the deep anger and wrath. For a PG movie, it has a lot of cruel violence and some gore, that some parents should know about. Produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures, as their first animation full length movie, and directed by Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells and Steve Hickner; the movie tells the story of Moses (Voiced by Val Kilmer), a Hebrew prince of Egypt, that found the courage and faith to go face to face with his half-brother &amp; pharaoh, Ramses (Voiced by Ralph Fiennes) and lead his people out of slavery. Prince of Egypt works, because it was one of the first films that focused hard on the relationship of the two leaders. You feel the pain, both of them are going through, and how much they wish they could return to what they had. This makes the drama much more interesting. Both voice actors do a great job, showing this. Val Kilmer plays Moses as an every-man, the person who fell into his leadership rather than seeking it out. Kilmer really has this sympathetic like tone. He speaks, very soften, and clear, as if a real-life monk. Ralph Fiennes voiced Moses's half-brother, Ramses was amazing. He portray Ramses as a product of his environment, a tortured soul who still loves his brother, but is under the psychological grip of his overbearing father and his duties as Pharaoh. He really has that, powerful commanding voice that you can't help, feeling intimidated when hearing. Both actors really work well, against each other. I just wish, the supporting cast was as strong as the main leads. Despite, a lot of big name actors, playing supporting characters; the film feels lackluster, in that department. Good actors like Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer and others, feel lost in the scuffle. They don't have many scenes to shine. Other actors like Martin Short &amp; Steve Martin feels not-needed and bit annoying with their premise. The comedy seem forced, and nearly unfunny. It never really feels natural. I always though, the movie could had work better, if they cut, those scenes out. No matter what, the movie still moves in a good pace. For a 99 minutes film, you really do see the characters, change from beginning to end. The animation is very well-done. You got some of the best animators, working on this film. When former animation chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney to start DreamWorks, he took a good amount of people from the Walt Disney Feature Animation Department. When director/producer Steven Spielberg, came onboard, he also brought good animators, from his defunct division of Amblin Entertainment, the Amblimation, known for films like 1991's An American Tail: Fievel Go West &amp; 1995's Balto. Both divisions, work very well, together. You really get the ancient epic scope, by how beautiful, the film looks. I also love, how the movie used computer animation to add, detail. A good example is the burning bush and the water sequences. The songs themselves surprisingly really help to tell the story, too. The opening song by Stephen Schwartz and composer Hans Zimmer, 'Deliver Us' was very powerful. It was so epic! Not only did it help, move the story along, but they also show what the characters are going through. You get to see this, in song sequences like 'Look through heaven's eyes', "All I Ever Wanted" &amp; 'The Plagues'. You see, both the joy and suffering that everyone has to deal with. The worst song in the movie has to be 'Playing with the Big Boys'. I really can't stand that song, one bit. It wasn't really needed. My favorite song has to be the power ballad, 'When You Believe'. This is one beautiful song. It goes from a soft spoken beginning to outright happiness. The middle part with the children singing is just uplifting. That song won Best Original Song at the 1999 Academy Awards. Overall: This movie was a decent remake for the most part. Unlike other modern day religionist films. This movie didn't feel like a joke. It's not too preachy or clumsy. It's a pretty good watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream works' best. Yes, I just said that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This animated film is PG, but I think anyone around the world should watch this movie.(Spoiler Alert). First of all, let's get one thing straight. This movie is awesome and accurate. If you are a Christian or a Jew, watch this movie or Joseph: King of Dreams. That movie is good too. Don't watch Noah or Exodus: Gods and Kings if you want to see a Biblical accurate story. This movie and Joseph are pretty close to being 100% biblically accurate! There are a few minor things, but I'll tell about those later. Not only is this an animated film, but it's also a musical. And a pretty darn good one, too! I love to listen to the soundtrack, and I listen to it like everyday! Some of the best songs are Deliver Us, Through Heaven's Eyes, Playing With the Big Boys, The Plagues, and Believe. Which is pretty much all the songs but who cares?Now let's talk about the minor changes that aren't what the Bible says. There's only two, but they are important. So, what do you think? When Moses came back, was Pharaoh his Dad or his Brother? The Bible doesn't say, but I'm pretty sure Moses would've said in the Bible that Pharaoh was his brother ( which he is in the movie). But I like this version too! Have you had a big fight with your brother before? None as big as this, ladies and gentlemen. Another minor change is Moses didn't complain as much as much as he did in the Bible when he had to go back to Egypt, and he didn't have to find Aaron at this place so he can speak for him. Nope. Moses speaks for himself. But that's OK, I like this version, too. So there were minor changes to the story, but they're good changes unlike the movie Noah.There's pretty much only one thing I don't necessarily like. I, honestly, think they could've done their animation better. It wasn't the best, but it also wasn't the worst. Dream Works has a way of doing that with their animation in movies. Movies with not so great animation takes you awhile to get used to. Like you're first like," Oh this is a bad animation movie," then after awhile it becomes natural. Not with this movie. This movie knew it had bad animation, so they made a thrilling beginning to say, " This is what we can do with this animation!" And that's exactly what they did.The casting was great, I loved the cast. I love the music. This is my favorite Dream Works movie. They did a great job with it. Like I said earlier, anyone should watch this movie, even if you're not a Christian! Watch this movie if you haven't and if you did, watch it again because it's just that awesome.8 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a Sunday School Special, it's a joy to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Prince of Egypt" isn't just for Sunday school, it's a well made animated epic with lush, detailed backgrounds, a story that's tight, an excellent soundtrack and performances that are just as good. We've seen the story of Exodus done multiple times now, but this animated version manages to bring something new to the field. Like any great film, every detail has been carefully considered, from the colour palettes which are adapted depending on the mood of the scene to the details on the Egyptian buildings which make this world feel genuine. What I really love about this adaptation is that it never skimps out on the spectacle of the story, with numerous crowd shots were thousands of characters are moving and enormous statues and buildings to really make it clear how overwhelming powerful the Egyptian empire is. It also manages to do several things that wouldn't have worked in a live action film. My go-to example is the dream sequence that is animated to look like moving Egyptian art. You've never seen anything like it and I think it really brings something special to the story. You would think that this movie is a Disney knockoff when you hear that there are several songs throughout, but this is a story that will appeal both to children and adults. There aren't any silly talking animals or magical talking statues that give advice to Moses or Rameses. The songs are used to develop the characters and further the story, in a way that is similar to a montage, but significantly more entertaining in my book because it gives you something to listen to besides catch phrases uttered between brief action shots. The voice acting is also very good and there are some subtle but interesting choices that will speak differently to you depending on your views of this biblical story (such as the casting of Val Kilmer as both Moses and God). There is humour present, but the focus is on the drama, the feelings of being torn between two different lives or two opposite and important choices. I feel like because of the spectacle of it, the well made animation, the acting, the soundtrack and the tried-and-true story of a Prince who must choose between his adopted family and his biological one, one to come to blows with his brother, that you can enjoy "The Prince of Egypt" even if the passage isn't a part of your faith.

		<fullReview>If Dreamworks doesn't release a blu-ray copy of this film I will be very very disappointed. The film's music is moving, the story is something anyone can enjoy regardless of denomination, and the animation is STUNNING. The cast is mostly white actors (For those where the race of the voice actor is as important as the character they represent) however that should not turn you away. Far superior to "Exodus", I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys biblical history, or musicals, or good films in general. The performances are wonderful as well and the visuals of this film are strong. Overall a treat for the eyes and your soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Admirable Animated Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As DreamWorks' first animated musical, "The Prince of Egypt" qualifies as an astonishing account of the Exodus epic from The Bible that rivals the 1923 and 1956 versions of Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments." This four-years-in-the-production, PG-rated, 99-minute spectacle covers the life of Moses from his birth, treacherous voyage in a floating basket down the Nile River to his emergence from the mountain clutching the 10 commandments and it commands attention. You won't see animals or architecture deliver dialogue and the filmmakers play everything in a straight-forward fashion. Unlike most adolescent opuses, this film boasts far more substance than you'd expect from an animated movie. Co-directors Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells approach their subject matter with reverence as reflected in the Angel of Death sequence. The lethal spirits pass up doorways and lintels splashed with blood, but eliminates families that didn't put blood at the entrances to their homes. Young and old alike should enjoy this gorgeous-looking film. The authoritative voice over cast of Val Kilmer as Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Rameses, Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah, Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Patrick Stewart as Seti, Helen Miriam as The Queen, and Jeff Goldblum as Aaron is as evocative as it is charismatic. The animation is tour-de-force, and the Red Sea sequence stand out. You won't forget "The Prince of Egypt."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exodus as an animated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 1/2 out of 4 stars.Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells' "The Prince of Egypt" is a re-telling of the Exodus tale from the Bible. It's an unusual American animated film. Although it was produced by DreamWorks, it feels like a Disney film. It looks like a Disney film and has songs written by Stephen Scwartz and Hans Zimmer. The film is an interesting juxtaposition of the Disney musical film combined with Bible. Sometimes it works, and other times it doesn't. First, the animation is quite beautiful. It is stunning at times and has a grand scope thanks to it being hand drawn. There is some awkward 3-dimensional animation at times, but it didn't hinder the film too much. For the most part, it is a visual treat.I'm not a big fan of the Exodus story. It's a my God is better than yours tale. The story is not as accepting and can be cruel at times. However, "The Prince of Egypt" has a little more humanity and complex characters. Thanks to the cast, these characters feel real. I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes's voice work the most. Ramseses can easily be turned into a one dimensional villain (look at Cecil B. DeMile's "The Ten Commandments"). Fiennes, though, gives Ramseses more complexity and more humanity. The only awkward voice casting to me was Val Kilmer being cast as both Moses and God. I think there is trouble mixing this story with song and dance musical numbers. It was weird seeing animated characters sing about whose God is better and people being killed while other characters are singing. It seemed inappropriate at times. Its hard to transition from someone being killed to singing about miracles and this version didn't hold up to me. My favorite part where I thought the music, story, and imagery worked is the first 10 minutes of the film. The song is called "Deliver Us" and it sets up Moses' story. It's a wonderful, but dark, montage that I thought was the strongest musical part of the film. The Exodus tale is a hard story to tell. If you were to choose between "The Ten Commandments" and "The Prince of Egypt," I would say watch "The Prince of Egypt." It is more concise and has complex characters. It's a very well-drawn film that will keep you visually interested. The film is dark for kids at times. A lot of people die, but it doesn't focus on the violence. "The Prince of Egypt" is a good way to introduce kids to the story of Exodus, but the film has its flaws that may not hold up for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt is probably one of my favorite animated movies not made by Disney. (I'm sure that I'd prefer it to several Disney animations as well.) This film was very present in my childhood, and I always enjoyed watching it, but it wasn't until a few year ago when I saw it for the first time in a while (I'm 20 now) that it really hit me just how intense and awe-inspiriting the movie is! I found myself getting chills the whole way through, basically every time someone sang, and when any power of God was shown. That, I think, is what really got be and brought me to tears, was the awesome portrayal of God, who really isn't present in any animated film except for this one (and the later story of Joseph). The Hunchback of Notre Dame also spotlights Christianity, but focuses more of hypocrisy and prejudice in the church than it does on God Himself. And, obviously, it's the story of Moses. You really can't go wrong there, as long as you actually follow the Bible. The movie did a great job in staying relatively accurate. Sure, there was some creative license taken, but the main premise of Exodus stayed the same. This is an incredible film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic and Moving, The Prince of Egypt is my favorite animated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt was a film that I loved watching over and over as a kid and now that I'm grown up, I'm still blown away by it.I like how this film tells the story of Moses from a different point of view than other stories. It focuses more on the drama and relationship of Moses and Ramses, who don't want to be enemies but Moses wants Ramses to let the Jewish people go, leaving Ramses to choose between family and legacy. The animation is just great, everything feels huge and epic. The songs are fantastic, each one feels right at home with the tone of the film. You have the songwriter of Wicked to thank for that.Surprisingly, people who watch Prince of Egypt think it's made by Disney when in reality it made by Dreamworks. I'm actually glad it wasn't made by Disney, and don't get me wrong, I do love Disney films, but there's always that part of the film that was just made for little kids and laughs that is totally different from the tone of the film. Luckily, the Prince of Egypt is serious and epic, but kids and adults can still watch it. I love this movie so much, I actually think this movie would beat Frozen for Best Animated Movie at the Oscars, but that's my opinion.I definitely recommend Prince of Egypt as a masterpiece. I promise, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather interesting religious video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting when people try to create biblical stories into films, even more so when they are made for children. The bible wasn't really meant for children in the sense of most of the stories have to be altered to fit our societies ideas of what our children should know. Things like death and blood never make it into the shows and sort of make it feel unrealistic then. When I hear there is a cartoon coming out that is supposed to be biblical, I really take it with a grain of salt. I was partly right in doing so though it was still rather enjoyable to watch anyway.I love how they humanized the story of Moses and didn't just try to play if off the book of Exodus. In the book (if I remember right) we only see how Egyptians took Moses and yet we always see that the Hebrews look to him lovingly. This feels a bit unrealistic. How would you feel if one of your people treated you like a slave, left after killing someone, then came back and said that he was chosen by god to save them. You would probably be skeptical about what he was talking about. That's how they first play it off in the show and It works rather well. Another thing is that they show a deep connection with Moses and Rameses that feels perfectly like how two brothers would act.Although there are some wonderful things they have done in the story, they have somehow missed a couple things from the story that I feel make it lose in a way. I care a lot about being true to the source if you actually want to create a story so it bothers me the inaccurate parts from both the bible and history. First off is the problems with the bible, According to what I have read and what I remember, it was not the Pharaoh's wife that found Moses but the Pharaoh's daughter. Also, unlike the show, it is said that Moses was given back to his mother to nurse him for the Daughter even though she was never able to say he was hers. Moses knew all the time that he was a Hebrew, not an Egyptian though the film has a nice dream piece to have him figure out who he really was. When he does see the burning bush, unlike the film where he seems intrigued or sticks his hand in, he is supposed to be afraid until god speaks to him and tells him that he is to do things for him. When he does return to Egypt, he was not greeted with open arms by the Egyptians because he really did kill someone. He was exiled instead of left on his own.Now when we get into history part, there is at least one thing I picked up on. During the dream vision he has, they show a sun with hands. This was the Egyptian God Aten, and was supposed to be during the time of Pharaoh Akhenaten a few hundred years after the time of Moses. Aten was the only time that Egyptians believed in one God. It would not be during this time and so he would not be dreaming of it or have it drawn on the walls.The Artwork is beautifully done. The textures stand out wonderfully and the backgrounds look like nicely detailed watercolors where the CG that is put in once in a while works perfectly, adding to the show instead of taking away from it. The characters look mostly like Egyptian drawings brought to life and even some of the poses can be seen from the artwork in Egyptian walls. Unfortunately, sometimes, the characters start to lack a bit when they move around. They are wonderful when they just stand or look like they mean business, but when they do fast passed action scenes, the characters feel a bit stretched out. One or two of the characters feel like they have to small of heads and the details just seems to be copied from Disney.The music is perfect and wonderfully done, bringing the show to life though when they start singing, once in a while, sounds odd. I really don't like how Patrick Stewart does the Pharaoh's voice. Something makes me feel a little unwell when a rather British sounding man tries to play the Egyptian old man. Aaron's voice, Moses older brother, just feels rather comical as well as the strange priests Hotep and Huy. I could never take any of them seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when The Prince of Egypt came out a few decades ago. My recollection is that it was a huge success and the buzz everywhere. Being a kid at the time I didn't understand the movie. I knew the story of Moses for sure but at that point in my life I didn't really get the magic of animation. Fast-forward today and I see it as movie that needs more attention. The story the characters, and a good blend of computer and traditional animation, it's not easy to keep that consistent. The only downside I can think of is the kookier moments and it is kinda distracting. But other then that it is a really good underrated movie.I hope in the future that they could make more animated films based on Bible stories.</fullReview>

The relationship between Ramses and Moses is just like a relationship we have with all our brothers. The animation in this movie is amazing. This film is not exactly as good as some other adaptations of the story of Moses, but it proves as one of the best animated films in all of history. The Prince of Egypt has a brilliant score by the composer of The Lion King, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Man of Steel, and Inception: Hans Zimmer. The Prince of Egypt has brilliant storytelling, great music, beautiful artwork and animation, and a brilliant score. This film will go down in animated movies history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Animated Version of the Book of Exodus (at least the first part)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched the previews to this movie it became clear to me that is was about Moses and the Exodus, and because of this I became more interested in seeing it. I guess my motivation was to find out how close this movie stuck to the biblical account. Indeed it does seem to stick reasonably closely, though a few things were added to make it a little more interesting, but the added things were derived from the Bible rather than created. The major addition is that Moses was Pharoah Ramses' brother, which is quite possible considering that Moses was picked up by the queen of Egypt.The movie is based on the Book of Exodus, the second book of the bible. The story is that the Jews have been living in Egypt and have been growing in number, according to the promise God made to Abraham. Fearing that the Jews would revolt, Pharoah ordered all baby boys executed, but Moses was put in a basket and sent down the Nile where he was picked up by the queen. Moses was brought up as a prince but realised that he was a Jew. One day, he killed an overseer that was beating a Jewish slave and fled into the desert where he found a burning bush. In this bush, God spoke to him and commanded him to return to Egypt and free his people. This Moses did, though he was quite hesitant. Pharoah refuses and God strikes Egypt with plagues. Finally, after the death of the first born, Pharoah tells the Jews to go and they flee, but after that Pharoah changes his mind and orders them stopped. By this time the Jews had reached the Red Sea which God parts for them. They cross and flee while the Egyptians following behind are drowned.It is a pretty complicated story but so are many of the stories in the Bible. The complication serves a purpose because this story is a reflection of what Jesus did on the cross. In a way it is an analogy that God created in history. We are slaves to our sins and no matter what we do we cannot escape. God sends a deliverer, who is Jesus, to free us from slavery. God freed the Jews in Egypt from slavery by sending Moses in to lead them out to the promised land. Jesus is sent to Earth to become a human so that he might die on the cross, thus paying the penalty for the sins we have committed. The Jews followed Moses out of slavery in Egypt just as we turn to Jesus to escape the endless cycle of sin and death that dominates our lives. Those who ignore God sin and the penalty of sin is death. A very interesting thing that we see in the movie is that some Egyptians escaped with the Jews, showing us that salvation is for everybody.In this movie we see both sides of God. Many claim that God is a vengeful God in the Old Testament, and that he is. The burning bush scene though shows us both sides of God. When Moses doubts his ability, God roars, throwing him to the ground, but then we see the fatherly side of God as he lifts Moses up onto his feet. We see the wrath of God as the mist flows through Egypt taking the life of all the first born, but we also see the mercy of God as he passes by the doors of all those who have blood on the posts. God is also shown as the protector as he raises a wall of fire before the Egyptians, allowing the Jews to flee.I guess we cannot fully understand why God did not let the Jews escape immediately, but rather sent all of the plagues; yet I guess it follows the idea that God is not only showing his mercy to the Jews but his wrath to the Egyptians. What the Jews were witnessing during the time of the plagues is that God was not only pouring his wrath out onto the people of Egypt, but he was protecting those whom he had chosen. When we look forward to the book of Revelation, we see a repeat of plagues, though they are not exactly the same. What the plagues show us is that God will pour out his wrath upon humanity, but these plagues represent the period that we have a chance to repent of our sins. We can either take the warnings of God and turn to follow him, or we can continue to ignore God's grace and face judgment and death at the end of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 2004 I saw this movie for the first time, and then I re-watched it in 2007 (and possibly again since then, I don't know). Here is what I had to say after my first re-watch:"Now, I knew this was based on something from the Bible, but I just have to say it didn't make me admire God any more than I did already. Not that I believe in God. But seriously, how can you admire a being that would happily kill off half a city's first-born children just to show them who's boss? Still, if I ignored the whole God aspect, I could enjoy the movie. And at least Moses cared about the dead kids."I would also like to add now, in retrospect, that I love the soundtrack to this movie. Hans Zimmer is an excellent composer and I pretty much always love his work. And the other songs on this soundtrack are enjoyable as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best animated films out there. Very underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This review is originally from my blog at http://samuentagareview.blogspot.com/. Check it out if you want.)I have a long history of love for this particular film, and it continues to this day. As a Christian, the story of Moses was one of those stories that is oft told in Sunday School and the likes, and deservedly so. It is one of the biggest examples of epic in the entire Bible.The Prince of Egypt is an animated Dramatic Musical that was first released in 1998, starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes and others, and is probably the most epic family movie I've seen. It kick- started my interest in Ancient Egyptian culture and history in my youth, and is to this date the best Bible Epic i've ever seen...and it's animated.The interesting thing about POE that sets it apart from other animated movies is that it doesn't bother with the dreaded 'Disney Comic Relief Characters' that are in every other animated movie, especially after The Lion King, including non-Disney movies. The issue with these characters is that they don't add much to the story, and are really just there as distractions for the kids, as to keep them entertained through the more adult story (see Hunchback of Notre Dame). Prince of Egypt doesn't do that at all, and the closest it gets to that trope are the two High Priests, Hotep and Hoy, played by Steve Martin and Martin Short, but they come across more as creepy than funny, despite their more cartoonish design, compared to the rest of the movie.But that's not to say the movie isn't funny. It has plenty of funny moments, such as the beginning with the brotherly quarrels between Rameses and Moses. These comedic moments are limited though, and the movie feels more like a musical along the lines of Les Mis, to give a recent example, than any Disney movie clone.The music is the strongest part of the movie, and the reason I think that the film will do well on a Broadway stage. The film has one of the best openings ever, in my opinion, with the seven minute 'Deliver Us' instantly saying to the audience 'This ain't a kid's movie' with the implied deaths of thousands of children. Other songs, such as 'All I ever Wanted', 'Playing with the Big Boys', and 'The Plagues', and of course, 'When You Believe,' a song that was covered by Celene Dion and Whitney Houston for the soundtrack and became a worldwide hit. The lyrics mix perfectly with the Hans Zimmer score, creating one of the most memorable soundtracks ever written.And the story is also amazing. Most everyone in a predominantly Christian or Jewish culture, whether they follow the religion(s) or not, are familiar with the Moses story, but the way the film presents it, as a tale of two brothers who are forced to be enemies by a higher power, is a very unique interpretation of the story. The fact that it's called 'The Prince of Egypt' speaks volumes about the tone of the story. At first glance, nobody would guess 'Moses' from the title, unless they knew about the film beforehand. The reason I believe it is titled that is because Moses, being raised in an Egyptian palace his entire life, would have a massive connection to the land and people, despite his heritage. Moses would've been conflicted with himself and the love for the country he was raised in, and the culture he belongs to, and the movie presents that conflict almost perfectly.Visually speaking, the film is GORGEOUS. Every single frame is made perfectly. The throne room of the Pharoh, with the statue of Seti right next to Seti's real profile is great framing. The entire movie feels huge, every picture is scaled perfectly, and the final fifteen minutes, with the parting of the Red Sea, is one of the most epic moments in animated cinema. Watching the movie just for the visuals in itself is an enjoyable experience, even to this day, and this film is fourteen years old now.So yeah, this is probably my favorite animated movie, at least right now. What my favorite Disney movie is, I get to later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another beautiful achievement from an animation studio that wants to do so much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt marks Dreamworks' second film from their animation company and the second in a row to be a big winner for its ambition, scope, and maturity. Coming off of Antz, one of the few animated films out there, I believe, would benefit adults more than children with its very pro-individualist morals. Dreamworks did a fine job of trading in silly puns for strong morals, delivered in a familiar, yet favorable way.Now comes The Prince of Egypt, a successful follow-up predicating on a similar formula with great power and craft. It tells the timeless story of Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer), beginning with his birth, when he was sent across a river during impending slave genocide to be the leading voice of the Jews. Right off the bat, this is a story that has been told time and time again, over the span of decades by the voices of competent directors and renowned auteur. Thankfully, Dreamworks spares us the drab redundancy of giving us a visually ordinary, preachy tale with minimal compelling elements. Much like with Antz, the company and crew know who's buying the ticket and who its target audience is, so the balance of entertainment and seriousness is greatly taken into effect.The one definite point of discrepancy from the film that will leave you delighted or divided is the inclusion of songs. Personally, music in animated films has become something of a standard and usually fails to distract from surrounding characters and the story at hand. However, the choice to allow musicality in a story about Moses is definitely made to take in account the young ones who will see it. Appealing to a demographic with an element of familiarity is an understandable feature, but out of place it is, seeing as this is Dreamworks' attempt to seemingly attract audience members with its increasing maturity and depth.Moreover, the artistic style presented here is simply gorgeous; crisper, more fluent, and more atmospheric than much of its competition at the time. The side of Egypt seen here is unlike any animation I've seen from the nineties. In 1998, when this film was released, audiences had already been acquainted with two beautiful Pixar films that brought forth a more attractive, glossier side to animation. This style would begin to take Dreamworks by the hand in 2004 after Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas returned modest numbers, with head Jeffrey Katzenberg stating how the attraction of traditional animation with a traditional story is rapidly dying. The Prince of Egypt possesses a style with a dark color palette and straighter outlines, with characters and scenery aspects that movie in a light that grounds them to reality. It's shockingly potent and beautiful in its representation.The Prince of Egypt has a style and an unconventionality I'd relate to Atlantis: The Lost Empire, one of Disney's biggest gambles that failed to do much but earn a cult following. Both occupy a straighter, more-sophisticated persona for animation, while creating wonderful environments and well-drawn characters with quirks and personalities we can connect with and appreciate. These are fine examples of subversive animated pictures from studios that continue to surprise with almost every film they released.Voiced by: Val Kilmer and Ralph Finnes. Directed by: Brenda Chapman and Steve Hickner</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Miracle of Music and Animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a "children's cartoon". The animated "Prince of Egypt" borrows some of the settings from Cecil B. DeMille's classic but manages to tell the story in a streamlined way in a mere 100 minutes. The musical score is a "miracle" with several excellent songs, including the Oscar-winner "When You Believe". It's a different yet respectful retelling of the Ten Commandments with half the characters and some very original ideas. In this version, Ramses and Moses truly love each other and it is a terrible twist-of-fate that Moses must destroy him to free his people. Ramses wife is not shown, but obviously exists, as the pharaoh has a son who must die because he is the first-born. It's all here: the burning bush, the serpent's trick, water turning to blood, the other plagues and the Red Sea finale. No golden calf idol, however. In this version, Moses' wife stands beside him, as does Miriam and Arron. All resemble the actors from the DeMille version. What is minimized are the backgrounds of the large edifices and monuments. It all works, however, even the contrived "chariot race" that seems borrowed from "Ben-Hur". Minor faults prevent me from giving this a "10" : Ralph Fiennes' British accent is annoying, and "slips" in a few of the key dramatic scenes. God's "voice" seems too young and not majestic enough. The fire-carving of the tablets is not depicted, although Moses comes down from the mountain with them. An impressive achievement in storytelling and with outstanding computer-enhanced animation. An excellent alternative to watching that overly-long 3 hr. and 20 minute classic version. Sadly, it's too "adult" for very young children (PG).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this not a classic aired every year around Easter/Passover?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Biblical epic I can think of that was really done from a Jewish rather than a Christian perspective. I suspect, to answer my own rhetorical question, the reason why this is not a classic aired every year is because of its yiddishkeit. Even Yemeni Jewish singer Ofra Haza (RIP) gets a chance to sing in Hebrew as part of the musical comedy format.The art style is very unique, with cushy Disney-esque animation but a different sensibility in the character and background design style. The naturalistic art style of the Egyptian "Amarna" period (the reign of Akhenaten) seems to have been a major influence.Val Kilmer as Moses is sort of meh, and of course the Evil Egyptians all have to have very theatrical British accents to contrast with the Good Israelites, who speak with a TV "Middle American" American accent.I'm sure the biblical experts will quibble with a lot of the liberties taken with the story. But basically this is a fable about the arrogance of power and how the most unlikely people can be heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of two brothers, of enslaved people and amazing visuals whats not to like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamworks animation really hit the ball on this animated feature. I saw this film when I was a young child and recently watched it again before writing this review and honestly it is a 9/10 in terms of animated movies.The characters are really good because of a mix of good voice acting and am amazing musical score to well portray the situation and the personal struggle of the protagonist Moses. This film has been compared to the 1956 classic The Ten Commandments and in a lot of ways it does itself a huge favor by giving a different perspective on the characters. This had some stunning visuals for the time still manages to impress even by today's standards granted that the film was not made that long ago but a lot of lesser visual animations are still made to this day. This is complimented by an amazing compilation done by many composers such as Hans Zimmer who added to amazing tracks that really shine in the movie.The movie is a little more adult for a children's not the sense of violence or adultery but more the themes such as slavery and religion which should be considered since it is a story about the Jewish diaspora. What really manages to captivate you is the relationship between Moses and his brother a really tragic take both characters that are almost non identical to there counterparts in the film the 10 commandments.The plot is predictable but it is based on a very widely known story so the fun in this movie is seeing how the animators and writers put a twist in the storytelling aspect.In conclusion this is a amazing animation very underrated although it is not quite for everyone but if enjoy a great and well told story with kick*** animation and awesome characters this is the movie for you a solid 7.9/10 for a movie and a 9/10 for an animated movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that cost a staggering amount of money (upwards of $70 million) and was lucky to just break even after paying distribution expenses. For some unknown reason, the script makes a large number of deliberate boners that will probably infuriate the Bible set. The first, of course, is that here we have a very well-spoken Moses, not a man that needs his brother to do his talking for him. This raises the second boner. As Aaron is not needed to do all the talking, his role is reduced even further. Aaron doesn't front up to Pharaoh. In fact, in this picture, Aaron doesn't come face to face with Pharaoh at all. And what's all this stuff about Moses being friends with Rameses? They were never boyhood chums. Moses was adopted by one of his daughters, not by Rameses himself or his dad. The way Moses is pictured is also rather odd. He doesn't look particularly Jewish, but I guess we'll have to pass that one. As it's traditional to picture Jesus as a Gentile, why not Moses as well? However, the picturization of Jethro as an overblown Santa Claus figure is really way over the top. And the uncredited voice of God is atrocious. God doesn't speak that way. Read the Bible. Moses is fearful at first, but then he settles himself down sufficiently to ask God a cunning question, namely what was His name. Moses was taught at school that if you knew a person's name, you could gain control over them. But ? as the 20th century's finest Bible scholar, Father Alexander Jones, points out in The Jerusalem Bible ? God is a wake-up to Moses's ploy and fobs him off with a jocular "I am who I am!" Now for the movie itself. True, if it's taken out of its biblical context, it is exciting, tuneful, breathless, staggering and even inventive. Definitely a must-see! In fact, you really need to see it through at least twice on the superb Dreamworks DVD (which also has lots of fascinating extras),</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt to this day remains one of the most underrated movies out there. The re-telling of the story of exodus as an animated musical sounds ridiculous but it works so well here. The way in which the story is told is so brilliant that it becomes as visually stunning as it is moving.The animation in this movie is simply breathtaking. It's a perfect blend of CGI and hand drawn animation. It uses these techniques highly to its advantage and creates scenes of incredible scope as well as fluent action and faster paced sequences. This time the story is focused on the relationship between Moses and Ramses being brothers. The journey they both go through from true brothers to mortal enemies is heart breaking. It's also down to the fantastic voice acting from Ralph Fiennes and Val Kilmer that these characters come to life. The supporting cast are also show steelers from Michelle Pfiefer, Patrick Stewart and Jeff Golblum. However without a doubt the best part of this movie is the musical score and songs. Hans Zimmer lends his always astonishing score with a middle eastern backing. The songs featured are fantastic for conveying the emotion and action and condense the story without losing important factors. After watching this movie I can guarantee you'll be humming segments of the score to yourself.All in all The Prince of Egypt is the best version of exodus and a great epic on its own. It's definitely a movie that needs more recognition to buy it, watch it and love it.</fullReview>

He would meet his sister also, but does not know it is her. The sister began to sing a song that Moses remembered from his mom singing to him when he was a baby. That set off Moses to fight for the Jews against the Egyptians who had been enslaving the Jews. He cannot stand the sight of seeing the helpless Jews painfully work. He realized being part of your real family that is poor is better than being rich in a family that is not your own. It was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Prince Of Egypt Is An Epic Animated Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt is an epic animated musical produced and released by DreamWorks Animation. It is an adaptation of the Book of Exodus and follows the life of Moses from being a prince of Egypt to his ultimate destiny to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. It was directed by Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells and Steve Hickner. It featured songs written by Stephen Schwartz and a score composed by Hans Zimmer. The film has taken the biblical story of Exodus, put it into cartoon form, and released it on the big screen as an epic animated feature.It tells the story of Moses releasing the Jews from Egyptian slavery under the hand of the evil pharaoh Rameses. The story revolves around these two close brothers, Moses and Rameses. While Rameses is groomed to take over the land, his beloved brother Moses is a carefree prankster, until he learns the true secret of his past. His secret, of course, is that he is really a Jew and as a child was floated down the river to escape mass genocide. The pharaoh Seti raised Moses as his son. Upon learning the truth of his past from a burning bush, Moses returns to Egypt with God on his side and demands that the pharaoh (now his brother Rameses) must "Let my people go." The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable as well as more humanly knowable.The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent.Finally,it is an inspiring translation of biblical grandeur, turning the story of one of history's greatest heroes into an entertaining, visually dazzling animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing, really. Dreamworks has made so many animated films, and everyone seems to forget The Prince of Egypt.It's probably because the film is one of the most daring animated films out there. It's heavily religious, it has slavery, death, and no cute sidekicks.It doesn't need many clichs, and that's what makes it excellent.The animation is unrivaled. The parting of the Red Sea is one of the best moments in animation.The story is epic, though sometimes slow. Moses is fantastic. He goes from an arrogant prince to a wise, and respected leader of the Hebrews. The film also has hope as the central theme, whether you're religious or not.My favorite aspect is the music. Han Zimmer's score is beyond compare, and Stephen Schwartz's songs are all fantastic.If you have missed out on The Prince of Egypt, don't avoid it any longer, it's well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest animated films of all time, regardless of what anyone says. A lot of people dogged Dreamworks during and 90's and still due because they're trying to "compete" with Disney. First of all they don't have to compete, because Dreamworks is definitely in the same league and this movie proves it. The music of the movie is amazing and it's what I love best about it. "Deliver Us" is such a dramatic and poised piece of music, just hearing it play as you watch the Hebrew slaves struggle, and then there is Yocheved (I think that's her name) when she sings "River Oh River". I love Ofra Haza as Yocheved, her voice is so beautiful and natural. Next song I love is what people seem to recognize the most is "When You Believe", it is a divine hymn of faith saying that even if all goes wrong, if you remain faithful, God will show mercy. The movie version which is sung by Miriam (Sally Dworsky) and Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pretty good, I especially like the break in the middle where the children sing "Ashi Ra"; but to be honest I liked the cover sung by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston more. Maybe it's because of my African American roots that prefer the gospel version instead. With that being said, the movie is full of beautiful scores but these are my favorites. The art and animation in this movie is absolutely top notch. I think it's the only film to do what it's done during time it was created. What makes "Prince of Egypt" so unique is that it blended traditional drawing and painting with digital CGI. Keep in mind that this was during the 90's so digital animation was still in experimentation, and what's surprising is how good the animation looks. It doesn't look like a blocky, pixelated mess that you would find during this era,everything looks so smooth,vivid and rich.A few notable things to point out are The Burning Bush, The Red Sea,The Plagues,the Angel of Death and the parting of the Red Sea.These are the BEST scenes in the entire movie, all digital! Last but not least , the story! Last year I watched an episode of Nostalgia Critic's Old vs. New where he decided which of the two movies, The Ten Commandments and Th e Prince of Egypt,was better. He ultimately chose The Prince of Egypt, and the thing that gave P.O.E. it's edge is the amazing storyline. The decision of the writers to make Moses and Ramses brothers instead of sworn enemies was a great move. It gives way more drama and emotion to the story because Moses goes through a constant internal struggle, whether or not to go against the brother he loves, to stay truthful to his god and his people or to continue living the life of comfort with the only family he's known and deny what he truly is. All in all this is a superb animated film for people of all ages, truly something of a masterpiece and I feel that everybody should at least watch this once if not hundreds of times (it's that good).</fullReview>

He grows up in the care of the Pharao Picard, and developing a sibling rivalry with the heir to the throne(called "the weak link" by his father, thus cementing his stubborn insistence on keeping the slaves), Rameses(Fiennes), who he's always getting into trouble with his actions, and out of it with his words. Their relationship is one solid aspect of this, and one of the only points in making this at all(they realize that a version of this was made in 1956, right? That one's gonna be difficult to top, and, other than aforementioned, this doesn't come close... maybe something eventually will, though I doubt it. Did they think that people wouldn't watch something that old? In spite of the book being 2000 years old...?). The animation is good, with a little well-done 3D. Acting is great all-round, and this is quite well-cast. The dialog is done in a style similar to the original text(...yippee...), and delivered with gusto. Some background and setup is delivered through musical numbers(two of which are horrendous, the rest of them are decent), because that's *definitely* much less obvious of a tool than exposition dumps(in case you couldn't tell, I was being sarcastic). This is paced fine enough, at about 90 minutes and with the amount it covers. I would have preferred if they didn't make the Egyptian deities out to seem like nothing other than "magic tricks". As if their faith, or any other, is any better. There is disturbing content in this. I recommend it to fans of 2D. 7/10</fullReview>

Its a pity that this brilliant movie only achieves a 6.9 on IMDb whereas other films that are in my opinion, undeserving, got more then a 7 rating. I'm aware that this movie isn't an exact retelling (which may have caused lots of '1' votes) - however all films are slightly changed from their texts.The story is set in Egypt. Moses, a Hebrew, is taken in by the Queen of Egypt - the baby boy grows up into Prince Moses - along side his brother Ramses. Moses however discovers his identity and breaks away from Ramses. After settling down, he is suddenly sent a message from good - to free the Hebrews. Moses does this after a string of misfortunes occur on Egypt. He and the Hebrews escape after the sea parts allowing them to cross it, whereas it crashes upon the Egyptians.Overall, this film is very well done. Dreamworks did a find job animating it, and creating some memorable songs ('Playing with the Big Boys Now', 'I Once Called You Brother'). The movie is fairly paced, and its entertaining and fun to watch. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Prince of Egypt - a truly biblical story - destroying Disney's rep in the process</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film itself: The Prince of Egypt is a animation in which is created with the older style drawing in which we've seen in many cartoons. This is an advantage because nowadays animation films (Disney) use a more fancy and realistic style of animation which in turn leads you to believe the film is good when actually, the story could be pretty awful. Though there are some exceptions in my opinion (toy story, monsters inc. etc.). This old style seriously complements the sub- genre of the film and portrays the story itself very well.The Message and meaning: (possible spoilers) This story is an alternate to the religious story of Moses when he is tasked by God to free the Hebrew (Jewish) slaves of the Pharaohs of Egypt of that time. This story is truly biblical in the sense that it could evermore reinforce what (unfortunate) little faith i have which can admittedly be said to have been destroyed by the 21st century's lack of tradition, respect and overly selfish views on how the world should be run. So in short this film made me feel fantastic that i have any faith inside me. Even though I'm not bound to one religion and honestly only 16yrs old i feel its necissary for me to say that this film could not have been mustered from an imagination which isn't crafted by God himself (itself).The verdict: Awesome visual take - Lovely musical interjections - Beautiful acting - Honestly mind blowing religious message - AND - (if with faith) a nice little reminder of how God works for good and in mysterious ways.Thank you - Adam - 16yr old "religiounless" believer - lol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This animated retelling of Moses' story is a piece of good, solid storytelling. But it isn't a great film, or even a memorable film in the way that De Mille's live action predecessor was. I suspect that this is at least partially due to animation being perceived as a more lightweight story-telling medium than live action, and the fact that there are a number of songs scattered through the film may also have a bearing.The storytelling is actually very good, and the animation varies from extremely good upwards (with the parting of the Red Sea being breathtaking).I'm looking backwards, remembering watching this several years ago, and the voice characterisation can be assessed by virtue of the fact that I don't actually recall any of the voices. Looking at the cast list I see that there are some big names there, and I suggest that this means they all did their jobs very well - when the identity of the actor overpowers the character, then I suspect that the casting isn't working that well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not religious in any sense of the word, so my review will be based purely on the film placed in front of me, and not on any historical inaccuracies and deviances from the actual story, or any religious implications in the film.I was blown away by this film to be honest. The story, the voice acting, the animation, it was all faultless, and though the songs took a bit of getting used to (they didn't seem to have that sweet, flowing quality I was used to seeing in most cartoon musicals) the soundtrack fits the film incredibly well, with the obvious standout song of 'there can be miracles' made famous by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. One fault I did have however was the script, which at times felt slightly awkward, but the voice actors did the best with what they had, and that small fault is completely swept away by all the great aspects this film has to offer. One of my favourite parts personally was the portrayal of the relationship between Moses and the Pharaoh, the anguish and stubbornness of both coming across well, and most importantly, the viewer can understand where both characters come from, sad that such a close friendship could be reduced to what it was. I thought the film was magical, and really look forward to watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not of the caliber of C.B.'s THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, this animated version does a fine job in recreating the story of the Passover and of the life of the second-greatest Biblical hero of all time (if you don't remember who's number one, you must have slept through way too many Sunday sermons.) At the time it was made, this was the most expensive full-length animated feature ever made. Part of the reason was the assemblage of an incredible array of vocal talent. Val Kilmer, who had previously brought rich characterization to the roles of Batman and Doc Holliday, headed a magnificent cast not duplicated in an animated feature since Disney's THE JUNGLE BOOK thirty years earlier. While this reviewer didn't think the visual elements were as good as the aural parts, the film was still very entertaining and very faithful to the narrative of the true story, some parts of which the original writer, Moses himself, would not recognize. Most of the audience at the Lidgerwood Presbyterian Church where this picture was shown may not have felt that PRINCE rates as an animated masterpiece to equal films like FANTASIA and SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS which they had seen when they were the same target age or thereabouts as for this film. Still, I would recommend this as an excellent way for children (and adults) to learn about a part of history that is still remembered as an integral part of a rite of the Jewish faith ever since, and that led to the founding of a great nation and its rich cultural heritage.

		<shortDescription>A very, very, okay animated musical, v1.10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>December 2007, I purchased four Sandra Bullock and I had expected this, from the cover, to be the least interesting. First viewing I rated it the best of the four. Ya Ya second, then Gunshy with its really nice flashes of Sandra, then Preppie. I had not realised that it is a musical, or that it is animated. I now rate Gunshy as higher. * Romantic. This has common bonds with Practical Magic in that there is dreamy romance through and through, the grit smoothed away. For me, not for everyone, as the user comments here show. This is based on a way too well known historic text. It is at risk of being grit just by it existing, yet it manages to avoid that trap and have a charm all of its own. I do not know how followers of the faiths who look to this story will understand this as it is nothing like a literal translation. It would be difficult for it to have the romantic appeal that it does to me if it was precise in that sort of way. If things had been as here, they would have crossed the desert in no time at all? With many stories I find that it gets in the way if key elements are turned upside down. This is an interesting example and I gather from the odd word in the DVD directors' commentary that they originally wanted to play it straight but decided that they had to do things this way. Having faced my own need to cross a desert, crossing still incomplete, I find the sugar of this approach to be something that I usually prefer. * I have not read so many of the user comments for this, but I do notice comments that look with horror at the warfare and genocide aspects, sympathies to Egypt. Or are they siding with Egypt? Yes and no. There are some real issues. To me, Exodus is a challenge. To me, there are real concepts of cosmic black comedy and tragedy re what people are and what their relationships with reality are. Re the genocide, for me this is part of the history that shows all ?woe- men to be brothers, behaving to each other in ways that show a family resemblance. Good ways, bad ways, plenty of genocide and fratricide ways. Hebrew, Egyptian, Lebanese, whatever. I had not expected to rate this story for just this sort of reason, yet I find that it manages to come out well, instead. It jumps a difficult hurdle and clears it. I would have thought that I needed the tangles of deeper tragedy to have been highlighted, realism, but instead this is a little kid type narrative that highlights Brothers and shows that can be okay. I honestly did not know that. Even the Egyptian priests are nothing like as often portrayed, they are little kid versions instead. * A user comment of December 2007 mentions that the film has been banned in some Muslim countries because it shows Moses' face. I show my UK non-Muslim background by interpreting that as a tragedy, that such countries are still trapped in their equivalent to Victorian times with its characteristic understanding of such as Ten Commandments and Promised Land that does not click for me at all. Early 90's I could understand that, I went that way myself. I had thought that a different approach to faith had been flowering this past few years. The negative user comments remind me of this Victorian trap too, very characteristic, if likely based on different beliefs. I can accept them as sincere. * Further, My DVD is a - flood sale ?, very affordable, Scandinavian disk and is rated age 7. If I read that as the manufacturers moving to a more solid age rating system then I like that a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review of Prince of Egypt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good that Dreamworks wanted to take a risk and make a animated feature based from the Bible. The result is "Prince of Egypt" (a little weird title, by the way), which is a watchable, epic, but also a unstable film.I'm gonna mention the bad things first; Hans Zimmer is a great composer, but the score in this movie is very dissipated.The tone of this film is too dark, too dismal and dissipated and the transitions from the light to the serious moments are too sudden.Although the character animation is great, the animators are overacting with the characters facial expressions (comparing to other animated movies where they're good at facial expressions, for example "Pocahontas").The songs are good (with exception of "Deliver Us" and "When You Believe) and Stephen Scwartz lyrics are recognizable, but I'm still considering that this movie could be better without songs, since it is a epic Bible/David Lean like film.OK, enough complaining about this picture. I enjoyed "Prince of Egypt". It has some great, epic moments, both light and dark. SPOILER: Even it takes some few liberties, it remains true to the Exodus story and it shows Moses from a more personal side. (SPOILERS OVER). The character I liked most was Tzipporah. The voice talents does a good job. The background animation is absolutely stunning. Despite some weaknesses, "Prince of Egypt" is worth watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie, so much that I bought it, but I would have enjoyed it even more if it had been more accurate, seeing as it's based on a story from the Bible.I noticed 3 things that in my opinion weren't accurate: 1. Moses was about 80 years old when he led the Israelites out of Egypt.2. There's no mention of Moses having a brother named Rameses, rather, it was a place (Exodus 12:37; Genesis 47:11) 3. In the movie, Rameses escapes being destroyed when the waters of the Red Sea return, but the Bible says that not so much as one of them was let remain (Exodus 14:26-28; Psalm 136:15) Other than that, great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the Prince of Egypt makes me appreciate what a brilliant and touching film Cecil B DeMille's classic, The Ten Commandments, was. I was glad to see that special effects of the computer animations is top rate. This film was of an important topic, yet such a terrible sceenplay and voice casting dwindled this would be classic to a mere Saturday cartoon with Moses coming across like a village idiot. If this was a musical then why does it sound like Song of the South than of the bible.Again top marks to the animators but the story line and the lack of passion from the big named stars just doesn't cut it. Danny Glover I give exception too and thought his part was well voiced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What "The Ten Commandments" could have been today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Prince of Egypt" is a treat of a film, using animation to tell the story of Moses from the time of his birth to his descent from Mount Sinai with the ten commandments handed down to him by God. It is a triumph not just on a visual level but also in its storytelling.Three decades ago we had "The Ten Commandments", still hailed today as one of the great films of the century. As a critical film it had its flaws, but it also had the commanding presence of Charlton Heston. Heston has since gone on to a less commanding presence as NRA spokesman, but the memory of his performance lives on. But what that film lacked was convincing special effects for a contemporary audience. People may have been wowed by the effects of the Red Sea parting back in the 60's but today the appearance of Heston standing in the animated water moving aside before him is less profound."The Prince of Egypt" takes the same story, and applies the magic of animation to transform it into its full glory. We see the full wrath of God brought down on Egypt in the form of the 10 plagues with a vengeance. The fluidity of water like nothing seen before in the form of the Nile. The majesty of Egyptian architecture, splayed out in a glorious profile as a backdrop to the drama. Even the expressions on the character's faces are wondrous to behold. This is a story that begs to be told in animated form. It is the first animated film from Dreamworks, and the effort they have gone to shows.It has big names for voices as well. Ralph Fiennes voices the stubborn Rameses, Patrick Stewart is commanding as his father, Seti, Helen Mirren as the Queen, Steve Martin and Martin Short as villianous court magicians, even Danny Glover as a Midan high priest. Val Kilmer has the interesting double role as both Moses and God. I hope it doesn't go to his head.Most people know the story of Moses, so I won't summarize it here. What sets this version apart from other interpretations of the story is the focus it has on the relationship between Moses and Rameses. I admired the way it emphasizes the conflict between the two, who are first seen as young men creating havoc in the streets with their chariot racing, inseparable. Later on, after Moses flees when he discovers his true origin, and returns to request the release of his people, the Hebrews, Rameses is crushed when he learns of his transformation, and hardens his heart, tragically, against the demands of Moses' strange God. This mission of Moses wasn't just about the commandments of God but his defiance of his assumed parentage, as a prince and brother to Rameses.So many movies about Biblical events are underwhelming because they have breadth of vision but lack the capacity for conveying convincingly the miraculous sights involved. "Prince of Egypt" is able to use its vision and animation to communicate these things. It is a rare achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough, but the background outstripped the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prince of Egypt tells a well-known story reasonably well, without breaking new ground at that level. Unfortunately, the action often took precedence over the story, or even over basic credibility (the chariot race scene was entirely ludicrous - it would have fit into a more comical film than this one, but was out of step with the serious themes the movie wished to explore.) Some scenes, however, were very effective - in particular, the deaths of the first-born sons.The animation was indeed impressive in some ways - the backgrounds and special effects were amazing, but the character animation did not measure up and seemed crude by comparison (for example, the animators seemed unable to properly depict characters walking or running.) As a result, the effects turn out to be stronger than the characters themselves, making the movie somewhat unbalanced at times.Rating: worth seeing once - a good film, but not a classic.</fullReview>

Compared to the graphics of Aladdin &amp; The Lion King they are more adult, realistic and therefore non-cartoon.

The fantastic opening ( Deliver Us ) set the mood for the entire movie. I remained seated, expected to see a great movie and that is exactly what i got.The music was overwhelming and the lyrics are fantastic.If you don't like this movie, stick to Tom &amp; Jerry.DreamWorks has set a new animation standard and has created a true piece of art and entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of us who believe in the story, "TPOE" is a marvelous interpretation. For those of us who don't believe, "TPOE" is still a wondrous assault on your eyes and ears. However, I would be remiss if I did not point out that there are several scriptural mistakes. For instance, Moses met Aaron in the desert, and they both went in to see Pharaoh together, not Moses and Zipporah. The pillar of fire that blocked the Egyptian's pursuit also led the Israelites out of Egypt. But these should not take away from the beauty of the film. If you look at the movie as "The Scriptures according to Dreamworks studios", you will be very disappointed. I would rather you read the first fifteen chapters of Exodus and then go watch the movie.Also, the songs can be a bit too much at times. "Playing With the Big Boys" was probably too flashy and should have been fed to the paper shredder, along with "Through Heaven's Eyes". However, the other songs are extremely important and tremendous achievement. Congrats to Stephen Schwartz for his score and especially for the songs "Deliver Us" and "When you Believe". Let's hope that the Oscar voters don't forget his work. I hope we get a chance to see Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey performing "When You Believe". Their voices were so beautiful and heavenly I almost stayed through the entire credits just to hear them finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great piece of animation, but with a highly important theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected the Prince of Egypt to be another 'run of the mill' cartoon which makes you say 'Wow, great animation!' but one which you basically forget about the next day. I was wrong.As a Christian, I fully expected the film to take the story of Moses and jazz it up out of all proportion, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story remained one of pretty much Biblical accuracy. Obviously some artistic license has to be taken to make the film more appealing to children and the non-Christian.Almost to take a swipe at Disney, the Prince of Egypt oozes fluid animation and the water effects especially are the best I've seen in a cartoon. If any producers are going to pull Disney from its perch, Dreamworks will definitely be the ones to do it. Rarely have I seen animation of this quality before.But the classy look of this film only hides its true nature as a Biblical story. The film delivers the story of Exodus admirably, with just enough humour and artistic license to keep the children interested. On a deeper, more spiritual level the film excels though. The story of Moses is not an easy one to come to grips with in the Bible and to see it brought to life on the big screen was a joy to behold. The burning bush scene was one of the most powerful, moving pieces of cinema I have experienced and the red sea scene was almost as powerful in it's own right. Obviously from a Christian viewpoint, this film couldn't have been made any better. To somebody else however, the Prince of Egypt also has so much to offer: Great animation, a cracking story and a good dose of humour. I highly recommend this film to anybody and everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad for the 8- to 10s; Scary for the under 5s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for "The Prince of Egypt," two thoughts came to mind: 1) the effects animation is brilliant but the character animation looks shoddy and 2) who the heck is this movie for? It runs above the kids but below the adults.After seeing the movie itself, two thoughts come to mind: 1) the effects animation is brilliant but the character animation looks shoddy and 2) who the heck is this movie for? It runs above the kids but below the adults.This cartoon "Ten Commandments" has three big scenes that are worth seeing on a big screen: The first is a dream sequence involving heiroglyphs that is a terrific study of textured animation. The second is the arrival of the angel of death during Passover night; it appears as a light that swoops over, under, and through the animated "sets" in much the same way as the spirits in the climax of "Raiders." The third, which everyone has seen in ads, is the parting of the Red Sea.But to get to those three spectacles, the audience has to sit through a rather pedestrian telling of the Moses story. And it has to endure some truly awful songs (confession time here, folks: I actually slipped out during a musical interlude to refill my popcorn box--something I haven't done in a theater since I was 10).And back to the character animation for a moment. The design is absolutely off-putting; every character sports a straight-edge nose that make it appear as if they have a butter knife attached to his or her face! And Mirian and Aaron (Moses' sister and brother, respectively) are dead ringers for Julia Louis Dreyfus and Jim Henson, respectively.I also hated Pharaoh's goofy magician side-kicks, voiced by Steve Martin Short. Neither funny nor sinister and yet trying to be both, they added nothing.I usually dislike remakes, so as a revamped version of the DeMille classic, "TPOE" ain't all bad. It just could have used some of the true-blue Disney talent--namely a good ear, for songs that further the plot rather than provide a refreshment break, and a good eye for design. </fullReview>

They must realize that the the basic narrative of Exodus is brought to life through this extraordinary film. Do not forget that this is a movie, and filmmakers are famous for taking poetic license. In any case, the moving images of the film and the truth behind it make "The Prince of Egypt" a masterpiece that even Disney cannot currently touch. This current version of "The Ten Commandments" makes Moses a more humanlike character. You can see the deep-seated love Moses and Rameses have for each other, and how difficult a job Moses has. Also moving is the vivid slave imagery. It was enough to drive one to tears...as was the dream sequence with the dying babies. Even with poetic license, "the Prince of Egypt" illustrates the messages of the Bible. This film is a compelling testimony to the power of God, and an excellent film for anyone to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you discover that a movie is not that good but better than you expected, sometimes you go to the movies expecting an unforgettable time and leave the theater with a "it-was-very-good-but-could-be-better" feeling. Prince of Egypt fits the last case.It's all there: the visual impact, the fantastic scenes (the one in the Red Sea is no less than wonderful), the emotions attached to a very known story, etc. But this could be the best of all the movies in animation history and it isn't.First of all, this Moses is like a shadow, he should be the soul of the story but feels like he's just passing through it; even his sister Mirian is more expressive than him. The personality of someone who has been chosen by God to free His people and, for that very reason, must throw his past away, could be much better explored.There are too musical scenes too. I know they're different from another scores, as long as they're sometimes close to an opera act, but this shouldn't be an excuse to fill almost the entire plot with them. The one in the very beginning and the last, with the made-to-be hit "when you believe", are very fine; but the one with the priests is completely strange to the movie's mood. And, worse, the part that shows the plagues is a waste of good cinematography possibilities: it's all filled with songs and music. It seems like they didn't know how to do the scene and then decided to make a musical out of it. I really don't understand why animated stories must always be entwined with that horrible Broadway style.But don't misunderstand me, you should watch this movie, and in the big screen. Although the plot is filmed mostly with a visual point of view, there are memorable scenes that can make you feel fully delighted and they're worth the price of the ticket. Otherwise, if you wait for the video, you might think this is just another one.</fullReview>

That was how the story was written in the book of Exodus; Pharoah enslaved Israel for 400 years, killed thousands of Hebrew babies, treated the Hebrews like dirt......the Angel of Death (from which Jewish Passover derives) only appears when all other attempts by Moses to free the Israelites have failed. The death of the first borns that night hardly compares to 400 years of slaughter and torture for the Hebrews.I also appreciated how, after the Angel of Death scene, Moses was not rejoicing in "victory" but rather heartbroken over what had to occur.I enjoyed this movie, despite the few discrepancies from the Bible. The animation was brilliant, the songs were beautiful, and the story was generally well told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamworks does not equal spiritual works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt is brilliantly animated, but it will be very difficult for Dreamworks to sell a cartoon for adults in an already overcrowded animated movie market. It is a rare animated movie that appeals both to kids and adults, but The Prince of Egypt, by sticking relatively faithfully to the biblical story on which it is based, doesn't even try. It's a movie for adults. No singing camels, no cute furry creatures, no Robin Williams. And Pharaoh thought the plagues were rough.I like and recommend this movie; four scenes in particular stick out in my mind. The opening 8-minute song sequence, a brilliant hieroglyphic montage detailing the Egyptian genocide of Israelite children, the 10 plague sequence, and of course the parting of the Red Sea are all superb. But the movie suffers from the conundrum all biblically based movies do. The Bible is first and foremost a spiritual document; moralizing is its whole point. Film is essentially a visual/ sensual medium. Nary the twain shall meet, Ingmar Bergman movies excepted. So to make The Prince of Egypt entertaining, its makers have emphasized the Moses/Pharoah conflict, turning it into a brotherly and familial battle. No matter its attention to details, this is essentially to miss the point.The movie also drags in the middle because it spends a lot of time with Moses in Midian, where he spent 40 yrs. after killing the Egyptian. The movie spends more time there than the Bible does, so it's unnecessary. Personally, I think the movie should have emphasized the repression and then freedom of the Israelite nation as a whole more, the central conflict revolving around culture and not family. One critic rightly said that this movie, in posterity, is likely to be admired more than loved.</fullReview>

Not only are many elements of the story disconnected or provided without causal relationships, but the characters are drawn as chisel-faced Pocohantas-types. Most disturbing, though, is the imposition of American values and thinking on ancient Egyptian culture.However, it's fun to watch and the Red Sea animation sequence is the best treatment of water in an animated movie I've ever seen.Just don't think you're going to learn a whole lot from it, but then, you shouldn't be trusting cartoons to teach too much history anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good animation, story needed work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I was a little disappointed. While some of the animation was far above standard, they skimped on 'little details' like the inbetweening, which was terrible. The CGI and standard animation were fairly well melded in most places, but it definitely could have been better. Similarly, the characters were well realized (apart from the visual design) and the voice acting was great, but the plot wasn't half as tight as it could have been, and it ended gracelessly.For the most part, I thought the vocal music was unpleasantly typical, though the orchestral pieces were excellent; I do make an exception for anything that was sung in Hebrew, which they should have done lots more of, and the very first song.I object to the Egyptian priests; the character design was terrible, the voices didn't fit their look at all, and their musical number was awful. I also think that portraying them as charlatans was the WRONG way to go; the Biblical story is much more powerful if you take the view that actual gods are contending with one another. I suppose they didn't want to confuse the children or get boycotted by those Christians who are overly sensitive. It bugged me, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic to watch, beautiful animation, attention to detail (9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give PoE 9 out of 10. It would be 10 but for the priests (and especially the "Playing with the big boys now" song) who were obvious Disney-style comic characters, and so out of place in this film. Some of the animals were also too 'cartoony'.Other than that, it was fantastic to watch (deserves the cinematography Oscar, IMO) and beautifully animated. Attention to detail was often incredible, I loved the fact that the parting of the Red Sea actually created a wind which could be seen blowing the characters' hair about. The 'acting' was well above the usual standard for animated films, my favourite example being Rameses' "I am the morning and the evening star. I am pharaoh" speech between the nine plagues and the death of the first born. In fact that whole sequence from turning the Nile to blood to Moses leaving the palace after Rameses has freed the Hebrews is amazing. I have read some reviews in the UK press which complain that the filmmakers were too cautious not to offend anyone and to avoid controversy. Without giving too much away, there are scenes in this sequence which really bring home the human cost of God's final plague on Egypt. The songs weren't as impressive individually as say, in a good Disney film, but the soundtrack as a whole worked really well.Having mentioned PoE's reviews, some comments (made here and elsewhere) have really annoyed me because they were so ill-informed. One is the common complaint that God takes a cameo role. I suggest that the reviewers read those parts of Exodus on which the film is more or less based. Those who generally complain about the film inventing events and relationships not in the Bible, should realise that actually "Prince of Egypt" is a book in its own right ("The Ten Commandments" was also based on this book). I haven't read this book, but if I was going to attack the film as an untrue adaptation in a professional review I think I would have checked the correct source text.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's little for me to say. While this isn't a perfect adaptation of the Exodus story (Aaron was actually Moses' speaker, and Moses' wife wasn't that close to the proceedings), it worked well for telling the story to those not familiar with it. Jeff Goldblum as Aaron was about as good of a choice for representing the mood of the Isreali people as could be.But that's not even close to it. The animation was something beyond anything else I've ever seen. The dream sequence in hieroglyphics was a beautiful mixing of 2-d animation within the 3-D world. The facial expressions make everything believable, but most of all, the music. Whoever scored the music deserves the Oscar right now. Every note, every beat was perfectly timed to the right mood, the right expression, and the right feeling.It was an unbelieveably powerful movie that made me laugh, cry, and ready to take over the world at the same time. I echo what others have been saying in calling this the best animated movie ever, and I'll go out on a limb and call it one of the ten best movies of any kind, ever. A definite 10/10.</fullReview>

With DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" there was not only no disclaimer, but he actually tried to pass it off as an accurate depiction of the biblical account!But just looking at "Prince of Egypt" as just a movie, I rate it better than average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've seen many animated films, and hands down this is probably the best American animated film i've seen. i do not say this lightly. the subtle nuances of the battle between the somewhat forward thinking monotheistic tradition and the old school polytheism is well played, and adds an element most will probably overlook. i believe that this film powerfully adapts the story of a man who holds a place of high esteem in 3 world faiths (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). in portraying him as a younger man it added a certain depth we usually don't see in Moses. seen as somewhat unsure at first, he is nonetheless willing to throw his world in to total chaos to stand up for right. we see him as a person, and it's very refreshing. far better than anything disney has had to offer of late. destined to be a classic if not a bestseller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We have been delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an accomplishment to see that a major movie studio has bested Disney in creating an animated motion picture that doesn't fall prey to the excessive "cutesy" tendencies that befall most animated pics. While the rest of the world, countries such as Japan for instance, has moved ahead in establishing animation as an actual art form, it is still regulated as something that enjoys only the likes of a Saturday morning audience or a weekend afternoon matinee. DreamWorks has succeeded in bringing animation to a new level of evolution in "The Prince of Egypt." While the studio has promoted the film was one intended towards mature, or adult, audiences, it is indeed for the entire family. But see it with intelligence and culture that you wouldn't have when seeing a movie such as "Mulan" or even "Anastasia." "The Prince of Egypt" never succumbs to the cliches of its animated predecessors. Others can learn from this example. I have already seen the teaser for Walt Disney's "Tarzan" and the web site for Warner Bros. "The King and I." I just hope that they live up to the fine standards POE has set for animation, because anything else after this DreamWorks epic completely bites the dust.The score of the movie has been underplayed greatly by most reviewers. However, I recommended purchasing the main soundtrack. While I haven't listened to the movie's other two albums, the main soundtrack is a thoroughly invigorating experience that not only captures the spirit of the movie, but brings to remembrance the visual details that made POE such a breathtaking experience. My favorite tracks: the powerful "Deliver Us," which opened the movie; "Through Heaven's Eyes" (movie version); "The Burning Bush"; "The Plagues"; "Death of the First Born"; and "When You Believe" (movie version). Note that many of my favorite tracks are comprised mostly of the movie score than actual vocals. Hans Zimmer has done a magnificent job of creating instrumentation that goes along with the movie, much like Jerry Goldsmith did with the "Star Trek" movies and even James Horner with "Titanic." Enjoy the movie, revel in the soundtrack. "The Prince of Egypt" will deliver you.</fullReview>

Their relationship was the catalyst to the entire movie and it was their relationship that draws you in and makes you believe in this breathtaking epic. Religion separate friends, families and lovers everyday. Faith and duty provide a silent barier between the stubborn and the hopeful.

Kudos to Dreamworks for proving to Hollywood once and for all that families will flock to a film that embraces high morals and values.I took my junior high youth group to see this film and we were truly impressed. The animation is brilliant, aside from a few "artistic liberties" the story line follows the Bible accurately.What impressed upon me the most was the producers viewpoint of the relationship between Moses and Ramses. How hard is it to do God's will over our own. I would say almost as hard as taking on Hollywood for decent entertainment. Thank you Dreamworks for being up for the challenge.</fullReview>

Now I am not saying this is not a good movie, but I repeat it is NOT for children. If you note the rating in the US is "PG". This is material not suitable for small viewers and they would be more entertained by something like "Rugrats" or maybe "A Bug's Life".Finally, someone and Maybe Disney will get the hint that adults can be entertained without cute fuzzy animals and stupid sidekicks for comedy relief. This is not Charlton Heston in "The 10 Commandments" for which I was glad, but of course it is the same story. It brings Moses and Ramases to human level instead of making them "so lofty they could **** marble" to quote "Amamdeus". The musical score was excellent and so were the songs, but I kept thinking of "Pocahontas" (Stephen Schwartz wrote the lyrics for that). Schwartz used a lot of the same musical techniques as he did in "Pocahontas", and I wished he made them different. Also some of the female characters reminded me of Pocahontas, I guess Dreamworks couldn't be a bit more original with their character design. The effects were truly unique and I enjoyed the details with which a lot of the backgrounds and small details were completed. Yes, I am a Disney fan and yes, "Prince of Egypt" was good, but I didn't come out of it with any kind of excitement for any part of the film as I did with "Anastatia" or "Mulan".Again it was good, but wait until the next Disney or Pixar film.

Only "The Lion King" and "Aladdin" could compete with it, in my opinion.Good points: Unbelievable animation (hieroglyph dream, pillar of fire, and the parting of the Red Sea come to mind), great cast (which is pretty obvious), good story (not much credit to DreamWorks, since I'm talking about the plot).Bad point(s): Seemed a little too short. I left the theatre craving more. (kinda stupid, I know)Remaining points: The music is the only thing that I was a little indecisive about. It was good, but not as good as songs from "The Lion King" and others. Still, there's good chance for an Oscar for "When You Believe". (Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey sing it better than the people in the movie)Bottom line: This was an excellent movie that I would recommend to anyone. It seems to be directed at an older audience, but it still appeals to everyone. Great work by Jeffrey Katzenberg and DreamWorks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no way any animated film could ever beat my favorite of all time, "Beauty and the Beast." But Disney should be worried. Dreamworks has done a great first attempt in making an animated movie. I am more sentimental than most people and was obviously touched by the characters in this movie. Of course, if you've watched "The Ten Commandments," you will see many similarities. The songs are even catchy, composed by former Disney hires Hans Zimmer(The Lion King) and Stephen Schwartz(Pocahontas). It is a much darker film than most Disney films, but never as dark as "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." It only lacks humor which it makes up with drama. It's a movie for the older generation.</fullReview>

However, with Saving Private Ryan, and now Prince of Egypt, Speilberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen seem to have gotten their act together. However, I still feel that they could have done a better job with Prince of Egypt. The Animation was awesome, and the talent behind the characters was good as well. However, the story seemed a bit lacking, and although they approached it with the appropriate seriousness, it just didn't seem as powerful as Moses' story could be.The singing was dry, and sometimes just didn't seem like it fit. Perhaps, like Disney, it might have been better to have found separate talking and singing voices. Also, it seemed like the movie borrowed a lot from other movies. There was a distinct "Lion Kingness" &lt;Katzenberg and Zimmer?&gt;, and certain scenes just felt borrowed. However... the animation, again, was just purely amazing, like nothing I've seen before. And Moses' dream, where the hieroglyphics come to life, was breathtaking.Dreamworks has made a good start with animation with Prince of Egypt, and the movie is really good, however, it seemed to lack a complete feel of its own, and a feeling of completeness. I cannot say it parred with the Disney glory streak &lt;Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King&gt;, but hey, I don't think anybody &lt;including Disney&gt; will EVER be able to do it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a spiritual film, it lacked spirituality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with a notice stating that the story is based upon the Biblical book of Exodus. Yet for such a spiritually charged picture, the Hebrew God was portrayed as a background character if anything. It left me and many others left with the question "What about God?".To be fair, if a movie takes on spiritual content for any religion, be it Christianity or Muslim or Buddhism, it should accurately portray the God or Gods which they worship. Otherwise what we end up with is a watered-down, "feel-good" movie. And unfortunately, 'Prince of Egypt' suffers this syndrome, though it patches over this by superb animation.I liked the burning bush scene, the awe and reverence, and the childlike-exuberance that filled Moses after he talked with God. The character of Moses is a wonderful, heart-wrenching hero.Yet for the plagues, and for the flight of the Hebrew slaves, God was absent, though in Exodus he was present as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. His only presence is through the 'magic wand'-like tool which Moses wields and the people treat as a source of wonder. Even in the end, there is no voice of God telling Moses to part the sea, but Moses parts it through his own reasonings. So, where is God? It would appear that he was axed from "his very own movie".I applaud DreamWorks for taking on such a film, and executing it in such a breathless display of animation. I'm only disappointed that for a movie with so much heart, it lacked so much soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All year long, we've heard how fantastic the animation and music in THE PRINCE OF EGYPT (the second animated film from the fledgling DreamWorks company in one year) would be. How unlike anything else we had ever seen it would be. How...well, you get the picture.It started out wonderfully. (I believe the name of the song is "Deliver Us") Ofra Haza, who provided the interesting Egyptian background to "Pump Up the Volume" by one-hit-wonder Marrs over a decade ago) was moving as Yocheved, mother of the infant Moses. And the animation was immense, sprawling, fabulous!!!But just past the chariot race (the film's second big animation scene) it started losing a lot of what the opening sequence had promised us. Facial features on the adult Rameses looked more like cheap television animation than state of the art computerized animation. The music was...well, boring. And I'm sorry but Tzipporrah looked a little too much like Disney's Pocahontas for my comfort--in fact, her entire outfit looked more Native American than it did Midian.This is not to say there were not moments that took my breath. The parting (and crossing) of The Red Sea was amazing. And the animation and song during which the hand of God smote the Egyptian empire (er...the plagues, that is) was nothing short of flawless.See this movie, yes. But remember, Disney's done animation longer and better, and unless Dreamworks comes a long way soon, Disney will continue to dominate. And also, make sure you read the real story of Exodus and don't take Hollywood's word for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great story of the book of Exodus in the Bible. Val Kilmer as usual does a great job of the voice of Moses. The songs are typical Disney fare. The movie has a PG rating, yet my 9 and 6 year olds were entranced by the film. I could not figure out why not a G rating. Charlton Heston would have been great as the voice of GOD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning, yet still remains a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the people in the first wave to see this movie on Friday. I expected it to be a great movie, but nothing compared to Cecil B. Demille's classic, the 1956 movie Ten Commandments. In one sense I was right. It was ten times more visual than the original, and also managed to keep a great story line. Some critics call it a religious movie. Well, almost every religion could enjoy the story, whether your full devoted christian or the most hardened aethiest. Along with a visual extravaganza and an awesome story, it is backed by an all-star cast: Val Kilmer as Moses and the Voice of GOD, Jeff Goldblum as his brother, Aaron, Sandra Bullock as his sister Miriam, Patrick Stewart as the great Pharaoh Seti, Ralph Fiennes as the even greater pharaoh Ramses II, Michelle Pfieffer as Moses's wife, and many other talented actors, including Danny Glover, Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Helen Mirren. I strongly urge you to go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's about time that someone wrote a review that is "true". I'm not going to say my opinion and crap like that. I'm right, well maybe not totally, but much more than some of the people on this board. The Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest films ever made. It has a wonderful take on Exodus, it is currently better than any anime movie, Russian animation, Disney or even a live action one like Titanic. I had Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan and Shindlers list at the top of my list. They are straining to stay there after I have seen this. Yes Disney has died. I'm sorry to all of you stupid side kick fans, this is it. There is no other way to put it.As far as animation goes, eyes dialate, they bounce like real eyes, they twinkle. Hands move, habits develop, expressions show things words do not There are no Val Kilmer or Sandra Bullock, there is only Moses and his sister. This is a movie where the writing and production go beyond the stars involved.The music is large in scope and you will sing certain songs over and over. "The river, flows softly...flows softly for me..."S*** like that. Also, parents out there who Brought kids to jurrassic park expecting Barney will have similar reactions from their kids in this one. There is death and torture in this folks.Also, those who came from this movie thinking it crap should question themselves, not the movie. If you cannot get into this you are one of those who say "oh it's just a movie" well you should take in hand that not everyone thinks the same as you and you need to stay in a rubber room for a while.

Overall I though it was a good movie, much in the spirit of Disney. The only thing that bothered me was that the animation was a mix of techniques, going from bad to dead right gorgeous (the hyroglyphs animation, the water in the basket scene, the open the red sea scene, etc...).

		<shortDescription>An Animated Feature to be enjoyed by both children and adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I saw the film at a preview in Randolph (stadium seating, which adds to your viewing pleasure immensely) and with a theatre full of children. There were lots of songs by well known R&amp;B Artists (Mariah Carey, Boys II Men, Whitney Houston etc.) The visuals were really beautiful, detailed and flowing - the story was very very inspiring - the film opens with a note that it is based on the story of Moses to be found in the book of Exodus in the Bible and that many people of many faiths of the world are inspired by the story of Moses' life and faith. The movie does not show evey single detail of Moses' life but the heart of the story is there. Val Kilmer's Moses the rebel and Ralph Feinnes' Rameses the young pharoah were perfectly cast; I thought the artwork on Zipporah, Moses' wife was beautifully realized as a portrait of Michelle Pfeiffer, as was Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Moses' sister -- kudos to Dreamworks SKG. I'll see this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On 98/12/15, I saw "Prince of Egypt" under unique conditions: at the Academy's own superb theater, with a professional audience which included the producers. The reaction was decidedly mixed, in keeping with the film itself. There were peaks of artistic illustration, technical effects, and expressive acting perhaps never before seen either in an animated feature or in a religiously themed American studio film of any type. There were also mediocre songs; gratuitous moments of cartoony cuteness; distracting and all-too-recognizable star voices for ill-defined, anachronistic secondary characters. The result was, in a word, uneven, with strikingly good and dismayingly bad things occurring not only in adjacent scenes, but often simultaneously.If all this sounds like what Katenberg (and Spielberg) always do, or so I believe -- attempt A+ work with at best B+ talent, judgement, and consistency -- and if you agree with that assertion, then you'll find this film well worth seeing, but far from the timeless masterpiece that its provenance and subject will likely cause mass-market reviewers to proclaim.In Katzenberg's best films for Disney, and now with "Prince of Egypt" we are watching a revival of the impossible dream of "Fantasia" -- feature-length animation which is brave, artistic, serious, entertaining, popular, and profitable -- all at once. That's more than most "live" films ever attain, including the junk which occupies each year's list of top grosses and top awards. I hope that this film is a big hit worldwide, that SKG reinvests the profits in even braver animated projects, and that someday we remember "Prince of Egypt" as a significant milestone along the way to masterpieces done in styles, and with tools, we can't even name yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writing the plot summary for this movie was not easy at all, as I tried to avoid any conflict with other beliefs on this, our, planet. The dramatic storyline and the technical details make this film into a very interesting, entertaining and fascinating adventure. For those who want to learn about the actual persons or events, whose existence - according to individual belief - may be doubted or may be proven, this film gives a solid background information about the Hebrew's flight from Egypt. Detailed information about this kind of (hi)story cannot be given in a movie at all, because a movie always is a interpretation of an event. In this case, this movie even is an interpretation of an interpretation. So those, who are offended in their belief by this film, should think about how they do interpret this themselves. The Prince of Egypt is a beautiful, emotional, dramatic movie (partly too kitschy/corny for me) in exactly the way the Life of Brian is a funny comedy about a guy born at the wrong time in the wrong place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Prince of Egypt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen a trailer for this animated feature from DreamWorks productions, I knew the basic story, and one or two of the stars providing their voices, I just had to watch it. Basically years ago Pharoah Seti (Patrick Stewart) commands all male Hebrew babies by drowned, and a desperate mother places her's in a basket, going down to the river, to be found by the Queen (Dame Helen Mirren). Years later, Moses (Val Kilmer) has grown up as brother and heir to the thrown Rameses (Ralph Fiennes), but they are to be split when Moses discovers his true heritage. After fleeing the city, Moses finds himself living with the Hebrews, and then he is spoken to by God, who gives him the task as the messenger to bring freedom to the Hebrews. So Moses tries to make Ramese see sense and free his people, and as long as he keeps refusing, Egypt will be plagued by a number of curses, including the sea turned to blood, frogs and locusts all over the place, etc. Eventually, after the death of his son, Rameses allows the people to have their freedom, only to be charging towards them with his army, and they only get away when Moses drives his staff into the Red Sea and parting the water, a cool scene. Also starring Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah, Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Jeff Goldblum as Aaron, Danny Glover as Jethro, Steve Martin as Hotep and Martin Short as Huy. The cartoon may have a similarity to Disney, but it is still very good, combined with a little computer animation, an intriguing biblical story. It won the Oscar for Best Song for "When You Believe" - sung by Pfieffer, and released with singers Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey (it was also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Music for Stephen Schwartz and Hans Zimmer. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Exodus of the Bible, this animated thriller brings you the story of Moses, and the freedom of the Hebrews from slavery. Excellent animation, and wonderful moments, especially the one where they go to the banquet and when Moses meets God in the form of the burning bush. I must say, they really depicted this from the Bible very accurately without causing any controversy at all, and without messing anything up, it's perfect for the religious ones, even to those Non-Christians or Non-Jewish people, and even to those not belonging to any religion at all, it's wonderful story and not to mention the songs in it. They were beautiful and memorable, I like also the song at the beginning when the Egyptians were gathering the Hebrew children, I also like the ones when the ten plagues occurred, and the one when they were finally leaving Egypt. That was wonderful. And not to say the least, the scene with Red Sea, when they were crossing it, the special effects were great. Recommended to the whole family, especially religious people, and you don't have to be Jewish or Christian to watch and enjoy this. Just watch it, it will amaze you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best movies ever made. I've seen many movies of all different genres and this is definitely one of my favorites. The story is that of Moses from Exodus. It's really objective and there's no favoritism (except for the obvious the-Egyptians-are-the-bad-guys part). I guess you could call it a "childrens movie" but really it's not. I don't really think children would understand the "deeper meaning" as much. The music is nothing short of glorious. I'm a musician and Handel couldn't have come up with better choruses. The only song I'm not really fond of is "You're playing with the big boys now". Well, it's really good for the scene, but melody-wise, it's OK. Someone said the music was unnecessary, but I completely disagree. It adds so much to the movie and to the telling of the story. I absolutely adore The Prince of Egypt and if you're looking for an amazing animated movie, go with this one because you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute movie, but hardly accurate (caution-spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prince of Egypt" was a cute movie as Disney movies go; beautiful animation, an amazing array of celebrity voices and a classic score. Unfortunately, for those of you wishing to give your children an accurate portrayal of events this movie falls flat on it's face. In what I can only assume to be an attempt to maintain political correctness, ghastly changes were made to the storyline. A few I can excuse as artistic vision, but the following cannot be overlooked. Moses was seen knocking a guard (who was beating a slave)off scaffolding, and it was made to seem an accident. Moses in fact knew exactly what he was doing when in a fit of temper he killed a man with a blow to the head from a rock. Later in the movie when we see Moses returning to Egypt to command Pharoh to let his people go, he is accompanied by his wife. More accurate, would be showing Moses talking to God telling him he had a weak mouth, and could not speak; therefore God tells Moses to take his brother Aaron with him to speak instead. And finally the end...when the Lord closed off the Red Sea no Egyption was spared, Ramsese did not safely land on a rock only to curse Moses after the Hebrews crossed. I think it's wonderful Disney chose to tell a biblical story, and I think more should be done, I only wish those who make the movies carry out their responsibility to provide a truthful and accurate story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film History's Most Underrated Animated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most moving animated films ever produced. More a story about the tragic fall of the loving relationship of two brothers than a retelling of the biblical story. I've read complaints about the story's inaccuracies compared to what's in the Bible, and all I can say is "so what?" From the beginning we're told that artistic licenses were taken with the story. I first saw it two years ago, and after the first viewing, it sent me scrambling for a Bible to read the actual story in Exodus, which I had never read. Whether you're religious or not, this telling of the story has many powerful messages.I don't mean to make it sound dour or boring. In addition to the dramatic elements, the film is lively, funny, and technically astonishing. The color palette is extraordinary, there is good use (but not overuse) of CGI, and it has a haunting musical score. Voice acting is first rate, and it also should be noted that as far as the songs are concerned, there is NO FILLER--all the songs are noteworthy.For those interested, this is also a reference quality DVD as far as video is concerned. The clarity of the anamorphic widescreen presentation rivals that of Pixar's DVD's, including Monster's Inc. and A Bug's Life, two of my favorites for judging video quality. The audio includes an excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital track which, although not a Dolby Digital EX or DTS ES track like many newer DVDs, is lush throughout and bone rattling when it's supposed to be. It definitely will show off any HT system.</fullReview>

On the contrary, even though the animation is interesting, the music is bland at best, proving Stephen Schwartz' music is the most uninspired he has produced in years, ranging from unmemorable to laughable and pleas, a Whale in the Dead Sea?

		<fullReview>Thrilling as far a special effects, animation and music but seriously, I thought this was going to be a movie about an Egyptian prince. Moses was a Hebrew so therefore he is NOT a prince of Egypt. And its the same thing with the Ten Commandments. Since when is Ramses the II the Pharaoh in the Bible? The Bible surely doesn't say and the if images of the Hebrews appear in Egyptian records, well so do Anatolians, Sumarians, and Nubians. Ramses had a big empire, y'know? It is also said that Egyptians didn't have slaves, only peasants who came to work on temples when the Nile was flooding. If it has to be Ramses the II, then where are his wives and one hundred children? And that scene where Moses looks at the wall painting of his family after he met his real siblings...well the painting has been altered from the depiction of earlier Pharaoh Akhenaten, Queen Nefertiti and three of their daughters (Akhenaten was a monotheist who nearly destroyed the Egyptian empire, just so the filmmakers know). Why can you see pyramids if this thing is taking place in Thebes? Anyway, I'm not trying to diss the Exodus, but they shouldn't be dissing Ramses the II and the High Priests of Ra in the first place!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunday School Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the spectacular nature of Exodus, the dramatic structure of the story and the professionalism of Dreamworks, it would be surprising if Prince of Egypt wasn't a success at some level. Almost from start to finish the animation is impressive, the soundtrack ethnic and grandiose, the voice talent effective and varied.. but .. but, for this viewer at least, it ultimately proved less satisfying and exciting than I hoped. Perhaps one problem is the familiarity of the story. By opting for what is essentially a conservative retelling of a famous Biblical epic, Dreamworks made me pine for a deviation from the well trodden path, a sense of provoking imagination and adventure, that was all often missing. Ironically for me, the most refreshing part of the animation came in the only real departure from Biblical tradition. Moses' 'hieroglyphic dream' was so amusing, witty and unexpected that, by it's presence, it ultimately showed just how Sunday School-bound the rest of the production really was. And heresies of heresies, when God finally spoke to Moses during the burning bush incident, my mind fled unbidden Monty Python and The Holy Grail - but that's probably just a personal thing.This is a strange, patchwork Egypt to watch as well; but perhaps historical accuracy wasn't of prime concern to the background artists. Here we have the temple of Karnak and the pyramids (in reality built thousands of years and miles apart) all in one grand vista; there we have a hodgepodge of Sphynx, statue and slaves plonked down to look pretty, dramatic, but without real rhyme or reason; now and again Rameses frames his noble features against the arrange of cross-dynastic images lined up behind him - did Ancient Egypt really look like this, a trans-dynastic smorgasbord? A bit more research, a shade more historical perspective would have gone a long way. If Dreamworks produce a film on the ancient Brits, lets hope that learn a lesson and at least keep Stonehenge and Big Ben in different shots!Having said all, what remains is undeniably spectacular, although I for one felt short changed when the Plagues were telescoped and rushed through, thereby losing a lot of animation potential. And perhaps I miscounted, but weren't we one or two Plagues short? Highlight of everything, of course, is the parting of the Red Sea which, leaving aside the logical absurdities of the original story, is very impressive as done here. The brief glimpse of whales (yes, whales in The Red Sea - but we'll let that pass) provided another rare, imaginative touch. But why no fish flapping under the feet of the fleeing Hebrews? On the music side, I was impressed by the opening and Exodus music, although 'You're Playing With The Big Boys Now' seemed trite and sub-disneyesque in the carrying out. But it's the parting of the Red Sea that, as it must do with this story, remains with me the longest . The sense of awe on Moses' and friends' faces at the passing events suitably reflected the effectiveness of this grand finale, as well this viewers own pleasure. I reflected then how far animation had gone in dramatic style and effect over recent years. It's a shame that script work, daring and invention hasn't managed to keep up with the other miracles on offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets face it, if someone would try to convert me into any christian religion by recommending this movie to see, i would stay an Atheist., because this movie presents such a disturbing violent version of God, that i cant help wondering in some moments, ...if the Bible realy depicts God like this...why would i want to worship such cruel being ?...And compared to this God, whats wrong with the Devil ?! In this story, God acts like a racist by choosing a favorite group of humans, takes the life of innocent people including children just because theyre Egyptian, acts like a dangerous squizofrenic entity, who has sudden burst of uncontrolled rage, threatens people to death like when he first gets angry at Moses , and Wow, people watching this movie dont even seem to care or take notice of this... Its like its ok, because God is the good guy. Excuse me ?!!... God in THE PRINCE OF EGYPT is presented in such a tyrannical and cruel way, that the Devil could have taken an extended vacation. This movie poses some real interesting questions, and none of this questions is a good publicity to any Christian religion, when most of them believe such tale to be true. Its because of this type of Biblical stories that im an Athiest. I dont want nothing to do with such a demented God figure, and i cant understand people who think this is the most beautiful movie, because it perfectly depicts one of the great stories of the Bible. Whats so beautiful about a God killing people at random just to protect a bunch of chosen people, and all this, after making that same "favorite" people also suffer for plenty of time...Then God blames the Egyptians, and murders everybody at will ?!!! What is this , a screenplay for RAMBO IV, written two thousand years ago ?!!!I went to see this movie about three times, and of course i loved the animation, the drawings are brilliant, the voice casting is great, and the soundtrack is perfect. I dont think anyone can point a technical flaw in this movie. Truly one to recommend to animation fan. But i cant help thinking THE PRINCE OF EGYPT its not the best film to convert anyone, ( although i doubt that was ever the intention of course). Ive listen to many comments after the movie, and even little kids were asking their parents, why was God so evil !! Many kids had trouble to understand why God murdered the son of Rameses for example. Frankly i keep making the same question...If this was an Hollyood screenplay and not something based on an actual Bible tale, i can bet it would be considered a very incoherent story, at minimum.So this is why i think this movie is so hard to classify. Its a brilliant achievement, but on the other hand, i dont find it that appropriate for children because its extremely violent altough the makers try to completely disguise it through out the whole film, under a very politically correct "cover" , that God is the good guy and Rameses the bad guy...hmmm ?!!This is a very good movie, but at the same time, its a very uncomfortable one, if you think about it.Its something like a brilliant movie with a very stupid and bad plot, which curiously was not even imagined in Hollywood today, but somewhere else a long time ago... Oh, and im sure if God exists, i doubt that he as such squizofrenic personality as it is depicted in THE PRINCE OF EGYPT.Hey, maybe HE should sue somebody ! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular effects; ponderous pacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film definitely displayed some visual innovation. Some of the effects were rather awe-inspiring. However, the movie didn't really deliver on other accounts.The character animation left something to be desired for one. Elongated faces, shortened foreheads, stork thin legs - heck, Seti looked like a stork). Expressions seemed to exist largely of characters looking shocked and amazed and little else.The choice of story is a bit odd and some of it doesn't make much sense to me. The Hebrew God didn't seem any less of a wrathful God to me than in the Old Testament and he seemed largely to be jerking Moses and the Hebrews around. I guess the story was a bit too un-secular for my tastes.I couldn't dig the musical numbers at all. The tunes were forgettable and the lyrics were ridiculous. Ugh. Even the worst of the Disney songs don't approach the sheer awfulness of PoE's musical numbers.The most annoying aspect of this movie was its pacing. Settings and situations were over-established, people looked at each other for long stretches and moments of grave import went on too long. One instance is just before Moses parts the Red Sea. I guess the thinking is since this is a big moment, it demands that Moses must pause dramatically and look around doubtfully. I can think of no other reason for his doing this. Still, the actual parting of the Sea was extremely well done.Overall, to give this a Siskel/Ebert type rating, I give it a thumbs up for effects animation and thumbs down for character animation, music and pacing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvelous story, and a great DVD presentation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review of the home DVD version, Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.The story is well-known by most. It is based on the Biblical Old Testament accounts, the story of Moses and his leading the people out of slavery in Egypt. Being a believer certainly makes the story come even more alive, but is should be enjoyed by all. The format is a "musical" where key songs amplify the story.PICTURE: It is just flawless. Since the whole movie is animation, it may make us think of cartoons and bright colors, and The Prince of Egypt is anything but. Where colors should be muted, they are. Everything comes across very realistic. Watch the special feature "making of" and you'll understand how they were able to do this so well.SOUND: Again, just flawless. When called for, the 5 channels of surround sound are used very effectively. At other times, all you hear are the front. It is mixed just right.EXTRAS: It is almost a 'given' that modern DVDs have "extras", and this one is no exception. There are several, but the "making of" is the one I enjoyed most. You get to see the actors recording parts of their script, and you hear them tell how the movie affected them. You also see the new animation techniques used to create the realism in such scenes as the chariot race or the parting of the water. The "extras" alone are worth renting or owning this DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the comments from some of the less learned of the critics of this movie, this movie is not only great animation but actual truth, as proven in Egyptian as well as Jewish historical records. All 10 plagues were displayed to a very moving song with wonderful imagery. The two faces of Rameses and Moses superimposed over each other was one of my favorite parts.The music was not flat and droning, but reflected the actual culture and time period of the movie. It was well-chosen and flowed nicely with itself. The way to tell a great soundtrack is how every song seems almost alike and reflects the culture/age of the movie's setting. This movie would not be the same great movie if it was played with Backstreet Boys or Madonna. It would not seem as real to the viewer. I was especially awed by the flawlessness with wich the cartoonists captured the racial characteristics of the ancient Hebrews. Their portrayal of the great and most powerful GOD Yaweh was as close to truth as I think I will ever see in a cartoon. This was a beautiful movie, and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blood, death, revenge and doubtful miracles. I don't imagine that is a thing still believable after 3400 years. Egyptian civilization depends on more objective facts. In 1300-1400 Before Christ slavery is a reality for all the world. But the known Egyptian documents show no evidence of Hebrew slaves. There were workers whom the Egyptians paid. Should there be no workers? There are still millions. I would prefer to watch a more objective, less Jewish, less musical, more serious film. Because Moses is a great person who is accepted a prophet in the Koran and the Bible who cannot be imprisoned in some doubtful miracles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was weird......the first time I saw POE I was dragged to the theaters by my older sister because she read the reviews of the movie and she had high expectations. I expected another poor animated movie (like Disney always puts out), but was amazed when I saw Moses' mother put him into the river. After the powerful opening song "Deliver Us" and beautiful characters and scenery, I was glued to the screen. The hold story was told so perfectly and so wonderfully that I am amazed that I was so stupid as to think that I wouldn't like it. When the life was taken from each first born child I was in complete and utter awe. It was so wonderfully eerie and mystical that it was exactly the way it should be. The parting of the Red Sea was magnificent! When I saw the big whale in the water I thought that it was just made up, but later my sister revealed to me that people actually saw the fish swimming around in the wall of water. Breathtaking is the only word for that movie! I know what my new favorite movie is and it's not "A Bug's Life!" It's definitely "The Prince of Egypt".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible animation and beautiful music catapult this film to the Best of 1998 list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps the best animated musical film I have ever seen. Dream Works has done what no one would have suspected-- beat Disney at their own game. Sure there are a few "formula" moments-- like the humorous villains singing a tune. But then there are many more "break the formula" moments-- no cute singing animals, and the use of Hebrew prayers in several scenes, to name a few. The animation is incredible, especially during the chariot race sequence and the parting of the Red Sea. The voice-overs are flawless. The story is simplified but the film does not play down to the audience-- the horrors of slavery are shown and emphasized. The music is beautiful, especially the opening number, "Deliver Us". I predict 2 Oscars for the music alone. One of the best films of 1998. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PRINCE OF EGYPT had a wonderful opening and closing - but that was it - the animation was beautiful and all - but when will people learn that what makes Disney films so good is their storytelling? Even their lesser films like POCAHONATAS told airtight stories that had been processed and processed. And their recent MULAN showed infinately more depth than PRINCE OF EGYPT or ANASTASIA. After the first 15 GOOD minutes of PRINCE OF EGYPT, it goes flat and we no longer believe in the characters - development is cut short and we are bombarded with bad songs and voice acting that can't compare with Disney's (though sometimes it recalled the bad job of POCAHONTAS in it's deadpan delivery - but at least POCAHONTAS wasn't boring, found its audience, and had BRILLIANT songs - alas, PofE has two)Don't bother seeing PRINCE OF EGYPT - just because it's based on the bible doesn't mean it is good at all. Religious people are so quick to embrace anything that spreads their message it is sad. You'll never see Disney stoop so low.This story was done better in TEN COMMANDMENTS - I'd say the film was rushed, but it felt longer than TEN COMMANDMENTS - a dead hour, I'm serious.</fullReview>

At the end, after all the credits have run, three verses of scripture, from the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Koran are displayed. Sadly, most people have left by that time. These should have been placed at the beginning or, at the very least at the beginning of the end credits. Otherwise, kudos to Mr. Katzenberg and his crew for a wonderful, entertaining, educational, and yes, amazingly, spiritual film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great potential, but not quite there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a trailer for this film, and part of the making for the film, I had high expectations. I was even prepared to finally admit that a non-Disney studio could produce a work that could compare itself to a Disney great.Frankly, I was disappointed. I found the movie slow in parts, and the songs were mainly boring. I found the voice talents worked extremely poorly, and it took me a while to become accustomed to the wide range of accents which the characters assumed, and which did not quite fit together. Perhaps other studios need to take a look at how Disney casts voice talents - ie. cast actors for the TALENTS in the role, rather than the mere fact that they are Hollywood stars.The worst element of the film to me was the inclusion of the two magicians of the King. They were completely out of place, and during their musical number, their repetition of the phase "You're playing with the big boys now" annoyed me almost to the extent that I wanted to walk out of the film.Aside from all the bad, some of the effects (esp. parting of the sea) are visually spectacular. But aside from these effects, this film offers little else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Subject Matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Prince of Egypt" is certainly top-of-the-line animation. Drawing, display, characterizations, music, voices; they're all very good and up to Disney quality. What kills "Prince of Egypt" is the story DreamWorks chooses to tell; that of the Book of Exodus of the Old Testament. For many this is Holy Scripture, and not an apt subject for light-hearted animation. What is off-putting to me is the grimness of much of the Moses story. This is not a malleable piece of fiction like Tarzan, Aladdin, or Hercules. These are easily molded to provide the goofy sidekick, singing friends or ghastly villains. Exodus cannot be so changed, and much of the story is very savage; the mass murder of infants, plagues, legions of slaves, and whole armies swallowed up by the sea. There's no getting around this. But still DreamWorks tries for the perky animation with accompanying music, and then tries to tell the story straight up, infanticide and all. Didn't work for me, sorry. I suggest sticking with Disney.</fullReview>

Film critic Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter is right in proclaiming "It's sophisticated, both intellectually and morally!" When Jay Carr of The Boston Globe laments that "I wish DreamWorks had been more truly daring instead of merely competitive and worked a little longer at evolving a drawing style that departed more radically from the Disney house style than this film does." it is obvious Mr. Carr totally missed the glory of this feature-length animated production. I humbly pray Mr. Carr has turned to, or turns, to our Lord Jesus Christ for Salvation at some point in his life on earth. Mr. Carr will then be able to reevaluate 'The Prince of Egypt' and find merit, not fault. I commend Jeffrey Katzenberg (executive producer) for persisting in having this epic animated film made.

		<fullReview>Prince of Egypt was a good movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The animation was good, and visually interesting. The basic plot was alike to that of the Exodus story. I also appreciated the feeling behind Moses' character. He struggled with God's request to save his people. He felt for his brother, for his people, and even for suffering Egypt.However, there were a few points where the movie fell short of my hopes.First, many plot details were changed. In the bible, Ramases is never named as Moses' brother. On the other hand, it added needed emotional conflict to the film. Therefore, making Pharaoh Moses' brother is almost justified. However, there is no reference to Moses' meeting his wife before he ran from Egypt in the bible. This part of the story I was unnecessary and dis-likable. Dialogue does not match the bible, but there is little in the actual story, so this is understandable.Second, some of the music was cheesy. Each song got across a main idea, but some lacked flow and beauty.Third, some of the dialogue are awkward.In conclusion, I will say that the movie is better for a younger audience, but if you do not judge the movie to eagerly, you too will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A captivating adaptation of Exodus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let's make one thing clear. You don't have to be religious to enjoy "The Prince of Egypt." You don't even need to be familiar with Exodus. The writers wisely give the story a human element, focusing on the concepts of family, community, purpose, and pride.The animation in this film is fantastic; the emotion of the characters is extremely detailed in their faces and in their bodies. The camera angles are brilliant and add dramatic effect.Several difficult scenes from the Bible stand out here for their awe and their delicacy, including the "burning bush" and the passover sequence. The other plagues are shown through montage, as they are not the main point of this adaptation.There are only two main characters: Moses and Ramises. As they grow up, we watch their brotherly bond grow. Clearly, they are closer to each other than to their father, the Pharaoh. But when Moses finds out he was "adopted" and is really a Hebrew, he starts to question all that surrounds him. Ultimately, of course, this winds up in Moses demanding Ramises (the new Pharaoh) to let his people (the Hebrew slaves) go. The result is the conflict of brotherhood and duty/purpose. Thus, giving Ramises a human element. He hardens his own heart, rather than God doing it for him.The actors voice the film extremely well. Overall, the music is decent, but I found the only two standout songs were "Deliver Us" (the opening number) and "When You Believe." All the stuff is the middle is passable but unmemorable. Particularly disappointing is a song about the Egyptian gods, which could have been an eerie spectacle. Instead, it (and the talents of Martin Short and Steve Martin) are wasted.Finally, I'll just point out that there's a terrific dream sequence including hieroglyphics that is completely original, entrancing, and powerful. Overall, this movie works well because it takes itself seriously, and it truly ends up delivering the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story told in beautiful animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you believe the bible, the story of Moses, or not, it is a great story to tell. The movie tells his story from the day the pharaoh of Egypt orders to kill all Hebrew baby boys, the day Moses' sister Miriam (voice of Sandra Bullock) puts him in a basket and leaves the basket in the river. That day Moses is found by the Egyptian princess and the pharaoh raises him as his own son. Moses' brother is Rameses, who will be the pharaoh of Egypt one day.As an adult Moses (voice of Val Kilmer) finds out he belongs to the Hebrew people and after God (again voice of Kilmer) has spoken to him he goes to Rameses (voice of Ralph Fiennes), who is Pharaoh by then, to ask for the release of his people. Rameses rejects this and the ten plagues are a fact.The great story is told with the most beautiful animation. Especially the splitting of the Red Sea is very impressive. All this, the great songs and the voice talents of Kilmer, Fiennes, Bullock but also Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren and Steve Martin and Martin Short for the comedy moments make this a very impressive animated movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I ought to start this review out by saying that I am not religious. This movie didn't offend me at all. If you want a perfectly accurate Biblical story, don't look at this. I think this movie put more of an emphasis on certain aspects that can be involved in religion (mostly how holding on to your beliefs is rewarding), but less of actual theology. Which worked perfectly for me.The animation is wonderful. At times I forget that we aren't watching real people. The music is lovely..."When You Believe" nearly brought me to tears. The movie never made fun of itself, and the result is that every scene seemed to have power and a purpose. I loved the characters themselves, but their relationships were especially interesting (mostly the kind of love/hate thing going on with Moses and Rameses). I'm sure the wonderful voice casting is mostly responsible for this.This is the most emotion-provoking animated film I've ever seen. I can't describe the sense of peace, joy, and awe it gave me. And if you really are in it for the religious aspect, hey, it's a great way to make the kids was to find the story in the Bible. But mostly it should be appreciated as a wonderful film and story. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt is a DreamWorks film like no other. It is based solely on the book of Exodus and, unlike most movies, tries to remain true to the book on which it is based.However, there are some minor flaws. For instance, Aaron became Moses' spokesperson and the pharoah died in the end. But these were changed to add some flare to the movie, and it actually helps.It is a nicely tuned visual epic. The animation is pretty darn good, with fluid movements and believable characters. The characters, by the way, support the film by being voiced by an all-star cast. This provides a sort of problem since throughout most of the movie I pictured the actors' faces rather than their drawn-out counterparts.The music by Hans Zimmer is, once again, amazing. Again and again he proves that he is an excellent artist of music. Thrilling tunes, playful themes, and sorrowful melodies rack the soundtrack. The songs, however, can get quite annoying, and I wanted to skip forward through some of them.The plot and storyline, taken from the Bible, are no doubt excellent. I doubt anyone could really dislike this movie.Although not a grand epic, it is still a tale worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Christians and Jews, including me, an extremely catholic man, this movie might have left God too??little? Some people complain that He is too bad with the Jews in the film, specially because its a kids movie. For us, God is master of Live and Death, so killing all those Egyptians in the Red See, the babies at the beginning of the film, and the citizens of Jerico (read the bible), is not really bad.The film might be the first of this generation to use animation for adult films, with elements that are enjoyable for children. Nowadays you can't use a lot of God in a movie, because too much people might not be familiarised with the story line. Fortunately, this movie has real characters you care about, real dramatic scenes, good music to express hard feelings (I myself was up to cry when Moses' mother sang `River, oh, River, flaw gently for me?') the best animation at the time (Good God, four years ago and I say it like it was sixty) and a key element that most people can relate to. I love this film, because its good and also has one of the stories they've been all talking about at Religion class at school. Yeah, it very good. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a great movie! It shows us not only the biblical side of the story. but also the sentimental and human side of it. I loved the way the relationship between Moses and Ramses was portrayed. Remember that it doesn't matter if you are catholic or not, this movie is universal, and it is a tale about people, feelings and basically everything that makes us human. If you are expecting something as boring as "The ten commandments", you are totally wrong. It is a hundred times better, and, trust me, you'll love it. I give it 9 in 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing and Disneyfied</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT*Although a decent animated version of the Exodus story, the film fumbles badly in trying to be like the recent Disney movies, with the pair of slapstick sidekicks, songs, and inappropriate comic relief. Exodus is a very dark and violent tale, after all. It seems weird to try to get humor out of it. Another disappointment is that the film ends after the parting of the Red Sea, as others have noted. In defense of that, however, keep in mind that The Ten Commandments was about 3 hours long and this movie is meant for kids. They can only cover so much in 90 minutes.I don't mean to dis any other reviewers, but many have made reference to this as a "Christian" story, or asked why Dreamworks chose such material, or why the film had God being so cruel to the Egyptians. I guess it needs to be pointed out that Dreamworks didn't write the original story! This is what the Old Testament says! And as for choice of material, remember that the SKG of Dreamworks is Speilberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen. These guys are all Jewish and this is their most important religious story. Should we expect them to make a movie about the life of Jesus, Mohammed, or Buddha?Overall their intentions were admirable and they gave it a good shot but in the end succumbed to the temptation to make it commercially appealing to kids by trying to inject humor into what is in fact a very grim and bloody story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A tad too much" I kept telling myself during this movie. "The Prince of Egypt" is definitely bold, but not in a good way. I found the movie pretty boring. I'm guessing alot of children are taught about the 10 plagues of Egypt, but manifesting it into visually reality was too much. Seeing children and animals die on the screen is not my idea of family entertainment. I found it offensive and disturbing in the bad way.I did find some scenes effective, such as "the parting of the sea" which was done very well, creating a creepy aura. Some of the songs kind of sucked though, except "When You Believe". Overall, the film was too much and too little at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful - shame about the religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is great fun - breathtaking in many places. It does have some of the problems of a first effort. (Remember Disney's old glory days: "Snow White" also had its problems, and in retrospect was awkward and under-done when compared to "Bambi" and "Pinocchio".) I'll start with the problems.There's a certain want of polish. Dreamworks does not yet have Disney's impressive stable of character animators - Moses and the Queen are excellent, others are lacking - and extra work and money can't make up the deficit. Computer graphics have been misused yet again. (This time they've been mis-applied to water. The scene where Moses's cradle sloshes about on a digital Nile is just a mismatch; and the parting of the Red Sea, despite all the artificial awe that gets whipped up, looks cheesy when placed next to its counterpart in "Fantasia", made 58 years earlier.)This is no problem, really. All I'm really saying is that Dreamworks is behind in the arms race at the moment. Most of the artwork is superb. Many of the effects - during the plagues, especially, although because of undue compression we only get to really see three of the plagues - are truly something to be proud of. Visually we can't complain.Here are the moments that really stuck in my throat:Firstly, the concluding song. (It was hideous: but that's not the point.) Over and over the tuneless warble goes: "There will be miracles - if you believe." A more witless summing up of the story would be hard to imagine. It's New Age, not Old Testament. If the story has told us anything, it's that there will be miracles whether or not we believe. The God of the Old Testament is a kind of iron juggernaut. He showers Egypt with plagues in order to free his people, whatever their psychological states may be. (Sometimes, if they cease to believe, he sends a miracle in order to bring them round.) The songwriters have evidently confused "The Prince of Egypt" with "Dumbo".Secondly, and related ... I draw your attention to the scene where Moses turns his staff into a snake, the Egyptian priests turn their staves into snakes, and Moses's snake eats the other two snakes. How many gods have been responsible for miracles here? At least two. Yet the Egyptian priests are portrayed as charlatans, who get by entirely with stage magic. -There are, in fact, two ways of telling the story. According to one the priests ARE charlatans and there is just one source of genuine miracles; according to the other (more textually accurate, and better) interpretation, the Egyptian priests command real magic, and the Egyptian gods are real gods - just not as powerful as Yahweh. Either story told unambiguously would have made for a better movie. But it also would have annoyed too many American Christians (and possibly Jews). That, indeed, is the general problem. Every so often the film-makers tread into territory that might offend a modern religious group, and they freeze rigid. If only they were as cavalier about offending modern religions as they were about offending Egyptian pagans.That's how things could have been better, but they're good enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen for every minute. When the gods keep their noses out of mortal affairs, "Prince of Egypt" soars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was entertained by this movie, and I wouldn't call it biblically "incorrect," but biblically "incomplete." The movie fails to include one of the most important parts of the story, which is included in the Seder service for Passover, which Jews celebrate every year: after the Hebrew people were freed, and they are in the midst of their rejoicing, God basically yells at them and says "How can you be joyous when my children have died?" This acknowledgement of the loss that the Egyptians experienced is a really important part of the story, but it was fairly irrelevant in the context of the movie. The songs were sometimes unnecessary, but overall better than I expected them to be. One to see, (mainly for the graphical excellence), but there are better animated films out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An exceptionally well animated film, with tremendous effort and imagination put into the central scenes; the killing of the first-born and the parting of the Red sea. Although perhaps one should take a critical peek at the giant fish silhouetted in the wall of water. What is it? A whale? A great white? It's so huge as to indicate a creature measuring about 90 feet, and this simply doesn't exist in these waters, dear Dreamworks! I enjoyed the songs too and there was great continuity in the (slight) storyline. The voices were quite adequate.Still, it's really a huge, grandiose Jewish legend, and so the reverence towards the God of Israel becomes overwhelming at times. Cecil B. De Mille would have applauded the old-fashioned, literal, letter-perfect way this story is presented. The hapless Jews gets the glory in the end, and what modern archaeology may have revealed about the workers who built the pyramids and temples (it is likely the Jews in Egypt were not slaves at all, but worked for wages) counts for nothing here. For this story to work, they have to suffer. Mightily. Do we really believe this today? No matter. For this is the EXODUS, where the Israel nation are God's chosen people. All else be damned.Geffen, Katzenberg and Spielberg: Shy away from the old Testament for inspiration. Please. Other than that, this is a marvellous film indeed.</fullReview>

There is so many extraordinary events told in this 80 years i'm sure it was hard to choose which ones to focus on. I personally would have spent more time on the plagues. I would have like it more if it had brought out Egypt's Gods and shown just who the plagues were directed toward.It did show me a new angle in which I hadn't given much thought. The fact that Moses had to turn away from the family that raised him and their religion to follow the true God. Thank you for that other perspective.I liked the movie.

		<fullReview>ok don't judge me on this...but this is what a little old me has to say.i somehow get the feeling that dreamworks was trying to bulldoze its way into the audience's heart simply by creating flashy and dramatic animation graphics, which many people seem to have succumbed to.I enjoyed the film yes, and to be honest, i even cried at several scenes. But somehow, (don't ask me why!), I just get a feeling it lacks that special element which will make it a classic.it is quite obvious that Dreamworks intends to overtake Disney's animation department. But disney started off with the right foot when he came up with Snow White (which till this day remains a classic) that's why the Disney Company will always remain a formidable 'empire' (as katzenberg would call it if he wrote this little comment) till this day.Disney doesn't rely on full blown showy graphics which so many audiences have succummed to in the Prince of Egypt. And although POE was profitable as a blockbuster in itself, it lacks that "spirit" so evident in Disney.To go a little deeper, Disney himself was a great animator and created cartoons for the love of it. He spent his entire career and life specializing in cartoons. Katzenberg's motive is tinged with a little jealousy and hate (against Eisner), which in the long run may negatively affect the films he produces. Spielberg on the other hand is obviously better with real life movies.Perhaps it would take more than simply bulldozing a flashy cartoon and a lot more love and experience in animation for dreamworks to really overtake Disney's legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pharaohs Seem More Simpatico</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I did like the animation, songs, and, overall the story, there were some things I found a bit disturbing! One was that (even though it was spelled out that the Old Pharaoh HAD massacred all these helpless Hebrew baby slaves) he is presented as an overall sympathetic character. He, his wife (rather than his daughter- as written in Exodus) and their biological son Ramseses consider Moses to be a full member of their family and, rather than try to kill him after he killed the sadistic Egyptian torturing the Hebrew slave (as written in Exodus), they ALL plead with him to forget his Hebrew birth and remain in the palace as though NOTHING had changed (even to the degree that Ramseses and the Pharaoh both try to decree that Moses's killing the Egyptian had NOT happened). One feels sorry for them after Moses chooses to leave their family. Zipporah is well-depicted and (ironicly) is the LAST member of her Midian family to befriend Moses . Her force-of-nature father Jethro likes him from the start. Moses does return to Egypt and pleads with his former brother Ramseses to let his people go but, even at THAT point, Ramseses is merely happy to see him again and gives him a bear hug! What's most agonizing here is that Ramseses is depicted as a VERY attentive and CARING father to his firstborn (and, so far only) son (no queen is evident so, it must be inferred that Ramseses's wife had died early- as well as his parents) so when his son DIES from the Plague of the Firstborn, he mourns him FAR more intensely than the mere fact of his being the heir to the throne! (Ironicly, in Exodus, it would seem that Moses was raised by the Pharaoh's Daughter but nursed by his OWN mother and it seemed well-known that he was a Hebrew BEFORE he killed the sadistic Egyptian so it was most likely he was a ward of the Pharonic court rather than a full-fledged prince and, thus, he had no previous bond of friendship with the unnamed Pharaoh in Exodus) . I heard at least one child in the cinema say that it was a 'sad movie' and it does seem ironic that I actually felt more sorry for Ramseses than I did for Moses at the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful animation, but lousy music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie left me torn: The animation is gorgeous--the entire parting/crossing the Red Sea scene was one of the most breathtaking animated sequences I've seen. The plot and characterization are well done, especially the Rameses/Moses relationship. However, the music was terrible. As opposed to good old Disney classics like Aladdin or Beauty &amp; the Beast, the music seemed forced. The songs were for the most part weak (Miriam's little "Faith" song and the high priests' "You're Playing With the Big Boys Now" being the absolute worst) and didn't add to the movie at all. So, I ended up sitting there marvelling at the beauty of animation, then pondering the interesting spin on the Exodus story, admiring the direction, and then groaning as another song kicked in and ruined the mood. If only Katzenberg had gone that one step farther away from Disney and ditched the songs completely, this movie would have been excellent. As it is, however, it only comes off as pretty good.</fullReview>

Prince of Egypt was not made to change or replace the story of Moses found in God's Word. So then why is everyone so upset about it?! It's a great animated film. The integration of computer graphics with traditional animation made it look great. The celebrity voices and beautiful songs made it sound great. And the way the narrative was developed made it feel great. If you're going to watch it for the purpose of comparing its accuracy to Exodus, then don't watch it.

		<fullReview>With Antz and Prince of Egypt, Dreamworks is quickly passing Disney as the best animation studio. Particularly with Prince of Egypt, not a cartoon but an animated drama for adults. There are not wacky dragons or back talking parrots or wise cracking genies, but a straight forward telling out the story of the exodus. Not only is the animation beautiful, but the cast of voices is second to none, where if this cast were in a movie the budget would soar past that of Titanic. The voices are all great, but above all Val Kilmer as Moses and Ralph Fiennes as Ramses pair well together and Patrick Stewart as the aging pharaoh is perfect. I highly recommend this movie. Dreamworks is just starting to roll and if their future animated ventures come near Antz and Prince of Egypt, Disney may get bumped from its spot atop animated kingdom.</fullReview>

Second, almost all of the important female characters are gone. Ramases' wife, her advisor, etc. And also the death of the original Pharaoh ain't nuthin' but a thang, apparently. I think the worst thing of all is how, in trying to make Moses more human, they excised all of his divinity. He's a shrimpy shrimp. The plot is shallow and uninspired. The idea of the brotherhood relationship was not bad. They could have taken it as far as the Biblical story would allow. But they took a butcher knife and chop-chop. Despite the astounding animation, "The Prince of Egypt" is easily one of the worst films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Does contain SPOILERS.The animation, both manual and CGI is top notch. The character design and drawn mannerisms and techniques here are excellent, including a lot of very powerful, dramatic scenes that are refreshingly deviant from Disney's methods. It only disappoints in the story, but this is not the fault of the producers and creative team who bring us the film.. Rather, it's a problem with the biblical story and its killjoy ending. All of that heart and drama and humanity.. the beginning and middle of this film build up to something that the audience can't wait to see.. something ultimately meaningful and thought provoking..something spiritual that will affect our lives and philosophies permanently.... and what does it come down to? Killing all the bad guys in a mass slaughter. Well, they don't agree with the Christian belief system, (They're backward Egyptians who have all those funky gods, right?) And they're stubborn and in the way and bothering everyone, so God just murders them all.....Really, I expect God to come up with a better solution than that. It truly does feel like something that would happen 2000 years ago, in its insensitivity and decidedly biblical prejudice... We hardly get any depth into Rameses' character or his inner conflict.. being presented with the choice of giving up on thousands of years of Egyptian tradition and heritage based on the testimony of a bearded derelict who has just wandered out of the desert. We get none of the positive aspects of Egypt, a country as rich in unique culture as any other, because it's presented here as the source of evil. We can't have the bad guys presented in the appropriate human context, because the audience is supposed to hate them.  Please keep in mind that this isn't Dreamworks' fault. They kept to the Old Testament as well as could be expected. Their only folly was selecting this particular downer of a story to make into a feature film. It IS eye candy, spectacular in its effects and appearance, and should be admired for this. The star spangled cast is somewhat wasted, as most of the dialogue is everyday business and there are few opportunities for talent to shine. The musical numbers, though heartfelt, feel out of place amid the severity and carnage of the somber storyline. Still, the film is an interesting study in animation and human behavior...... But it isn't one for the kiddies, particularly the scene where God discriminantly murders a slew of innocent Egyptian children. ...This film definitely highlights the evil side of the Almighty. It's nothing for anybody, particularly Christians, to be proud of. In fact, any Christian with a sense of humanity should be ashamed of this dark chapter in religious history. It's cruelty and vengeance all around, and hardly anybody gets away looking good. Yes, slavery is evil. But murder is evil, too, folks. ... Oh wait, but God is exempt from the rules. That's right..

Even better, there were no sweet little animals to put me in a diabetic coma.As the movie wore on, I began noticing many missing details. The movie seemed more interested in its own ability to sell than it was in the actual story. What we were treated to was animated cliff notes, and not very thorough ones at that. It was a summary of only a portion of the story of Moses. Major details were left out like God telling Moses how to use his staff. What about Aaron? Aaron was Moses' sidekick. Moses never faced the Pharaoh alone, Aaron was his mouthpiece. (Which was another issue the movie failed to confront). What about the constant grumbling and complaining of the Jewish people that began even before they were led out of Egypt?The ending of the movie was so sudden that I turned and asked my wife, "is this it?" I thought they must be joking! It was as if they found a convenient spot to simply cut the story off.There is nothing included in the movie that is inaccurate, that I can think of.

		<shortDescription>Exodus Accuracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was a great film and I'm glad to see such a film. However, to the Christian world, we learned that Aron was Moses' mouthpiece to Ramsies. Such was not so in the film. Also, when Moses had his experience with the burning bush, afterwards his face shown like the sun and they covered it because it was so bright. I looked for these and expected them as I watched the movie (quite impressed with everything else), but they were missing. While I loved the film, it left me with mixed feelings and the desire to see a really great bible film that was accurate and brilliant in every way. I also expected God to have a very low and rumbling voice. Later in the bible when the people gathered around the holy mountain, God spoke to the people directly, but the voice was such that the people were so afraid, they asked that God not speak to them again. Thus the reason I expected a low majestic and terrible (like the strength of a volcano) voice. However, I hope they keep going. I like where they are going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, didn't live up to the hype, but few films do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When all is said and done, this film is an imitation of live action, and that is not what animation does well. I saw cuts from Ben-Hur, The 10 Commandments, and a number of other films. The characters were handled unevenly, with some being well handled and others--let's face it--badly drawn. This failing isn't just DreamWorks', Disney also has been doing remakes of live action films in animation, and the results have been similar. I'd rate PRINCE OF EGYPT about the same as I rated POCAHONTAS or HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. They are stories that are not suitable for animated musicals, and it's too bad that the new studio makes the same mistakes as the old one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamworks takes on Disney at its own game but fails to make the definitive statement in animation. They follow the formula too closely complete with an overabundance of inappropriate songs. Just when you feel yourself being drawn in, the spell is broken by one of the characters bursting into song. This is the story of Moses - how are we supposed to take it seriously? Where is it written that all animated features must be movies? The subject didn't warrant it, it's hardly a kids film, so why?A huge disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney would have done it better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exodus here gets the Disneyesque treatment, in a star-studded &amp; doubtless expensive effort from Spielberg's DreamWorks studio. The picture works well enough to show a Sunday school or religious studies class learning about Exodus, but considered entirely on its own merits as a film, it doesn't quite work.Structurally, what works for a religious chronicle isn't the same as what works for a film, leaving some sequences stretched out until they become dull, &amp; some (the Ten Plagues most obviously) feeling bizarrely rushed. The writers also seem to assume the viewers know the story already; not knowing it (as my little sister didn't), it is a tad difficult to follow.The songs are dull &amp; unmemorable; the film's musical sequences are its dullest moments, conversely to Disney films, in which they are typically the highlights.It still receives an OK-to-good score of 6/10, though, primarily because the animation is stunning, particularly during the parting of the Red Sea: a whale swims right past the "wall" of the sea. I never really thought about what happened to the sea-life in the story, &amp; it's one of many excellent little details of the film. Also, the characters are well-developed, both visually &amp; in terms of their characterisation. Pharoah, in particular, is much more fleshed-out, conflicted, &amp; believable than his almost characterless Biblical counterpart.Finally, a criticism of the source material: my 6-year-old sister was baffled &amp; disturbed when I explained, towards the film's climax, that God was killing the first-born of everyone in Egypt. It may be that this story, featuring as it does slavery, mass infanticide, a river of blood, the drowning of a huge army, &amp; even an implied rape early on, is simply too dark to adequately adapt to a children's animated musical, as was the case with Don Bluth's Disneyesque Anastasia (revolution, regicide, the apparently-unmentionable communism) or Disney's own The Hunchback of Notre Dame (rape as villain motivation).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prince of Egypt According to the Bible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw The Prince of Egypt, I was attached immediately. The power of the characters. The music was phenomenal! The only downfall in this movie is the storyline. It all starts out correctly and ends correctly, but almost everything in between is not accurate according to the Bible. If a person knows or read the story in Exodus, they will know. For a person like me, it drives us nuts. We know the story already, and while this movie is fantastic, it doesn't fit with the actual story.They say about 600 religious experts were conferred with to "make the film as accurate as possible." This is not true. Read the story of Moses and his path in the book of Exodus and watch the movie and there you will find many errors in the movie according to the Bible. Once Moses is separated from his mother to the point where the Hebrews cross the Red Sea, numerous events are incorrect. Watch carefully, after reading the story in the Bible, and see the scenes to which I'm referring. Another way to see the difference is by watching the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston. Same story, but major difference in the events taking place.If a person doesn't really care about the storyline of the movie or what really happened they can disregard the false implications. The first time I saw the movie I didn't think anything of what really happened as told in the Bible.</fullReview>

The parting of the Red Sea was cool, but the ring of fire looked like it was taken from an episode of G.I. Joe.Also, what is the deal with the horrid Elton John style music/singing? It seems that every American style animated movie has to have two or more really horrid Elton John style songs in it. Like it's some sort of rule.Combine the poor animation, not counting the computer enhanced shots, with some of the most rancid musical numbers, and the stale static backgrounds and what you get is just another crappy American style animated film, with maybe a whole minute or two (added up) of neat special effects.I'd give it a rancid 1 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reduces an epic story to epic visuals. Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt uses the story of Moses as written in Exodus to serve as an epic backdrop. Sadly, it is used as the backdrop for a very mundane tale about a young man who doesn't quite fit in with his 'family' and rediscovers his roots. Leaving aside the impressive visual spectacle this is a film that has little more to say than the sitcom 'Different Strokes', and much less to say than Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing', about social circumstances and justice. And it virtually ignores religion - presumably for the sake of Middle East sales...It must be said, though, that the vocal cast do a creditable job with a particularly polite, unconvincing and unsurprising script.It is arguable that animation works best to represent events that cannot be reproduced naturally. Disney's doe-eyed characters work well because they are obviously unreal and can portray a range of distorted expressions to communicate mood. This film's more realistic human-like portrayals unfortunately limit the expressive range of the characters, so for some of the more intimate scenes (such as Moses' first adult encounter with Miriam) the viewer is left staring at an unmoving cartoon human head with little or no nuance of emotion. Such stories are best told with live actors, especially when the music is little help.The film is, to be sure, mighty impressive when it works. Barring one or two shortcuts the art direction is excellent. Key scenes such as the hieroglyphic dream sequence, the parting of the Red Sea and the death of the firstborn are handled as well as anyone could hope to expect, and the crew deserve merit for these great achievements. Strangely though, they have chosen to take glaring computer animation shortcuts in odd places and the clash of computer precision with cell animation fuzziness is sometimes painful (as it is in recent Disney products).Unfortunately, the well-placed symbolism and visual opulence have to provide nearly all the entertainment because, with the exception of the Court Priest's song-and-dance routine, the music is tedious and the lyrics banal.The Prince of Egypt is, I think, worth watching for its merits - which are entirely visual. This is not the film to shake Disney's world, but DreamWorks certainly have potential in spades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Prince of Egypt today, and though I had read many reviews about it, nothing prepared me for how disappointing it was. Where was the awe, the emotion, the wonder, the divine inspiration?The mixture of CGI and traditional animation was as fluid as oil and water. It reminded me of an old Mad Magazine satire that showed Donald Duck cowering naked in a realistically rendered henhouse. The contrast was almost embarrassing. The story either went too slowly or too quickly. I never really made an emotional investment in any of the characters.The story jumped from one "Money Scene" to the next "Money Scene" with awkward transitions. The distortion of the legend making Moses the Pharaoh's adopted son instead of grandson was not believable. Why would a mother, especially the pharaoh's wife, with a very young son of her own so readily adopt another, and a stranger at that? It was just a plot device to trump up a sibling rivalry, and not a particularly interesting one at that. Moses came off as being too tortured and not heroic or enough. In a movie like this, belief (in the divine) is supposed to make you strong. And God, who is supposedly the point of all Bible stories, was reduced to a cameo role. The character animation was annoyingly angular, with eyes ridiculously far apart and on top of the forehead. And the clanging mixture of flat American (Pfeiffer, Bullock), regal British and traditional Jewish accents was particularly jarring. The songs were pretty much forgettable. Well, I could go on and on, but you get the idea.Katzenberg could say all he wants about how this is a film for adults and he is breaking new ground in animation and making the world safe from Disney mush. But if the movie fails to find an audience, it's not because he aimed too high, but because he missed his mark.</fullReview>

Furthermore, the first two-thirds of the movie is humorous, dramatic and entertaining; they plot moving along at a steady pace.

		<shortDescription>A waste of great animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film I had to ask: what was the point? The Bible does not have enough fantastic elements in it to sustain an animated feature, unlike say, the Illiad or the Odyssey. Furthermore, the characters in the bible are very broadly drawn--and certainly not that involving if you treat it as a storybook as opposed to a religious text. I was impressed by the animation--but that was about it...The Bible does not have many supernatural elements in it--and so the film seems like straight live action--with scenes of people standing around talking.. Boring. Furthermore, it looks like Dreamworks was attempting to please everybody with a story that has some fundamental problems with its ethics--at least to a modern audience. The god of the Old Testament was a very harsh war god without the touches of humour or sympathy you find in the Zeus of the Greeks. The filmmakers attempted to soften the brutal punishments of the Hebrew God by having Moses be compassionate to the Egyptians--but this doesnt help much.. You leave the theater not rejoicing that the Hebrews are freed, but wondering about the terrible punishments that are inflicted upon the men, women, children and animals of Egypt to reach that end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wannabe adult Disney fails badly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A massively over-hyped piece of faux-adult entertainment. The scripting ranges from awkward, to laughably inept. The songs, in addition to being totally out of place, are completely forgettable. The acting is wretched for the main part, with a stand-out performance by Patrick Stewart. The animation is generally quite good, but lacks the vivacity of a Disney production, which the film is obviously trying to compete with. The computer animated parts are very effective, but are integrated very poorly with the cel animation, especially in the Red Sea sequence. Backgrounds are extremely patchy. But, for the most part, the movie is guilty of the worst cinematic crime of all; of being very, very boring. The entire film contains two compelling scenes: The taking of the first born, and the crossing of the Red Sea. These two scenes possess the grandeur necessary of such a powerful story, but elsewhere, the movie is very wanting. Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Prince of Egypt is a well-animated Dreamworks film set in Ramses' I and Moses period of Ancient Egypt. Unfortunately, that is all this film has for itself. The film is interwoven with hypocrisy and poor musicals. Perhaps one of the most mind-numbing films of the late century, it is one film not worth a good word.Based upon the epic tale of Moses and how he freed 'his people' it appears to be a happy ending, ethical film. However as the film progresses you notice a few odd demeanours. Moses tries to free his own people yet, in the process, kills many innocents along the way. Moses' God brings wrath among the people for not freeing Moses. Raining fire and brimstone, animal plagues and what-not. Perhaps it hadn't occurred to the makers that they were being the slight bit hypocritical. Behind the harsh treatment of the slaves was the other side of the glass, where the innocent people of Ramses were ruthlessly hurt emphasized EVEN MORE by the quivering child and her mother as their people were laid to death. Moses also blames Ramses for this, however it was almost-definitely his fault for bringing it on the people... Since when did the person being provoked get the right to murder? Throughout the film you will hear ear-bleeding snippets of 'music'. The contraptions that they set out for the viewer to hear simply are terrible. They lack rhythm with repetitive lyrics and, as difficult as it sounds(pun intended), it will make you want to bash at the screen with a cobra-on-a-stick.It is clear that in the film they try to keep the good word in for Moses as killing innocent civilians and soldiers in an inverted tsunami is apparently proper etiquette. This is not aided by the fact that Moses and his people has to walk for forty days and forty nights without proper supplies or water. If treks in Ancient Egypt's desert tells us anything it is that you lose a lot of people that way, such as fifty-thousand soldiers lead by Cambyses.Despite all the terrible mind-numbingly tedious motions of this film there is a single good point which I shall sweep across. There is good animation, each shot seems well positioned well enough to see the terror in the face of civilians. Although on a high point, it doesn't bring this film from the trenches although it does lift it upon a fire-step of '5' (out of 10) only to be shot down by everything else.The Prince of Egypt is as difficult to review as to watch, every word brings horrid images of hypocrisy and gargantuan plot holes into perspective. Ultimately this film is altered by preference, and if you are a die-hard fan of the New Testament then by all means watch it. However, if you are not and feel that this film will better your knowledge of other cultures then stay half a sea from this 'movie'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually like movies like this. True, "The Prince of Egypt" has great animation, interesting characters and super voice talent (Kilmer, Fiennes, Bullock, Pfeiffer, Glover, Martin, Stewart, Goldblum...) and there are set-pieces that deliver the goods (The Parting of the Red Sea, the Building of the Pyramids, Baby Moses' Basket Trip down the Nile, etc.)....BUT, and this may be a BIG problem for many of you, there isn't a whole lot of religion in this movie. You may be saying "big deal, it's a kid's movie, stop shovin' God in our faces all the time". Well, I'd agree with you if this wasn't based on THE OLD TESTAMENT!!!!!A lot of the big scenes are treated like after-thoughts (Moses' exile into the desert, the Burning Bush scene, etc.), there's little to no character development (especially in Rameses and Moses, which is a shock) and scant mention of God and His hand in things. Telling a Bible story for kids and leaving out God? That's like telling a bed-time story and leaving out the heroes in it.SPOILER -But this is my biggest gripe with "The Prince of Egypt" - right after the Red Sea is parted and Rameses is left in defeat - the movie ENDS!! Just some end crawl about what Moses did afterwards and blah blah blah.... THEY MESSED UP! No Mount Sinai! No giving of the Ten Commandments! They missed out on what would have been a spectacular ending!- END OF SPOILERCould it be, in this time of movie-making where they don't want to offend any non-religious movie-goers, the makers of this film decided to go middle of the road and just deliver action, animated violence and big-name star's voices, then forget the fundamental elements of the Exodus...like, say, the fact that it was BASED ON CHRISTIANITY??! Look, you want to have the kids get the right kind of exposure to this story, rent "The Ten Commandments" with Charlton Heston. You'll get the best telling of this story yet. without a lot of cutesy, intrusive songs, to boot. And with God at the forefront. as it should be.Shame on you, Dreamworks Pictures. Keep your mitts out of religious pictures; you're obviously under-equipped.Only three stars - for the animation. It's the best part, but that's like buying a car because it has a pretty paint-job.Forgive them, O Lord; they know not what they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Holy Bible gets a Disney treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago I reviewed this movie here. I recently read my review and seeing how terribly written it was really hurt me. That is why I removed it. I will try to do better now.DISCLAIMER: Of course, I know 'The Prince of Egypt' is not an actual Disney movie.SECOND DISCLAIMER: And, of course, I am not a religious person. I don't have a religion, actually.Well, my opinion about this movie hasn't changed one bit over the years. I hated it six years ago and I hate it now. Now I will try to explain why.At the beginning it actually looks like a great movie - the animation is wonderful and the voices are great, and the theme it's centered around is something every person in the world should be familiar with.However... Here is the problem: this theme is much more serious than the treatment this movie gives it. After all, it is a story that changed the world forever. The creators of 'The Prince of Egypt' turned it into a Disney kind of a family movie. They put some childish songs here, they did the animation in a Disney manner, they simplified the story and they even put some insanely stupid non-funny comic reliefs. As I've already said, I am not a religious freak. I don't believe in God the way most Christians do. And yet even I think the story deserved a more serious approach. This story is just not suitable for a kids' film, sorry. A very big part of it is about the horrible death of thousands of kids. That is why many reviewers wrote their kids started crying at the very beginning of this movie. Many kids actually feel horrified by this movie, and there is a reason for that - a story like this one has to be told in a movie rated at least PG-13. It is not good for younger audience, and it is definitely not good for a kids' movie. Making a kids' movie out of it is just wrong - it wouldn't work, and it is plain disrespectful to the Holy Bible and the religion.Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that posses its flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, "The Prince Of Egypt" is overshadowed with a very dark and violent feeling, which will with no doubt depress many viewers of the film. You may also like this film, despite the killing of innocent Egyptians and Hebrews and the horrible excitement of the film. You less likely to like this film if you are one of the following people:1. An Egyptian person. 2. Someone who does not believe in the Bible. 3. A person who does not believe in God. 4. A person who prefers calmer films.If you are one of the following people you are much more likely to enjoy this film:1. Someone who IS NOT an Egyptian. 2. Someone who does not particularly care for the Egyptian race. 3. Someone who believes in the Bible or God. 4. A person who wants to watch a more violent, darker cartoon film.This film is animated, based on much of the story of Moses. The animation is beautiful, but that is pretty much the only light thing about this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corrupts the Biblical Story, and teaches racism and hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who think this movie is good must be just so over-wowed by the colors and music that they their brains stop working! As a result, they miss some very important and insidious problems. First, the film sends the message that it is OK to hate another race so long as you are not a member of that race. If you find out that you are actually a member of that race, then you need to join them and hate your former race as strongly as you once hated your own. But whichever race you belong to, hating different races is the order of the day! Yippee! How does this terrible message get over looked by people who like this film? Watch it again! This is exactly what is presented in the film and represents the precise motivations of its characters, especially Moses! Worst of all are all the modernistic adulterations of the original BIblical story. It represents the RHV, the "Revised Hollywood Version" of the Bible. I have never understood why stories that are so apparently worthy to be made into films are nevertheless not worthy to stand on their own as films! If the market draw of a film is its source material, then why not represent the source material faithfully? There's no harm in filling in the gaps of a Biblical narrative with original and entertaining stuff, but why change the explicit details of the original story themselves? As a result, the public thinks it knows something about the Bible when all it has been given is some half-baked, Hollywood revision done for the sake of marketing demographics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course the animation is terrific, and well it should be, as in any animated picture since the advent of computer technology. But what's lacking here is that sense of "heart" that shines through in almost all Disney works. This may be a 'babysitter' for the VERY young, but for anyone else this is a KLUNKER. It's gonna die at the box-office...wanna bet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one more Disney rip-off with only moderate animation, forgettable songs, terrible plot, and poorly developed characters. Children will have a hard time with the violence and adults will be bored with the plot. Also, this is a religious film where God is depicted as a mere afterthought. Dreamworks was too careful with this one. They didn't take any risk at all and the result is an animated muddle that is only mildly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another preachy Disney melodrama (with singing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie as a dare. A friend of mine had to watch Home Alone 4 (Taking back the house), so I was left with another kiddie movie - The Prince of Egypt. I knew it would be another preachy, annoying piece of Disney melodrama, so I prepared everything I needed for the journey - the potato chips, the comfortable bed, the cool drinks on the side... but I guess I wasn't completely prepared. Between the singing, the wide-eyed facial expressions and the divine massacres, portrayed for the kids as justice, I had unconsciously chewed up all the pillows and sheets around me, and one of my eyes, the one closer to the TV, was suspiciously red and sore. Even by Disney standards, this movie is exceptionally awful... unless of course you love Disney movies and preachy Bible stories - in that case, a-OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POE is DOA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no joy in this picture. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I wish Dreamworks hadn't attempted to do this film by following so strictly the Disney musical formula--only without wit or subtext. They didn't spend enough time letting the audience get to know the main characters before being expected to empathize with them or identify with the struggles they face. This has nothing to do with the AVERAGE running time (of an animated feature)--but the producers unwillingness to commit to creating individual personalites in the leads. So the audience is left to watch a pageant akin to really bad French Grand Opera. The designs remind me that, like "Antz," Dreamworks eschews appeal by trying too hard NOT to be like Disney. People might not mind or compare if the stories were compelling or at LEAST entertaining (I did NOT say FUNNY, I said entertaining) As far as the color, I wish someone would turn the lights on so we could see the characters. The skin, clothes, and props are colored so dark and with so little contrast that it strains the eyes. While I admire the fact that it attempted to do something different--it just didn't work, which proves the idea that a goal is something you strive for, but rarely achieve. And for all Dreamworks Honking about this being an "Adult" picture, it falls into the same trap they suffered with "Antz" in trying too hard to alienate anyone that might call them on their bluff: IT'S A CARTOON. That's NOT a bad thing! Disney has had the same problem, and has yet to strike the right balance (Gargoyles in "Hunchback")--but the chances Disney's taken in the last few years have been much more satisfying than this production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very let down with this film. Dreamworks is hyping this as the best animated movie ever and it is definitely not that. It definitely can't compete with "Beauty and the Beast." I went into this film with high hopes and left the theater asking "why in the world would Dreamworks mess up such a golden opportunity." Wait for the dollar show on this one. It's not worth your time or money. Boring plot, boring songs, mediocre animation. 1 1/2 stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>take the PG rating seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read so many reviews on this movie (on this and other sites) before trying to show it to my children. Too may people gush about the biblical aspects of this movie without regard to the violence. There is a great deal of whipping of people (some in shadow) and violence towards infants. My oldest (7) has a great interest in Egypt and history so I thought perhaps she would enjoy this. I gave the kids a background on the Moses story beforehand, but still they were absolutely horrified at the dream Moses has where they kill the mothers and take the babies away (they kept asking if the babies were killed and I said "No, of course not"). We stopped the movie and they were in tears all throughout bedtime. Not worth it at all, no matter what your religious beliefs. I do not think this movie should be shown to anyone under the age of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suck-rific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In every possible respect, this movie was meritless.The animation was poor. I particularly enjoyed our protagonists grotesquely misshapen head.The music was awful, and I mean both the score itself and the performance. I've never quite cringed the way I did tonight when that nauseating theme recurred for the five thousandth time.I guess it makes sense that the singing was so sub-par, considering they managed to blow all their money on gratuitous, excessive, repeatedly egregious computer graphics. When Passover comes, the "death blob" looks more like a plasma weapon from a orbiting alien battle cruiser. The parting of the Red Sea was nice though, in a "if we make it all spurting water, we don't actually have to draw any characters" sort of way.The comic "relief" provided by Ra's high priests was completely out of place, and a transparent attempt to emulate Disney's habit of incorporating a pair of funny side kicks.Why is it that, in every movie dealing with Egypt in that time period, an explanation is inevitably provided for the Sphinx's missing nose? Really, dreamworks, how trite.I'd like to end by saying that the entire group I went with feels the same, and that we are now going to scrub ourselves with wire brushes to see if we can get the dirtiness off.Oh, but it was a good movie though, yah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have quite enjoyed this movie, as it's very well executed, with the fantastic storyline that animated movies of this kind should have, if the creators of the movie hadn't put that ridiculously pretentious text at the beginning of it, telling me that I had to believe that all of this actually happened!It's scary to me that not only do these people apparently believe that God murdered tens of thousands of innocent people so that the hebrews could go free (to name just one of the incredibly cruel and vengeful acts that seem so incredibly human), but they also don't appear to see any problem with that!A scene with hebrews singing triumphantly in the streets follows directly a scene in which an innocent child is struck dead, and the movie is full of moments like these. It's really incredible that someone would make a movie like this in the nineties...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious propaganda at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How in the world did dreamworks make a religious movie for kids? This is just ridiculous propaganda that says its OK to kill babies because the magic man said so because he got angry at Egyptians. this fairytale to corrupt children's minds that Moses supposedly went through Nile or turned water into blood is just absurd. So basically they made a 2000 year old fairy tale look realistic to kids cause religion says so I have to admit that The Prince of Egypt looks great and it has its good moments but that's all it has. The message is that Egyptians were evil and that Moses is our "Savior". in conclusion, cartoons should not portray religious messages to youngsters because they aren't mature enough to handle them. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrible movie with a horrific message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this movie preaches that its okay to kill another group of people all because your the chosen people. The fantasy of the bible loves to preach hate that pretends to be love. In fact God is all about hate in reality and is in reality evil. To kill children in the name of God? How disgusting and utterly inhumane is that?I read up on the Egyptians some and what the bible teaches vs what actually happened is very contradictory. For one Egypt wasn't built on the backs of Hebrew's it was built through manual labor and slaves yes but very few of the actual slaves were Hebrew. Also the waves going up like it described for moses and his people by god is another lie. In reality it was a natural event and its highly doubtful that Moses people survived it unscathed. Another factor that enraged me is the contemptuous way that the Jewish and Christian people treat faiths other than their own yet they get self righteous when people criticize them right back. Nothing short of astounding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Folklore treated as fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am not being insensitive to people's beliefs but this film is based on a story marketed as fact. It is based on a political conflict that is not important to us today and only exists in a biased traditional account. The Egyptians are shown as evil, despotic and barbaric. Egypt was the most advanced, enlightened and sentimental civilisations at the time. It was a place were slaves had equal rights and were more servants then labourers as many Egyptians then would be unemployed. Slaves also became part of the family and there was no prejudice on race. Exodus in real history was written centuries after the events it describes from a political objective with jingoistic racism of Egypt's Canaanite enemies but was most likely based upon the Hyksos invasion and probably on Akhenaton. My opinion is that this film encourages people to hate other people because of their race and difference in culture because a deity has made them " a chosen race" and kills innocent people in the process despite their degree of high culture. What hypocrisy and arrogance and yet when it comes to criticising a different religion thats palatable but when the same is done back that's different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I believe religions are generally the root of most conflicts, terror, wars and discrimination against women, races and gay people. This one-dimensional movie is a perfect bullseye for all Born Again Christians and Jews. For those of us who know as opposed to believe, this movie is a children's cartoon of the bible for use in church.Furthermore i hate the concept of musicals. This movie is perhaps even more of a musical parody than Monthy Pythons "Every sperm is sacred". The tunes are annoying, the lyrics are pathetic.You only live once. Don't waste your precious time on this movie. Watch the grass grow in stead.I hope DreamWorks who has given us great animated fantasy movies can keep their hands off missionary works like this in the future.</fullReview>
