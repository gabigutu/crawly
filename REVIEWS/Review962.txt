		<shortDescription>Kajaki Movie ? 5 Stars: A Must See Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people with military experience I find conventional war films a bit irritating ? Implausible plot lines and ridiculous dialogue along with inaccurate uniforms and weapons tend to detract from the overall impression. The recently released movie Kajaki ? the true story is, in the exception to this trend, and an important contribution to the national mood of reflection on the Afghan conflict.Every aspect of the film is grittily authentic, right down to the banter between the blokes, the detail on the T shirts and the tattoos.The incident will be familiar to many ? in 2006 a patrol from 3 Para stationed at the Kajaki dam wander inadvertently into a legacy minefield from the soviet era with the inevitable unpleasant consequences. What sets this film apart from the crowd is the complete lack of sanitised pastiche violence and a storyline that sticks as closely as possible to the known facts, having had access and co-operation from the surviving members of the patrol, if not from the MOD itself. The movie scrupulously avoids being drawn into discussions about the controversies of the Afghan campaign and the level of resources supplied to the deployed forces, preferring instead to focus completely on the individual soldiers and the events of the day.As a surgeon with extensive experience of landmine injuries, I was hugely impressed with the level of detail in the depiction and treatment of the injuries and the completely unsentimental depiction of the actions that day. Writing in the Sun, Jeremy Clarkson explained that even though he had taken an interest in the Afghan conflict and had been out to see soldiers on deployment, he had absolutely no idea what the reality of battle and injury entailed until he saw the film. I am certain that many civilians and even some serving servicemen will feel the same after seeing the Kajaki movie.Having been released at the same time as the annual ceremonies of remembrance and, co-incidentally, at the same time as the centenary of the First world war and the draw-down from Afghanistan, it is important to remind the UK population that war is not all about artistic installations at the Tower of London, beautiful though those may be. With the Army having the lowest headcount in over a century, the population it serves is more disconnected than ever from the military ? Kajaki conveniently reminds everyone about the realities of conflict.Dan Jarvis MP, himself a former Parachute Regiment officer brought up this very point at Defence Questions in the House of Commons and secured an assurance from the Defence Secretary that he would see the film in person. It should be required viewing for a far wider audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will cringe, laugh, cry and hold your breath in shocked disbelief and utter horror: one of the most intense and most touching war films I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's only a handful of so called "war films" I consider to be films about the actual reality of war. HBO's mini-series 'Generation Kill' is probably the most realistic when it comes to the depiction of modern warfare - but 'Kajaki' (also known as 'Kilo Two Bravo') gives it a run for its money: this criminally little seen masterpiece should be considered a modern classic. The production values are fantastic; the cinematography, the script and the direction are absolutely flawless - but you won't notice them. What you will notice is the outstanding ensemble of actors, portraying characters in a way you forget you're watching a movie. They will make you cringe, laugh, cry and hold your breath in shocked disbelief and utter horror.This film had me literally on the edge of my seat the entire time, but what really grabs you by the gut is not just the suspense and the horror; it's the relationships between these soldiers and how they look out for each other. How close men become when their lives depend on each other has probably rarely been depicted on screen with the intensity and no-bullshît, keep-it-real attitude as is the case here. And knowing that what you're seeing actually happened only adds to the experience (for this film IS an experience). Definitely not the kind of war film that you come across very often. Superb. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved this film. I saw it on its first weekend in Portsmouth and it was incredible. I didn't know the story - but the film is almost unbearably tense and I watched through fingers willing something else to happen but it didn't. I have never seen a film like this before - it really feels like a totally different way to view war - but horrifically realistic at the same time. Fantastic film and everyone should see it...I'm still thinking about the film two days later, and the blokes who were there and also just what it means to be a soldier today. Respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever your views on the war in Afghanistan, this film is an absolute must see. It does not seek to glamorise the cause or glorify the British and American forces. It does not say "them bad us good", and conversely it does not say the allies were arrogant pricks, barging in to a country without rhyme or reason. To do so would miss the real point of the film: which is love, love through adversity.We meet a team of British soldiers holding a position against the Taliban somewhere above the Kajaki dam. However, the presence of the Taliban is merely peripheral and during the course of the film they instead face four very apposite enemies: boredom; incompetence; lack of resources; and a valley full of old Russian land mines. What holds them together through the hardships they endure, both very real and perceived, is love ? and lots and lots of banter.Kajaki does away with the traditional paraphernalia of war films: billowing musical scores, slow-mos, and poignant flashbacks. Quite simply, it doesn't have to, because it isn't one. Instead we are given a film that is clear, crisp and clean; that is relentless, remorseless and uncompromising. The acting is impeccable, the direction and production sublime. It is tense, tragic, uplifting and heart-breaking all at once. Quite simply, it is a love story: love for your country, love for the job, love for your mates. Go see it and be prepared to have your mind blown open by what true love can achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rumours that this might be greatest British war film of all time should not be ignored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a exciting, engaging, harrowing and uplifting film. It is also unique amongst contemporary war films, as far as I know. It bisects perfectly the ground between the enslaved 'dramatic reenactment' on one side and the mendacious 'based-on-real-events' springboard to fantasy on the other, creating a film that sticks to the facts but transcends them as well, showing universal truths and insights that, dare I say it, art should.The characters are strong and engaging, the pace is perfect and the strength of those involved and tragedy of situation brought tears to eyes in between hang wringing tension and leaps from the seat. I slunk lower and lower into my seat as the inevitable yet still terrifying events loomed over me. And on top of that, it looks like a ?20 - ?40 million film - not once did I spot decisions made for budgetary reasons (excellent VFX btw as well as SFX).It's an outstanding, award-winning (it deserves them, anyway) film and was well worth all the blood (mostly fake, I hope), sweat (indeed there is much sweaty torso-ed musculature on show here) and tears (to add to mine) that must have gone in to it's making. GO SEE THIS FILM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big film fan I spend half my day reading the trivia and quotes of famous film makers. Recently I read a quote from Peter Jackson about how he hopes cinema returns to it's more 'original' ways. In a time where re-makes or adapted screenplays are the only films being made, it's Kajaki that's leading in the way in bringing back original cinema. It's been branded as the British Hurt Locker, and it could well be if it has a good scoop at the BAFTA's this year (I think it will). But has has more similarities with big box office hit Lone Survivor with it being a true story. HOWEVER both Hurt Locker and Lone Survivor are so glamorised and glossed over they're as far from true realities of war and military action as Kim Kardashian in her 'Break The Internet' magazine spread. Kajaki doesn't even have the subtle background music every film need. It's so good it has no music! That's a massive achievement. Tell me a good film that's done that! A film that will move you, terrify you and restore your faith in cinema. Just go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling, intense modern war film based on real events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was privileged to attend one of four UK regional charity premieres on Tuesday 25 November ahead of the UK general release at VUE Cinemas on Friday 28 November. Each premiere was located in or near the home town of one the soldiers portrayed in the film such that family and friends could attend, and where possible, the actual people portrayed on- screen too. Bristol is the home town of Stu Hale who was portrayed on- screen by Benjamin O'Mahony. Stu was present at the screening and answered questions with the cast and crew at the Q&amp;A afterwards. A portion of all the ticket sales across the UK goes directly to charities supporting returning servicemen and servicewomen. This all speaks to the very special nature of this film. In his introduction before the screening, director Paul Katis described it as a modern war film. It is indeed, and it takes an honourably neutral view of the conflict. At its heart this is the true story of a group of extremely brave men facing a difficult situation.The action takes place back in September 2006 in Afghanistan where a British army unit is responsible for the security at a key dam, which when fully commissioned, will provide hydroelectric power. Unbeknownst to them, the area is also home to a minefield left-over from the Soviet invasion in 1979/80. On a routine security patrol some of the unit find themselves trapped in the minefield when one of them is seriously injured after stepping upon a mine. Over the course of the film we get to learn more about the characters and see many examples of extraordinary bravery, all of which actually happened. This is powerful storytelling and writer Tom Williams has crafted a screenplay which reflects the truth and helps the audience understand the complexities of the situation. It walks the difficult line between intense and life-threatening action vs. the humour which people can use as a coping mechanism in such situations. Director Paul Katis holds nothing back and the full horrors of war are on display here, including some graphic injuries. This is all done in a non-gratuitous way and is part of the brutal and uncomfortable honesty of the events. I, along with the rest of the audience, sat on the edge of my seat and there are several moments of shocking surprise throughout this tense thriller. This is a film worth going to see in cinemas with an audience and at my screening several spontaneous rounds of applause broke out at key moments in the end credits. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A *war* film (not a Sunday afternoon round the telly war film)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly tough and gritty film, the least glamorous war film I've ever seen, but the portrait of a group of men coping with the most horrendous suffering - because they're all in it together - is something that utterly transcends the banal clichés of the form (cliches that we glimpse in the early scenes, the familiar rookie arriving and having everything explained, the safe and cleanly photographed long distance fire fight), and raises it to an extra level. Their patience is almost Christlike; the 'Happy Birthday' scene is something totally unlike anything else I've ever seen in a British movie. (I can only compare it with some of the old Polish films about the Warsaw uprising - but this is funnier!) Brilliant, brave and grimly funny. I took my sixteen year old son - this should be compulsory viewing for kids of the video game generation, specially if they're thinking of any kind of uniformed career. A hundred times better than such recent fare as 'Lone Survivor' or 'Fury' - I can't recommend this enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of searing honesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being honest in day-to-day life is tough enough. Being honest when you are telling the story of a bunch of hairy-arsed British paras caught up in a minefield in the middle of a nihilistic and nasty little war is a huge challenge. As noted in other reviews, the easy option is to exaggerate, sentimentalise, put vaseline on the lens and fill the air with swooping strings: anything to get away from the reality of what did happen. Kajaki does none of the above. It stays honest and keeps its nerve and challenges you to keep yours, even as yet another shredded leg stabs at the screen. Out of the horror and ugliness is created a clear and radiant beauty born of comradeship, valour and truth. This is the shining soul of Kajaki, something that most films don't even know they lack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 3rd battalion Parachute regiment sniper patrol move to take out a Taliban extortion road block. Whilst crossing a dried out river bed one squaddie detonates a land mine,left over from the Soviet invasion of 1979. His comrades rush to help him only to find themselves trapped in the minefield. Every move is now crucial as there is no way of knowing exactly where the next mine lies.The realistic and brutal effects of the injuries,involving blood saturated, shredded and mangled limbs are depicted brutally. The audience grimly awaits the next inevitable detonations. The amazing bravery,black humour and crude banter of the platoon as they attempt medical assistance and rescue are key features of this nail biting film. One jarring note is the British logistics failure to provide helicopters with winch facilities to lift off the seriously injured men. A Chinook is sent but any landing would surely precipitate mass explosions. The Americans ultimately provide the proper necessary aid.One of the very best war films of all time superbly directed and acted by a previously unknown cast. The movie was shot in Jordan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like war films. Not because I like war, but since it happens I'd like to know more about it. This film isn't like "Platoon", "Hamburger Hill", "Saving Private Ryan" or any other such "Movies". This film isn't like a movie at all. It is so real that it sucks you into every moment as though you were actually there. After the character development, I was literally on the edge of my seat, with my elbows on my knees with my hands holding my cheeks. I saw it at home, so thankfully I was able to pause it to make a cocktail; I needed one because it was that serious. Other war films I have seen and liked; they seem like popcorn fodder compared to this one. I was so engrossed in the progression and actually became angry at war itself like I have never felt before. I wasn't aware it was a true story until the end credits and I cried then. I was emotional throughout the film, not even knowing this. It was so real that I talked not only to myself, but to the characters I was watching.Thankfully, there were no "shaky cameras" like "Inglorious Bastards", making it easy to concentrate on what was really going on. What was going on was disturbing and humbling at the same time. Every scene and every incidence was relevant. I don't even call this film a "movie", because it is better than that. I have never given 10/10 to any film and rarely write reviews, but this one is deserving of a 15/10 if that were possible. If you have any reservations about watching this film, cast them aside and view it. Every aspect of what a perfect film would be about is included in this one. It's not a family film or for those who faint easily. It is gripping, extremely graphic, truthful and simply a masterpiece of cinema. It is deserving of the Academy Award for "Best Picture", "Best Director", "Best Screenplay", "Best Actor", Best Supporting Actor", "Best Cinematography", "Best Editing", "Best Makeup", and of all the films I have ever seen, I put this one on the top of my list, and that isn't an easy feat. With my child love of the "Wizard Of Oz" and my insatiable lust for "Star Trek" and "Star Wars", this film has dethroned all of them. This is the best film I have ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

No one left until the lights went up and the credits ended. How often does that ever happen. A stunning review is indeed required. Everyone should not miss the opportunity to see this. There is no political messaging but you make up your own mind up.

If you haven't served in the British forces you might not get this film, at one point I was sat quietly crying when a guy spat out a one liner that had me in creases. I won't go in to the old "them and us" bit, comparing British soldiers to American soldiers, suffice to say that these guys are very understated hero's. No hullabaloo, no histrionics just guts and above all a camaraderie that cannot be replicated anywhere else. But don't take my word for it, judge for yourself. Please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kajaki essential viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very aware of the incident in 2006, I kept up to date with the planning and logistics, I had personal feedback from cast during filming yet never has a movie hit me so hard as Kajaki. I have seen if twice, the second time hit me harder and I have no doubt I will see it for a third time real soon. The horror of war and the day to day dangers faced by our military in war zones is something that the majority of the British public are, in the main, sheltered from, but this film takes you into the theatre of war, you feel you are watching the day play out for real. You want to jump out from your seat to help, you have well and truly been sucked in to this movie. We are all to use to seeing the repatriation of our service personnel through the small market town of Royal Wootton Bassett but never have we been given the harsh realisation of what they faced. Their screams are piercing, the fear on their faces look real and the injuries look very real. The acting is first rate and this young cast has clearly benefited from spending time with the paras in 'boot camp' and in many cases with the members of 3 para they are portraying. Everyone should try to see this film, it will leave a lasting impression. It's gripping and tense and are no big names, no musical score and no Hollywood-esque glamorisation of what ensues, yet it is the only movie I have seen where no one leaves until the credits have ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic to a degree of excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with no real expectations, however knowing a lot about Kajaki and those who were there in 2006. In the Afghani/War on terror, many movies come out that have no realism, no research, no detail specifications or background information. I found this movie to be on point in all of those categories making it a real and horrifying viewing experience. Controversial war films are rarely made these days. This was a controversial time in the 21st century when many who were in Kajaki in 2006 will, most definitely, relate to and understand. Many war movies use the same army gear, guns, etc however there is a huge difference between all factions, countries, and wars. This movie, if you know a little about war history, just by turning it on you would know the place, incident, and year. The director/costume people did a fantastic job with the accuracy right down to the TATTOOS ON soldiers. Another bold and extremely accurate detail I found was the attention to mines and effect they have when one is triggered. Spot on. The makeup was so real, and accurate, is was like I was there. The men in this movie told a story. The story was the soldiers telling it, not the action going on around it. That is a what I call a fantastic script. A soldier is your brother, or sister, and in a life or death situation, They're not going to just run because it's too dangerous. This film was a showcase of bravery and truth. I wish they had gone a little further with some of the other issues at hand in Kajaki but this was the issue at hand and 10 stars for taking the leap. I don't see any mystery, however.. Not much mystery in this movie, straight up a war drama. A tragic, funny, and a display of brothers in arms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is about a group of British soldiers fighting in Afghanistan and trapped in a mine field. It's just that, a true story, as simple as gripping and unexpected.People, as me, could think why don't just use a mine detector, a robot, but the answer it is simple, the group got trapped off guard and without the necessary tools nearby and in the encampment. Moreover, some mines are made with minimal metal content, hard to detect, they are indeed not much powerful but enough to injure or kill you. Sure, there could be other chances, but the war isn't always like a movie and this one show, with no caricatures, what really happen to these soldiers at that particular juncture.The only flaws in my opinion are that it does not enter much into the characters, which are not really explored in depth, and that the film does not show much more than this unique single event.Another gory aspect of the war.7+/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can highly recommend this film to anyone who can handle the intensity of a gruesome war film. The film starts slow and is filled with typical tough guy war banter and then the intensity jumps dramatically as the film re-creates a real story for Afganistan where soldiers are trapped in a minefield. Gripping, intense, sad, fierce and powerful. It is not a political film, but will get you to think deeply about the wars of the middle East and how we fight them. A very well made film that often feels like a documentary. Flawless filming and acting to make you feel there.This film is NOT for everyone. This film is quite gruesome and captures the reality of land mines. NOTE: The heavy British accents required us to turn on captions.I wanted to score the film an 8.5, but upgraded to a 9 based on powerful filming, intensity, real-ness and solid acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie, this no chocolate-coated Hollywood make believe. First of all the viewer has to realise that unlike so many previous films that describe themselves as 'based upon a true story' this film actually does lay bare the incredible events in 2006 at the Kajaki Dam, stunning the viewer with a credible recreation of the events as well as recognising the magnitude of these soldiers heroism. Every scene in 'Kajaki' has its origin in fact as recorded by numerous witnesses and laid out for the public and press in the numerous inquests that followed. The level of the movie's military realism is exceptional, the locations perfect and the banter strictly 'green army' (regular army). I've taken note of a couple of armchair generals comments, quick to denigrate British troops for their quiet determination and courage, instead they twist it, concluding instead that the soldiers involved were 'incompetent'. Well, take a moment to search for 'Chinook inquest: Caught in the Kajaki landmine trap' I think that the coverage from a notoriously left-wing newspaper with a history of criticising British armed forces will clarify just how brave these young men were and how we the audience should take a moment to pause in wonder at their dedication, resolve, and tenacity. In closing, ask yourselves, exactly how would you do in the middle of a minefield mortally wounded, would you lie there screaming or dress your own wounds, get up, tend to your comrades injuries and arrange transport? These men are giants in the classic sense and it was my privilege to witness them in action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its Afghanistan and a unit of British soldiers charged with defending a nearby dam find themselves caught in a minefield left over from the war with the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Here mines are the unseen enemy as friends and comrades try and save each other from a left over relic which they didn't even know was there. True life dramas are always a tricky proposition, especially when depicting events where someone has actually died. You risk offending those involved when the subject matter isn't treated with care and honesty plus these are not always an easy commercial sell either. Here, such fears are unfounded. With a relative unknown cast this film becomes all the more powerful and the subject matter is given all the realism and care that it rightly deserves. This is not an action movie, and its about the bravery that exists between comrades when their lives are on the line. Here there is no enemy in human form and everything is about making the next decision or the next mistake. Its a realistic depiction of the kind of difficulties we face in conflict and a sharp reminder that even relics from a war all but forgotten can go on to kill young men today. While it might lack the punch of the snap of bullets from Lone Survivor this is an equally powerful film and no less tense or well made. Sharply directed and scripted, what really holds your attention here are the performances of the cast and special mention must be made of David Elliot, who plays anchor role so seamlessly you could believe he has been in the army for years. Coming across as the brother you always wanted to have, you feel every part of his predicament. I predict big things for this actor, the fact that he isn't so well known now serves the film well making it all the more visceral to watch. You believe your right there with these guys and you share his pain and those around him. I hope his performance and that of his excellent co-stars is not overlooked when the awards come along. This is a very good, if tough film to watch, but you would should see it. Riveting, painful and explosive, your feel every emotion possible before you leave the cinema and that my friends is good film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without question, the best depiction of the Afghanistan insanity yet produced. It makes the Hollywood attempts appear shallow and contrived by comparison. And, it's a true story. Excellent in all respects, from acting, technical presentation, and photography, to location selection and choice of cast. My only gripe is a need for subtitles. The one I saw had none and for those of us with limited skills in Brit accents, there were times when it was tough to understand some of the conversations. That said, it in no way detracts from a magnificent film. Be advised, this is gut wrenching and will leave you drained. I hope it gets a wider distribution in the U.S. No political statements, no canned viewpoints, just realism and well done from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's a good movie showing what's behind the scenes , Stories we aren't suppose to know about especially military stuff which is so classified , This movie is showing us how soldiers are risking their lives to get the job done , Beside it's based on a true story so that's a plus for me since I love movies based on true stories, but what I didn't like is that most of the movie they are focusing on one thing in the same area I don't want to spoil it but what I can say is there is a lot of disturbing scenes even if that what really happens but when converting any story into a movie it suppose to have that cinematic plot a way to keep audience thrilled not just copy past it like re-acting what's happening in the exact way ! This is the reason my rating is 6/10 otherwise it could be better and would deserve 7/10 :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional true story of the realities of war...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kajaki was released in November of 2014 in the United Kingdom before being released in the United States as Kilo Two Bravo one year later. The film is based on the true story of a British Army unit (call sign: Kilo Two Bravo), which was part of the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, positioned near the Kajaki dam in Afghanistan. On September 6, 2006, the unit was on a routine patrol when they entered a dried out riverbed. When one soldier steps on a landmine, the others rush to his aid and find that they are surrounded by unmarked mines.Kilo Two Bravo is the directorial debut of Paul Katis, which (not surprisingly), earned him a nomination for a British Academy Film Award. This film is realistic in so many ways ? from the landscape, realistic gore and violence, all the way down to the emotions and language of its characters. Be warned, this film is not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare that I'll see a film which compels me to write a review about it, let alone a highly positive one, but Kajaki had such an impact on me that I felt that I had to type a few words.Such a compelling and harrowing movie which is brilliantly written, directed and acted. Why has this not gained more recognition and acclaim? Is it because many people aren't comfortable with seeing genuine suffering? Are they too used to being told what to think by the politicians and the media? This is one of those films which I would encourage everyone to see, however uncomfortable it may make you feel.It's also now on Netflix (UK at least at the time of writing).Absolutely superb. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True story of British soldiers stuck in a minefield, where even a wrong step can mean death, after an accident during their deployment in Afghanistan. It is a honest endeavour into capturing the battle scene, neither is there any effort to exaggerate it neither to sentimentalize it, but only to show the reality. And it has no agenda, it doesn't debates on why they went into Afghanistan and whether it was right or wrong. It is free of glamour and glitz that we are accustomed to through big budget American war films and the agenda that they carry. According to experts it is horrifyingly authentic in its portrayal. This film brings to the screen the brutality of mines and one can't help but compare this with what our soldiers, of Pakistan army, have been experiencing in northern areas. A must see as it reminds us the bitter realities of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once I finished watching, said 'wow'. It can mean in many ways like the movie was stunning, edgy and probably best war flick of the 2014. Yep, there's no doubt in that, at least to me among those I've seen. It was a low budget British war-drama-thriller based on the real event that takes place in the year 2006, Afghanistan. The director was a documentary filmmaker, and I'm happy he chose to make it a movie. But still it looks like a semi-documentary and powerful.In the backdrop of the Kajaki dam valley where one of the British army camp lies in a mountain top, one morning a military unit goes for a routine checkup in the surrounding area. It was not an usual day, a tragedy strikes and followed by a series of mishaps that leaves the entire team in a critical situation and so the other teams who come to assist. They risk their lives to rescue each other. Coming from the England, laying under the burning sun as the injured, they might have felt a very close to hell. The rest of the story is coming out of it, or would they?I must agree with many who had seen this said, it is tough to watch. Because everything looked so real, sometimes the pain was felt if your focus was thorough. Especially if you are a kind hearted, your heart rate might go up. It is not all about predictable, we know what might happen because of the following scenes after the first blow, it's one way or another. But how, where, when and who is the question. Anytime, anything might happen, the screenplay was genuine in that matter. Once the tension parts begin, it was unstoppable, it will pull you out of your chair often."This whole country is full of sht left behind when armies fkd off."The whole film was shot in one location and its close by zone. It was in Afghanistan, according to the story, but the film was shot in Jordan. Very well utilised the locations, camera angles, the performances were top notch. I don't know anyone from the cast, but they were the best. Well, you won't forget the film after a watch, at least for a week maybe. You don't have to compare it with American war movies. This was not high-tech military combat, but just a simple story with one breathtaking circumstance.What really disturbs is to know it was a real story. The unit was small and the head office did not provide them a proper equipments like well working radio sets, metal detectors et cetera which caused the disaster. You know, in the war its not like, take your gun and go kill the enemies like the John Rambo. There is types of war that fought in different style. In this film, these young soldiers were making sure and reporting the movements of the enemy in a nearby checkpoint. What happens was they caught in an unexpected trap and afterwards it turns human emotions.I don't remember seeing a better war film from Britain, at least not recently. This film totally shocked me which was unexpected from an unheard title. As usual, taking chances in the unpopular movies gave me an opportunity to discover the hidden gem and I want to spread this word as much as possible far its reach. If you are reading this, especially you are an adult, I definitely highly recommend it. Don't anticipate a complete combat, but it'll give one hundred per cent of the theme under this narration takes place.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in 2006 a team from 3 Para of the British Army set out to intercept a Taliban patrol. They were based at the Kajaki Dam in Helmand province in the south of Afghanistan. In order to have cover they chose to use a wadi (a dry river bed). Unbeknown to them the area has been mined by the Russian Army when they occupied the country in the 1980's.What follows is based on actual events and the efforts of the men to extricate the wounded in the face of dreadful odds where you never know when the next unstable mine will blow.This is not only upsetting it is also edge of seat stuff. All of the performances are exceptional. Mark Stanley ('Game of thrones') plays the medic ? Tug and he puts in an extraordinary performance. This is well filmed, directed and acted and deals with a part of war that is less seen in films but is just as much a reality when dealing with modern warfare. This is a film that has the power to move and upset you but is all the more praiseworthy for having done so. I hope it is a fitting tribute to the men who took part in this action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is an intense movie depicted on the Kajaki Landmine Incidence. The acting and graphics are realistic and takes the viewer to the war scene. The movie starts off showing the life of Nato soldiers deployed in Afghanistan. One day, 3 soldiers go on a regular scan of an area. One of them steps on a landmine and looses a limb. Others come to his rescue but become victims of more land mines. A rescue chopper ends up blowing up a landmine injuring more. In the end, a chopper with a winch rescues all of the soldiers. Three of the soldiers loose their life. The movie does a great job of showing these intense moments and keeps the viewers always on the edge expecting a landmine to blow up every other second. The movie does justice in showing the extreme pain that soldiers endure during this incident.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knowing the story beforehand I was curious to see how the makers of this film could come up with a well rounded movie.Unfortunately, they didn't. After a very short introduction to the main characters, all with strong British accents which even I had trouble understanding (British born Australian), we are taken to the minefield. Yes I jumped a couple of times, but then found there was no pace. There was too much unedited conversation and no action or tension.It is a shame that the film makers didn't provide more background, showing how tough you have to be, to be a British Paratrooper, and some of the previous actions they had been involved in leading up to the mines. This would have probably conveyed more the futility of being killed or wounded by Russian mines planted many years earlier. Just showing realistic portrayals of mine strikes does not a great movie make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember seeing a film as intense and as harrowing as Kajaki in a very long time. This is brilliant British independent film about a group of British soldiers in Afghanistan and while on a routine manoeuvre get caught in a minefield . Any wrong move can and does result in them losing limbs or worse. None of the actors are well known and could easily pass for real British military. The dialogue and banter between the men is spot on , even when they are extreme pain and in life threatening situations the dry sense of humour continues and it feels absolutely right but this is no comedy. Some of the scenes are extremely gruesome and in a kind of way this is a horror film. This was nominated for a Bafta earlier in the year and how it didn't win i don't know. First time director Paul Katis has created an absolute gem of a movie here and i highly recommend everyone see it. It's widely available to buy now.</fullReview>

It does not rely on music, or any artificial tension-enhancing trickery, to create a very tangible sense of fear and dread in the audience.Finally, it pulls no punches about the consequences of what is happening to the characters -- the audience is left feeling pulverized by this film, and, occasionally, it is worth seeing a film that has that impact on you and leaves you trying to process what you have just seen for a long time after it has finished.</fullReview>

Even though I'm far from a film critic, I have to say that this brit low budget war film was literally outstanding, graphic, striking and extremely powerful... Not forgetting how beautifully shot, cast, edited and brilliantly directed.As a producer, have some idea of the work, sacrifice, blood, guts, tears and everything else that goes into creating such a splendid and vivid piece of cinema. Gareth Unwin and his team have, plainly "pulled the rabbit out of the hat" and produced something, which gives real and great credit to all those brave souls who serve and have served in the forces. But be warned, although "Kajaki" is just brilliant, on the same field it is absolutely brutal and gives no quarter in depicting the essence and viciousness of war. Every once and a while along comes a film, which you need to see, and "Kajaki" is no exception. Well done to all involved in making this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy- but short of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are far too few films about the Afghanistan/ Iraq conflict and "Kajaki" is a worthy effort to redress that imbalance. Low budget, and with a cast without big names, authenticity is the quality which seeps through every blood stained pore of this story. Filmed in Jordan, the heat and landscape convince.No attempt is made to comment on the politics of why they are there. There are no bad guys versus good guys, just a small patrol of soldiers who find themselves trapped in an unmarked Soviet era minefield.The dialogue is salty, laced with trooper black humour, the action limited to a handful of explosions. The drama is wholly one of their unpredictable, entrapment of unseen danger.Although the heroism of all involved is impressive, the camaraderie heart-warming, this soldier's tale stops well short of greatness. Attention to detail, eschewing dramatic opportunity ,results in a strangely muted affair. An American film would have had a Taleban attack bravely repulsed, evil locals getting their comeuppance with a mass Black Hawk strike, and intra group tensions resolved with the quiet guy coming good.As a film which portrays the casual violence of war, and how soldiers deal with it, the result is admirable. But the dialogue is not quite good enough, or the drama and sense of jeopardy sufficiently pressing, for this to reach classic status.</fullReview>

Yes, granted they where difficult to understand being such thick accents, however i felt that this really added to my enjoyment of the movie - I liked the characters, had some interesting characters each with their own individual traits. now the things i didn't like that made this movie quite silly.-the biggest thing that i found bothered me in this movie, is that it nearly entirely takes placed in a ravine-Landmines are the bad guy in the movie-SEND MORE PEOPLE INTO THE LANDMINE PIT, they didn't learn their lesson the first two times. -their non functioning radio is a major plot piece, and it doesn't really do anything other than cause frustration and more delay to the story.-soldiers lay there on the ground in the minefield and have lengthy conversations while waiting for either another land mine or help to arrive. these conversation moments are drawn out and quite boring. Overall, I would say that I still did somewhat enjoy this movie, but mostly for the scenery and the characters. If you really don't have anything better to watch then i would say give it a try, but otherwise you can give it a pass and you wont be missing much other than landmines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I met the academy award winning producer today (Gareth Unwin, The Kings Speech) after being shown his latest film, Kajaki, I must say if he carries on to produce films like these then he will fast become my favourite producer.Kajaki follows a team of British special forces officers in Afganistan after they discover a desolate, drained riverbed which contains a minefield. We are then given what can only be described as an intense race against the clock to save the lives of men who have been caught in the explosions whilst their teammates struggle to get to them as a result of being at risk of setting one off.When i say this film is intense i mean that it is extremely INTENSE. We are kept on the edge of our seats watching these men battle through this ticking timebomb of a minefield. Every time a character takes a step I was biting my fingernails down to the bone thinking a mine would set off. This is the tone throughout most of the movie. We feel like these men would in the terrible situation they are put through. Yet when a mine does go off we still don't expect it which really makes the film all the more intense, a real white-knuckle experience.Although the film does have a slow start where we get to see life behind the scenes, it pays off. It was good to see this at first but it started to get stale as we had seen this sort of thing before. But once that first mine goes off we are given an entirely new experience that we have never seen the likes off before. If you are squeamish this may not be the film for you as we see a lot of realistic and graphic images of limbs being blown off, but if you don't mind seeing these images Kajaki is a real treat and i highly recommend it as a film that is realistic and nail bitingly entertaining</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 6th September 2006 is a date that will forever be etched into the memories of many, this day is known as the "Day of Days". Soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (3 Para), together with support were stationed at Kajaki Dam in Afghanistan. On that day several of the soldiers sustained horrific injuries after stumbling into an unmarked minefield in a dried out riverbed. My brother Stu Pearson was one of them.The events of the "Day of Days" have had an enormous effect on all involved, their friends and families for over 8 years. I had the privilege of attending the Glasgow premier. Kajaki is an astonishing film, at times it is almost too hard to take, as the film is not a "dramatisation of" or "based on" the events of that day, Kajaki is the TRUE story. The film is not political, the arguments about whether or not we should have been in Afghanistan could be argued for eternity, the film is about a group of mates who have been thrown into a truly awful situation and must rely on each other to survive.I implore everyone to watch this film, it is extremely graphic depiction at times; however, it is without a doubt one of the greatest British "War" films ever made.Thank you to all involved for making the film a fitting tribute to the memory of all affected by the events of the "Day of Days".</fullReview>

I read many books about warfare when I studied history (specialized in WW2). Minefields have always been ugly. There are a lot of maimed children in Cambodia to tell a horrific tale. But? this movie just did not grab me. They get in the minefield by accident early on. Some go off. People get hurt. People get scared. And that's about it. Minefields... Ugly?

If this is really the sequence how true events happened those officers should be court martial-ed (not given medals)...OK you got to the first casualty... by pure luck...prevented bleeding etc. etc. but then STOP WALKING AROUND... don't call choppers on your head to roll some stones downhill and activate a few more landmines and add few hundreds shrapnel's to already lethal device. Don't hop around like a bunny...Again if this is a true sequence of true events... those officers should be court martial-ed... if not the director doesn't know a "beeep" about military, infantry, minefields or landmines...I would sooner believe that a whole platoon was caught in a minefield, with five man instantaneously got maimed or killed and a heroic medic who improvised and took great risk to save his buddies... but then the movie and the script would be pretty boring... We would watch what? Heroic medic? Sitting in the minefield and listening to the cries of the wounded while waiting for helicopters? If this is "director's freedom" he could easily change daytime to night... remember... they were going to set up an ambush... some night-vision shots... getting caught in the minefield under Taliban's fire... traces zipping like lasers all around them... total chaos and heavy fighting... budget...budget... budget...Like this... it's lukewarm...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bunch of British morons dancing in the mine field and paid reviews!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>starts with a bunch of Brits overseeing a valley from the top of a hill. bunch of crude jokes and language while they oversee some Afghan dissidents in the valley. and three of them decide to go closer to some enemies to smash them and now it gets stupid. they are walking around knowing there are mines scattered. one bloke gets to have a foot less. the guys start screaming and agitating and trying to help and another step on a mine while dumbly walking around. the chopper comes in trying to help and i see some more soldiers bleeding. at this point i just could not stand it.isn't it that mine detectors are standard equipment and a lot cheaper than legs, chippers and fancy weapons? i hoped for something better but all i see a bunch of morons walking thoughtlessly on the minefield and then screaming and crying.ps: i see lots of 10+ reviews calling you to "go see the movie". the movie is great... if you are brain dead or if you are PAID TO GIVE GREAT REVIEW. cheaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blisful Brainwashed thrash movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another movie that perpetuates the idea that people serve for one reason to protect. You do not serve to protect, You serve to goals and ideals of the money hungry corrupted government and there bosses the corporations. They don't care if you die. They want to use you like they do all other people. I am sick and tired of seeing such garbage, Real story or otherwise its just wrong! How many War movies have there been? How many remakes of movies crappy takes? The Screen Writers , directors Producers You lot need to be more creative you need to come up with some actual decent movies! Bloody hell! I mean seriously. FOR YOUR GOVERNMENT YOU SERVE TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE CORPORATIONS. For your people you serve to perpetuate there Slavery. We are not safe we are not free we are slaves!</fullReview>
