		<shortDescription>Them there eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for everything you've ever wanted to know about horror, mystery, depression, and suspense, go take a peek into Ingrid Bergman's eyes.The actress -- who would soon become blacklisted after her marriage to Italian director Roberto Rossellini -- can convey every emotion and nuance of her character through her amazingly expressive eyes. Completely believable in George Cukor's Gaslight as a wife whose husband (Charles Boyer) is trying to make insane, Bergman can show you all her turmoil and emotional stress just by looking around.The plot is simple, perhaps even arcane. A famous opera singer is murdered in London, leaving behind no motive, no clues, and Paula, the young niece who discovered the body. Paula is sent to Italy, where she, too, studies music, until she elopes with an older, dashing pianist (Boyer). He convinces her to move back to the exact same house where her aunt was murdered, where nothing has been changed in all those years. And, naturally, here is where the movie really begins.Soon, her husband starts acting very strangely, and starts convincing her that she is very ill and unable to go out. Trapped in the house, alone with her husband, a somewhat-deaf cook, and a tart of a housekeeper, Paula soon starts to hear noises, see things, lose things, and even hide things. Or is she? Is she going mad? Or is her husband -- who she is supposed to love, honor, and obey -- making her mad?The show is Bergman's to steal, and she does so with gusto, garnering an Oscar for her endeavor. With her performance, Bergman transforms the character of Paula Alquist from a weak, paranoid wimp of a wife into a woman struggling with her own identity and her role in marriage and society. Perhaps unintentionally, perhaps unwittingly, Bergman's Paula is a symbol and a superhero for all women trapped in an abusive marriage. Even today.Granted, the story line is somewhat contrived, and one can't help but wonder how Paula never notices that her husband is completely evil BEFORE the marriage. Also, Joseph Cotten, as the Scotland Yard detective smitten with Paula's beauty, seems to come out of nowhere. Still, the acting prevails over the plot, and what better actor to come out of nowhere than Cotten? His charm and charisma make up for his character's two-dimensionality.Although there are faults, Gaslight is an extraordinary film, generating its suspense not from an evil lurking in the shadows, but from the psychology of the mind itself. Perhaps one of the first "pure" psychological thrillers, Gaslight, just like Ingrid Bergman's eyes, contains the perfect blend of mystery, suspense, and beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Chilling Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a big fan of older movies myself (for some reason I really don't know) I decided to go out on a recommendation and rent "Gaslight." And I must be honest, I was impressed.When Paula was younger, her aunt with whom lived with in Thornton Square in London was murdered by a strangler roaming the streets. Paula goes to stay in Italy, and some time later, meets Gregory. She and Gregory plan to marry, and after they do, they move to London, back to the exact house Paula lived in. Not too long after, Paula starts to become "forgettful," as Gregory tells her. In fact, he tells her a lot of things...and she believes him. Then things she knows she had put somewhere or remembered doing seem nonexistent, and Paula is left to wonder if her sanity is in check. Then, many times, she starts hearing footsteps, and the gaslights are going down a lot. Is Paula going crazy, or is she being haunted by her dead aunt's spirit...or is it something far more sinister?I liked this movie a lot. Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyet were amazing. Bergman portrays her character's emotions to the point that you feel the same way she does. And Boyet is pure evil in this one. Many times watching this, I was thinking, "He is so terrible to her!" It was so psychological, how everything eveloped. The best scene in the whole movie took place at the reception, when Gregory tells Paula he lost his watch, and then finds it in her purse. Then she bursts into tears, and it was so absolutely amazing how the scene was pulled off. In fact, it was so subtle it was scary. You wouldn't expect a missing watch found in her purse to be such a big deal, but it is such a strong scene. The one thing I didn't like about this otherwise nearly flawless movie was the climax. It was just too dull to me, and the only part I really liked was Paula's wicked sarcasm towards Gregory while they're in the attic. She truly did deserve the Best Actress Oscar for her acting, but nothing could mask the fact that the climax was just too weak. If it had a bit of a touchup, this movie would be perfect.All in all, I recommend this without hesitation. It is absolutely amazing, and I could watch it again and still enjoy it, and that is quite rare for me. So, I recommend you find this wherever you can and give it a chance. It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman experiences the murder of the aunt who has raised her. Ten years later, she returns to the house in which it happened with her new husband (Charles Boyer). Something is wrong, though, as her husband, once so kind to her, grows cold and cruel. Furthermore, Bergman begins to lose things, misplace things, and develop a case of kleptomania, or at least that's her husband's explanation. Boyer convinces his wife that she is going insane, that she is sick, and she becomes little more than a shut-in. She becomes paranoid, especially at her maids (the younger of which is played by Angela Lansbury in her first film role). Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten, a detective, gets an inkling that something is up in that household, and that it might be related to the aunt's murder. Gaslight is a very atmospheric film. The black and white cinematography is full of shadows, and there are interesting things going on in the focus. The music is also quite excellent, and very original. Classical music is also used to great effect. The plot is great, although maybe a tiny bit predictable (it didn't harm my enjoyment of the film whatsoever). The performances are top-notch, although Cotten doesn't add much to the picture. I mean, he's good, but his role perhaps isn't the one the original playwright or the screenwriters were most interested in. Anyone probably could have done just as well. Bergman's performances is to be counted amongst her best. Charles Boyer, an actor with whom I am unfamiliar, is so wicked in the film. You hate him, but you've got to admit it's an effective performance! And I can't finish without praising Angela Lansbury. Dame May Whitty also has a nice supporting role, although the role - the comic relief - is sometimes used at a bad time. I don't think, for instance, she should have come back in during the final sequence. Anyway, little flaws don't detract much from this masterpiece. Bravo, Mr. Cukor! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foggy nights in London's Thornton Square</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patrick Hamilton's "Angel Street", an American stage classic, was turned into "Gaslight" in 1944. This atmospheric account about a woman being driven out of her mind, was directed by George Cukor. The film has always been a favorite of classic movie fans all over the world because it holds the viewer interested in watching the psychological drama with echoes of Gothic overtones, unfold on the screen.This was not the first adaptation of Mr. Hamilton's play, although in our humble opinion, it is much better than the previous account, in part helped by the great cast that Mr. Cukor assembled to portray these characters. Thanks to the magnificent black and white cinematography by Joseph Ruttengerg and the musical score by Bronislau Kaper, the film ultimately rewards the viewer.We are taken to No. 9 Thornton Square, at the start of the film. A murder of a famous opera singer has been committed. We watch as a young woman is taken away. Paula, is being sent away to Italy to recuperate from the tragedy she has just witnessed. The idea was for her to follow her aunt, the murdered diva's footsteps, but just listening to the young woman sing, one realizes opera is not going to gain a new star.The young pianist, Greorgy Anton, who is seen at Maestro Gardi's home, seems to be in love with Paula; she, in turn, has fallen in love with this much older figure. They prepare to return to London and live in the house at Thornton Square. Paula, alas, is not too happy because of her traumatic experience there. Little by little we watch as Gregory, now in charge of the household, begins to terrorize his wife. The key seems to be hidden in the attic where all the things that belonged to the late diva has been stored.A young man living near the Antons, Brian Cameron, takes an interest in what he sees is definitively wrong with the woman at No. 9, and takes things into his own hands. It's through this man's intervention that Paula is able to see all that has been inflicted upon her. Whatever Gregory has done, succeeded in giving Paula a deep sense of insecurity and fear.Ingrid Bergman, who makes a magnificent Paula, was born to play this troubled woman. She is seen as a young girl at the beginning of the film, then as a blossoming beautiful woman and at the end she is transformed into a person afraid of her own shadow. One look into Ms. Bergman's eyes and we know what's going on in her mind. She conveys all the emotions convincingly. There's not a thing wrong with her performance.Charles Boyer also makes a great Gregory Anton, a man who is duplicitous and sly, with a hidden agenda to get whatever he can out of poor Paula. Gregory is an evil man who will go to great lengths to get what he wants. Gregory Anton offered the actor one of his best characters. His chemistry with Ms. Bergman is wonderful.The other supporting characters are well performed, especially by a young and interesting Angela Lansbury, who plays the parlor maid, Nancy. Joseph Cotten, on the other hand, seems to be out of character as Brian Cameron. His American accent ruins his appearance and we don't believe in him. Dame May Witty is about the sunniest one in this film."Gaslight" is an excellent way to spend the time in the company of Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer, thanks to the detailed production directed by George Cukor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Kept Secrets: Gaslight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first scene establishes the dreary tone of the film. It is nighttime in London and a murder goes unsolved. The magnificent Ingrid Bergman portrays Paula, the niece of the deceased woman. After living ten years trying to forget the past, Paula returns to her house in London at the suggestion of her new husband, Gregory (Charles Boyer). "I've found peace in loving you," Paula says and decides with the help of her husband, she is ready to face the past. Fear is an essential element in the story. It seems the police cannot find a motive for the murder but when a new young assistant comes to Scotland Yard, he sees something that others did not notice or would not pursue. The murderer remains at large and his next potential victim has returned to the very house where the first murder was committed.The cast's flawless talent makes the film absolutely unforgettable. Charles Boyer is exceedingly ominous as Paula's obsessive husband. As the high-strung wife, Ingrid Bergman gives an outstanding performance. She is startling and brilliant. Brian Cameron, played by Joseph Cotton, makes his appearance later in the film but is wonderful nonetheless. Watch for the emphasis on foreshadowing and the beautiful lighting achieved in Gaslight, as well as the particular attention to the many details that make it spectacular. George Cukor's fantastic direction of this intriguing and suspicious tale will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Crafted, Well-Acted Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This American-made version of the English thriller "Gaslight" is well-crafted and well-acted, with many moments of good suspense and tension.Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer work very well in the two leads, and they get considerable help from the rest of the cast and the production.The character of the fragile, self-doubting Paula is an ideal role for Bergman, who conveys Paula's anxious uncertainty while keeping her sympathetic and even engaging. Boyer likewise comes across very believably as her calculating husband, and the two leads make their characters into a strong foundation for the tense story.Joseph Cotten does not really seem as if he could be a Scotland Yard detective, but in a more general way, he succeeds pretty well as a sympathetic policeman who wants to help personally while striving to get at the facts of the matter. A very young Angela Lansbury gives her character some pointed moments, and she becomes a useful part of creating the right atmosphere.The story does, of course, have some less plausible elements, but it is written carefully enough that the seams rarely show. In fact, it seems to have been constructed rather carefully, so as to provide subtle hints that can be made use of later on. It all makes for a satisfying drama that also provides a pretty good showcase for its stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good suspense film that could have been great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman plays Paula, an orphaned Victorian-era Londoner whose opera-singer aunt is murdered at the beginning of the movie. She moves to Italy to follow in her aunt's footsteps as a diva, but falls in love and returns to London with her new husband (Boyer) to live in her aunt's empty house. There, she becomes the victim of a carefully-orchestrated campaign to drive her insane.GASLIGHT is richly atmospheric, mostly well-acted, and beautifully photographed. There are chills aplenty as seemingly innocent people grow progressively creepier, and the movie is well-paced with each successive scene increasing Paula's terror. The climax is tense and has a certain poetic justice to it.The chief flaw in the movie is that we are clearly shown from the beginning that Paula is the victim of a third party and is not insane. Thus we cannot share the doubts and terror that she feels. We are not, like her, wondering if we can trust our senses, but merely wondering who is doing this to her. And the latter question isn't very challenging to answer. With a little more subtlety, Cukor could have left us as much in the dark as Paula about why she is experiencing so many strange phenomena, and made this effective little film into a true masterwork of suspense. As it is, GASLIGHT is good, but fails to achieve its potential to match such classics as REBECCA or VERTIGO.Bergman and Boyer make a very dynamic on-screen duo. The film does suffer from Joseph Cotten, whose apple-pie American accent makes for a very unconvincing Scotland Yard inspector. Angela Lansbury is delightfully saucy in her film debut as a Cockney maidservant. Dame May Whitty provides effective comic relief.GASLIGHT is well worth a rental at any price, so long as your expectations aren't overly high.Rating: *** (out of ****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one classy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Cukor's 1944 Hollywood suspense flick "Gaslight" was originally made in 1940 in England under the title "Murder in Thorton Square". When the Hollywood producers got a hold of this hot commodity, they attempted to make the original film vanish from sight and memory by destroying many of the prints. Interesting how this particular tale parallels some of the mental manipulations employed in the film itself.This tense, atmospheric film takes place in London in the 1870's several years after a murder shocked the residents of Thorton Square. Paula, the niece of the deceased woman, has inherited her aunt's house. Strange things start happening when she begins to occupy the place with her new husband. Through a steady thematic build we watch as she slowly loses her mind. "Gaslight" is a classic psychological thriller in the vein of the best Hitchcock with Ingrid Bergman, fresh off "Casablanca", stealing the show as the innocent victim of mental illness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solidly-written ground-breaking psychological mystery; it's Bergman's show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gaslight" (1944) was in its time first a play by Patrick Hamilton and next a psychological thriller of great influence. Since the work was directed by George Cukor, one expects fine performances, and the film delivers several of these; it is in fact unusually well-done in many respects in my judgment. The screenplay by John Van Druten, Walter Reisch and John Balderston has also been widely admired for retaining the theatrical tension of the original work. As produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr., this intelligent but somewhat unsettling drama features understated music by Bronislau Kaper, the fine cinematography of Joseph Ruttenberg, art direction by the great Cedric Gibbons, unusually good set decorations by Edwin B. Willis and costumes design by Irene (Sharaff). But because of the understatement of its scenes, the lack of large scenes of action and image, and the sheer amount of its meaningful dialog, it is an actor's film. The minor players such as Dame May Witty as the heroine's neighbor, Tom Stevenson as Wlliams the policeman, Angela Lansbury as the saucy aid, Barbar Everest as the faithful maid Elizabeth, Emil Rmeau as the maestro, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Halliwell Hobbes and Edmund Breon and Lawrence Grossman range in ability from good to exceptional. As the policeman who discerns what is going on that troubles the heroine, played by Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotten is dashing, attractive and acceptable as both potential lover and man of action. Charles Boyer has in this film a thankless role, that of a devouring immoralist who has only two possible moods-- brief burst of anger needing to be controlled and an exuded charm that must be slightly overdone at times. These moods he plays very professionally at all points, his timing being not the least of his accomplishments during the film. In the difficult role of a Victorian young woman of intelligence, honesty and vulnerability, Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman earns the award by sustaining a sunny and intelligent personality undergoing a series of slowly-revealed and subtle attacks from her husband, who is trying to convince her she is incapable of independent function. Everything in the film--lighting, use of flights of stairs, objects, blocking, gestures, observers, character and dialog contribute to the overall effect. Even the title, referring to the mysterious changes in the lighting of the house Bergman and Boyer inhabit has meaning here. The film is not a sunny one; but the suspense is in my opinion rather admirably sustained. In tribute to its quality as a drama, I can only say that in the more than six decades since the film was created, no imitation of its male to female menace has come close to achieving anything really approaching its sterling qualities. To have ushered in a sub-genre--the Victorian menaced-female type, and set so high a mark is no small feat. The mystery's solid construction and simplicity of design certainly play a part in the building of its sustained fascination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological terror distilled and made utterly palpable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gaslight (1944)This is an uncharacteristic film for George Cukor, slipping sideways into Hitchcock turf for this period. Psychological suspense was never more focused, and less distracted, than you'll find in Gaslight however. You might find the plot too linear, to predictable overall, to be blown away, but in fact that's partly why the suspense works. As with great Hitchcock, you have a sense of where you going, and you want to stop it.So we have Charles Boyer, smarmy, deceptive, and ultimately evil, leading his new wife down a path of mental anguish and, he hopes, madness. The wife is played with usual high stakes perfection by Ingrid Bergman (between her stunning roles in Casablanca and Spellbound). Cukor gets the most of her excesses, and her nuances. Boyer is more nuance, and is a perfect match. The movie is really about their back and forth, with Joseph Cotten making his appearance as a necessary line of safety and hope because we can't stand to see the woman go down without a fight.Most of the film occurs in an old, lavishly decorated house, and the lights and camera-work are dreamy, dripping in rim light and shadow, in odd angles and closeups of their faces. It's quite an involving experience, and because you are limited to mostly these two characters, you get very intimate with them. Yes, the two maids are perfect, including a sassy Angela Lansbury in her first movie role. And the cop, too, is a classic bobby, handsome and cooperative.The plot, alas, is the one weakness here. The man's obsession with gems is fair enough, but when we finally get to the attic, after many months of him being there searching for them, it's as if he's up there for the first time, opening drawers with cobwebs on them, scattering through drawers like a thief with five minutes and no more. It just undermines the whole premise of a man resolutely devoting his whole devious, murderous life to this one goal.So forget the plot, exactly. It's a MacGuffin. The real movie is in the acting, the characters in their personal wringings out, and in how beautifully it is done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting classic but it's hard to suspend disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1944 movie is obviously a classic and to mention "Gaslight" is to refer to one spouse who tries to drive the other insane. The storyline is based on a 1940 British movie of the same name which was based on a British play of the 1930s. That's an important factor because the psychological/psychiatric sophistication of expert treatment personnel in that era -- or the general public's sophistication -- was pretty primitive. That makes the story plausible for THAT time; it's far less so for many of us now. People in those years did not understand where madness comes from. This movie suggests that it's easy for one person to quite deliberately drive another person mad.I'm a retired clinical psychologist with 40 years of practice, 10 of them in state hospitals and then, for 30 years, some of my outpatient clients had been hospitalized. It's NOT that one person could not shake the grasp on reality of another. BUT, in order to do so as in this story, the victim would have to obviously be already very shaky from the start and lacking even a moderately fair sureness of her grasp of reality. Not the type of character Bergman plays at the beginning. That said, Boyer plays an excellent cad; Bergman plays an increasingly distraught and troubled bride; Cotten plays a handsome savior; while Lansbury plays a spicy, uppity maid. Given this script, they've given it their best and their best is very, very good. In 1944, I doubt that the script was that predictable. Sixty years later, you can see clues dropped here and there which you absolutely know will resurface later.My quibbles are too harsh for many. My companion (almost half my age and certainly without the psychological experience) thought it was excellent -- compelling and gripping. My occasional whispers to her that I bet that THAT clue is going to reappear didn't spoil it for her one bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cukor's GASLIGHT is a classic of the Gothic melodrama genre, which hit it's apex in the early-to-mid forties, starting with Hitchcock's REBECCA. Bergman won a Best Actress Oscar for her role in GASLIGHT, and she is indeed convincing as a wife terrified she is losing her sanity, in the face of the tricks of her cunning and opportune jewel-thief husband Charles Boyer (remarkably sinister yet attractive).It's an engrossing work for the most part, with great performances by the two leads. Joseph Cotten plays the romantic rescuer of Bergman, and even if it is only a one-note role, he is still pleasing. We also get great supporting work from the likes of the inimitable Dame May Witty and saucy servant Angela Lansbury (they add a touch of English that would have been missing otherwise in this story set in the Londin fog). I did feel, however, that the film dragged in a few places and the ending was just a little too cute. Nevertheless, the atmosphere Cukor creates is very convincing, and the cinematography is appropriately shadowy and dark. The house, presumably created on the studio lot specially for the film, is a marvelous set, conveying the wealth yet emotional emptiness of Bergman's life, and meticulously decorated so it appears as a true evocation of the Victorian era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thornton Square Murder of c 1879?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fun, at times, to be a criminal historian, and look at old movies to see how they fit a pattern for their time period. GASLIGHT was based on ANGEL STREET, a play by Patrick Hamilton. Hamilton was one of the best "thinking man's" creators of melodramas of the period between the World Wars. He constructed the play ROPE (the basis for Hitchcock's 1949 movie) on the Leopold-Loeb Case, with two self-impressed intellectual "supermen" testing out their interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy on their "friends and acquaintances". The only difference between that play and the movie was that the play was set in England, making the relationship between Jimmy Stewart's teacher/mentor and Farley Granger and John Dall (with it's overtones of homosexuality) somewhat more likely - especially as Hamilton based Stewart's character on Oscar Wilde. Hamilton's ANGEL STREET was set two generations before ROPE, in the "gaslight" era of the 1870s and 1880s in Great Britain. It was a period of hide-bound propriety that has rarely ever reappeared in the western world, particularly after both World Wars. That propriety seems stifling - as stifling as the attempts by the villain (Charles Boyer) to control and dominate the soul of his loving wife (Ingrid Bergman). And to top it off his method is to suggest his wife's lack of control of her mind - insanity is so full of impropriety you know!Lest one think that Boyer's Gregory Anton is a bit of dramatic license, compare him with some of the males who pop up in actual Victorian murders of the period from 1850 to 1889. Look at the film MADELEINE, at the performance of Leslie Banks as Mr. Smith, the architect and father of Madeleine Smith - a tyrannical head of the family who never forgives her transgressions with Pierre (her poisoned lover). Actually it is the extra-marital sex more than anything else that he detests: we last see him rejecting her by hissing out, "You are naked!". Or look at Raymond Huntley as the "Charles Bravo" based husband/barrister in SO EVIL MY LOVE, who refuses to admit his inability to have children is his fault (his mother agrees with him) - they blame his wife (Geraldine Fitzgerald). In the actual case, by the way, Charles was put off by his wife Florence Bravo's refusal to turn over to him her personal fortune. Also look at the case of James and Florence Maybrick, a stern, older husband who had a younger, livelier wife (and an American one at that) who just could not fit in. James appears to have had many sexual escapades Florence had to swallow. But when she strayed with Alfred Brierly, James gave her a black eye!So Boyer's Gregory is acting precisely as so many other Victorian hubbies did in these domestic crimes. His personal greed, tied to his foreign background, is also similar to Victorian villains. For example, Henri Pineux (a.k.a. Henri De Tourville), an ex-waiter who pretended to be a French count, and married and murdered two women for their fortunes.But even the atmosphere of the unsolved murder named for the location it occurred in. Nineteenth Century Britain was loaded with them: the Euston Square Murder, the Burton Crescent Murders, the Whitechapel Murders, the Rainhill Murders, the Stepney Murder. The list was endless, so why not a fictitious one like the Thornton Square Murder?George Cukor has to be credited with capturing the spirit of the period very nicely in the film. From the start, when we hear "The Last Rose of Summer" being sung by a woman (a reminder of the murdered woman: Ingrid Bergman's aunt - an opera singer), to the end. The gaslight of the title may be a plot twist (that the gas goes down when Gregory secretly returns to the house's attic to search for the fortune he desires), but it was, as I said earlier, a "gaslight" age.There is even an example of the incipient end of the period in the attitude of the insolent snippy Angela Lansbury towards Bergman (whom she considers a madwoman, to be despised). Lansbury's servant probably really mirrored many of the age who thought they were better than their "betters". Soon they were able to slack off the social controls a bit. Flanders Fields was a great leveling ground in many ways.Boyer's Gregory is one of the most sinister villains in film, being plausible for so long, until Joseph Cotton starts taking an interest. Cotton is fine as the Scotland Yard Detective who has a personal interest in the welfare of Bergman. And Bergman's performance as a woman who is driven to the point of insanity (and uses this marvelously against her persecutor at the end of the film) is great - and thoroughly deserving of her first Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not often that a proper name or title enters the common use of any language, but maybe the highest possible praise Gaslight could receive is the fact that the title is now a verb. To gaslight someone now is to do little deliberate things and blame articles disappearing or misplaced on a person in an effort to make them think they are losing their minds.That is exactly what the suave sophisticated continental Charles Boyer is trying to do to his new bride Ingrid Bergman in the house that they live in. It was previously occupied by Bergman's aunt, a noted soprano who was murdered several years earlier. A good mad act is always guaranteed to draw Oscar attention and in this case it got Ingrid Bergman her first Academy Award. She is really something to watch as the poor woman really starts to believe she's losing her mind.Charles Boyer goes against type in this film. Usually the charming European of many nationalities besides his native French, Boyer starts out the film in a typical Boyer mold. But he gradually changes into a hardened stone cold killer. The audience ever so gradually realizes he didn't marry Bergman for love. Boyer was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, but no one was beating Bing Crosby that year in Going My Way. Joseph Cotten plays the stalwart Scotland Yard inspector and a very young Angela Lansbury has an early part in Gaslight as a tart cockney maid.George Cukor directs it all with a Hitchcock type flair that even the master of suspense would tip his hat to. In fact I'm surprised that Alfred Hitchcock didn't consider Gaslight as a film property for himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, I really enjoyed this film, more than I thought I would. It lives up to all of the Hitchcock's and despite the fact that we know that Bergman's character is not insane, the film depicts a woman's suffering from her Husband. I think this film is especially relevant today as it portrays how the woman was bullied by her Husband though does not realise it because of the role of men and women at the time. The film mixes suspense, romance and horror to create a well designed film. The lighting is incredibly atmospheric and shadows help to create that typical thriller tension. You can see that people probably thought this film was scary in its day!Fantastic film-definitely worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my review of the 1940 film version of Gaslight, I admitted to liking both films. The basic plot line is the same, with the 1944 version lingering a little longer, and paying more attention to the lush Victorian sets, which helps to adequately add to the foreboding mood of the story. It also has changed the characters names. Charles Boyer plays Gregory Anton, the sinisterly cruel husband and Ingrid Bergman plays Paula Alquist, the sweet loving wife, subjected to her husbands menacing attempt to drive her insane. The supporting cast actors have a much stronger presence in the 1944 version. Joesph Cotten plays the sleuthing detective Brian Cameron, Angela Lansbury plays the cheeky maid Nancy and the added character of a nosey neighbour played effectively by Dame May Witty. Ingrid Bergman's strong dramatic performance remains very riveting and is the hallmark of this film. Charles Boyer's characterization of Gregory is a little more suave and not quite as malevolent as Anton Walbrook's gripping portrayal of the abusing husband in the 1940 version. The 1944 production of Gaslight is a very entertaining film, and still holds up well. If you can, try to view both versions of this suspenseful story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, Claustrophobic &amp; Sinister</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An often fog-bound mansion in Victorian London is the setting for this tense psychological thriller which begins during the aftermath of a murder and develops into a husband's sustained plot to convince his wife (and everyone else) that she's insane. The villain's diabolical scheme is cruel, manipulative and interesting to watch as it shows how the victim's confidence is gradually undermined by a series of deceptions and the type of controlling behaviour that leaves her isolated, confused and genuinely doubting her own sanity.The action takes place in an increasingly sinister atmosphere and the mansion provides a wonderfully claustrophobic location for most of what transpires. The property's cluttered walls and over-furnished rooms make the victim's surroundings seem cramped and camera angles that bring the ceiling into view re-emphasise this impression. Furthermore, the streets around the mansion are mostly seen at night when the darkness and the fog considerably reduce what can be seen. These visual features contribute strongly to the mood of the piece and also emphasise the victim's strong feelings of being trapped.Paula Alquist (Ingrid Bergman) is a girl who'd been brought up by her aunt (who was a famous opera singer) since her mother's death. After a break-in at her home during which her aunt is strangled to death, the killer escapes and the traumatised Paula is sent to Italy to recover and study to also become an opera singer. Many years later, she falls in love with her piano accompanist and after a very short courtship and a honeymoon at Lake Como, her new husband, Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer) persuades her to move back to her previous home that she'd inherited from her aunt and which had remained unoccupied since the time she'd left London.Back at her childhood home, Gregory decides to move all her aunt's possessions up into the attic so that Paula won't be upset by their presence and then boards up the attic door. From this point onwards, he starts to make remarks about Paula's apparent forgetfulness and inclination to lose things. Her fragile confidence is then undermined further as he belittles her in front of the servants, openly flirts with the housemaid and forbids her to leave the house or receive any guests. Things then get even more troubling when she starts to hear sounds from the attic that no-one else hears and becomes alarmed by the gaslights which dim periodically for no apparent reason.Brian Cameron (Joseph Cotton) is a Scotland Yard detective who'd been a great admirer of Paula's aunt. After seeing the opera singer's home occupied again, he takes a growing interest in what's happening there and reviews the police records relating to the unsolved murder. Eventually, after some difficulties, he manages to meet Paula and win her confidence and this proves to be a turning point in her struggle to rationalise what had been happening to her since her return to No 9 Thornton Square."Gaslight" is well directed and features some top class performances. Angela Lansbury (in her first movie role) is terrific as the bad mannered and disrespectful maid and Charles Boyer is equally convincing, initially as the debonair and very attentive lover and later as the domineering sadist who tries to get his wife committed to an insane asylum. Ingrid Bergman really stands out in her Oscar-winning role as a woman who'd experienced the childhood traumas of being orphaned at a young age and later having to cope with the shock of her guardian's very sudden and violent death. Her sensitive interpretation of her character's ordeal is magnificent as she conveys her vulnerability so effectively without resorting to the exaggerated histrionics that many lesser actresses may well have employed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Different Kind of Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years after her aunt was murdered in her home, a young woman (Ingrid Bergman) moves back into the house with her new husband (Charles Boyer). However, he has a secret which he will do anything to protect, even if that means driving his wife insane.I think this is a very different kind of mystery. It involves a murder, but there is never really any doubt about the killer. And it involves a wife thinking she is going crazy, yet we know all along that she is not. (In fact, despite the praise she has received, I think Bergman overdid it a little bit on her acting here... I found it hard to believe that she was that stupid.) Placing the film in the same era as the Jack the Ripper murders was a nice touch, as it could just have easily been the 1940s and the plot would not have been substantially altered. And the debut of Angela Lansbury? Truly remarkable. Who knew she had such a cockney accent inside her? Great film... a very solid performance from very solid talents. George Cukor never fails to succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Cukor was a director most noted for producing "women's films" {'Little Women (1933);' 'Camille (1936);' 'The Philadelphia Story (1936)'}, and so it came as a pleasant surprise to discover 'Gaslight (1944),' his subtle, taut MGM psychological thriller/murder mystery, starring Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer and Joseph Cotten. In the film, a beautiful young woman, Paula (Bergman), is haunted by the memory of her dear aunt's murder. After a decade has passed, Paula finds a loving husband in Gregory Anton (Boyer), and the two return to the home where the murder took place, anxious to start out a new and happy period in their lives. However, something about this marriage is not quite right. For some unfathomable reason, Gregory appears committed to convincing Paula of her insanity, slowly and systematically tormenting his fragile wife into accepting her failing grasp on reality. Why does Paula keep misplacing things? Why did she remove the painting from the wall without any recollection of doing so? Why is she hearing footsteps that nobody else can hear? Why do the gaslights suddenly dim as though somebody else is in her home? It's up to detective Brian Cameron (Cotton) to discover what strange happenings are taking place in this cursed household, hopefully before Paula is driven to the brink of madness.The film {released in the UK under the title 'Murder in Thornton Square'} was a remake of Thorold Dickinson's British film, 'Gaslight (1940),' itself adapted from Patrick Hamilton's 1938 stage-play. Out of a total of seven Oscar nominations, 'Gaslight' was rewarded in two categories, Best Art Direction (for the superb interior decoration of the Victorian town house) and Ingrid Bergman for Best Actress in a Leading Role, the first of her three Oscars {this was also her second nomination, having lost the previous year with 'For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943)'} Bergman ? aside from being one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen ? delivers a gripping performance as the vulnerable house-wife tormented by her malevolent husband towards a complete nervous breakdown. Charles Boyer, playing against type, is suitably wicked and mysterious as Gregory Anton; we are certain almost from the start that he is up to something wicked, but the story unfolds so wonderfully that we can't piece together the jigsaw puzzle until the very end. Joseph Cotton, though his distinct American accent doesn't quite pass him as a Scotland Yard detective, gives a fun and amiable performance as the only man who can uncover the secrets of Paula and Gregory's unusual marriage.'Gaslight' is shot beautifully in black-and-white, with cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg making excellent use of shadows and lightning to create the ominous and silently threatening atmosphere of the old home. The whole film has the subtle feel of an Alfred Hitchcock picture: it includes two actors who would star in the director's films {Bergman in 'Spellbound (1945)' and 'Notorious (1946);' Cotten in 'Shadow of a Doubt (1943)'}, and the mysterious plot always keeps us wondering whether what we are seeing is real {Patrick Hamilton, who wrote the original play, also penned the work on which Hitchcock's 'Rope (1948)' was based}. Overall, 'Gaslight' is a wonderful and engrossing psychological thriller, with stunning photography and great performances. Not that you need an excuse to spend 100 minutes watching the lovely Ingrid Bergman?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angela Lansbury at 17! and Ingrid Bergman's first Academy Award. What more could you ask for? Very little in the way of effects means that there is nothing here to entertain you but pure talented thespianism. These performances fully demonstrate what acting should be. I bill this timeless production right up there with Hitchcock's "Rebecca." This is a beautiful, atmospheric, epic-quality suspense, and is one of My absolute favorites. Paula, a haunted, timeless lovely, has found peace in loving her man. Or has she? This is one of the choice classic thrillers which deserves the status of "Classic." A real masterpiece.This is a thinking movie rather than the popcorn fare of late. But if you've ever had a bad relationship, then you will find the humor in this attempt. At least...I did. It was a very enjoyable 80 or so minutes which builds a good level of suspense.It rates a solid 9.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victorian London setting makes for chilly atmosphere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only bright note in 'Gaslight' is whenever Dame May Whitty pops in for a scene or two as a gossipy old lady who knows about that mysterious old house. Otherwise, this is an absorbing psychological thriller that takes itself a little too seriously--a few more touches of dry humor (the kind Alfred Hitchcock would have supplied) are missing from this George Cukor production. His meticulous, somewhat fussy attention to every little detail of sets and costumes softens the suspense.Based on a stage play called "Angel Street", it shows its stage origins with mostly interior scenes of Bergman slowly being driven mad by a husband who is searching for jewels in the attic. Charles Boyer is debonair and smooth enough as the husband. His final confrontation scene with Bergman, where she decides to torment him and string him along to exact her own revenge, is highly satisfactory. Bergman really shows complete understanding of her character and deserved her Oscar for Best Actress. Angela Lansbury makes an auspicious film debut, looking very confident indeed as a saucy Cockney maid.The only flaws are the slow pace and the casting of Joseph Cotten as the Scotland Yard detective. Cotten's role is just a peripheral one and too bland to sustain any interest. Nor does he even attempt a British accent. For Bergman fans, this is definitely a must see!Given this sort of material, I can't help thinking it would have been a tighter and more suspenseful film if directed by someone like Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lacks mystery and intrigue - quite predictable.A young woman, Paula Alquist (played by Ingrid Bergman) leaves her home in England for Italy, for singing lessons. There she meets and falls in love with a pianist, Gregory Anton (played by Charles Boyer). They marry and move back to London, to live in the house Paula's aunt was murdered in, 10 years earlier. However, Gregory's intentions toward Paula aren't entirely romantic, or benevolent...For a movie with such sinister plots involved, this movie is quite predictable. You can see all the links and plans involving Gregory in the first 40 minutes or so. And some of his plans are just plain lame (the watch at the concert...). Good performances from Bergman and Boyer plus Joseph Cotten and Dame May Witty. 18-year old Angela Lansbury made her debut in this movie and puts in a solid performance. The minor performances can be quite laughable though - the risk of filming an English setting in the US (and you can thank WW2 for that). Best example of this is the scene with a cop whose accent frequently veers violently between English Cockney and southern-US in mid-sentence! Unintentionally funny.Ultimately a mediocre story, with some solid performances from the leads. Had heaps of potential, but much of this was squandered.</fullReview>

The actors in this movie deliver excellent performances that help to capture the audience and carry them through the story. It was in fact this film that Ingred Bergman won her first Oscar for. It was also the acting debut of actress Angela Lansbury. Although somewhat predictable, the movie will still have you tense at times, especially at the end. The premise is solid and even quite believable. Any fan of the Hitchcock style mystery should give Gaslight a try if they would like a bit of a different flavor.

		<shortDescription>Can Your Spouse Drive You Nuts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on personal experience, many of us might answer the question, "Can your spouse drive you nuts?", with an unequivocal YES, but this story is a little different than what our everyday experiences might be. Here, the husband (Charles Boyer), with the complicity of a nasty bitchy maid (Angela Lansbury, her debut), deliberately tries to arrange events in his gas-lighted Victorian house, so that his weak-willed wife (Ingrid Berman) will believe that she's losing her mind -- again.Boyer commits minor acts of deception. He hides objects, moves portraits, claims he had nothing to do with it, that Bergman is going nuts and not remembering her own irrational behavior. The object? Boyer is trying to locate some extremely expensive jewelry that Bergman inherited. Neither of them knows where it is, but Boyer is convinced they're locked securely away somewhere in an overstuffed attic. In order to search the attic he leaves the house and reenters it by a secret passage from another street. Then he lights the gas in the attic and pokes through the chests and armoirs and other doo-dads, looking for the jewels. Now, gas light is not like electricity. There's only so much of it being pumped into a house, so when you light an extra outlet or two, as Boyer does in the attic, the flames in the rest of the house are lowered noticeably. Gas has other disadvantages. It explodes sometimes and it can smother you. You know who was at pains to point out these dangers? The whale oil lobby, that's who! (I just threw that in and, though it's true, you may ignore it except as evidence that plus ca change, plus ca meme chose.) Back to the movie. Yes. Bergman wanders around the house, half stoned from anxiety, watching the gas light go up and down, while no one else notices it, hearing boards creak and drawers roll shut in the attic where no one can possibly be. She becomes dreamier and is convinced that she's going bonkers again.Enter Joseph Cotten who clears things up in a jiffy. Like Poe's purloined letter, the jewels were hidden in plain sight. The bad folks are whisked away and Bergman is freed of a husband with a baritone French accent but a malevolent character.Could Boyer really have driven her clinically insane? Probably not, though he might have convinced her that she was going round the bend. Those are two different things. Oh, it's perfectly reasonable to expect that she'd be scared out of her wits, but not gravely disabled. For that you'd be better off bringing an organismic vulnerability to the situation, a genetic component. And the stress would have to be vastly greater than discovering hidden objects and hearing boards creak. Otherwise, as soon as the hiding and the creaking stopped, Bergman's belief in her own insanity would probably fade soon enough.George Cukor has staged the movie and executed it well. I vaguely remember seeing it as a kid and it scared the heck out of me. Except for the psychology, it's almost one of those spooky, haunted old mansion movies. A good movie for the whole family on a Friday night. Watch it with the kids. And every once in a while, during a particularly frightening moment, shout into their ears and tickle their ribs and watch what happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable thriller/melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gaslight" is a highly enjoyable old-fashioned melodrama, where villainy occurs, emotions run high, and all of the elements click satisfyingly into place. It's reminiscent of Hitchcock, sort of a combination of "Rebecca" (innocent heroine, sinister husband, nasty housemaid) and "The Lady Vanishes" (young woman wonders if she's seeing things). Other Hitchcockian touches include dramatic use of shadows, and some comic characters to contrast with the suspense, including a nosy neighbor played by Dame May Witty, the Vanishing Lady herself. And perhaps Ingrid Bergman's menaced, anguished role in "Gaslight" inspired Hitchcock to cast her as the similarly tortured heroines of "Spellbound" and "Notorious."Here, Bergman plays Paula, newlywed wife of the dashing Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer). The couple moves into a London townhouse that Paula inherited from her aunt, who was murdered ten years earlier and whose killing has never been solved. Gregory soon becomes possessive and patronizing toward Paula, forbidding her to have visitors and insisting that she's forgetting things. The increasingly confused, fragile Paula gets terrified late at night, when she sees the gaslights dim and cannot figure out why. Meanwhile, a detective (solid Joseph Cotten) re-opens Paula's aunt's case file?This is a meaty role for Bergman, and she negotiates Paula's shifting emotions with great energy and skill. You see how deliriously happy she is to be in love with Gregory, which makes it all the more poignant when he spurns her. As Paula becomes more fearful and insecure, Bergman's performance is quiet and tense: her eyes rove and she lets out strangled screams like a caged animal. And at the end, she attacks her climatic speech as though it were an aria. Appropriate, considering that Paula and her aunt are opera singers.Other performances are also strong. Boyer has a seductive quality to his voice that makes you understand how he is able to brainwash his wife. His behavior is so shamelessly passive-aggressive and cruel that, perversely, it's delightful to watch. Angela Lansbury makes a memorable film debut as the impudent housemaid, and even gets to sing a few bars in her distinctive voice.The foggy streets of Victorian London are effective and atmospheric, and recall other, more famous thrillers like "Dracula" or "Dorian Grey." But unlike those two stories, there's nothing supernatural about "Gaslight." Instead, it's a great psychological thriller, just the right blend of florid melodrama, riveting suspense, and believable human emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eliminate the Competition - Why Not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've noticed that people seem surprised that MGM attempted to suppress the 1940 British version of GASLIGHT to avoid any competition with their version. I don't know why anyone should be surprised - Hollywood's business is a cut-throat one: remember that L.B. Mayer, along with Jack Warner and others, offered to buy CITIZEN KANE from RKO and then destroy it, all to appease William R. Hearst - fortunately they didn't (just imagine the history of film since 1941 if they had!) And although MGM didn't destroy all prints of GASLIGHT, they did manage to keep it out of sight for many years - I think I first saw it on a cable station in the early 1980s - I tuned in expecting Boyer and Bergman and got Walbrook and Wynyard - as it turned out I didn't mind at all, and have enjoyed it many times since! MGM did the same thing with Paramount's 1932 DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE which, except for an occasional screening, went unseen (but much written about) until it came out on video around 1990 (under the MGM label - imagine that!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joseph Cotten's performance is, as always, a class act. Ingrid Bergman... well I'll get to her in a minute. Charles Boyer's performance is so affecting that I almost kicked a hole in the TV. This is both good and bad. Obviously he's a powerful actor, but it's laid on so thick that it becomes downright aggravating by halftime. That is, the idea of an egotistical, domineering husband (and the wife's diffident acceptance of the situation) is so infuriating that I was hardly able to enjoy myself. I almost shut off the movie halfway through because it's no fun to see a woman getting abused and tormented with no recourse. But then I realized that Joseph Cotten, the main reason why I was watching the film, hadn't yet made an appearance (he doesn't come in until the 2nd act when things start picking up).But I'm so glad that I stuck around, because once things get rolling--once the director begins to make his statement--the film becomes truly powerful, engaging and poignant. The coup de grce is an absolutely stellar performance by Ingrid Bergman in the last 10 minutes which I won't spoil for you. Suffice it to say that I think it's one of the finest monologues since Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth, and it puts the whole film into perspective.I'm rating this only a 7 because of my disappointment with the 1st half which I felt was a bit of a gratuitous pity party, but the more I think about it, perhaps it was necessary in order to have such a powerful payoff in the 2nd half. I'll definitely be watching this movie twice, and I urge you to do the same. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the play on which this movie was based, "Angel Street", by Patrick Hamilton earlier this year, and enjoyed it very much. The next month, when I saw this movie, I was greatly suprised. The play moved much faster than the movie did. In the play, the action starts as Mr. Manningham (as he is called in the play) is driving his wife to insanity, and takes place over his last night of doing so. In comparison, the movie begins with the murder, and continues with Gregory beginning to court Paula. In fact, only the last forty-five minutes or so reflect what happened in the play.However, there are plenty of good things about the film. For one thing, Ingrid Bergman's Oscar winning performance as Paula was captivating, possibly better than her roles in "Casablanca" or "Notorious". Charles Boyer was wonderfully slimy and slick as Gregory. And, as hard as it may be to believe in these times we live in, Angela Lansbury used to be young!Unfortunatly, there are flaws. There is very little humor in the movie. Whatever humor there is, is supplied by wonderful character actress Dame May Whittey as the nosy neighbor. Another major flaw is Joseph Cotton. As much as I like Cotton, I think that "Gaslight" was the lowest point in his career. He makes the character quite pale and uninteresting, therefore the detective becomes a character the audience doesn't care too much about.This could have been a much better film, especially if the directing task had fallen into the hands of Alfred Hitchcock.Rating: 3.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In London, at Thorton Square 9, the prima donna Alice Alquist is strangled and her famous jewels miss. Her young niece Paula (Ingrid Bergman) is sent to Italy to study music and the house stays empty. Ten years later, Paula decides to get married with the older pianist Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer), who convinces her to move back to the old address in London. When they arrive, Paula finds a letter from a mysterious and unknown Sergis Bauer, making Gregory upset. He psychologically begins to torture Paula and she has a nervous breakdown, insecurity and memory problems. When the Scotland Yard policeman Brian Cameron (Joseph Cotten) sees Gregory Anton in a tourist place, he immediately recognizes Gregory and decides to investigate and find evidences to connect Gregory with the unsolved murder, while Paula is being driven mad and menaced of being interned in an asylum by her husband.The American version of "Gaslight" is not as good as the claustrophobic and Machiavellian original 1940 British version, but it is also a great movie. Ingrid Bergman in some moments seems to be too strong for the lead role, but has an excellent performance, alternating moments of lucidity with madness and winning the Oscar of Best Actress in a Leading Role. Joseph Cotton seems to be too young for the role of the snoopy detective, and Charles Boyer in any moment shows chemistry with Ingrid Bergman. The debut of Angela Lansbury in the role of the vulgar and slut maidservant is very good. The Art Direction-Interior Decoration also won an Oscar. Just as a curiosity, the 1.75 m height Charles Boyer climbed a box in some romantic scenes with the 1.78 m height Ingrid Bergman to look taller. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "?

		<fullReview>Charles Boyer is slowly driving wife Ingrid Bergman mad in Victorian England. There is a reason but I won't give it away.The story line has been done to death since 1944, so this isn't as fresh or exciting as it once was. Still it is an excellent film. The film is incredibly elaborate--wonderful costumes, huge intricately designed sets and furnishings. Also the film is wonderfully directed by George Cukor with excellent use of light, shadow and darkness to give us insights to the characters and their emotions. It also contains some truly frightening scenes with Bergman doubting her sanity and the strange noises from the attic...The acting is just incredible. Charles Boyer is perfect as the husband--he acts so cultured and suave but you always see hints of madness and murder peeking out--very scary. Ingrid Bergman deservedly won as Oscar for this role and she's just great. You see her change from a happy, carefree girl into a frightened, cowering woman from the psychological browbeating from Boyer. She's totally believable every step of the way. Also in this movie is Elsa Lancaster in her film debut. She was only 17 at the time but you wouldn't know it! She plays a sullen servant and was just great...and nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Even the usually wooden Joseph Cotten puts in a fine performance! Basically this is a rarity--a film where ALL the casting is on target! Superb psychological drama--don't miss this one!There is a 1940 British version (which is better than this) that MGM purportedly tried to destroy so it wouldn't overshadow their version!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GASLIGHT characterized by a great atmosphere, set design and costumes. The film is a good combination of classic paranoid drama and detective stories. Restless atmosphere brings some very exciting and disturbing sequences. The fragile and distraught women versus dominant and wicked husband are the right combination for a good melodrama.Despite the gloomy atmosphere, it is exciting to see how the two main protagonists go crazy in their own ways. One character (Boyer) is full of hypnotic malice and impatience, while another character (Bergman) drowning in pain, weakness and lack of self-confidence. Maybe for my taste too dramatically and inconsistent, but I share conclusion that their performance is good.The strongest argument of this film is the concept of confinement. The level of horror, frustration, claustrophobia, fear, confusion is quite low. The story is confusing and undeveloped. The peak is more or less expected. Confrontation at the end is pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This drama turned out to be a really good Gothic psychological thriller. It's worthwhile watching if you like these kinds of films. In short: It's about a man who murdered an opera singer over the rubies she is said to own, he searches for them but doesn't find them. Years later Gregory meets Paula, the niece of the woman he killed years ago, and she accidentally uncovers his real identity so he decides to drive her mad to have her locked away while looking for her aunt's rubies. Paula is just lucky that a snoop is interested in what goes on in number 12. The film is pretty dramatic, starts slow while it takes time for the tension to build. It's beautifully filmed, well acted out and a story of madness, murder and crime. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exceptional film with great performances led by Charles Boyer as the conniving husband with the ulterior motives .You despise him , he is utterly convincing .Ingrid Bergman is also at her best here as the long suffering innocent victim of her criminal spouses greed . Angela Lansbury is very good as the tarty maid in her first role at 19 yrs of age .And finally Joseph Cotten as the hero who wouldn't give up gives a fine performance .Its refreshing to watch these pre-special effects films that were about people and the challenges we face , these days special effects have taken much away from story telling , its become story showing instead , you don't need your imagination as much and that lessens the experience in my judgement . See this one !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy and Gloomy?Heavy Handed and Frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immensely Irritating Film with Good Performances and Lavish, Gaudy, Cluttered, Claustrophobic Sets. Heavy Handed and Relentlessly Edgy, this Over Baked Melodrama is a Favorite of Movie Buffs.The now Shop-Worn Story certainly Played Much Better in 1944. Audiences Today must Muster a Goodly Amount of Suspension of Disbelief to Imagine some of what Goes on Here. Charles Boyer is so Domineering and Ingrid Bergman is so Docile that some Modern Viewers will Lose Patience Quickly.But if You Go With it and Allow it to Unfold it can be a Marvelous, if Manic, bit of Gothic-Noir. Bergman is so Lovable and Quaint Her Abuse, from the outset, Rides the Edge that keeps Sympathies with Her and is in Danger of Losing Not only Her Mind, but the Audience as well.In Fact, both Leads Play the One Note of Good and Evil Continuously for the Long Running Time and Joseph Cotten as a Scotland Yard Investigator Figures Things Out maybe a Reel to Late to Save the Movie from Collapsing under its own Weight of Repetitive Similarity.In Support, Angela Lansbury got the Oscar, as well as Bergman, and is Creepy as can be, but May Witty as the Comedy Relief, like most of the Movie, tends to Grate on the Nerves.Overall, a Must See for Classic Film Fans, the Movie has a Reputation that Cannot be Denied. Superbly Mounted and Presented in High Hollywood Gloss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young bride (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband (Charles Boyer) move into the house where her aunt was murdered years before. Suddenly her sweetheart of a husband becomes cruel and she seems to be losing her mind. A Scotland Yard detective (Joseph Cotten) becomes enamored with her and starts investigating.A great-looking thriller from MGM with a fine cast. It's based on a play (filmed before) but George Cukor does a good job making it feel fresh and not stagy. Wonderful MGM production values. Love those period sets and costumes. Bergman's Oscar-winning performance is one of her best. Boyer and Cotten are solid as ever. Dame May Witty plays a well-intentioned busybody that kind of got on my nerves. Angela Lansbury's good in her film debut. The movie's biggest failing is its predictability. When I first watched it many years ago, I didn't like it much because of this. But now I'm able to appreciate the good qualities of the film more. You get a good idea fairly early on here who the villain is and what they are up to (assuming you weren't spoiled by plot synopses online or in film guides, 95% of which give away the big plot points). Like many classic Hitchcock films, it isn't a mystery or twist that makes it work but fine characters and suspense built up throughout the picture.</fullReview>

Ingrid Bergman is the light that shines through the whole movie. She is great as a shining star as well as a downtrodden wife. She has an amazing range. There is a good back and forth about her sanity although it could even be better. There's no big twist but there is a reveal. It's a well made and well acted dark drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film in Many Ways, Though Bergman is Uncharacteristically Hammy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ANGEL STREET, GASLIGHT was made in Great Britain four years previous to this version. Louis B Mayer was so taken with the play that he bought not only the film rights but also the distribution rights to the 1940 film, after which he locked it in the MGM vault so that it was not seen in the States for decades. It is interesting to compare the two versions: most critics seem to place the British original in higher esteem, but I disagree, mainly due to the performances of the two lead actors. Diana Wynyard, an old-style actress in the British tradition, gives a good but rather uninteresting performance; she spends most of the film in a state of near-catatonia which, frankly, gets old fast, while her co-star Anton Walbrook overacts shamelessly all over the place, which has the unfortunate effect of robbing the piece of much of its suspense.George Cukor, known as one of the best directors of actors of his day, makes a vast improvement in the acting in the 1944 version, though he may have gone slightly overboard in the case of Ingrid Bergman. She won her first Oscar for her performance in this film, but it is not her best work: an uneven performance that in spots is a tad bit hammy, something that Bergman practically NEVER did; she was a master at underplaying (see CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS). She's good in GASLIGHT, but as I have already stated in my review of that film, the actress who should have won the Award for 1944 should have been Barbara Stanwyck for her seminal performance as the ultimate femme fatale in Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY.Ironically, it isn't really Bergman who gives the best lead performance here: it's Boyer. Aside from a certain "sourpuss" expression on his face, at the beginning we have no idea what a monster this man is, nor do we have a clue as to what he is planning to do to his adoring young bride. As a result Cukor manages to drag out the suspense in an almost Hitchcock-like fashion until it becomes nearly unbearable. Boyer's Gregory Anton is one of the great screen villains; wearing the mask of a loving husband, he proceeds to drive his wife to the brink of madness in such an effective manner that the term "gaslighting" actually entered the vernacular, as in "He's gaslighting us (meaning "he's lying/misleading/playing us")." To relieve some of the darkness of the main plot, Cukor provides two comic relief characters: local busybody Miss Thwaites, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Dame May Witty, and housemaid Nancy, a saucy little tart who flirts openly with Gregory while at the same time not bothering to conceal her disdain for his wife. Angela Lansbury, all of eighteen years old and making her film debut, sank her teeth into the role of the trampy little bitch and got an Oscar nomination right out of the box for it. It is one of the most auspicious debuts of one of the greatest actresses Hollywood, Broadway, and television have ever been graced with. Also on hand to solve the mystery is Brian Cameron (the great Joseph Cotten in yet another of his fine performances), a Scotland Yard detective who as a young boy idolized Paula's aunt, a famous opera star who was brutally murdered when the girl was in her teens.All of this sounds like I am knocking Bergman, but I really don't mean to. She is one of my favorite actresses of all time, and her performance here is excellent; I am just not sure if it is Oscar-worthy. At any rate I still think Stanwyck should have won. And Bergman gave Oscar performances in many other films for which she was not always recognized with so much as a nomination: NOTORIOUS, CASABLANCA, and THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS come to mind, to mention only a few.At any rate, any film effective enough that its title becomes part of the language is obviously operating on a higher level than most films, Oscar or no Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly diluted but still excellent version of "Angel Street" offers many chills.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American audiences did not get to see the 1940 British version of "Angel Street" for many years after MGM planned its own version with an exciting cast, a famous director and its typical glossy production values. While a viewing of the 1940 version might cause some to put down its American remake, that version does stand out for excellent performances, lavish sets and costumes and lush photography, even if it comes up a bit short in what the 1940 version made up in far more recognizable technical achievements that make that version seem even newer than its remake.Poor Ingrid Bergman has memories of the murder of her aunt in her London home when she was much younger and has avoided stepping into the house for many years. A chance encounter with a newer resident of that street (Dame May Witty) brings back memories, and faster than Dame May can utter "Well!", Bergman is returning home with her new husband (Charles Boyer) who is all charm and culture on the outside but hiding a dangerous secret on the inside. No sooner have they remodeled the old homestead than Bergman seems to undergo some mental anguish. She is forgetful, apparently looses things, has crying spells for no apparent reason, and Boyer tells her he fears she is on the verge of loosing her mind, he claims, exactly like her mother did. A curious young man (Joseph Cotten) takes notice of Bergman and Boyer and ingratiates himself with the nosy neighbor Dame May while Boyer himself seems enamored of the new cockney maid (Angela Lansbury).This is as dark and Gothic as the title says, the "Gaslight" having two meanings: the form of artificial lighting which the pre-excessive electricity day world lived with, and a psychological manipulation of destroying another person by making them doubt their own sanity. Both Bergman and Boyer are outstanding, and she combines both vulnerability and confusion in her character who is certain she is not guilty of the things she has been accused of, even though there is no other explanation for them. Boyer's character switches early on from suave to suddenly sinister, taking away any romantic image you may have of him from such earlier classics as "Conquest" and "Love Affair". Dame May adds obvious comic relief, but her stereotypical nosy neighbor has more to do than just peak through curtains and swipe a strawberry from the deaf cook. As for brand new to the screen Lansbury, you won't soon forget the image of her in her truly trashy get-up, and the way she treats Bergman with such obvious contempt in spite of being employed by her makes her almost a Mrs. Danvers ("Rebecca") in training. Lansbury seems a tad bit older than her 19 years which lead to a career of her playing villains until the entertainment world learned that she could sing and dance in addition to be occasionally hateful or solve any murder she set her mind to.While I highly recommend the original version of this a bit more, American audiences might appreciate the directness of this version, the British version definitely more literary and mannered in some ways, yet technically superior. As directed by George Cukor, this ends up a triumph that overshadowed the original version simply because MGM's head (Louis B. Mayer) kept the other version hid in preparation for the release of this version which he didn't want overshadowed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking Beautiful in London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London, beautiful young Ingrid Bergman (as Paula Alquist) is taken away from 9 Thornton Square after the strangulation of her guardian aunt, a renowned opera singer. The murder is unsolved and a fortune in jewels disappears. Years later, Ms. Bergman takes singing lessons in Italy, hoping to follow in her aunt's footsteps. She falls in love with older French pianist Charles Boyer (as Gregory Anton). The newlyweds move to Bergman's inherited home in Thornton Square, site of the earlier tragedy. Lower class Angela Lansbury (as Nancy) and Barbara Everest (as Elizabeth) are hired as housekeeper and cook...The dimming of "Gaslight" and other mysteries ensue... Scotland Yard investigator Joseph Cotten (as Brian Cameron) is suspicious and elderly neighbor May Witty (as Miss Thwaites) is nosy. This is a re-make of the superior British "Gaslight" (1940). Although the leads often seem overly posed (it is, after all, seen through the productive lenses at MGM), all perform exceptionally for director George Cukor. Everything looks exquisite as photographed in black-and white by Joseph Ruttenberg. Bergman won a "Best Actress" Oscar for her high strung portrayal and Ms. Lansbury got a nomination in her first screen credit.******** Gaslight (5/4/44) George Cukor ~ Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotten, Angela Lansbury</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film and a classic example of Narcissistic Behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To prevent Blacklisting, possibly a spoiler comment. If you are still reading, I watched this film because I am writing a book on Narcissism. Although it is not mentioned in the film description many feel this is where the Narcissistic term, "Gaslighting" comes from. As the film is unfolding and we see the Psychological torture Paula is undergoing through the hands of her husband Gregory, we are left to ponder, why would someone that loves you do this to you on purpose? It is a toxic environment that would slowly drive anyone mad. The wife, Paula, feels as though it is not real or she is somehow imagining it. Unless you have lived through this yourself, I unfortunately have, it is hard to wrap yourself around how torturous this feeling is. It is a confusing toxic weight at best because after it is released it is so freeing yet... you miss the control. The Characters play this out very well in the film. As I read other comments about why Paula would not notice her husband is completely evil before or during the marriage, I must say Gregory is very skilled at deception and is a classic example of an abuser and a full blown Narcissist. This type of individual pulls you in slowly in an effort to trap you until you are fully in there grasp, this is when the danger begins as it escalates until you reach the breaking point, sometimes a nervous breakdown. This film will remain on my must see list. Thank you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory (Charles Boyer) marries Paula (Ingrid Bergman) and they return to live in the house that Paula had lived in as a child. She initially left the house to forget about her aunt who was murdered there. Now she is back. She starts to become forgetful and her mind begins to fall apart. Not until Brian (Joseph Cotten) appears on the scene does she have any real hope of discovering that something sinister has been in the air.Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer are excellent in the lead roles - Bergman plays the victim well and she is never quite so weak as to be annoying - and it is good to see her fight back at the end. Watch how she handles a knife - is she crazy or not? It's my favourite scene in the film. Meanwhile, Boyer's face lends itself to an arrogance that has you disliking him from the start.There is plenty of suspense and the film runs at a pace that has you forget that the film is almost 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Gothic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Cukor directs "Gaslight", a creepy melodrama revolving around a jewel thief (Sergius Bauer) who murders an opera star but, unable to find the location of her hidden jewels, flees her home before the authorities arrive. Many years later, and posing as a pianist, Bauer marries Paula Alquist, whose aunt he murdered years before. The married couple then move into the opera star's home - still the location of the hidden jewels - at which point the mind games begin.Bauer increasingly behaves cruel toward his wife and places in her mind the idea that her mother died from a condition which drove her insane. Believing herself to have the same condition, Paula begins to question her sanity, begins to slowly lose her mind, begs her husband for patience and kindness, without realising that he is the man behind her woes.To add to the creepiness, Paula's father, whom she thinks she escaped from, was a domineering and possessive figure whom Bauer himself slowly morphs into, until he to becomes a father figure of the most fearsome kind.And so as the film progresses, Bauer will attempt to commit his increasingly hysterical wife to a mental institution. But it is he who is insane, his marriage to Paula a mere pretext for his claiming possession of the opera star's house so that he might continue his obsessive, mad search for the jewels.Packed with psychological nuances, the film is menacing and terrifying in subtle ways, and its pretty creepy the way Paula becomes "ensnared" and later "free" of two oppressive institutions; family and patriarchic matrimony.But even the villain of the picture, Sergius Bauer, earns our sympathy. In the grips of psychosis, it is clear that his sadistic behaviour towards his wife stems from an attempt to redress the sense of disadvantage he has always felt toward powerful women (like the opera star he murdered).So at its best, the film deftly merges film noir and the damsel-in-distress genres. In both genres, a projection of sexual fear participates; noir, in which the male is ensnared, trapped and ruined by the woman, and the damsel-in-distress thriller, in which a man disadvantages and conquers a woman. You might say the fantasies and desires of one genre stem from the fears and anxieties of the other.So in terms of "Gaslight", we have the noir half of the film in which Bauer fears being consumed (sexually, physically and emotionally), fears being a victim, fears female sexuality and power, and the damsel-in-distress half, in which he represents male power, the need to dominate and assert himself. What makes the film creepy is the way the two genres overlap, combating one another in an intimate tug-of-war.8/10 ? An interesting film which bears some similarities to Hitchcock's "Notorious" and "Vertigo". Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gaslight" is a thriller set in London in the late nineteenth century. A woman whose aunt was murdered years before gets married and returns to the house in which the murder took place. However, before long she is doubting her sanity due to her husband's manipulations which are meant to suppress the truth about his past.Ingrid Bergman won the first of her three Oscars for her performance here and I certainly wouldn't argue with that choice. She vividly displays her character's deteriorating mental state, often with subtle body language. Meanwhile, Charles Boyer makes a suitably sinister antagonist with his effortless mix of charm and insinuation. He also received an Oscar nomination, as did Angela Lansbury in her very first film role. Apart from these actors, Joseph Cotten is merely adequate while Dame May Witty improves any scene she's thrust into.George Cukor's direction is expertly handled and the film benefits from strong, Oscar-nominated black-and-white cinematography. Although I didn't particularly notice the art direction/interior decoration it managed to land the film it's second Oscar. The score also escaped my notice so I suspect that it was satisfactory but unremarkable.All in all, "Gaslight" is a finely-tuned thriller containing some impressive performances and exhibiting an all-around level of quality. It's Best Picture nomination was well deserved and it even managed to outdo the original British version from four years earlier.</fullReview>

This is a well made drama, a much more lavish Hollywood production than the 1940 British version, but it is not quite as effective as the original, which is more efficient (half hour shorter) and atmospheric in telling the same story. Bergman is quite good in her Oscar-winning role, as are Boyer as her tormentor and Cotten as a kindly police detective. Cukor creates a creepy atmosphere with the ever-present fog, although this one lacks the visual expressionism of the 1940 version.

		<fullReview>Gaslight is one of the first moody, atmospheric and psychological films ever made. Before it came to the screen, most dark thrillers and dramas didn't delve into the mind and the details that cause people to think and do the things we usually see them do. Here, Ingrid Bergman plays a young woman moving back into the house where she found her aunt dead and soon starts to hear and see things no one else seems to. Could she be losing her mind? Bergman is one of the greatest actresses of all time and it is well-known that the key to any of her performances was her eyes. Watching her in Casablanca or Notorious or here, her eyes are constantly roaming up and down the person opposite her as well as all over the set. It is especially effective here as it gives a sense of claustrophobia and unsettling nerves. Her wild eyes help offset her beautiful face, making her seem more believable as a woman fearing she is going mad than just some love-struck dumb beauty. And although he didn't win an Oscar for his role as Bergman did, Charles Boyer is very understated as the husband who certainly has an evil bearing in mind and seems to push his wife to the brink. Joseph Cotten is wonderful as well but he is horribly underused as an American-sounding detective from Scotland Yard who has a strange fascination with Bergman's case.One of the best things about Gaslight is the fact that it shows director George Cukor's ability to go outside his usual sophisticated comedies and melodramas and make a bleak, moody thriller focusing more on the psychological aspects of the main character than the physical actions. It also features a very young Angela Landsbury as a housemaid with a Cockney accent and a saucy demeanor. It certainly isn't perfect and the ending is rather unusual, but there are some quietly effective moments thanks to Bergman, and Cukor's wandering camera and harsh lighting provide great mood and setting for a very well-made thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit too obvious but a well executed George Cukor thriller nevertheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is rather an actual predictable and obvious thriller, that nevertheless remains a great one to watch due to its skillful execution.George Cukor isn't exactly a director who is known for his thrillers. The world knows him best as the director of comedies and drama's, as well as some well known musicals. This movie is one of the rare thrillers he made during his career. While watching this movie you have to say that it's a shame that he never directed any more thriller's throughout his career. He had the right touch for it and knew how to handle and build up its story, despite the fact that the story of this movie is being all too obvious.Basically you can already figure out the plot and 'suprises' as soon as the movie is only a couple of minutes long. You know what is wrong with the movie and its characters and were it's all heading to. It's just all a bit too obvious and therefor the movie never really works out as surprising, though it still handles all of its ingredients, such as its build up and tension, well.It's simply a nicely crafted movie that is being told nicely. It makes "Gaslight" one of those real classy and effective '40's thrillers, that were quite popular at the time, not in the least thanks to Alfred Hitchock contributions to the genre during that period. Perhaps it's no coincidence that Cukor and Hitchcock later became friends.I was also really impressed by the movie its acting. Each and every actor gave away some stunning performances and Ingrid Bergman even ended up winning an Oscar for her role in this movie. It wouldn't be her last. It was also great to see the still alive Angela Lansbury making her movie debut in this movie. It's quite a big and important role and she is quite recognizable as Angela Lansbury, despite the fact that she was only a teenagers at the time of production.Simply a great '40's thriller, despite all of its obvious aspects.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nope, they don't make movies like this anymore-be it color or B&amp;W. I took stock of the Oscar nominations and wins and why Charles Boyer did not take home the prize for Best Actor beats me. What a perfectly sophisticated cur! And already at such a young age, Angela Lansbury was looking remarkable but how about the exquisite gift that Ingrid Bergman brought to the screen for so may years? According to Wikipedia,she is ranked as the fourth greatest female star of American cinema of all time by the American Film Institute. The woman was a legend and if you'll check her out on Wiki,you'll agree.This "Gaslight" flick is absolutely outstanding. Does it contain love? Yes. Horror? Yes. Murder? Yes. Is it dark, damp and depressing? You bet. Is it ultra-suspenseful? Yes. Has it spirit,humor and carefree qualities? Yes. Does one recognize the deviousness of Boyer? Yes, but forge ahead Charlie. Does one recognize the kindness and intuitiveness of Joseph Cotton? Yes but forge ahead Joe.The thing is that despite the obviousness of everything, the movie is so intriguing, riveting and flawless, who cares about the predictability of events? "Gaslight" has been and always will be a celluloid treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying Victorian mystery melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining old-fashioned costume drama, very obviously based on a stage play - the action rarely breaks out of the confines of Ingrid Bergman's London house, all the more to exaggerate the enforced claustrophobia by her dastardly husband, played with oily lan by Charles Boyer. In fact he only lacks a waxed handlebar moustache to complete his Victorian villainous appearance and you often feel constrained as a viewer to hiss and boo the bounder's every entrance. The plot is unbelievable tosh, but with Bergman relatively underplaying her part, Boyer overacting his head off and Joseph Cotten acting as a neutral counter-balance as an inquisitive amateur detective, friend of the family, a sort of balance is reached. Bergman is fine in her role, displaying the necessary innocence and genuine distress at the ordeal Boyer subjects her to, she toughens up enough at the climax to turn the tables satisfyingly on him. She looks radiantly beautiful throughout, perhaps too much so, as you can't really imagine any man wanting to bump her off even for a set of valuable old jewels! Of the supporting cast, dbutante Angela Lansbury is very good as an insolent housemaid, with designs on anything in trousers, including her employer Boyer and Dame May Witty fritters about interferingly to slightly over-exaggerated comic effect. Celebrated "woman's director" George Cukor certainly captures Bergman's beauty in a variety of lighting shots and otherwise keeps the movie's even pace going to its predictable conclusion. All in all then, what no doubt started as a satisfactory night at the theatre is turned into an effective movie matine experience. Job done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Scene, in Depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself is an expertly done Gothic chiller. However, my point is not the film itself, but one particular scene-- the drawing room recital at Lady Dalroy's where Paula (Ingrid Bergman) is finally driven to emotional collapse by her fortune-hunting husband Gregory (Charles Boyer). Not only is the scene beautifully performed, but it also amounts to one of the purest examples of civilized mayhem in Hollywood annals. Gregory seeks to destroy Paula, not physically, but mentally, and in this scene almost succeeds. The sequence also exemplifies vintage Hollywood at its collaborative peak, and is thus worth a deeper look. The sequence begins with Paula confronting Gregory at home in a last stab at independence from his suffocating control. She insists that she must go to Lady Dalroy's recital. She looks ravishing in her party gown, but beneath the firmly-set jaw lurks the anxious knowledge that the demanding Gregory will refuse to accompany her. After all, his plan has been to keep her isolated so as to prey on her mind. He refuses to go, of course, expecting this to be final since she has been under his spell for weeks. But now Paula is determined, her jaw set more firmly as she stalks off-- she will go without him. Watch Boyer do some quick mental calibration, realizing that Paula is escaping his grasp. Shifting gears he relents, dressing hurriedly, and in the process appearing (it's not clear) to take out the fateful watch-- already he's scheming how to exploit the new situation.They arrive late to Lady Dalroy's in such a way that all the lavishly dressed lords and ladies note their presence. But that's okay because Paula looks radiant, having momentarily escaped confinement at home. The pianist enters, seats himself, and immediately launches into a darkly portentous selection, and right away we know its Paula who's being musically menaced. The camera dollies in on the twosome, she rapturous in her liberation, he plotting his next move. And here begins one of the most exquisitely executed breakdowns in film annals. Gregory reaches for his watch bob, presumably to check the time, and of course pulls out only a dangling chain just as he planned. Matter of factly, he leans over to inform Paula of the missing timepiece. Watch the next sequence of fleeting expressions as Paula tries to stifle the mounting panic that she has truly lost her mind, that she has taken her husband's timepiece and cannot now recall the event. She stifles a small outburst, getting the unwanted attention of those around her. He reaches to take her little purse, while she sits, hoping against hope. But there it is, just where the scheming Gregory has put it. Suddenly alone in the crowd, she's plunged back into her tormented little world. She struggles to control the panic, but the emotional waves are too strong. Finally engulfed, Paula collapses in unrestrained sobs. Humiliated in front of the lords and ladies, she must lean on Gregory to get out the door and back to confinement. Gregory has won by turning her last stab at independence into humiliating defeat. She is again under his malign control.I've gone into detail for two reasons. First, Bergman manages the emotional sequence in such expert fashion, carrying out the descending scale from rapture to collapse like an intricate piano piece. This scene alone is worth the Oscar. It's certainly not the movie's climax, but does remain the dramatic high-point and an exquisite example of civilized mayhem among the terribly refined and unfailingly polite. And second, what a crystal clear example of old Hollywood at its collaborative best. Note how well-mounted are the lords and ladies in their finery that makes Paula's humiliation even more deeply felt, while the economy of director Cukor's camera keeps eyes glued to the screen, and the astute script that knows when silences speak more loudly than words. All of these come together to heighten Bergman's virtuosic performance, transforming the scene into a minor masterpiece and a triumph for MGM's production unit. In our era of exploding cars, digitalized worlds, and acrobatic derring-do, a scene like this may seem impossibly tame and old-fashioned. But we all continue to have inner lives of one sort or another. And it's that hidden terrain on which Gregory has chosen to launch his assault. The results may not be Spiderman; nonetheless, in their own way, they are no less spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment, but not without camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this movie--a husband tries to drive his wife mad by playing tricks on her--was so famous that "Gaslight" became a byword for such a scheme, and the idea was much copied and parodied. Not that it isn't pretty silly from the start--I mean, Ingrid Bergman thinking she is going crazy because she can't remember where she put things? Another problem is that Charles Boyer (perhaps the sexiest actor ever on screen--that voice! those eyes!) is so divine most women wouldn't care if he certified or knocked off a whole raft of Ingrid Bergmans.However, star quality and chemistry makes this memorable--unusual to have two foreign stars in a Hollywood movie, both very sensual but from extremely different nationalities. Though it is somewhat ridiculous that big, strong Bergman should go to pieces just because someone hides her jewelry, it is touching to see such a healthy woman so vulnerable.At nearly the last minute, Boyer tips the wink to those of us who have thought it pure corn all along. Nicked by Scotland Yard, he turns to the housemaid, played by a sexy little minx called Angela Lansbury, and gives the raised-shoulder gesture that in French would mean "Alors.." and in Yiddish would be translated as "So nu?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is some melodramatic acting in this film that is, at least by modern standards, to be a little cheezy. In particular, Charles Boyer's portrayal of a sleazy, manipulative husband, and Joseph Cotton's (inexplicably American) Scotland Yard detective are so earnest that they strike the modern, irony-laden audience as nothing but humorous.On the other hand, this movie has some moments of greatness that transcend its faults. Director Cukar keeps the pace moving along nicely, and there is some wonderfully moody cinematography and lighting.But the real reason to see this is, unsurprisingly, Ingrid Bergman. Not only does she light up every scene with her grace and beauty, she also gives a wonderfully nuanced portrayal of a woman struggling to maintain her sanity.</fullReview>

Anton Walbrook and Diana Wynward can't hold a candle to Bergman &amp; Boyer when it comes to acting but the 1930's stage-style acting, the cheap production values (poor cinematography, cheesy sets and costumes) somehow add an eerie effect that while barely avoiding camp still makes it a more suspenseful thriller than the 1944 version.</fullReview>

However, I tired of the unlikely plot twists, plodding police investigation, and haughty maid (Angela Lansbury).I was surprised to read on Wikipedia that in real life, Boyer, who plays such a callous heel in this film, committed suicide following the death of his wife, a case of life most definitely NOT imitating art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Oscars for Ingrid Bergman (Best Actress) and William Ferrari (Best Black and White Art Direction) besides a string of other nominations and awards, Gaslight is a must see for all classic movie fans.The plot centers upon the psychological terror exerted upon a woman by her husband whose greed for jewels leads to deception and murder. Such story is adequate enough but the real strength of the film lies in the immensely absorbing mood of darkness and claustrophobia that gradually overwhelms the heroine. It is as if we feel ourselves her inexorable descent into perceived madness as each of us can easily identify with the sheer frustration of knowing something to be true but feeling unable to convince others of its reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man tries to gaslight his wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Suzanne once said on "Designing Women," "you're trying to gas stove me." The term for driving a person crazy by either gaslighting or gas stoving them comes from this magnificent 1944 film, remade from a 1940 British production - and both come from the play "Angel Street." But it was this Oscar-winning film that made "to gaslight" popular. It stars Charles Boyer, Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotten and Angela Lansbury.This "Gaslight" has some differences from the British film, in that it switches the connection to the woman murdered in the house where the Antons live from the husband (Boyer) to the wife (Bergman), and the old detective interested in Gregory is now an attractive young detective interested in Paula (though the names are changed here too). It also gives us a back story as to how the couple met.For reasons of his own (also different in both films) the lovely Paula's new husband, Gregroy, starts slowly driving her mad, accusing her of forgetting things, losing items, and setting her up to be frightful of going out or being social, and when she does, having hysterics so everyone knows she is disturbed. He openly flirts with the trashy maid (Lansbury) and embarrasses his wife in front of her. He also leaves the house every night, and as she sits in her room, the gaslight dims, as if someone has turned on another light in the house. But no one has. Paula is going nuts. But a young police detective has seen Paula and has recognized her as the relative of someone very important in his life.The acting and production values in "Gaslight" are great. Bergman has never looked more beautiful than in the gorgeous Victorian costumes. She makes Paula and very vulnerable and sympathetic young woman. Pia Lindstrom states on the DVD that her mother's performance is subtle. That's one thing it wasn't, and it's her tendency to go a tad over the top is the only thing that dates "Gaslight" as produced in another time. Many of her mannerisms have been used so often over the years that they have become stereotypes. Not to say there was anything wrong with Bergman's performance; she was a great actress with a wonderful quality. It's just that the acting style employed in this film has changed somewhat.Boyer's Gregory is suave and cruel in an off-handed way. He speaks to Paula with a gentleness that makes his venom even more sinister. Joseph Cotten brings an attractiveness and sincerity to the detective. Angela Lansbury, 17 and in her film debut, is wonderful as the tarty Nancy, with her sullen look and low-class accent. An excellent performance.The DVD set has both versions of "Gaslight" (there was also a TV movie starring Christopher Plummer) and watching both of them is very enjoyable. Though some people consider the British version superior, I give the slight edge to this great 1944 classic, directed with a gentle hand by George Cukor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingrid Bergman shines in this splendid psychological thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cast including the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, the suave Charles Boyer, and the sophisticated Joseph Cotton (not to mention a very young Angela Lansbury), this film had a lot going for it. But more than star power, it had a great story, and excellent art direction (it won an Oscar for best Art Direction/Black and White). London, with its infamous fog, serves as the perfect backdrop for this story of a woman who fears that she is losing her mind a little more every day. The fog itself seems to represent the confusion going on inside Paula's mind. I don't want to go too far into the plot, because there are a couple of rather large twists that I don't want to spoil for anyone. Ingrid Bergman plays Paula, a troubled young woman trying to escape her memories of her aunt's unsolved murder. Her lover (Charles Boyer) wants to take her to London with him to live happily ever after, but not all is quite what it seems. Joseph Cotton plays an investigator who take a particular interest in the unsolved murder of Paula's aunt. Watch for Angela Lansbury as the house maid. A great movie to be sure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie gets off to a sluggish start, each scene builds on top of the next until your heart is racing by the time it's finished. Bergman turns in a wonderful performance. Her range of emotions, apparently just below the surface come out to play as needed. Charles Boyer is perfectly cast and does a great job playing the creepy husband who almost succeeds in driving Paula mad. The scene where they are at a concert and she realizes that his watch is missing still makes my heart pound every time I see it. Along with the nervousness every time she must deal with the servants shows the range of the part, juggling between self doubt and insanity. Joseph Cotton, who turns up in the most unlikeliest of places is somewhat bland as the savior of Paula. The house, its furnishings, the costumes, the sets are all outstanding and add greatly to this film. If stranded on a desert island, this would be in my top 10 movies to take with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The superior version of "Gaslight"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director George Cukor's "Gaslight" is superior to the earlier British film. Under Cukor's direction, the excellent acting, cinematography, art direction, and editing create a psychological thriller much more suspenseful and atmospheric. Ingrid Bergman's remarkable performance of a loving vulnerable woman descending into madness is still astonishing 60 years later. The screenplay embellishes the original story, but gives it more sense. The only carp may be turning the Scotland Yard detective into a romantic interest -- a complaint that might be more easily dismissed if actor Joseph Cotton didn't sound so American. But Charles Boyer is probably perfect as the duplicitous husband, with his quick shifts from feigned charm to cruelty. In comparison, the 1940 British version seems clunky, more contrived, with less psychological depth. Although that earlier film has its interest, the more haunting 1944 version shows the Hollywood studio system at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good morning daffodils?Gaslight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film that I just don't think aged well with the years. George Cukor's Oscar nominated Gaslight has the feel of something that was fresh and unique back when released in 1944, today, however, it feels as though it was from a bygone era, complete with acting that somehow has become laughable where it once showed brilliance. A slow burning plot is laid out, showing us the systemic destruction of a woman's mind. Our lead Paula found the body of her dead aunt/caretaker when she was young. Now grown up, she has married a man in a whirlwind romance and decides to move back to the place of the murder with him. In that house, her mind begins to wander and frighten from sounds she hears at night and the dimming gaslights surrounding her. It appears she is also losing her mind and possibly stealing artifacts from around the house for no apparent reason and her husband's temper creeps out more and more as the time passes. The handling of the degenerative process concerning Paula is done well, but I feel that having seen so many movies like this one over the years ruined my experience. I pegged the conclusion and twist about fifteen minutes into the story and I have to say it was written on the wall quite loudly. Being, what could be, the first of its kind, that revelation at the end might have really stunned some people, now it just means we have to sit through some monotonous exposition and character progression before seeing what we all knew in the beginning was eventually going to happen.It's not even like we are on the cusp of sound evading film either, it happened almost two decades previous, but the acting almost comes across as too broad. Especially with lead actor Charles Boyer, who plays Paula's new husband Gregory Anton. He gives us shades of villainous facial expressions right from the get-go and never shows the audience anything to make us wonder if maybe he wasn't pure evil. With his role as it is, there can be no confusion of his motives and that, to me, takes away a huge part of this film. All suspense about what is happening is thrown out the window as soon as Paula discovers a letter from the past addressed to her deceased aunt. That moment seals Gaslight's fate. From there on, the only suspense was whether Paula's forced nervous breakdown would become real, making her fabricated insanity a reality.As far as Paula is concerned, I do believe Ingrid Bergman does a good job. Was the performance worthy of a Best Actress Oscar? I'd lean more towards no, but then I haven't seen any other film from that year, so for all I know she was the best. Her feigned waif persona comes across a little heavy-handed at the start, almost playing right into the fact that she was being lied to in order to think she was crazy. It felt like she knew her craziness was faked and had to play it up to make it appear more believable. This would have been a brilliant move if she knew what her husband was doing and was subverting his work to trick him, but that is not the case. It was just a somewhat hammy performance. I will say that towards the end, where the truth is slowly being revealed, she steps it up a bit and shines. Half a performance, though, does not a best of the year award make.The film is not without its charm either. Its conclusion is fun to watch and see what is truly going on with Boyer's role. A big part of that revelation is laid on the back of Joseph Cotten. Now here is a man that could act. I have never seen him in a role that wasn't believable or restrained in the realm of reality. He is the best part of the film and never misses a step. We are also treated to some comic relief from characters played by Dame May Witty, a neighbor, and the couple's live-in maid Angela Lansbury. In her first ever screen performance, Lansbury shows a lot of spunk and sarcastic wit. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere. Every foggy evening outside was beautifully shot and allowed the world without electricity to become a character of its own. As a whole, though, the film ultimately was too by-the-numbers and obvious to uncover its motives. I know this is all easy to say when so much has probably been lifted from it over the years, but that is where I'm coming from. One of the many hindrances to seeing old films today means I can never view them fresh or without the back catalog of cinema I have already seen being recalled to memory.</fullReview>

They misuse Courts to steal wealth and make trouble for grown offspring who act for the good. Russell Crowe spoke with clarity, recently telling Steve Kroft our 'Courts are very easily misused'.Gaslighting is an old effective trick by which estate-thieves hide in shadows and harass rightful inheritors of family wealth. Gaslighters' targets either go stark raving mad, behave in criminal manner out of desperation, or fold like a cheap camera to extortionate demands.Good News: Once you know they're Gaslighting you, their power vanishes instantly. I know. The Living Trust in my name and that of my murdered mother, Julia M. Zecchino, was stolen by shonk lawyers, greedy-gut distant relatives, and a Rhode Island HMO many call 'a mafia'.My family was gaslit for years until one relative's mind 'split' and they folded to blackmail. Thugs almost got away with it. That you're reading this proves they didn't. Lady Justice will inexorably find them just as she found Charles Boyer in "Gaslight".Criminals do the same things over and over, like wingless barnflies. Inevitably they're caught. "Gaslight" outlines the tactics, again popular in our era. "Gaslight" is both a crime prevention film and compelling story. Given the wealth of many seniors, the surplus of otherwise useless lawyers, and busy Boomers, isn't it surprising Gaslighting isn't more prevalent than it presently is?Root out this magnificent Film Noire and watch it-With lights dimmed!Dr. Paul Vincent ZecchinoManasota Key, Florida14 November, 2006"Thank you for showing me Man's lofty ideals - now let me show you the basement."- S.

		<fullReview>Combining the fantastic acting talents of the beautiful Ingrid Bergman and handsome Charles Boyer plus the supreme, intelligent direction George Cukor and a great supporting cast you get Gaslight: a cinematic masterpiece. It is mysterious, intriguing, gripping and spooky and the Victorian setting adds to this. This is almost Hitchcock like as it shares many similarities with his films.Alice Alquist, a famous entertainer, is brutally murdered in her home. Her niece, Paula (played wonderfully by Ingrid Bergman) finds her body but the killer cannot be found. Devastated and in shock, she is sent away to school, but returns 10 years later with her new husband (played by a mysterious Charles Boyer) in an effort to let go of her feelings towards the murder. However, it is not long before strange things start to happen: she forgets things, she hears noises upstairs. Does Paula find her mother's killer? Who is it? And what is the explanation for all the weird things? The script is incredibly good - quite realistic and eerie, very atmospheric and you almost feel claustrophobic as Paula does. It's funny how this movie affected me. The scenes leading up towards the end are incredibly good and explain everything. Certainly leaves you hanging.With the essential elements put together, Gaslight is an amazingly chilling, intriguing, mysterious, suspenseful thriller that just keeps you guessing and guessing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to drive your wife mad 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without the benefit of psychological expertise, it is fair to say that Gregory Anton (Boyer) is a certifiable psychopath. Not only does he kill a famous London singer for the chance to find some priceless jewels, but also when he fails, he waits for ten years and seduces the niece of his victim so that he will be able to get back into the house, which she now owns. The niece, Paula Alquist Anton (Bergman) falls head over heels for Gregory; they are soon married and, initially against her wishes, back living at the home in the Thornton Square section of London. Gregory begins to drive Paula mad slowly, first by giving her something then removing it secretly, chastising her for being forgetful. Soon Paula begins to hear sounds coming from the attic, and the gaslights dimming, while Gregory feigns innocence. When he begins to pin servants (one played by Lansbury, in her first role) against her and shaming her in public, she loses all control and, truly believing she is mad, hits her breaking point. Meanwhile, Paula's strange behavior doesn't go by unnoticed for Brian Cameron (Cotton), a Scotland Yard detective who was once a great admirer of Paula's aunt. Brian decides to look into the goings-on in the Anton house and when he uncovers the mystery, must convince Paula of the truth in order to save her life."Gaslight" is an essential film in the suspense genre; at times it was easy to forget that it was not a Hitchcock film, rather, directed by the masterful George Cukor, a man as known for his romantic comedies as for his melodramas. At times, "Gaslight" is genuinely creepy; the fact that it takes place at the turn of the century and we must rely on small lamps or natural lighting adds to the dramatic shadows and lighting. The Oscar-winning set design also contributes to the spooky atmosphere. Bergman, who won an Oscar for her performance in this film, is so fragile one expects her to crack any minute. A sheltered and timid woman after discovering her aunt's body as a child, she briefly comes out of her shell when she thinks she has found true love, until her husband begins his machination. Cotten, an excellent actor, was underused in this film, though he is technically the film's hero. It is Charles Boyer who turns in what I consider to be the most incredible performance of the film. He can turn his character from a charming, romantic man to a raving (or worse, icy) psychopath within seconds. With just a quick flash of his eyes, you know that he has locked on to yet another way to toy with Paula's mind. Good beat evil at the Academy Awards that year (at least on screen? it was Bing Crosby that won for "Going my Way", but at least he didn't beat his kids until he got home) but Boyer's performance should have won out.There were several suspense films that were released in 1944, (one of them, "The Uninvited" is quite good) but "Gaslight" has a hint of originality to it. I'm sure there are instances that I can't come up with from the silent film era in which one spouse tries to convince the other of their insanity for mercenary reasons, and there are many films that have visited this theme since, but "Gaslight" stands out because the villain is just SO evil that even people (like myself) who look for dark themes in their films may have a hard time grasping how much of a real deal this guy is. I would particularly recommend this film to Ingrid Bergman fans, but if you enjoy Cukor's lighter fare ("The Philadelphia Story", "My Fair Lady", "Pat &amp; Mike") check out this rare thriller from his filmography. Even his most melodramatic of melodramas can't compare to this one. 7/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman was one of a handful of truly beautiful women in films and she could act up a storm, which she does in "Gaslight". As the wife slowly being driven insane by Charles Boyer, she runs through every emotion....you see her coming to the false assumption that she is truly mad and you believe it as she whimpers and cowers and transforms herself into a mental wreck. It's an acting coup that deserved the Oscar that it garnered. Charles Boyer, in a bit of casting against type, does a good, low-key portrayal of the evil husband; he was somewhat typecast as a romantic lead but really is quite convincing here. A very young Angela Lansbury, in her film debut, is a standout as the snippy little housemaid who is used by Boyer to instill fear in Bergman. Joseph Cotton is miscast....another American playing a part for a British actor....why do they insist on doing that? Dame May Witty, always a delight, pops up here and there to give a bit of humor to an otherwise tense screenplay. George Cukor, known as a woman's director, shows his merit and talent in the way he handles Bergman's role. Overall, this is a very solid, exciting film that should be on everyone's list of "must sees". Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really NOT worth the hype...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy black &amp; white classics, but this one left me feeling like "Huh? What was that?" Not only that but the back of the actual videocase reads "he is a murderer obsessed with locating jewels hidden in their London home." Hello?! So much for plot twists or surprises. Actually, that didn't matter too much since these details are painfully obvious before the first hour of the movie is over. I can understand why Bergman was praised for her acting here, but at times, I felt like her character was really pathetic &amp; annoying. Again reading the back of the videocase, my hunch was affirmed: this movie was first a play. In some of the scenes, I distinctly got that "play" feeling. Anyway, I was hoping for a more "film noir, gut-wrenching, plot-twisting ending." I didn't get that. In the end, I can only wish that I got back two hours of my life...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly menacing melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of classic film 'Gaslight' is not quite one of my favourites, but it has a great cast who give almost uniformly fine performances and although the story has been done to death and is somewhat "dated" (a criticism this reviewer dislikes on the most part) much is done to make it gripping (especially the atmosphere) and the film has much to offer.The only real issue this reviewer found with 'Gaslight' was Joseph Cotten. It is not an awful performance, he is often sympathetic and charismatic and not as wooden as he sometimes could be. But he is very unconvincing as a Scotland Yard police officer, too young, too American and sometimes stiff, so he does seem out of place sometimes as a character that should have been introduced earlier and perhaps been in the film more.However, 'Gaslight' is a beautifully made film, the lighting just adds so much to the atmosphere and the tone of the film, the cinematography is haunting and luminous and the Victorian setting is so striking in its elegance and evocative atmosphere. Other excellent assets are George Cukor's intelligent direction, Bonislau Kaper's nail-biting, orchestrally lush and melodically rich music score (great use of classical music too) and a cracking script, which sizzles with subtle tension with the odd spot of wry humour that is surprisingly well balanced with everything else. Despite being a melodrama, 'Gaslight's' script avoids being too hammy or over-dramatic.'Gaslight's' story is not going to work for all tastes now and one can see the reservations. The criticisms that it is contrived, "dated" and that it has been done to death are valid and understandable. This said, this reviewer found herself absolutely riveted throughout the whole duration of 'Gaslight', even if the earlier film version is tighter structurally and a little less obvious (which were not problems at all to me, because the story on the whole is really well executed). The slow-folding tension and suspense was very effective, making the overwhelming intensity of the ending as this tension and suspense crescendos all the more powerful. Equally powerful was the whole dynamic between Bergman and Boyer, the intensity in the last half of the film genuinely frightening.Cotten aside, the acting is uniformly great. While Barbara Stanwyk in 'Double Idemnity' was my Best Actress pick for that year, Ingrid Bergman was still a more than worthy win in one of her best performances, she radiates on screen and performs her character's vulnerability with raw edge and poignancy. Have yet to see a better performance from Charles Boyer than the one he gives here in 'Gaslight', he is handsome and suave to begin with and then later on the more sadistic edge he brings is absolutely chilling. Dame May Witty brings a delightful dottiness and wryness, and Angela Lansbury is deliciously auspicious in a very early role.Overall, superbly menacing and very highly recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dastardly deeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gaslight is regarded as a classic but now feels dated as a heavy handed melodrama set in Victorian London. It is shot in close ups and foggy streets as the film was made in California.Charles Boyer marries Ingrid Bergman in Italy and they return to her London home, long been abandoned since her aunt, a world famous Opera singer was killed. However soon Boyer is domineering even trying to drive Bergman mad. At night while Boyer leaves her, she hears noises in the attic. Only Joseph Cotton who is hanging around with an elderly neighbour could come to her aid.As the film goes on Bergman's docility easily gets irritating but her desperation will certainly get you to hate the dastardly Boyer who we realise has ulterior motives in marrying Bergman and moving to London.The film does look quaint now and has not aged well. The contrived showdown between Bergman and Boyer at the end looks silly. Still it is a worthwhile Hitchcock type thriller to view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you know that "Gaslighting" was a word that originated from this movie? It's a means of psychological manipulation by confusing the victim. I came across this movie reference when reading about Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Narcs use gaslighting as a means of gaining control over their naive victims. But enough about that. This movie is so simple and stunning. The performances are brilliant. The slow and steady destruction of Bergman's psyche is artful and devious. I personally believe that if you have to engage a live audience, your script has to be really tight and tested on a theater audience. It's evident from the movie that it is based on a play because of how taut the script is. I love this movie and wish to watch more such classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing Combination of Film Noir and Psycho-Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dark and shivering study of Victorian villainy," (Bosley Crowther, New York Times review May 5th 1944) seems best to describe the spirit that predominates this screen adaptation of Patrick Hamilton's Broadway play that aired a few years earlier. GASLIGHT directed by George Cukor, a director that was more familiar with melodramatic stories of intense female sensibility (consider CAMILLE with Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor), displays a truly engrossing combination of film noir and psychology, something that was still winning widespread acclaim at the time.And the film won two Academy Awards being nominated for seven: Ingrid Bergman as Best Actress and Art Direction. But that is not the highlight of my review since absolutely different reasons lie behind the fact that GASLIGHT has truly stood a test of time and, thanks to its black and white images, may engross viewers of modern technologies.As James Berardinelli states in his review, the film may be divided into two parts, actually. The first half, as he says, is "deceptively romantic" (this deception embraces the female leading character and us all as the observers, viewers); the second half is an "ominous" tribulation filled with suspicions, moments of tension, "gothic, noirish and effective melodrama" (Filmsite). The Thornton Square is at the center of mysterious events that lead to fear of some characters and growing greed of others. Berardinelli rightly concludes that hardly any film can match "this picture's intricate psychology."It is nothing but a masterwork in the depiction of Paula Alquist (Ingrid Bergman) being planted the seeds of doubt about her husband and Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer) slowly growing horns of tyranny and greed. The couple hold the best dramatic moments of the film and, being set in the noirish claustrophobic whereabouts, they deliver something of a reality unforgettable. Their scenes are memorable thanks to flawless acting skills and the visual elements. The supporting characters need a special mention as well, primarily Joseph Cotten as Scotland Yard officer Brian Cameron who soon contributes to Paula's way to fresh air, charming luminous humour of Dame May Witty's in the role of Miss Thwaites who finally manages to see the couple, Barbara Everest as Elizabeth and, in her debut role, a newcomer to the screen Angela Lansbury as Nancy. The atmosphere of the movie is, actually, one of its main strengths. Who can forget the idyllic scenes of their honeymoon, who can possibly skip the haunting images of London in fog, who can fail to notice the shadows in the interiors and the psychological torments of the leading character.However, an important fact about this film is its psychology combined with the moral message. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most powerful depictions of manipulations and its mechanisms that not solely exist in some abstract reality that may occur far from simple citizens but indeed may exist and grow among anyone of us. The conceit and deception of superiority and the shrinking esteem derived from inferiority leads to confusion of unfair relations and the lack of honesty that the couple experience.The happy ending, flawed as it may seem and criticized by many film scholars, has its parallel and meaning. At last new future, new reality, a haven of fresh air outside of claustrophobic trauma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Over "Charade", "Gaslight" Is the Best Hitchcock Film Hitchcock Never Directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Cukor's "Gaslight" (1944), based on a play by Patrick Hamilton, was the MGM studio's attempt to overwrite history and replace the British film adaption of the same name made four years earlier. They succeeded. Few have seen Dickinson's "Gaslight" (1940), and most remember Cukor's. And it is indeed quite a treat. It's simply a well- made piece of cinema. British suspense has often been well translated into Hollywood and Alfred Hitchcock is probably the best example of this popular phenomenon. Cukor's film's British nature is veritably strong since it takes place in Victorian England, it has British humor and its share of Hitchcockian elements. The basic set-up of the story is that a woman, Paula Alquist (Ingrid Bergman) has lost her closest and dearest relative, a famous opera singer, at a very young age and now, as an adult, returns to the very place of crime with her husband, Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer). The familiar environment brings back memories and mysteries involved with the death of Paula's aunt. The strangely secretive marriage of Paula and Gregory as well as their few public appearances draw the interest of Brian Cameron (Joseph Cotten), a former fan of Paula's aunt, who thinks that Paula might be in danger. Overall, the story is very simple. The classical narrative works extremely well with a tight structure supported by a conventional style. To some, the film might seem utterly predictable, but in a way that's the whole point, and this is yet another parallel to Hitchcock. For the essence of Hitchcockian suspense lies in build-up rather than surprise. The viewer knows the mystery of "Gaslight" but is nonetheless excited to see the development of its revelation to the characters. As many know, the English expression "gas-lighting" refers to mental abuse where information is distorted in such a way that the person who receives it is made to think that she has lost her mind. This supplies the story with its basic motif, the gaslight, which strongly belongs to its historical milieu and is, despite its seeming narrative significance, left ambiguous in deeper meaning. Given this set-up, it is easy to see how "Gaslight" is really a film about power and imprisonment. On a historical-social level, it can be seen as an ironic comment on marriage as a prison for women who have been sentenced to a lower social status in comparison to their husbands. (Interestingly, Robert Siodmak's "The Suspense" (1944) reveals a situation where murder is the only escape for the husband from his Victorian-age marriage). On a general level of psychology, the film might also be seen as a story about being imprisoned by one's past, whereas, on a more private level, it can be seen as a story about the tormenting experience of manipulation. There is one scene in particular that deserves attention. Gregory has reluctantly taken Paula to a social get-together where he is able to make Paula believe in her kleptomania as well as in the urgent need of keeping her locked up, away from the eyes of the public. The private anxiety of Paula as she is surrounded by a large number of people is pure Hitchcock, whose films often feature brilliant sequences where characters feel most alert in crowded spaces.Although the film is hardly an imitation, its subtle sense of film-noir, the powerful presence of Ingrid Bergman, and its story about a frail woman being terrorized by a deranged man draw immediate associations with Hitchcock. For one, Hitchcock made his share of such stories in the 1940's, most notably "Rebecca" (1940), "Suspicion" (1941), and "Shadow of a Doubt" (1943). The films also bear a similar "predictability". If Stanley Donen's "Charade" (1963) is the best pastiche of the later Hitchcock style, "Gaslight" is a wonderful reflection of Hitchcock's style in the 1940's. Overall, and despite these parallels, Cukor's narrative in its classical nature is quite different from Hitchcock's perpetual desire to regenerate cinematic narrative and stands strongly on its own. The film is very worth seeing simply for the divine pleasure of watching the story unfold in a tight, precisely considered structure, making one yearn for Hollywood in the 1940's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>turns out to be a great film about psychological damage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I wasn't sure about Charles Boyer's performance in Gaslight. He plays the con man Gregory Anton (his real name?) who somehow seduces singer Paula (Ingrid Bergman) and marries her. He suggests moving to London and to a particular house... a house where she found her Aunt, murdered. They didn't find who did it, but for the moment that doesn't matter: that was in the past, right, and now they can make a new home for themselves in this house (with the upstairs of her aunt's relics boarded away. But about Boyer is this: he at first seems so evil, so conniving, that I thought that from here on it would be a little hard to take him seriously as a real threat to the real hero of the film, Paula. But as the story goes on, and this gaslighting takes place - as this has been coined now due to this film - I bought into Boyer's performance more, as this man who can turn on and off the charm when he needs to, at a whim, and is rapidly making this woman go out of her mind.It's all about, of course, where one puts the blame for things. You lost this object? Oh, wait, did I? No, I had it a moment ago, it can't be, where was it? Oh, I'm sorry I lost it, I can't believe it. Oh, it's alright dear (and in reality the item is not lost, just 'put away' somewhere else). It's all about mind-games, but in a very particular, passive-aggressive manner. This is all about mental abuse - of course, if Gregory were to ever raise a hand to this woman, it'd all be over - so that he can go after his real prize, the jewels that he just knows are in her late aunt's possession in this locked room. At first though the audience doesn't (or may not) quite know what his game is at, despite getting a clue early on, when Paula is privy to a letter from her aunt that he quickly snatches away, and how he gazes lovingly (like in a brief trance) at some jewels in a museum.And yes, Joseph Cotten thankfully is here as the police inspector who sees something odd - that this Paula woman is the spitting image of her late aunt, who he knew as a younger man - and that they are back at THIS house. Oh, and that nobody comes out, sometimes driving the maids a bit harried themselves (including debut performer Angela Lansbury, wow is she young and good in this). But really, this is Ingrid Bergman's show all the way; she has to make Paula fragile and yet not someone who we should think is stupid or ignorant. Or, rather, the gaslighting - coined due to what Anton is doing to the gas from behind the houses to make it seem like things are going up and down - may make her feel like she doesn't have control. That's the key here: who is in control of things, and how much will the control be twisted into something that is too painful to endure? Bergman has all of her capabilities as an actress at full tilt here; she embodies this woman's anxieties, but also how this man in her life can't ever make her fully happy. Actually, it's worse than that, as he dangles happiness and then takes it away in such a way as to make HER look bad. Watch the scene where the couple finally does go out - she insists to go to a music recital party to see an old mentor - and he does it again, acting like he's lost something, and it makes her break down in front of everyone. You can see in Bergman's performance, she really doesn't want to do this. But what expectations are there in this relationship? The man knows best, right? This man is trustworthy, correct? Bergman makes this into a heartbreaking character, but also someone who we hope, and know, is capable of rising up and trying to get some sort of justice for what's been done to her (with some help from good ol' Joseph Cotten). She won a richly deserved Oscar for this performance, by the way.This is classic suspense, the kind of material Hitchcock could have had fun with, and in George Cukor's hands is moody at times (watch for the scenes of the London fog, with Boyer walking like someone surely with something to hide), and then also engrossing but in an entertaining way. There is despair felt, but not in any soapy, unrealistic way; what's happening to Paula could, can, does happen to women all over the world, and in a big way the movie acts as a feminist statement, or more than that just a tale of empowerment: if you think something like this is happening to you, but aren't sure, here are some tell-tale signs right out of British dramatic suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Cukor's Gaslight is a movie very similar to the many Alfred Hitchcock movies that I saw, but this movie is less in depth when it comes to the psychological thriller part but it still had a superb screenplay. The movie stars Charles Boyer in a terrific performance as Greg Anton a man who comes to a new house with his new wife Paula (played by Ingrid Bergman in an Oscar winning performance)after her aunt gets murdered many years earlier, and then he keeps some jewels a secret and convince his wife that she is ill and out of her mind just to make her mad without even realizing it, then later on in the movie a detective named Brian Cameron (played by Joseph Cotten) who comes into the home to ask her some questions, and then find out Greg's little shortcut from upstairs in the attic back into their residence. Cukor's film tries to convince grown ups to watch out for who you marry because you may not know the way that he/she will treat you during the time course of the marriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Movie In Western Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Gaslight" is a superb rendition of the Shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness poignant foibles). This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Witty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting).The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot supremely depicts within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition. The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman is well contrasted with the 'southern race- cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian!The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the Gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly effusing the high signature European drama sense.If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most representative Western movie ever made - it would be "Gaslight" (1944).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If I could only get inside that brain of yours..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been some time now since I saw the original "Gaslight" from 1940. At the time some five years ago, I felt inclined to get hold of the 1944 film to draw a comparison, but things going the way they do, I'm only getting around to it now. With a fleeting memory of the earlier film, I'm at least able to say that both fare admirably as psychological thrillers, though upon reflection, it's apparent that there were some problems with the plot in the Boyer/Bergman picture.My main issue has to do with the character of Gregory Anton, portrayed by Charles Boyer. It took some degree of fortitude and patience to track down Paula Alquist (Bergman) from London to Italy with the intention to win her over and return to Thornton Square. He could have saved himself a decade's worth of time and planning by remaining in England and plotting the theft of the jewels following his murder of Alice Alquist. Having eluded the police successfully, it would have made more sense to me to rent the vacant home and take all the time he needed to search for the Empress Theodora jewels. Or, as he did when residing there with Paula, simply used the back alley, across the roof approach to the shuttered attic where the treasure was to be found. No fuss, no muss as they say.But I guess then, you wouldn't have much of a story. As for Paula, I guess it bothers me that she didn't have the backbone and self esteem to challenge her husband's behavior toward her. Instead of fretting over an occasional memory lapse, how about taking steps to make certain she wouldn't fall prey to Gregory's set-ups. Paula certainly was well educated and socially skilled, so allowing herself to be derided by Anton's merciless jabs seemed uncalled for.But, since that's the way they went for it, you have to give some credit to the players for their portrayals. Bergman earned her Academy Award with a performance that displayed an intense range of emotion. Jubilantly happy one moment, guardedly cautious the next, Bergman gains the viewer's sympathy as she reacts to the taunts of the vile and despicable Anton. There are moments when Boyer doesn't have to say a word, the menacing look on his face draws in the viewer as if a participant in the drama.Of the other principal characters, Angela Lansbury is confidently professional in her screen debut, a saucy maid who plays the part of a temptress with willful but understated glee. If there's a weakness in the main cast, it might be Joseph Cotten as the undercover detective Cameron. His off screen subjugation of Anton might have been better used to position Paula for a more physical confrontation with her husband. Wouldn't it have been great if Paula got in a few whacks with the knife before Cameron jumped in to make the save?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaslight ? it's a good title. It refers only to a detail of the plot, but the very idea of gaslight conjures up images of the smog and grime of Victorian London, of dimly lit chambers and Gothic atmosphere. And these are the images of which the picture is composed.Yes, Gaslight is all about atmosphere, or at least relies upon atmosphere for its impact. The cinematography plays an inordinately large part here. Although there is a lot of darkness, it is not quite like the stark blacks and crisp whites of what is known as film noir. It is instead a motley mix of deep greys. Much of the screen may be immersed in gloom, but the level of detail is amazing, with every item in each cluttered set clearly defined. Keeping all this detail in view is particularly important in giving the house its oppressive character. Joseph Ruttenberg was Oscar-nominated but did not win for his cinematography, while Cedric Gibbons' team bagged the award for their Art Direction and Interior Decoration. However this was at least in part down to how well Ruttenberg shows it off! That wealth of background detail is also important to director George Cukor. Cukor uses a lot of movement, not always to follow the characters but sometimes just to alter the view behind them, and thus change the tone. Take a fairly simple moment, the introduction of Dame May Witty's character. The scene opens with Bergman framed in close-up against the plainness of the seat ? tranquil in her own thoughts. When the camera is moved to reveal Witty, Cukor doesn't simply pull back or scan across, he has it wheel round in a right-angle, bringing the carriage window into view. The tone of the image has now completely changed, with the blur of scenery matching the intrusive, insensitive Witty character. There are hundreds of other equally fascinating examples you can discover for yourself if such things happen to interest you.Cukor also has the sense to "turn off" the busy backgrounds at key moments and focus us entirely on the actors. And there is a lot of fine acting to focus on here, most notably that of Ingrid Bergman. For much of the time she does not appear exceptional, merely steady and natural. It is at those moments of incredible strain when she becomes captivating. Her hysterical screaming is so utterly real, so piercing and frantic. This is something that actresses so frequently fail at, and one reason why melodramas tend to fall apart at the most crucial points. Bergman's abilities keep the thing afloat throughout. Charles Boyer's performance is a little simpler, but he nicely portrays the epitomic evil without hamming it up. An honourable mention goes to Tom Stevenson, who plays the copper Williams. For a Californian, he does a passable Cockney accent ? not completely seamless but at least hitting the right tones. Incidentally Stevenson is still alive at the time of writing, having turned 100 a few weeks ago.*But all the atmospherics and nuances of the performances serve as a backdrop to what is, in fact, a not particularly amazing thriller plot. It is not appallingly bad, and there are even some great things about it. It's particularly neat the way although it is not made clear for sometimes whether or not Paula is really going made or being set up, Anton is from the off set up as a rather shifty character. The fact that we feel we cannot trust him makes us keenly sense Paula's frustration and sympathise with her plight, rather than the thing looking like some woman-goes-gaga melodrama. But still, considered alone it's not the most plausible or tightly-constructed affair, and that's why the overwhelming tone of the piece and the sincerity of the acting make it what it is. The phrase "style over substance" is generally meant in a depreciatory sense, but a picture like Gaslight requires style by the bucketful.*Update November 2010: It appears Mr Stevenson in fact died in 2004, but the information was only just added to IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative Evil Under the Guise of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie several years ago, and although I don't remember it very clearly anymore (I'd love to watch it again), it always remained in my mind the impression that I had watched one of the finest psychological thrillers ever made.Ingrid Bergman plays Paula Alquist, a woman who knew tragedy in her life at a tender age: many years before the movie's story starts, she discovered the dead body of her aunt. Now she is returning to the same house in which she discovered the body, accompanied by her loving husband, Gregory Anton (played by Charles Boyer).It should be noted this movie is not a mystery. Boyer plays the villain, that is obvious from the start: Anton is a ruthless, cunning manipulator who concocts a scheme to drive Paula insane. He systematically makes her doubt her own senses and sanity and isolates her from everyone until she's wholly dependent on him.There is a narrative tool called 'dramatic irony', that Hitchcock used abundantly; it involves the viewer knowing more than the characters. This creates suspense because the tension is not so much about finding something, like in a mystery, but about how a situation will develop. Gaslight is one of the masterpieces of this type of suspense. It's dreadful, at times unbearable, to witness the vicious Anton manipulate the poor Paula. Paradoxically, this only makes us root harder for Paula to succeed.Ingrid Bergman won an Oscar for her performance in this movie, but for me it was Charles Boyer who stole the show. He created one of the best - and sadly forgotten - villains of cinema, a chilling portrait of an all too familiar evil, the abusive husband who, in the comfort of his house and hidden from society, and feigning tenderness and love, torments his wife at will.Joseph Cotten also deserves some credit for his role as a Scotland Yard inspector, as well as Angela Landsbury, in her first role, playing an unpleasant maid who further torments Paula.I don't remember many more details from the movie, but what I know is that it was a very enjoyable experience. Hitchcock may have been a unique film director, but in this movie, George Cuckor came very close to surpassing him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gee, everyone knows so much about the (apparently) many different versions of "Gaslight". This makes me want to see ALL of them. BUT - it does not take away from the beauty of this story, because the acting makes it so believable. Isn't that REALLY what movies should be ? The important factor of enjoying movies shot in different eras - about past eras - is to get yourself in the same physcologic attitude as the story is. You gotta live in that time-period and understand how people acted and felt in that era. Otherwise, you find yourself just "reviewing" the film, not really enjoying it. My opinion, anyway - It isn't difficult for me to get right into "Gaslight"....the settings are so authentically Victorian (so far as I know !) and the lighting is so spooky - I wasn't aware that turning-on another light in the house caused the ones already burning get dimmer. Thank you, it lets me know that "Paula" (Ingrid Bergman) is aware that she isn't imagining this aspect, although other folk deny it.It's been so long since the original release, I forgot that "Paula" was introduced to the dashing pianist "Gregory Anton" (Charles Boyer), and that she also was a singer (as her aunt was). Because I AGAIN came late into the TCM presentation, after the beginning of the movie, it took me a minute to remember why "Gregory" is trying to drive his wife mad. I also flashed that he was looking for priceless jewels, until it was mentioned by Scotland Yard that "Paula's" aunt had been given the jewelry secretly by a member of the royal family. Juicy!An after-thought: today, it would have increased the suspense had there been more piano-playing by "Gregory", then immediately destroying "Paula's" happiness by accusing her having done something inexplicable. However, George Cukor directed brilliantly; John van Druten's script was intelligently well-written; Angela Lansbury ("Nancy Oliver") was fantastic (I thought she was "Gregory's" lover; the lighting was perfect. All of the roles were well-acted, and Dame Mae Witty was a screech.SO, what not to like about "Gaslight" - just get yourself into the mood and enjoy. If you're one of those who do not like to know the plot in advance, don't read too many of the comments posted here. It doesn't bother me at all - I am looking for THE STORY ! Bravo !!</fullReview>

BTW the maid is Angela Lansbury (Murder, She Wrote) in her first major motion picture role, not Elsa Lanchester (Bride of Frankenstein). Joseph Cotton is wonderful as the detective who falls in love with Ingrid Bergman's character and he stops at nothing to prove that her husband (Charles Boyer) is slowing trying to drive her mad. Your heart just breaks watching her self-image deteriorate so rapidly. Dame May Whittey make a great nosy neighbor who unknowingly provides important information about Charles Boyer to Joseph Cotton. If you liked this movie, I recommend "Spellbound" with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It's one of the first Hollywood films to deal with psychoanalysis. Highlights include dream sequences by Salvador Dali. Don't forget to look for Hitch's cameo appearance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Victorian suspense films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best Victorian suspense films that I have ever seen. The whole film just melds perfectly with itself. The cinematography, the costumes, the sets and especially the atmosphere is just unbelievably amongst the best ever seen on the screen. If you have ever seen the original British version made in 1940, you just would not believe that they were the same film, as the British version is a wee bit dull, but not much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doing Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got to watch this in 2008, after borrowing the DVD from the local library. A haunting, moody thriller-drama in Black-and-White, this boasts a wonderful slow-burn storyline, along with all-round great performances. I'm a sucker for any movie Ingrid Bergman acted in, never mind whether/not its a good quality one. So, use that to judge my take on this master-work of class.The plot's simple, and though the makers are different (Cukor, of 'The Philadelphia story', Adam's rib', 'The marrying kind' and 'My fair lady'), it smells, nee, reeks of Hitchcock, even up to the use of lighting and framing, in addition to numerous plot devices used to propel the movie forward, including the plot contrivances.Plot's simple - the protagonist may, or may not, be going mad; and her loving husband, may, or may not be trying to gain from her' for lack of a better word here, fall. Each footfall, each creak, each sound-byte is designed to amp up the tension, which it does, effectively. Not quite 'After dark my sweet', but its got Bergman.Cotten appears in this as well, and after his appearances in 'The 3rd man' and 'Shadow of a doubt', this seems to be a tad weak, since his presence is very contrived, the way it would be in a mainstream Bollywood flick. Though I enjoy his presence and his acting, this role, unfortunately, does not do anything good for him.Once again, this is a great watch, and would make a classic companion piece to 'Rebecca', and I'd watch it again-and-again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Husbands were surely disliked in the 1940's, at least by writers and filmmakers. There is no shortage of films depicting the villainous husband targeting the unsuspecting and defenseless wife. A couple years prior to this one we had Suspicion, and a couple years after, we had Notorious. The latter also features Ingrid Bergman who won her first Oscar for Gaslight, one of the more atmospheric of the psychological thrillers.Based on the Patrick Hamilton play, this one features terrific lead performances by Ms. Bergman and Charles Boyer, a role quite against type for France's romantic leading man. Joseph Cotten delivers a solid (and nice) supporting role as the interested Scotland Yard detective, and making her screen debut is an 18 year old Angela Lansbury (yes this movie is now 70 years old).Mr. Boyer is quite convincing and creepy as the despicable husband out to convince his bride that she is slipping into insanity. The psychological abuse is painful to watch, and the art/set direction provides such perfect decor that we share the claustrophobia and entrapment with Bergman's Paula. This audience connection allows for a most effective comeuppance or revenge scene that is simply delicious.There was actually a mostly unsuccessful UK film version in 1940, but it doesn't stand up to this expert production from director George Cukor. Mr. Cukor is the legendary director behind such classics as Little Women, The Philadelphia Story, and My Fair Lady. Gaslight received 7 Oscar nominations and in addition to Ms. Bergman's win, it also took home the statue for Best Art Direction. The film, Cukor and Boyer all lost out to that year's big winner Going My Way (Bing Crosby, Leo McCarey). Not many films have a psychology term named after them ... here's hoping you are never a victim of "gaslighting".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an intense drama about psychological abuse, and implants the virulent dual-murders, one from the past and another is ongoing, one is fulfilled and the other is up in the air, George Cukor (from MY FAIR LADY 1964, 6/10; A STAR IS BORN 1954, 8/10 and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY 1940, 8/10) blindsided me with his own creation of film noir, and conducts Boyer and Bergman's career-best performances. An unsolved crime at the beginning, the film drops from a whodunit detective story rather early, after the a short spell of foreign sojourn (Lake Como, where else would be more romantic?), the newly-weds returns to London, for Paula (Bergman), the scar dooms to be lifted open and the bare wound is even more deleterious than she could ever imagine. Adapted from Patrick Hamilton's play "ANGEL STREET", the film predominantly is a two-hander between Paula and Gregory (Boyer), and about how Gregory punctiliously and effectively manipulates and impairs Paula's mental state, he ensnares Paulo into a self-doubt of her sanity (the very first outing in London is to visit the torture chamber, no wonder all the Museums of Torture are prevailing in the touristic attractions here in Europe), insulating her from meeting other people, trapped her in the mansion and slowly yet mercilessly infuses all the hallucinogenic chicanery to further damage her flimsy nerve, which includes the titular gaslight and it also serves as a signpost of his surreptitious whereabout every night. Boyer is quite extraordinary in expressing venom under his high-and-mighty politeness, frowning and pouting, his devilish complexion enlivens the film's watchability even at its corniest part, a bestial man indeed, but a tour-de-force exemplar of his kind. Bergman, although is the hapless victim who is unwittingly sleeping with the enemy, very anti-femme- fatale indeed, manages to deliver a visceral transition of Paula's trauma, which certainly out of her usual graceful and elegant comfort zone, and albeit her Nordic height, it is such a stretch for her to reveal her female vulnerability without any reservation. She got her first Oscar for the film, I'm now wavering in choosing my pick between her and Barbara Stanwyck in Billy Wilder's noir paradigm DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10).A third-billed Joseph Cotten is the cardboard detective eventually will be the hero, and Dame May Witty, the garrulous busybody, appears sporadically in case she overstays her welcome. The film is also Angela Lansbury's film debut, at the age of 17 during the shoot, the young flighty maid might only be a pawn in the plot, but a rather singular boldness and an Oscar nomination presages her reverend orbit as one of the most versatile character-actress in the Hollywood history. Overall, the film is a highly-recommendable piece of psychological study, shot in minimal bleakness (even the gala concert is intentionally shortened) with solemn and choppy original score from Bronislau Kaper. From a modern-day POV, one might find Paula is a stereotyped exploitation about how women usually are portrayed in the yesteryear, which seems out of topicality now (not domestic violence, just the showcase of female's utter dependence and extreme delicacy), so, it might undermine the reception from the younger generation, but anyway, at least, a big bravo to Bergman and Boyer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but it was only after watching it I found out that the leading actress won the Oscar, so I was satisfied twice, from director George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story, Born Yesterday, A Star Is Born, My Fair Lady). Basically famous opera singer Alice Alquist has been murdered, and the perpetrator escaped without the hidden jewels he wanted, because young niece Paula (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ingrid Bergman) watched him commit the crime, she was being cared for following her mother's death. She travels to Italy to try and escape the memory of that terrible night at Number 9 Thornton Square in London, and she trains to become an opera star, and while doing this she meets and falls in love with Gregory Anton (Oscar nominated Charles Boyer). They eventually get married, and he convinces her that she should return home to London and to the house where the horrific incident happened, as it was bequeathed to her, and so that she can calm her anxieties, and all her aunt's possessions will be stashed in the attic. Moving into the house Paula comes across a letter addressed to her aunt, written two days before her murder from someone named Sergius Bauer, Gregory snatches this in a sudden violent way, but he calms and explains that he is only concerned about her. As time goes by strange things start happening concerning Gregory's attitude and controlling his temper and Paula's memory and mental state, she is made to think with his nasty manipulation that she is losing her mind. This includes making her think she has lost a valuable brooch, taking a picture down from the wall and recollecting where it actually was, and noises coming from the attic and gaslights dimming for no reason, he tells her it is all her imagination. Gregory is also making sure to isolate her from anyone who tries to visit her or intrude in any plans, including curious neighbour Miss Bessie Thwaites (The Lady Vanishes' Dame May Witty), and on the one occasion they do go out to a musical Paula is made to become hysterical. The young maid Nancy Oliver (Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury) is causing some stirring in the household as well, but there may be help in the form of undercover Scotland Yard Inspector Brian Cameron (The Third Man's Joseph Cotten) who is trying to get to the bottom of the murder, and the location of the missing jewels. He eventually gets close to Paula and convinces her that she may not be going mad after all, and she finds the letter that Gregory had taken from her, it turns out that Gregory is actually Sergius Bauer, he has been searching the attic for the jewels, and he murdered her aunt. The end sees Gregory finally caught for the murder he committed and attempting to steal the jewels that he did manage to find, and with him tied up Paula gets her own back by psychologically torturing him like he did to her. Also starring Barbara Everest as Elizabeth Tompkins, Eustace Wyatt as Budge, Emil Rameau as Maestro Guardi, Edmund Breon as General Huddleston, Halliwell Hobbes as Mr. Muffin, Tom Stevenson as Williams, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Lawrence Grossmith as Lord Dalroy and Jakob Gimpel as Pianist. Bergman gives an Oscar worthy performance as she is mentally tortured by her devious and evil husband, Boyer is of course fantastically menacing with his suave mannerisms that are overshadowed by his very cold looks, and a young and beautiful Lansbury is terrific with her cockney accent and opinionated maid character. I can agree with the critics a bit in them saying that this film is a little dated, but it still keeps you watching as all the psychological tricks have the ability to grip you, it is certainly a period melodrama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Ingrid Bergman was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and the film was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you compare this film with the earlier English 1940 version, I think you will find the quality much the same. The one thing I like about the American version is the better confrontation between Paula and Gregory at the end. We are all wanting the worm to turn and I think this was carried off better in the American film. I agree that Joseph Cotton was an odd choice for a Scotland Yard Detective. He even received visitors in his office wearing a smoking jacket.One thing I find so interesting in these films made during the early 20th century is that when the film was made, the set decoration, dress and manners would be well within living memory of those making the film, hence the authenticity. You wouldn't have to go to an antique shop for props, they would be in many homes. For example, when a picture was taken from the wall there would be a light patch on the wall. This if from the soot from burning oil lamps. Who would think of that today. Meet me in St. Louis is another example of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me way too long to finally see Gaslight. Boyer and Bergman are terrific. Cotton and Lansbury add marvelous support. The only reason I can't give Gaslight a resounding ten is because somehow the identity of the strangler is much less of a mystery than it should have been for viewers with a modicum of intuition, aside from that...the movie is a Masterpiece of bad vibes and manipulation and madness. Marriage generally comes down to a battle of sanity so the union of Bergman and Boyer will be troubling to members of all married couples who are engaged in the customary battle to prove that they are more sane than their spouse and are therefore on the higher moral and ethical ground which ends up being the essential factor in issues of control. Boyer can be charming one moment, monstrous the next instant and then paternal and nurturing while Bergman can go from loving and supportive to vulnerable to insane to ironic to vengeful as quickly as Boyer.Don't wait forty plus years to see this one.They don't make 'em like this anymore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaslight is a nice little thriller/drama where poor Bergman thinks she's going mad, courtesy of her not so loving husband.It isn't the most original or unpredictable of plots, at least not by today's standards, but it has some nice moments in it. The movie does itself disservice by having a rather slow and tedious beginning, that threatens to put the viewer off, but if you hold out the movie picks up pace and gets better.To me, the acting feels a bit too much like over-acting, as it does in almost every film of this era. Perhaps it's not how you're supposed to feel, but I can't help it. Bergman in particular seems to struggle a bit at times with her mental breakdown. Boyer, however unrealistic his characterisation may be, is nevertheless pretty entertaining as one of the slimiest movie bad guys I've seen.To sum it up, Gaslight is a fairly entertaining old-school chiller that still holds up reasonably well.

		<shortDescription>"An elegant slice of Hollywood melodrama."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GASLIGHT is a remake of the British picture of 1940 based on the successful stage play by Patrick Hamilton.GASLIGHT is the story of a murderer (Boyer) who killed an actress-singer called Anne Alquist for her precious stones, which are hidden away somewhere in her house in London's Thornton Square, but he didn't find them. Having escaped justice for ten years and changed his name from Serges Bower to Gregory Anton, he marries the late actress's niece, Paula Alquist (Bergman), so that he can move back into the house and continue his search for the gems under the cover of darkness. At the same time he systematically tries to drive his wife insane because he fears that she will discover his true identity.Even though it lacks the sense of electrifying tension that distinguished it's predecessor, as an elegant slice of Hollywood melodrama, it makes a classy entertaiment. While Boyer's portrayal of the villain lacks the obnoxious and Victorian bully characterisation that Anton Walbrook brought to the part in the original, the basic theme of the evil husband trying to drive his wife out of her mind through mental torture is still disturbing. The stars, Boyer, Bergman and Joseph Cotton as the Scotland Yard man who finally brings the killer to justice, thus saving the wife's sanity all give fine performances. A 17-year old Angela Lansbury made her film debut here as the rather flirtatious parlour maid whom Boyer cleverly uses to add humiliation to his wife's injury. This is another stand out performance along with Dame May Whitty as Miss Thwaites, an inquisitive neighbour with a taste for murder mysteries who keeps on trying to get into that house where the murder happened.Academy Awards went to Ingrid Bergman and Art Director Cedric Gibbons, while the film was nominated as best picture as was Cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg, Charles Boyer and even Angela Lansbury. The film has been reissued on DVD including a theatrical trailer, a documentary about the film and newsreel footage of the 1944 Academy Awards. I hope that the British version will also be given a DVD release too, it deserves it. Incidentally, it is alleged that MGM tried to destroy the negative of the English original so that it wouldn't been compared with their technically superior film, but they had a hard act to follow in recreating the tension that director Thorold Dickinson created in that film.</fullReview>

I love the energy that Ingrid has, a believability that you just don't find that much anymore. I always say that you can tell how good an actor or actress is by believability. It's called character acting. If you can forget that that is Ingrid and just think of her as a woman on the verge of insanity, then she did a great job. One of the best character actresses today is Sandra Bullock, but more on that another time.Another sign of a great actor or actress is versatility. This role was way different from "Casablanca", yet she was just as believable in either case.It kept me on the edge of my seat and the ending was a heart pounding race to see who would end up in custody first.I always say when I write these things that I loved it but you might not.

Thin plot given gossamer treatment by overrated director George Cukor; Cukor knows a great many things on how to showcase an actress, but he doesn't handle the men quite as well and his attention to plot details is murky. In the lead, Ingrid Bergman is highly uneven. With the camera so close on her face, Bergman is forced to feign and swoon continuously under the eye of the audience, and it's a gambit that doesn't pay off (one is simply too aware of the actress's tics to feel the full tension of the plot). Some suspense is delivered, but Cukor relieves the atmosphere of tautness through his lack of control over the scenario. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the great cast which also afforded me another opportunity to admire Ingrid Bergman's beauty, this movie wasn't nearly as appealing as I had hoped. That was because of the downer of a story.I did not find it fun to watch an innocent woman being mentally tortured for an hour, being accused of things she didn't do and slowly being driven insane. Charles Boyer is effective as the vile husband. Bergman looks best in the beginning of he film with her hair down and smiling a lot. After that, it's the opposite. The last part of the movie, when Cotten starts to investigate, is very good and saves the film somewhat. My only question - concerning the story - is why the maids aren't found guilty of conspiring with Boyer since it appears they do so, especially in Angela Lansbury's case.Overall, too depressing to watch more than once. Too many viewings of this and you'll want to take the gas pipe, not the gaslight.</fullReview>

But i think she's perfect in this movie, she is believable every single time, you inevitably go with her downwards that spiral of depression and despair for believing she's losing her mind. Charles Boyer was flawless as the sociopath that ruins ones live to serve his interests solely. I loved some of his facial expressions, and particularly that close up on his face when he asked Bergman about the picture.The movie is brilliant! I do love a good psychological thriller, being one of my favorite genres. The story is incredibly good, the pace is right, the dialogs weren't very clever, they didn't have much depth as you would expect of this genre. What i mean is, Bergman believed to easily she was losing her mind without questioning herself and the times she did it was as if it was a rhetorical question. But given the year it was filmed it's excusable since men didn't expect women to think too much.Overall putting the film in the year he was filmed, it's pretty good, and very enjoyable even for todays audiences. I rate it as a "must see".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changing times make Cukor's impeccable Gaslight more exasperating than frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When, shortly after the unsolved murder of her opera diva aunt, Ingrid Bergman practices the "mad" scene from Lucia di Lammermoor, we pretty much know what she's in for. George Cukor's impeccable direction insures that not a detail goes without its later echo: A trophy glove gone missing, a hard-of-hearing cook, a shimmering crown diamond in the Tower of London -- all bide their time until their placement pays off later in the movie. That meticulous craftsmanship, however, is to be admired -- and remains one of the chief reasons why we still watch Gaslight. Otherwise, it is dating rather poorly. Based on a stage play set in a fogbound London (more in the Edwardian than Victorian age, I think), it presupposes many assumptions we are now likely to question. Bergman is wooed by Charles Boyer for nefarious purposes -- to retrieve jewels which his murder of the aunt failed to uncover. But could an intelligent young woman brought up in wealth and privilege be so easily dominated by her husband that she could be persuaded she was losing her mind? (Although a tensely orchestrated scene at a ritzy musicale almost convinces us of the sex-specific conventions at work -- her fragile vulnerability and his utter villainy.) Did it truly require the intervention of a male stranger (Joseph Cotten) to put matters right? Times have changed, and now it has become difficult to suspend disbelief on such points. And even if we do go along with the old-fashioned conceits of the film, the worm turns much too late in the game to accommodate today's brisker paces and more confrontational tastes. Nonetheless, the movie is made up of many marvels, among them Angela Lansbury's screen debut (she was 17) as a flippant and tarty maid. And Ingrid Bergman's face, of course, is as extraordinary an object of contemplation as the camera ever found.</fullReview>

The script is always exciting and has a tad bit of humor and the suspense mounts. It tells the story of Paula Alquist(Bergman),the teenage niece of an opera star who has been murdered in her home. After her aunt's death, Paula goes to live and study in Italy. Fourteen years later,she falls in love with her piano teacher,Gregory Anton(Boyer),they have a whirlwind courtship and marry. Paula decides she wants to live in her aunt's house in England because of all the fond memories she had before the murder. Paula's new life with Gregory seems to be going well, but things soon change.The Antons never invite anybody in their home and are rarely seen in public. Gregory tells people that Paula is too ill to see anyone. Things are misplaced in the house and Gregory blames Paula for losing them. She insists she never takes them. At night, Paula hears strange noises in the attic and her gaslight dims down and goes on again. Gregory makes Paula believe she's going insane. When they do go out,a Scotland Yard detective(Joseph Cotten)recognizes Paula from her childhood and sees strange things happening. A noisy neighbor(Dame May Whitty)also senses things are amiss. Bergman plays the paniced woman to perfection. I couldn't seen anyone else in her part. Boyer gives an often frightening presence on screen as the wicked tormentor. The film sounds like Alfred Hitchcock directed it,but it was directed by George Cukor. This is a must see! I give it a 91/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful acting I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingrid Bergman's performance in a few scenes sent me into shock- she so accurately shows the breakdown of herself.If you are here to review whether this film is worth your time- if you do like film-- this is worth your time. It isn't, as its overview tries to paint- depressing or "deflated"- out of its time. Instead, it is an awesome glimpse into what makes a person- what strength a person musters.I ought to say something of the plot, direction/producing, supporting actors, and the like, but cannot. It will take some time, and a few more viewings before I can fairly judge these other things besides- I can little view them in anyway but by remarking them 'great'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done movie and script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been years since I saw this fine film in the movies, and all I could remember was the gas light going up and down and nothing else about the script. Fortunately TCM showed it last night without commercial interruptions and it has been a long time since I have enjoyed a drama as much as I did. Charles Boyer was excellent as the plotting husband and you cannot praise the performance of Ingrid Bergman who was outstanding as always in her part, as the victim of her husbands plot. For once I cannot say go to the movie theater to see it, but if TCM shows it again do watch it as it is well worth your time and with no commercials to interrupt the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Hollywood chestnut feels hopelessly dated despite neat cinematography and fun, over the top performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A criminal burglarizes the home of a wealthy opera singer in London, looking for a set of expensive jewels. During the burglary he murders the opera singer but when the singer's nine year old niece interrupts the crime, the criminal flees after failing to discover where the jewels are hidden in the home. This is essentially the opening of the old Hollywood chestnut, 'Gaslight', starring Hollywood icon, Ingrid Bergman, as Paula Alquist Anton, the protagonist of this rather slow-moving, dated 'mystery-thriller'.Following the murder, little Paula is sent to Italy where she studies to become an opera singer like her aunt. Now as an adult, her music teacher becomes exasperated with her as her mind is never on her music studies and she can never give up obsessing about the murder of her aunt. She ends up returning to the old house in London where her aunt met her demise after meeting Gregory Anton (played by another Hollywood icon, Charles Boyer) who is her piano accompanist during her opera lessons and an aspiring composer. All the courtship scenes between Paula and Gregory set in Italy serve as unnecessary exposition and it takes quite a bit of time before we get to the meat and potatoes of the story: Gregory's attempt to gain control of Paula's home by convincing her that she's losing her mind.Later on in the film, we learn that Gregory gains access to the attic, where Paula (at Gregory's behest) has placed all of her aunt's belongings. Gregory gains access by entering an domiciled home, two houses down the block, then climbing onto the roof and through a skylight into the attic. The question arises why he never entered the home to look for the jewels years before Paula had reached the age to enter into marriage. It's posited that since the jewels would have been so easily recognized as stolen, Gregory would have been unsuccessful in fencing them, so the only way he could take possession, was by having his wife committed and legally being declared the new and complete owner of her estate.Unfortunately, once Paula discovers the letter from 'Sergius Bauer' addressed to his aunt, coupled with Gregory's angry outburst, it becomes pretty clear that Bauer and Gregory Anton are the same person. Act Two involves one repetitious scene after another of Gregory attempting to drive Paula batty by making her believe that she's either hallucinating or stealing items from him or the home. It all begins with the brooch Gregory gives Paula, which she loses at the Tower of London. Soon afterward, a picture is no longer in the frame on the wall and again Gregory blames Paula for taking it. When Paula finally finds the picture behind a table, Gregory accuses her of having put it there (when it's obvious that Gregory has been hiding all the objects all along).More of Gregory's tired machinations are trotted out before the climax. That includes the footsteps Paula hears up in the attic (that's actually Gregory rummaging upstairs trying to find the aunt's jewels) and the gaslights dimming up and down, with Gregory once again, at the controls. The 'last straw' is when Paula finally insists on getting out of her cloistered existence by accepting a socialite's invitation to a party. There, Gregory pulls another one of his 'hide and seek' routines, pretending his watch has been stolen and now finding it in Paula's purse. Clueless Paula, who is not only besotted with bad boy Gregory to begin with, and is also fragile due to the tragic circumstances of her childhood, is unable to trust herself, despite knowing deep down that Gregory's accusations are untrue.With little suspense for a good chunk of the film, we at least get to enjoy the antagonist's comeuppance at the hands of the solid as a rock Scotland Yard Inspector, Brian Cameron (played by solid as a rock 'Yankee' actor, Joseph Cotton). He's been trailing Gregory all along and with the help of a cop on the beat along with the Anton's servants, manages to subdue the villain, tying him up in the attic (one wonders why Director Cukor chose not to show the fight between Cameron and Anton, up in the attic).While Ingrid Bergman does take on a role that would NOT make any feminist proud throughout most of the film, the film's scenarists throw the woman's movement a bone by finally having Paula give Gregory his due?she pretends she's insane, unable to 'recall' where the knife is, which Gregory could use to set himself free.'Gaslight' is based on a stage play that's rooted in an earlier time. It's poorly written but features some nifty 'noirish' cinematography and excellent over the top acting from the principals along with Angela Lansbury in her first screen role. Lansbury plays one of the servants, a sassy working-class gal who adds to the protagonist's paranoia at every turn. It's an excellent performance but one wonders how Lansbury could have been nominated for best supporting actress at the Oscars, since her on screen time is extremely limited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There'a a reason audiences watch film narratives and it generally has to do with withholding portions of the story to create interest, tension, or realizations.This obvious, one-note movie does not eventually reward a viewer because from the start, the audience identifies with Bergman; and we immediately interpret Boyer as a sociopath trying to destabilise his wife's sanity... a viewer hates him from the first few minutes. It's not played to be read two ways, and the film offers no other plot point. It's irritating in the extreme to watch the same type of scene play out over and over to almost two hours in length. You could go mad yourself watching this. Gaslight fails utterly, because it's without complication or interest, unless you like old movies for old movies sake. This is a very stupid, obvious movie. If you can't guess the big ending 4 minutes into the movie (a tell-all prologue), you're in a coma. If Ingrid is this dumb, she deserves to be driven crazy. Who knows themselves so poorly that they can be fed a revised version of their own life and believe it? A bunch of histrionics from Bergman don't raise the film's value. Joseph Cotten is also in the similar, but far superior 'Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte.' The critical difference is that H.H.S.C. features more free-floating viewer identification, and villains are not assigned until well into the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake was the epitome of Hollywood's hands in the cookie jar. Instead of leaving a masterpiece at rest, the studio chose to remake this film only four years after the original was released and completely butchered it. To begin, they brought too many bigger named stars into the picture. Ingrid Bergman overacted her part as Paula Alquist, bringing Hollywood insanity to the screen instead of this feeling of real fear or insecurity. Also troubling is the role of her husband, played by Charles Boyer, who never quite gets that slimy taste in your mouth like Walbrook did. He is acting, and you can tell from the moment that he opens his mouth on screen. Add in one of the maids played by Angela Lansbury (of Murder, She Wrote notoriety) and you have a literal Hollywood remake equation. We have all seen this before, more money = bigger actors + bigger publicity + more chances for Oscars. Boy, did this equation work well for Bergman. She was awarded an Oscar for her portrayal (and nearly everyone else was nominated for their parts) of Paula, which to me seemed like nothing more than overacting to get that feeling of "insanity". There was no reality to her performance, and sadly should not have been awarded.Watching these two back to back you really see how Hollywood the 1944 version became. It became even more apparent when there was more stories added to build character depth. The beginning where Paula is related to the murders and the subplot dealing with how her and Charles Boyer met was hysterical. It was unnecessary and a waste of time. The original did not carry these scenes and it was better, wouldn't you think that studio bosses would want to keep a good idea instead of turning it to mush? These added scenes and mixture of events only created a jumbled mess that was harder for me to follow than really enjoy. With so much excitement after watching the original, this was very difficult to watch. Director Cukor never captured that eeriness of the gaslight or the darkness of London as well as Dickinson was able to. Cukor was a Hollywood dog following the leash that was given to him by the studio. It was sad to see these two together and do not suggest this version. The beauty and innocence coupled with fear and insecurity just wasn't the central theme of this film (as it was with the original) and ultimately it hurt it in the long run.Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one REALLY shows its age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this film doesn't really deserve to be called "a classic", because it really shows its age: it may be technically excellent, but the obvious script and Boyer's overacting (he seems to have "I am BAD" written all over his face ) are unforgivable by today's standards. "Gaslight" has a few effective moments, but, as a whole, it doesn't quite click.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>poor adaptation of a great play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is proof positive that hollywood can take a fine play, hire hack writers and 3 big name stars and destroy it completly.The plot changes left the film so much less suspenseful that the play, joseph cotton,normally a great actor was terrible as an english detective (SINCE HE WAS TOO YOUNG FOR THE ROLE IT WAS CHANGED SO THAT THE CHARACTER DID NOT INVESTIGATE THE ORIGINAL MURDER CASE) Boyer is adequate but they had to make the role a frenchman, Bergman too was not all she could have been..but lets not blame the cast they had to sail through the muck along with the audience. for a better film try the 1939 version that mgm had supressed in order to made this lousy film.</fullReview>
