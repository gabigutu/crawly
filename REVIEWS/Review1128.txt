		<shortDescription>A Time Machine Trip Back To The Texas Summer Of 1976</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I graduated in 1976 from a high school in North Dallas and this entire movie is so spot on it's scary. It is my favorite film. I've seen it hundred's of times and every time it's like watching it for the first time. Only someone that was there and lived through those days could have directed such a movie. I drove a 70 dark blue Chevelle SS 454 with a 4-speed, over 400 HP and all of the goodies Wooderson described. Starting that car up, listening to the roar of that engine and burning out in 1st gear while in a thick cloud of blue smoke in front of the high school at 3PM while wasted......doing over 80MPH in 2nd gear....oh yea! I feel sorry for the teenagers today that drive the limp wrist fluffs of metal that pass themselves off as cars these days. I was a stoner like Pickford smoking weed non-stop. Some mentioned that the heavy drug use was not too common. Well, at our school it was beyond common. Before school, during school (in the bathroom and football field) and after school. Our school had a smoking area outside the cafeteria where everyone went to light up. The opening scene with Aerosmith "Sweet Emotion" slowly building up and Pickford driving his Goat and girlfriend in the school parking lot kills me every time. I cannot imagine a better opening scene for the movie. That was pure genius. The funny thing is Linklater did not show getting licks from the coach or the principal. For all the "uninitiated" back then all a coach or an asst. principal had to say was "Smith, I want to see you back at my office now". Our coach had a paddle he personally made that he kept on his wall over his desk. It had about 30 holes drilled in it and it was covered in black electrical tape! When that one came down you knew it! Now with all the PC people coach would go to jail for "assaulting the poor boy" Hell, back then it was called character building. As I remember from the 7th grade on licks were given out. The soundtrack. Best ever. Might as well be back at White Rock Lake or Lake Ray Hubbard on a Friday night getting wasted. Head East was a nice touch. Every time I listen to that soundtrack I remember things I have not thought about in 25 years. The man that portrayed Pickford's dad was dead on. Accent, demeanor along with the big caddy and the tennis playing wife in the mini-skirt and puffed up hair. Some of the reviewers mentioned they did not think it was too realistic showing/mixing a lot of sexual activity among the freshman girls. That is another point I must dispute. Maybe at their school in their town of 500 or their strict upbringing but at our junior high and high school the freshman and younger girls were pretty wild. I mean really "wild"! This is coming from someone who "lost it" at 12. So insinuating things about a 15 or 16 year old freshman is pretty tame. 15 and 16 year old's were the "world travelers" to us 13 or 14 year old guys. There is something about this movie that pulls me back over and over again. It's hard to describe. I'm not sure what it is. Am I a Wooderson that enjoys reminiscing? Am I someone that prefers simpler times? Am I someone that is so sick of PC people that a movie like D&amp;C is like a breath of fresh air? Was there something magical in the air back in 1976? The country was celebrating 200 years of freedom. Now within the last 30 years it seems that most of those freedoms have been slowly whittled away with and all that is left is a former shell of the old. Especially after 2001. The best scene? To me it's a toss-up between the opening "Sweet Emotion" GTO in the school parking lot and the Emporium scene with "Hurricane" playing in the background while (The Past) Wooderson, (The Present) Pink and (The Future) Mitch walk into the Emporium while the camera films every little nuance in slow motion. The cockiness of Woods, the mellow Pink and the innocence of Mitch. Put that scene on slow motion and study their faces and the reaction shots of their peer's faces as they acknowledge their presence.Your own personal time machine if only for an hour and a half. Slip the DVD in, turn the lights down low, take a couple good strong hits and wash them down with a few Tallboys. Use your imagination and for the briefest of time you are back in 1976. I wish they made more movies like this instead of the sugar coated pablum coming out of Hollywood nowadays.Remember this?Howard Hughes died, Robin Trower-Bridge of Sighs, Jeff Beck, Kawasaki Z1, Kawasaki 750 triple 2-stroke, 45 cents a gallon gas, 104 octane gas, Frampton Comes Alive, Bad Company - Shooting Star, Elvin Bishop - Fooled Around and Fell In Love, Jimmy Carter, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, 1969 Dodge Charger 440, 2 Lane Blacktop, 3 finger lids, windowpane, Diamond Dogs, J. Geils, Midnight Special, Wings Over America tour, Bad Company - Movin' On, Mott The Hoople - All The Young Dudes, SD 455 with the Big Bird on the hood, Marshall Tucker Band - Heard It In A Love Song, Emerson, Lake and Palmer - Brain Salad Surgery, Edelbrock Tunnel Ram with Holley Double Pumpers, getting high at dusk while listening to Pink Floyd's "Time" and looking at the Dallas skyscraper skyline against the setting sun.If you do then Dazed and Confused is right up your alley. If you don't then still watch it, the characters in D&amp;C cover all generations, just the cars and clothing have changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a Documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are spoilers in this review...What a great, great movie. If you want to know what being in High School in the mid 70's was like, rent this film. I grew up in the metro Manhattan area. We didn't have the freshman hazing, and few of us could afford the cars (although we sure knew about them and lusted after them), but the rest of this movie is so dead on about my experience of High School in the 70's that it's scary. Every character in the film corresponds with someone that I knew during that time. Yes, there was a lot of pot smoking, yes, obtaining beer was quite easy for underage kids...I used to buy it in bars when I was 16. We made pipes in shop class. We hung out and had parties at night, drove the streets drinking beers and smoking joints listening to the same music. There were no youth centers though. The girls that I knew were as beautiful, and also struggled to get into their jeans. They used pliers too, but they also put them on while they were wet to further get that skintight look. There was no HIV virus to worry about, Herpes was not a big thing then, the biggest worry was getting pregnant. Everyone was having sex... All of these facts also were no big deal. Most of my peers grew up just fine, and now are upstanding pillars of the community. Many today would like you to believe that this is an example of the road to ruin. It was an incredible great time. The film has interesting character development, with the same types I remember. Philosophers, heads (now called stoners), bullies and waifs. This is my American Graffiti and it is perfect. Waxing nostalgic? Perhaps, but anyone that didn't live through that time will sill love the dialog in this film, as it deals with the universal experience of that point in one's life. This is high school in the 70's. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a breeding ground for talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dazed and Confused", which takes place during the 70s, was one of the best movies of the 90s. It really is phenomenal how much talent was in this ensemble; if you want to see Adam Goldberg, Matthew Mcconaughey, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey, or an almost completely unrecognizable Ben Affleck (playing the sort of role he would almost never play again, an a**hole) before they were stars, look no further. And of course this was an early movie for director Richard Linklater, who had made the relatively unknown "Slackers" previously and who would go on to make "School of Rock", which was almost as good as "Dazed and Confused".Taking place on the last day of school in a small suburban town, "Dazed and Confused" is a brilliant ensemble piece rivaling anything done by Robert Altman that covers the broadest spectrum of teenagers imaginable. We see the nerds, the potheads, the jocks, and the cheerleaders, as well as the incoming freshmen, as they celebrate the beginning of summer. Some celebrate less than others, of course; freshman hazing is a big part of the movie, both male and female. The dialogue is fresh and unexpected; lines about George Washington's proclivity for marijuana, why you just gotta love high school girls ("I get older, they stay the same age", as McConaughey's character says), and the herd mentality when a fight breaks out demonstrate how all-over-the-map the dialogue can be, and it's always affecting and usually quite funny. Of course, it's the acting and the characters that really steal the movie, and it really is amazing how many people in this movie went on to bigger things. As I said before, Affleck was the most surprising, but Mcconaughey had the most memorable role as an older dude who can't seem to let go of his youth, a slick slimeball who chases after under-age jail bait. And he has never been funnier or better than he was in this. Eventually, his character will wake up and the kids aren't going to want to hang out with him and the girls aren't going to want to sleep with him anymore, and he's going to have a rude awakening. But for the time being, he's all macho cool swagger, and Mcconaughey pulled off the part perfectly. Parker Posey is also excellent, playing a senior bitch (but only because she's "supposed" to be) unleashing a humiliating hazing on the incoming freshman girls.You have to give props to the writing. It's not a long movie, but it covers so much ground that it feels big. At one point, a character says that the 70s obviously suck. That may have been, but it's never looked cooler than it did in "Dazed and Confused". And the soundtrack must be mentioned too. The 70s was a decade full of musical highs and lows, and thankfully the soundtrack highlights the highs while ignoring the lows, and we have songs by Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Dr. John, War, and other seminal 70s rock figures (curiously missing: "Dazed and Confused" by Led Zeppelin, but that's forgivable). Brilliant; there's not a single clunker, and it adds to the free, easygoing atmosphere of the movie. "Dazed and Confused" is quite possibly the best "teen movie" ever made, and, from the point of view of someone who grew up in the 80s anyway, the best movie about the 70s ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Teen Movie of the 1990's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused (1993)Cast: Jason London, Rory Cochrane, Sasha Jenson, Wiley Wiggins, Michelle Burke, Matthew McConaughey, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Marissa Ribisi, Shawn Andrews, Cole Hauser, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason O. Smith, Ben Affleck, Christin Hinjosa, Parker Posey, Nicky Katt.Directed by Richard Linklater."Dazed and Confused" is one of the best teen films ever made, and for many reasons. It stands the test of it's time, along with George Lucas' "American Graffiti" and John Landis' "Animal House". It shows the highs and lows of partying, friendship, and drugs. The plot is about upcoming seniors and freshmen in a Texas town on the full last day of School in 1976. The characters are very likable in this, well, at least most of them. Richard Linklater gives a great independent direction. This isn't a film that encourages kids to do drugs, but it shows a true portrayal of teenagers in a America, in a very fun way. "Dazed and Confused" is one of my all-time favorite films, and one that I can watch over and over again. Well done.5/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This became my all-time favorite comedy the first time I saw it. I was a small child in the 70's, but I do remember that era somewhat, and the characters in this movie reminded me so much of my teen-aged neighbors. The music is right on-one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, a must-have for any 70's classic rock fans (in fact, it is so comprehensive, there are two volumes). Superb performances by Jason London, Sasha Jenson, Rory Cochrane, Milla Jovovich, Adam Goldberg, Parker Posey and Matthew McConaughey highlight this film, but the rest of the cast is just as great. It is no wonder that a majority of them went on to become major stars-everyone shines with this hysterically funny and nostalgic script written and directed by the amazing Richard Linklater. The movie flows beautifully, every scene is funny, and the chemistry of the characters is just amazing. Party at the moon tower!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last day of school in 1976</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dazed and Confused" details the last day of high school for the typical youths of America in 1976. Shot in and around Austin, Texas, the film failed at the box office in 1993-94, but has gone on to achieve a well-deserved cult status. I never even heard of the film until this year when I saw most of it on TV and promptly decided to pick it up the DVD when I got the chance.To my mind, "Dazed and Confused" is one of the best high school comedy-dramas, along with 1982's "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." The difference between these two films is that "Fast Times" contains more goofy antics whereas "Dazed" is more of a docudrama with amusing flashes. In other words, although "Fast Times is generally realistic, excepting the over-the-top parts with Spicoli, "Dazed and Confused" is more like a slice from real life.What makes "Dazed" work so well is that it gets the LOOK of the mid-to-late 70s just right, particularly the hair &amp; clothing styles. Secondly, the actors pull off the material expertly. In fact, a large part of the film's success is the excellent casting choices. Both are no easy feat. Speaking of the actors, you get a few up-and-comers here: Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck and one or two of lesser note (as far as future popularity goes).All the standard school archetypes are here: the jock who parties on the side, the bullies, the hot sister and her little long-haired brother, the black dude, the hot (feminist) teacher, the streetfighter, the cool guys, the geekier crowd, the babes, the guy who graduated years ago but still hangs around, the mentors &amp; mentees, etc.And then you have the standard school experiences like parties at friend's houses, keg parties, fleeing bullies, dealing with coaches &amp; teachers, flirting, the possibility of sex, hanging out, meaningless conversations, fights, smoking pot at school or in your friend's bedroom, etc.Like "Fast Times," "Dazed and Confused" is a joy to watch -- whatever your age -- because it successfully takes you back to the high school years with all its joys &amp; agonies.Some don't like it because it's more of a slice-of-life film than a plot-driven, contrived story. The plot here is simple: It's the last day of school and the youths want to celebrate. If they can't party at their friend's house (because the dad catches wind of their plans) they'll have a party at the park or wherever, but they WILL party. The rest of the film involves their interactions within this context.I've heard some complain that the film conveys a terrible message. What message? There is no message. The message is that school's out and it's time to celebrate! Besides, there are a few positive points that can be mined from the proceedings: the arrogant bully gets what's coming, make a stand and fight when you have to (even if you get beat up), ultra-tight pants must be put on with pliers &amp; the help of a friend, be true to yourself, etc. But -- really -- this isn't a movie to look for deep messages, its simple purpose is to take you back to the school years -- in this case, 1976 -- and all the fun &amp; painful experiences thereof.No review of "Dazed and Confused" would be complete without noting the excellent soundtrack. You get some great rock/metal of the 70s like "Sweet Emotion," "School's Out," "Stranglehold," "Do You Feel Like We Do," "Love Hurts," "Paranoid," "Rock &amp; Roll Hootchie Coo," "Rock &amp; Roll All Nite," "Slow Ride," "Cherry Bomb," "Tuesday's Gone" and many more.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I Did When I was a Teenager</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best teenager, high school flicks which tops most of the many other films i have viewed. It depicts male and female struggles with all the temptations that face youth and will continue for generations to come. (maybe even worse). The beginning of the film cautions the public that drug use is going to be viewed and it sure is clearly displayed through out the entire picture. Beer drinking is being digested like it is water on tap and bottoms up appears in more ways than in bottles. The classic act is destroying mail boxes and also a bowling ball being thrown into the back window of a car. One of the teenagers talks himself into getting a six pack of beer from a liquor store like it was taking candy from a baby. Lots of hot looking gals in tight pants being zipped up with pliers in order to get their nice forms skin tight. Very entertaining film and extremely realistic and down to earth. All the actors gave outstanding performances. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A postcard from the 70s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is a lot like the time in which it takes place. The film doesn't have much of note to say, but you get the sense that it has a good time just being there. By 1976, Vietnam was in the rear-view mirror, as were much of the struggles of the previous decades. It was almost like people were sick and tired of caring about things and just wanted to get wasted. Notice how nobody seemed to care when their teacher was trying to tell them about the 1968 Democratic Convention or our "aristocratic" forefathers. There is a certain innocence about the period that our up-tight and violent world of today could use right now.Our film shows us the trials and tribulations of kids just looking to get high, drunk, or just save their butts from being paddled on the last day of school. Not much of note happens in this film. We just see kids doing what kids are still doing. They are all just out to have a good time. There are plenty of familiar faces in this cast, but nobody really outshines anyone else. The film is paced in a manner that doesn't let us get to know too much about the characters. We spend a minute or two with one group of friends, then we see what another group is up to. The most memorable scenes in the film are more painful than funny. We see next year's freshman class (girls and guys) get pummeled by the seniors. We see the destruction of property. We see a fight or two break out. Plenty of beer and pot are consumed by all. And there really isn't much else to it.Linklater films the action from a completely neutral vantage point. There is nothing at all pretentious or preachy about any of the subject matter. We see some cool cars, tight jeans, long hair, and just about anything you would associate with this time frame. The film lacks the humor of Porky's or The Hollywood Knights. It also lacks the tragic desperation of The Last Picture Show. That said, this film is still worth taking a look at. Especially if you were in high school at the time. I was just a toddler in 1976, but I could still relate to these characters, and their need to party.7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "American Graffiti" for the '70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see the appeal of this movie. It is very much an "American Graffiti" for the '70s. If you look just a little you can find many of the same caricatures used by Lucas. DC is viewed by the youth of today much as we viewed AG in our day. Contrary to many of the other reviewers I saw little humor in the hazing and the wide-spread drinking and smoking weed. That is not to say that there were not funny moments and lines, because there were quite a few; Slater's "knowledge" of history particularly hilarious. Who knew that Martha Washington grew weed - apparently by the bushel!I also found it interesting the number of reviewers that have watched this movie and assert that this "exactly" their experience during the '70s. Mine was far from it. Growing up in a small N. California town (not far from AG's inspiration - Modesto) much of what was depicted did not occur or at least not to the extreme shown. Parents cared what time their children came home, what they'd been up to and if they'd been drinking/smoking. That is not to say that there wasn't any drinking/smoking - it was just on lower level and not nearly as wide-spread as depicted.And many of the "pranks" shown in the movie occurred but were easily remedied in the real world. My father's mail box was hit only once. It's concrete-filled replacement collected broken bats for years afterward. And our equivalent of paddling was promptly discontinued when a freshman stabbed his assaulting senior with a knife. Problem solved.But this is the way with movies. A narrow reality is shown often with few if any consequences for actions. Those not having lived in the time view it and get nostalgic over what they "missed out on." In reality the only thing they missed out on was a figment of someone's imagination. One thing particularly note worthy of this movie is the quality of acting. I don't think that there was a bad performance in the lot. Perhaps some could have been better but none were bad. And others have noted, the music selections were great. Now there is a reality that is sorely missed today - the great wealth of artistic talent that was the '70s. The youth of today have no idea what a vast waste land of music they're living through; it's a veritable desert compared to the '70s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bored and Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother gave me this movie on DVD as a present, since I love stoner comedies. This had potential, it had an all-star cast, a reputable director, and a catchy title. The first twelve minutes were promising, high school is almost over and the story seemed to be going in a positive direction. After those precious twelve minutes, this movie went completely downhill. There was no plot whatsoever, zero conflict, and undeveloped characters, things you do not want in a classic film. I was disappointed and I had never been so bored in my life watching a "comedy" that felt like an eternity to finish. There is only ONE funny scene worth watching and that's the part where the hippie talks about George Washington smoking weed. Other than that, I cannot believe this project got made in the first place. It doesn't even count as a real movie, but I digress! If you want to watch an overrated movie that is boring and has no redeeming qualities to it, then this is the movie for you. I'm glad I shared my opinion and by the way, I sold the DVD after watching this piece of garbage for the third time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am wondering about all the other reviews that say this is exactly like real life in the 70's. I found this movie to be very unlike real life in 1976, to a severe extent. I graduated high school in 1973 so it should be almost exactly my time but there are many things wrong here. The movie has stoners wearing polyester print shirts which were actually the costumes of the disco set. In real life they would all be wearing blue denim jackets with DISCO SU**S buttons on them, and never disco clothes themselves. The movie has them smoking bongs in a convertible in plain view of cops, something never done in the 70's when people still went to jail for 2 joints and always smoked dope where the cops couldn't see us. It shows stoners always getting into fights. Not like real life, only greasers and jocks got into fights, stoners were too stoned to fight at all. They never talk about music in this movie, the most you hear about music in this movie is the one guy who talks about getting Aerosmith tickets, but in real life, all us stoners talked about was music. That was like 80% of our conversation. Jethro Tull, Deep Purple, Captain Beyond. I think most of the people in this movie were the lower intelligence set, the smart stoners didn't knock over garbage cans or go around paddling people in the posterior with wood paddles. It never happened. In real life, the football players were dumb jocks with short hair, big muscles, dated the dumb straight cheerleaders who made money at the bake sale to buy uniforms. Jocks were straight and never smoked dope or even cigarettes. They were scared of the stoners because they didn't have any idea what we were doing. Once in a while a stoner got on the football team but never fit in with the jocks, and when the stoners found out he was on the team we thought he was maybe a jock-hippie which was a rare thing. But this movie has skinny little hippies playing football!! Never happened, ever. And it shows hippies with late-60's Camaros with 454 engines in them and Dodge Chargers with a 440 and a 6-pack. Bzzzzzt!! Those were the greasers! Hippies drove beat up Volkswagens and Chevy Novas with 6 cylinders. This movie is not realistic at all. I think this movie is ABOUT the 70's but it lampoons them, and it seems the people who made the movie were not really there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess this one wasn't for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I write reviews and I can see people reading them, cursing my words and saying that I don't know what I'm on about. I'm well aware at how well Dazed and Confused was received, getting 5/5 ratings from the majority of viewers. I guess that means I just missed something about it and it didn't work for me.It's about the last day of school in an American High School, back in 1976. The older students are looking forward to generally beating up the younger kids (as is tradition... apparently - all I can say is that this didn't happen to me at school in Britain during the eighties and nineties and I'm glad it didn't!).I found most of the characters either unlikeable or boring. I found it hard to root for someone who enjoys bullying people smaller than them (which is most of the older kids), just as I found it harder to identify with the younger ones who just sort of spent most of the film running away or waiting to take a hiding. Plus there's no real story. What you have here is a collection of scenes with numerous different characters all doing their own things on the last day of school. There's also too many characters. Many don't really have much impact and aren't really fleshed out enough to be believed in. I think it would have benefited with a smaller cast. Although, the cast is pretty impressive - maybe not when this movie was made, but, in retrospect, there are a fair few Hollywood A-listers all here in the younger (pre-fame) days.However, as much as I didn't really like it, I had to give it credit for getting the 'look' of the period right on. It really could have been filmed in the seventies for the way it was presented. Plus the soundtrack was right up my street. For once a film set in the seventies didn't have a single Abba track involved and there was far more use of some 'classic rock anthems' such as Alice Cooper (hooray!).I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it as much as everyone else apparently did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born in 1975 so I sort of understand that people like this film as a travel back in time, but as a story, it sucks. The fact is: there is no story. None whatsoever. Apart from the beating of the freshmen(which I've never experienced), I've been to better and more interesting parties than the one in this film, and I've never thought that those parties where film material. Style over substance all the way. The best thing about is the music, but I find it hard to believe that in 1976, they only played songs that were later to become classics. I guess they also played songs that were forgotten as well.And it is not a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Author: jscott7432 from United States a teenager who said that "The 70's just seemed like they were amazing to live in like how so many kids were cool with smoking pot, cigarettes, drinking, etc. today that is not the case".I grew up then and the movie is just a magnifying glass on a cut in time. In fact many that lived it have overemphasized it. The pot smokers, known as pot heads at my school, usually failed out of classes, school etc. They were considered low life's and failures. We did have a smoking court. Big deal. Those same students today, who I know are battling lung cancer due to the strength of cigarettes back then. Drinking was around, beer mostly, but not the way they show it. Probably less than there is today. Mostly after football games, etc.And sadly so were DUI deaths and injuries. A HS friend of mine was permanently scarred when her head went through the windshield of the car when her then drunk boyfriend hit a tree. Remember there were no airbags back then. No cell phones so emergency help took longer to get there. Others died in what today would be a minor accident. It was not cool. Never envy a previous generation. There was good and bad just like today. It was right after the end of the Vietnam era so many of my friends had older brothers or uncles who who never came back. Getting grounded stunk. No TV and there were no video games, cell phones,Internet or anything else to entertain you so you read a book or hung out with the parents while they watch TV and there were only like 5 channels (ABC, NBC, CBS and a few on UHF) the upside? No school police, no guns in school, everyone actually went to college (except the potheads).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", you'll like this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused has a lot in common with Fast Times at Ridgemont High; both movies contain a lot of future stars playing teenagers, both have lots of terrific Rock tunes on the soundtrack, and both derive laughs from their characters and situations and not through jokes, pratfalls and other typical Hollywood clichés. One difference between the two films is that Dazed and Confused is a period-piece, filmed in 1993 it takes place in 1976, and directer Richard Linklater does a marvelous job capturing the habits, the styles and the attitudes of the era. In that regard maybe this movie is more inspired by "American Graffiti" than Fast Times at Ridgemont. But it doesn't matter because to me D&amp;C is the best of them all.This movie seems to be as personal to Linklater as it is to me, and its not so much about plot or big scenes as it is about realism and the overall flow...and it flows beautifully. The movie follows a group of high school juniors and another group of 8th graders (next years seniors and freshmen)through the events surrounding the last day of school in Austin, Texas in 1976 (the whole film takes place in approximately 24 hours). We observe the hazing, the partying, some introspective banter and many familiar rituals as the characters prepare not just for the summer, but for the next school year and beyond. This was the same general time period I was in high school, so this movie had a special impact on me. At this point I need to mention Wooderson (McConaughey,in his film debut), a key character, he's that 20-something dude that still hangs with the high school crowd. Did every town in America have a guy like this or what? Wood, Dawson, Slater, Pickford; these guys all remind me of guys I grew up with in my hometown. The greatness of this film is that it rings so true...the way the "jocks" party with the "freaks" (or "grits' as they were also called where I grew up), the way they just aimlessly cruise around in muscle cars until they find out where the party's at, or the mailbox bashing (here it was beer bottles thrown at signs), or even the bottle cap flipping...we did that all the time! The only thing i didn't see was a bong. (besides the one Slater was making in shop class..HEY, we did that too!) Yeah thats right -joints are better for cruising anyway.This is the kind of movie to rent on one of those Friday nights where you have to work early the next day. I first rented this movie on one of those very nights. Its a great Friday night movie and why not? No heavy handed plot, lots of partying and good music, and it makes you feel good. Speaking of the soundtrack...Linklater makes great use of period music; We get the gamut of 70s pop/rock including Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, ZZ Top, War, Dylan and even Black oak Arkansas (remember them?)....Jim dandy to the rescue! This movie really took me back.Dazed and Confused is also a bit of a curio because of all the young actors (who were all unknown at the time) who went on to star in other movies. You will see Matthew McConaughey (his best performance ever), Ben Affleck, Parker Posey (she's a riot), Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams and Milla Jovavich (ok,i'm reaching now), among others. My only complaint involving the cast is that Wiley Wiggins' (as Mitch Kramer) mannerisms are a bit irritating, but other than that everyone does a tremendous job. This movie has become like a fascinating time capsule about that post-revolutionary decade of the 70s, a decade filled with great music, movies and television (seriously, what the heck has happened to entertainment in this country?)... so its worth viewing for historical and social aspects as well as its entertainment value.But anyway, I hope you enjoy one of my personal favorites...a really cool, funny and realistic look at what teenage life was like in so many towns in America in the mid-70s.It may be set in Texas, but it could just as easily be Ohio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was there, it was awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must concur with the other reviewers who have commented on the eerie accuracy of this film. I too attended high school in Texas in the 1970's, and this film is so flawless in recreating this time and place it lends the impression you were being documented without your knowledge. If you are of an age and background that permits you to relate to Dazed &amp; Confused on this level, it will give you an unusual affinity for the film. This is exactly how we dressed and wore our hair, those are the cars we drove, the music we loved, that looks exactly like my high school (with only slight variations in paint colors), those seemed to be my teachers, and all of these people were the people I knew then. There is no question but that the author of this piece had to have been one of us.As someone who was there, I hope I can clear up or offer some insight into a few of the points people have raised about the film. The drug use; well, it was the 70's. In my high school, really hardcore drugs such as heroin were virtually unknown, we talked about it but never saw it, but both marijuana and LSD were as common and available as sand in your shoes. My generation had a very permissive attitude toward these substances. My own clique would never have had the brass ones required to actually partake on campus, as getting caught would not have meant a detention but a trip to jail; on the other hand it was not infrequent to find us stoned in class. But we did leave campus to blow a joint, absolutely, (usually in either the home of one of us who lived nearby or a van that belonged to another of our group, parking at the shopping center down the street). In D&amp;C we see Slater and some of his friends smoking weed right in the schoolyard, that didn't happen in my school. There wasn't a single teacher at my high school who would not have immediately recognized the odor of marijuana and sought out the source. With the clarity of thirty years hindsight, I remain of the opinion that we frankly had a healthier attitude on this subject than do so-called role models of today. Bad drug problems are bad drug problems, but the recreational use of marijuana is substantially less detrimental than either alcohol or tobacco, which both get a free pass because they're legal. Marijuana also failed to serve as a "gateway" drug in our clique, none of us were led by it into harsher substances. I'm glad I'm not in high school today.One point of particular discussion I have noticed here on D&amp;C's IMDb page is the movie's rather brutal depiction of hazing, "busting the freshmen". Several have reported that this did not occur at their school. You were lucky, and be glad of it. I attended high school in Dallas in the 1970's and this absolutely was a part of our life. I, like all girls, was spared the brutal whippings that Mitch and his friends have inflicted upon them by the seniors, but it absolutely happened to incoming freshmen boys and was generally sanctioned, or at least overlooked, by the adults in charge. For the record, YES IT IS ASSUALT AND BATTERY. Dang! What else do you call violently beating someone with a board until they cry? Battery, plain and simple. Outrageous, mean spirited and cruel, and frankly the homoerotic ass-fixated nature of this hazing paints a far more unflattering psychological portrait of those dealing out the punishment than of those receiving it. As girls we were at least not physically assaulted, but we did undergo some nasty initiation rituals, but usually only those of us trying to get into an organized club, not just all of us en masse simply because of our age (this is also depicted quite accurately in the film, what those poor girls endure from that bitch to get on the cheerleading squad, God love 'em). And it is likewise plainly obvious in the film just as it was in real life, the senior boys learned this bizarre monkey-like behavior from those bastions of simian progress, their "coaches", roles universally filled by academic failures who represent the Wooderson's of the future.As disturbing as the hazing is, it belongs in the film because it was there, it was real, it was a part of our lives in that time and place, and I felt a delicious satisfaction when that one kid's mom met O'Bannion at the front porch cocking a shotgun. "I don't think so, creep!" You go girl! As both Mitch and Sabrina deal with the initiation rituals in a manner that is respected by their older peers and grants them access to the cool clique, it is too intrinsic to the storyline to be removed or whitewashed. I might add this is the only movie I have ever seen that captures this.In summation, this is a movie directed at a rather specific audience. My friends who are of dramatically different age or grew up in a different part of the country do not generally relate to this movie nor enjoy it on the same level, although they often find it entertaining. But if you, like the filmmaker, were a Texas high school student in those amazingly permissive 1970's, and didn't particularly hate your life at the time, I think you'll absolutely love it. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand the appeal of this movie. What was it genre? It's labelled a comedy but -and I'm not exaggerating- there are no funny moments at all. Is it coming-of-age? Well, no. The characters don't change over the course of the movie and they're pretty one-dimensional to start off with.I suppose the acting isn't bad. But literally 80% of the characters are the same person -stupid, obnoxious, and completely uninteresting. There are a couple of half-way decent characters in there but I honestly don't care enough to praise them.The whole hazing thing is so weird to me. I mean, I get that it's the 70s but it's really strange that 17/18 year olds get such a kick out of humiliating 15 year olds. Also, I highly doubt that so many freshmen would take this crap. I don't know if this is like an American tradition but in my country, no one would be into this idiotic rite of passage.It was very cool to see 70s fashion and music portrayed so authentically. It was probably the only thing that kept me watching up to the end.The plot is non-existent. Seriously, nothing happens.Am I missing some kind of deeper meaning? Perhaps I'm being dense but all the movie looks like to me is a bland, confused mess that has only two things going for it - a fairly star-studded cast and a retro vibe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie explains why people make fun of Texans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Texas, with the class of '77 as seniors (I was also class of '77, by the way). I spent over 100 minutes desperately seeking a plot, apparently in vain. SPOILER: Beginning with close to a half hour of high school students terrorizing and beating junior high students and moving on to smoking weed and drinking by minors, this movie struggled pointlessly for a reason to exist. Supposedly funny, it was actually rather painful to watch, given the fact that I lived through the same era, albeit in a different state. While it is true that many of the actors went on to great careers, few of these had big roles in this movie, Matthew McConaughey being the exception. If you want a funny high school movie, try Fast Times at Ridgemont High. It is VASTLY superior and has a plot. The only explanation I can give for the high IMDb rating is that everyone was stoned or drunk when they watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie we can all relate too!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in '76 I was only two years old, so I can't really say that I can relate to the decade which this movie was based on, although in my time just like the 70's there were drugs, a cruising culture and friends which this movie so highly portrays.What really adds to this movie is a killer soundtrack, although I would of enjoyed hearing Led Zeppelin and AC/DC during the movie who I think really connected with the youth back in the 70's.As for the cast - similar to American Graffiti that featured so many stars before they were famous. Superb acting by a group of youngsters at the time.Every character in this movie was unique - O'Bannion the school bully, Slater the hippie who was always high, Mitch Kramer the innocent young kid who was just starting in the adult world, Mike and Tony the nerds, Wooderson the guy who would always hang with school students no matter how old he was and Randall who I can relate to the most - the kid who is running with a poor crowd, but had potential to go places if he just applied himself a little more, but had serious issues towards his peers.But what really stands out in this movie is the concept of high school initiation which can be brutal, but a sympathetic understanding by allowing those students who were punished to attend the party in the end. This is what the movie is highly based on along with the drinking and drug culture that every generation has to deal with.I think the must crucial point in the movie is towards the end when Randall Floyd is confronted by his coach in the early hours of the morning after a night of partying. Will Randall leave his drop kick friends and apply himself giving in to his coaches demands or remain a rebel? A decision we all have to make.I think there is a little Dazed and Confused in all of us!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the matter with you people? Why do you praise that film so much ? Personally , I like living situations ,like the characters of the movie lived, VERY MUCH, BUT I certainly hate sitting on the sofa watching others living them. Many imdb users wrote the this movie doesn't have a plot , but who cares ? I CARE ! You see ,watching a plotless film is like watching a film in which all you see is a farmer milking a cow, the only difference here is like the character of that film (the farmer) has less fun than the characters of Dazed and Confused. Many others wrote that `if this film doesn't touch you , it means that you have never had fun like that?and bla,bla,bla..' I believe it's exactly the opposite,and I suggest you to go live you lives and have fun, instead of watching the others having it ,and just paralleling yourselves with them. When I see a movie , I need something to really happen . And if you think that the director of this movie did well describing the teenage life of the 70s , you should really see what Larry Clark did describing the teenage life of the 90s ,far more realistic but somehow plotless too. Finally, like Pink said in the movie `If this is the best time of my life, remind me to kill myself ` ?. 6 out of 10 mostly for the good music(for those who care).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as realistic as "Melrose Place" and as funny as "Platoon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the few occasions when I bash the snot out of a movie, I usually try to have fun with it. I won't even bother this time. So get set for a review as brutal, dry and miserable as the movie we're talking about.Contrary to everything they tell you, "Dazed &amp; Confused" isn't a comedy. At least I sincerely hope not. The only people who could possibly find humor in the disturbing paedophiliac rape scenes which compose much of this movie's vapid "plot" are probably the same people who laugh at images of prisoner abuse at Abu Gharib. Let me describe one of these "funny" scenes. A high school freshman, played by an actor who looks like he's 12, flees in mortal terror from 6 ham-faced seniors, played by actors who look like they're 28 and on steroids. They catch him. Hootin' and hollerin' they bend him over the hood of a car doggy style. The camera angle gives us a close up of the kid's contorted face grimacing while, from behind in slow motion, the ham-faces howl and laugh as they violate the prepubescent kid in the posterior with a paddle. If you were too dense to miss the rape symbolism, at one point they tell the kid to squeal like a pig, bringing to mind Ned Beatty's somewhat uncomfortable anal experience in "Deliverance". Gee, funny stuff. In the 1st hour the same scene is repeated two more times with two more kids. At one point a car of girls pulls up and one girl shouts "hey, take it easy on the kid" to which ham-face #5 cockily opens up the trunk of his car to reveal 200 beers, to which the girls suddenly start oohing and begging like trained seals. Are you laughing? I wasn't, nor was my date, nor was the entire theater. Good thing because I probably would've punched anyone who was.The sick feeling I got when watching "Dazed &amp; Confused" was a lot like the sick feeling I got when watching Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange", except that Clockwork is a powerful, intentionally unsettling film with a purpose while D&amp;C is just a mess. Clockwork was a brilliant dark satire of society--we're never supposed to believe or even expect that the story would ever be remotely true because it's so nightmarish.To those reviewers who are raving about how "spot on" this movie is, I don't know what Archie comic book world you crawled out of, but it certainly wasn't mine. In what alternate universe does every 17-year-old high school senior own a Pontiac GTO (which cost $4500 in 1976, roughly $8000 by today's standards), have the cash to buy 200 beers and 6 kegs, have no job other than hootin', hollerin' and smashing windows and basically walking around stoned &amp; drunk 24 hours a day? While, yes, these things were known to happen in the 70s, it was only about as frequent as you'd expect today, generally describing the 0.05% bored rich kids whose mommies &amp; daddies were buying them cars while the rest of us were schlepping around in our rusty Dodge Darts because that's all our part-time jobs would cover (minimum wage: $2.35/hr in 1976).It quickly becomes obvious that this movie wasn't trying to give us an accurate portrayal of the 70s so much as it was a series of gratuitous 70s clichés. Aging baby boomers could feel like their existence was validated while younger Gen-Xers could feel like they're getting a cultural education. Wrong on both counts. What "Dazed &amp; Confused" amounts to is simply a bunch of idealized nostalgia, the same way the 50's was idealized by the creators of "Happy Days". At least Happy Days was funny &amp; entertaining, so we accept it. But "Dazed &amp; Confused" failed because it took itself too seriously and had an inherently bland script, leaving with us with nothing but phony, contrived situations to entertain us. Contrast this against "Napoleon Dynamite" which was similarly set in a high school 20 years in the past but featured not only a funny self-deprecating approach but a memorable script full of great one-liners. In the case of "Napoleon", we accept the nostalgia because it's such a great satire of itself.Now let's talk about the soundtrack of "Dazed &amp; Confused". Think of every classic rock cliché that's been played so many times on the radio that even die-hard classic rock fans would switch the station. Now string these songs together almost randomly, with no significance to the story (as if trying to compensate for lack of cinematic content with crowd pleasing candy rock), and there's your wonderful soundtrack. Does anyone on the planet actually like the song "Rock &amp; Roll Hootchie Koo" anyway?The 70s offered so many better songs (which we actually did listen to back then). It is particularly irritating that the movie would take its title from the great atmospheric Zeppelin song "Dazed &amp; Confused" while not acknowledging it once in the film. Not mainstream enough, I guess.If you want a cool, nostalgic 70s trip with poignant music (not just the regurgitated radio crap), check out the films of Gabrielle Salvatores with obscure yet awesome songs like Deep Purple "Child in Time" or the movie Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas with Jefferson Airplane's incomparable "White Rabbit" or for you serious 70s rock fans, the movie "Buffalo 66" with great songs by bands like Yes &amp; King Crimson. Leave this "I Love the 70s" radio-happy-rubbish to the posers who think this was what life was like back then.As a comedy, this movie fails. As a drama, it's just plain disturbing. As a rock &amp; roll movie it's annoying as hell. Watch a documentary about paedophiles in prison for more entertainment value than "Dazed &amp; Confused". And for the love of Pete, if anyone tries to tell you this is a cult classic, please belt them in the chops for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is about a bunch of high school seniors partying on their last day of school. And that's it. What was there to like about this movie? Well, there were a handful of chuckles here and there, and the movie wasn't boring, nor was it particularly poorly made (I guess?). What I didn't like was how little substance there was to this movie. It's just a bunch of montages of kids drinking, then driving, then complaining about life, then drinking again. There's nothing to it. Sure, maybe it wasn't a poorly made movie, considering all the acting and stuff was in place, but there just wasn't anything special about it. Overall Dazed and Confused is just a nothing movie. There isn't anything to like about it, but it wasn't necessarily a bad/poorly made movie. It just wasn't about anything really. Not even the characters were interesting. In the end I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linklater still far away from his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dazed and Confused" is an American 100-minute film from almost 25 years ago written and directed by Richard Linklater in his early 30s, a bit of a breakthrough film for him and he briefly made it before launching his "Before..." trilogy. I really adore these 3 films and I also like his recent "Boyhood" that got him lots of awards recognition, also at the Oscars. But coming-of-age films without real love story impact may not have been his forte back in the 1990s. Everything in this film here, he did 10 times better in "Boyhood". We follow a bunch of teenagers dealing with everyday problems, be it the other sex, older bullies or just life and hobbies in general.This is a tale about many subjects, but it fails to elaborate convincingly on equally many. Maybe it's just realistic? It certainly aspires to be, but have you ever had a guy firing at you while you drive away from him with a bunch of your best friends? Or have you ever had your mother pull a gun when a bully threatens you with a baseball bat? It certainly is over-dramatized on many occasions I believe. And still the story told in here is not too involving at all. I cannot say I felt particularly for any of the protagonists. The cast includes many names that are still famous today, or a lot more famous than they were back then. This includes Adam Goldberg, Parker Posey, Rory Cochrane, Milla Jovovich, but most of all Academy Award winners Matthey McConaughey in a supporting role (alright, alright, alright) and Ben Affleck. Sadly, despite the big names listed here, not a particularly endearing love. Teenage wasteland yes, but not as much of the defining film for a generation just like it is treated many times. Thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one time or another, a movie is made about every generation. Dazed and Confused is for the survivors of the 1970s: that group of Americans who came of age when bellbottoms, love beads, mantras, and marijuana were the fashion, drinking and driving hadn't become taboo, and safe sex was used only to avoid pregnancy or VD. As the United States reached her bicentennial, Vietnam was over -- if the memories still lingered -- and the short-lived disco craze was building to a frenzy that Saturday Night Fever would both exploit and exacerbate.This movie begins on the last day of the 1975-76 school year, and finishes less than twenty-four hours later. For Randy "Pink" Floyd (Jason London) and his friends, it's the end of their tenure as high school juniors, and with the final bell of the last period, they have reached the ultimate goal for teenagers -- they are seniors. At the local junior high school, Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) and his cohorts have a serious problem to consider. They are members of the incoming freshman class and, as part of a time-honored tradition, they are about to be totally and painfully humiliated by the new seniors.Dazed and Confused explores the beginning of the 1976 summer from the varying perspectives of an unusual group of characters. Just about every type is represented: the timid nerd looking for a way to break out of his shell, the mindless jock, the overaged twentysomething guy who likes hanging out with teenagers, the blond bombshell, the stoned-out-of-his mind pot addict, and the timid newcomer. Writer/director Richard Linklater (Slackers) is only partially successful in his attempts to avoid making his characters into caricatures. Most of what works with the youthful population of Dazed and Confused is due more to the performances of a fine cast than the writing.There isn't much to this picture. The storyline is minimal and the characters' personalities are as hazy as the marijuana-drenched atmosphere. What Linklater does exceptionally well is open the door on an era seventeen years in the past. This is 1976, from the music and cars (which combined cost a huge chunk of the $6 million budget), to the people and their attitudes. You'd have to climb into a time machine to get a better view.Comparisons with American Graffiti are warranted, remembering, of course, that this is the next generation. Both have similar aims, but while Graffiti's plot may have been no less insignificant than that of Dazed and Confused, its characters are better defined. At times, Linklater seems too wrapped up in getting everything right about the time period. While the directors of both films care about their protagonists, George Lucas does a better job of transferring that feeling to the audience.The cast is one of new or barely-recognizable names and face (Michelle Burke, who went on to do Coneheads, is among the few who might tweak the memory). None of the principals can have a clear memory of 1976 (unless they're a lot older than they look), yet they play their roles like they lived through it. Most memorable of all is Wiley Wiggins' Mitch, who performs almost every scene (including one where he buys his first six-pack) with an affecting blend of charm and realism.Dazed and Confused is irresponsible and politically incorrect, and almost worth applauding on those grounds alone. Overall, however, this is light entertainment -- nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy. This film was made to celebrate a dead culture, and those who were part of it, or are merely curious, will find a path into the past through it. Unfortunately, due to the weakness of the script, they won't find anything substantial there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A depressing commentary about teen life and bullying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading some of the comments here, you would think that this film painted an idyllic picture about the transition from childhood to adulthood, as represented by the final days of junior high/high school.Whilst the film does paint a picture of teens frantically trying to have a good time at any expense, the film seems more about bullying, both physical and psychological, and about the sad depths that American teens will go to conform.Supercially, this appears to be a standard teen movie, but I suspect that what at first appears to be a deliberately blasé approach to ritual beatings, is actually a quite subtle way of drawing attention to the "lives of quiet desperation" endured by many of the characters.The director is either a lot smarter or a lot less pleasant than you can tell at first glance. If he really thinks that the battering of freshman boys is funny, then he's a real a**hole. I give a low score because even if the director was making a social commentary, the film was moderately unpleasant to watch, from a European's point of view.There are some here who doubtless empathise with the jocks and the party lifestyle, but then they were probably the same people who, in their school years, made life miserable for those around them.I don't know if this unpleasant movie really does depict American teen life, then or now, but if it does, it certainly explains a lot...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first look it seems like this movie is pretty dim-witted and meaningless, but you proceed on watching and eventually realize that some fundamental feelings inside you are rousing up. The first and most important feeling is freedom. You're like get back to your own days of youth and begin nostalgic no matter whether you lived in 70's or not. By the way if you didn't, you definitely start imagining that - the atmosphere of American 70's is presented amazingly. Absolute freedom, insouciance, joy and freshness would ensure you at least several hours of dreaming. A huge role in this process plays the music - catchy rock'n'roll songs intertwine with the movie inextricably. However, i suppose that Dazed and confused could be a little bit more dynamic - despite rock'n'roll at some point it might be considered boring. But then you realize again that this movie is about average life, standard problems and simple happiness and everything falls into place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie in theater when I was in college. I was instantly hooked the minute I heard Sweet Emotion begin and we see the GOAT cruising the lot in slow mo. I'm an 80's kid but I can still relate to the characters and went to school with a Verizon of each. So many unknown actors in this movie that are now big time movie stars. Still one of Ben Afflecks best roles ever. Same with Matthew McConnaghy. Fantastic soundtrack that's definitely worth owning. I can watch the movie over and over and love it each time. Totally agree with another reviewer that the opening Sweet Emotion scene or the Bob Dylan Hurricane scene are a toss up as best scene. But there's plenty more. Still quote this movie with my friends. Gonna go watch it now and J K Livin'........all right all right all right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazed and Confused was written in 1993 by Richard Linklater but has a setting in May of 1976.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a film that involves patterns of school hazing, parties, drugs, and relationships, everything that goes on in a classic high school in the 1970's. The senior students participate in tormenting the freshman kids with paddling and public humiliation. After they hunt down most of the younger students, and find out that the original plans for the party have changed, they begin to prepare for the new party that is in a field under the Moon Towers. Over the duration of the party the main characters experience many new things including buying alcohol, smoking marijuana, getting into fights, and sexual arousal. The film is particularly accurate for a 70s film considering it was made in another era, the styles, cars, drugs, and language used are all very time sensitive. The film provokes many feelings of teen angst, spite, awkwardness and embarrassment through the feelings of the young characters but will surely entertain and bring you back to a time of youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is absolutely one of the best films on the face of the planet. I am only 20 years old and every time I watch this film I start making deals with God pleading to be able to go to high school in 1974-1976. The music of this era was the best ever made and I am so ashamed of my rap and thug generation where everyone has to try and prove how ghetto they are. This movie is probably Ben Afflecks best performance ever. This movie successfully creates a tale back in time,and has a melting pot of some of Americas great actors. Not to mention that every single car shown in the movie is wanted by almost every single kid in todays colleges. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING AND 10 OUT OF 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High School the way I remember it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I graduated high school 26 years after the characters of the movie. So I can't tell if the movie shows the year 1976 accurately. But I sure could relate the plot to my high school experience. We didn't have any freshman initiations, I wonder if they existed at all? But I do remember high school as a time when we were getting stoned all the time, drive aimlessly through the night trying to find a party, have parties busted by parents, trying to get alcohol, have huge parties in the park etc. The movie has no plot, but this is done to represent the teenage years when the life is "plotless". I wouldn't necessarily call it a comedy though, I didn't laugh a lot, but it is a great movie that captures that time of our life so perfectly The characters are great, they show all the different types of high school students. And the cast is full of stars before they became such. I must say I loved Matthew McConnaughey in it. He had a great character and played it very well. I also enjoyed the performance of Adam Goldberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>alright alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I revisited 1993's cult classic "dazed and Confused", at the local artsy film house. It was a great night they had a costume contest, which we won, well we were the only one's who apparently decided to come in costume, but still we won. They even sold PBR's during the movie so that made things that much better. So is this movie a classic, I say alright alright. This is a cult classic more geared towards the stoner crowd of which I am a proud member. What affirmed for me the notion that this movie is a cult classic is the overwhelming abundance of people (including me) who were saying the lines of the movie out loud in the theater. The fact that so many people remembered so many great lines I think says it all. And that is one of the great things about this movie the story and the dialog in particular. The great cult film maker Richard Linklater, didn't just develop fascinating characters, he gave them many many many memorable things to say. This movie is also nostalgic, for even though it takes place in the 70's, I identified with the whole suburban growing up and making the transition from middle school to high school and going from underclassman to the all powerful senior class thing (that was a mouth full). I also identified with a lot of what these characters did to have fun when they were young and stupid. Look, I don't know if this movie is for everyone, as I said it is a stoner cult classic, but Richard Linklater has given us not just fun movies to watch like this and school of rock, but a pair of great romance movies in before sunrise and before sunset, some really deep philosophical vehicles, in slacker and waking life, and last but not least the imaginative "a scanner darkly" which showcases the very beautiful filming technique known as interpolated rotoscoping, which Linlater was the first to utilize for an entire film. In addition to all this, this film launched the careers of actors like Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck. Look the point of all this is, this is not just a great film, it was made by one of today's most interesting film directors, and gives a look at budding stardom. So in other words, no matter what your personal tastes, there is almost no reason not to at least check out this gem. You may even find yourself someday watching it again and saying the lines with glee yourself. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazed and Confused... Brilliance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie 6 times, now. It's not a great movie with any great story or brilliant acting. It is just a simple movie that you will always love to watch again and again. The story just spans around half a day and it is like going through a compilation of great records with life happening around. This is one of the greatest high school films of all time for me. The events that happen just after the school closes for the summer form the basic plot of the movie. Well, nothing much happens, story wise, but at the end of the movie you will definitely want to watch more of those high school punks, jerks, stoners, geeks and freshmen and their talks. I mean, that is exactly what the people behind this wanted. This movie is neither a dramatic experience nor one in which you will be laughing your asses off but this movie will bring out some smiles and satisfaction. I will definitely rate this movie 10 on 10 and the director- writer guy, Linklater, is a brilliant storyteller.~ dillitalkies.blogspot.com ~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Freedom To Choose - May We Never Give Up Such A Gift</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater has made some pretty interesting and entertaining films. And I think this is one of his best.The film doesn't try to over do anything, and that is one of its greatest strengths. Linklater manages to keep this teen film, with characters revolving around the end of a school year, very down to earth and authentic feeling. I've heard some clowns say that there really isn't much story to this film. I disagree, it really does capture the angst and confusion of teenage youth. It also possesses a subtle message, or at least a deep look at the issue regarding rebellion and conformity. A choice that basically every teenager is continuously faced with in many different ways as they grow into adulthood. The answer that the film seems to come up with is also very grounded. Somewhere in the middle seems to be the healthy choice that the film expresses. And how true is that? If we all conformed in every way. Few things would ever progress in any sort of major way. However if we all just rebelled against every little thing that society brings upon us, then we really aren't even going to be a well respected part of society for very long. We have to pick our spots, and for each individual person, we have different things that suit us regarding each choice.The review I first saw when I came to this page was titled, "One Of The Best Teen Movies Ever Made". I can't say I disagree with that at all.The world would be a pretty boring place if we were all the same. Truth be told, if we totally conform to everything, we basically die as individuals. And the world loses the uniqueness that we have to offer. Living how someone else wants us to live, or how the majority wants us to live, isn't really living our own life at all. We would basically be living a life that others have placed upon us. Emotionally and mentally, that can't be healthy. We all need at least a few avenues where we can be free, and creative in some way. Let's face it, history has been filled with this struggle between conformity and rebellion. It is one of the universal struggles of all people. And this is the essential spirit of life inside every person that Wooderson refers to when he says, "No matter what happens, you gotta keep on livin'.". This film in my view really is a sort of homage, and celebration to those of us who have not given up our freedom to choose, and our freedom to be individuals. How sweet it is!Have I mentioned that this film has some moments that are funny as hell? There is a lot that can be said about this film. It is hardly a run of the mill film with a meaningless story. Keep on rockin' in the free world punks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I graduated in '78 near Seattle and was surprised how authentic the depiction of that time was. We didn't experience nearly the level of hazing but the characters and the parties and the atmosphere was perfect.I was a head, who used to be a jock, so I hung around with both social crowds. The football guys got stoned just like the rest of us...they just wanted it to be a secret.The community club was significant because I ruled at Foosball at the time.Except for the dominant hazing plot, this movie was incredibly accurate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth viewing for those who can relate to the 70's adolescent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Linklater may do a good job of recreating the look, feel, atmosphere and overall attitude of suburban teen life in 1976. At times I felt I was reliving that era. I was Born in 1968 which would have made me 8 years old for this time frame. Having an older brother and sister and witnessing there early teenage years I could recall some nuances in D&amp;C that seemed like Deja Vu. Many comments on this board refer to how accurate Director Linklater is in showing what high school people were like in the 70's. But he doesn't have much material to work with other than Muscle cars, long hair, bell-bottoms and "groovy" music. So I can't say that the effort on production value was elaborate or extensive.If you are looking for involving drama and some real laughs you will not find it here. What we see is basically a near documentary. Linklater has given us a picture, but he hasn't given us a movie. Linklater doesn't spend much more than a couple of minutes on one scene before he pans to another scene of a group of teenagers, etc. It's that kind of movie. The purpose here is to paint a cinematic scrapbook, a timepiece with minor events and inane escapades of high school kids looking for a thrill. Some of the dialogue and characters were funny and a couple even reminded me of some people I knew in my youth. The most interesting character, Slider, played very well by Rory Cochrane captures the spirit and personality very well of a teenage stoner. We initially see him as a cool and hip pot-head with some witty remarks exhibiting a crafty and sly demeanor. But we later discover that he is rather insecure and more of a tag-along to his friends.Besides some of the actors who showcase like McConaghey, Affleck, and Jovovich, some of them appear like amateurs and newcomers to acting. Mainly the younger kids and the parents I am referring to.Dazed and Confused serves its purpose in that it wants to be like a walk down Memory lane. Some of the actors capture teenage uncertainty and ennui. Who can blame them. The 70's teenagers didn't know how to define themselves. The post-Watergate era was caught between the cultural revolutions of the 1960's and before the materialistic 1980's took effect. Women's solidarity hadn't come into status quo yet either. We see freshman girls being hazed by the seniors through some initiation ritual as the upper-class boys passively sit back and watch. Ben Affleck (O'Bannion) and his bully cronies launch a rampage of swatting upcoming freshman with big paddles. I guess some kids were so bored and devoid of fun and games that they resorted to abusing the younger kids due to their own lack of fulfillment and direction in life. I persoanlly don't recall paddling in high school. That actually happened in college through the fraternity curcuit. But I do remember bigger kids abusing younger ones.All the characters seem to be on an even keel. Each character has the same adequate screen time as another. So we really don't have any leads, heroes or heroines, etc. The star quarterback, (London) seems too mature for a high school kid. He exudes a sort of older brother wisdom and rationale; it's not an appropriate acting choice given his age. Everyone else seems real in that you really can't ask for much when you take young actors and have them dress in shoddy 70's clothes and let them act indifferent and bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Far Have We Come?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70's. The jeans, the pot, the sex, the sports, the beer, the parties, the cars, the arcade, the underage drinking, the parties in the woods, and the young adults. I graduated high school in 1980; so much of this movie rang true to my experiences, except for maybe the hazing ritual. We did play 'touch the light' on the way home from athletic events, whereas the freshman had to run through the whole upper-class team to touch the emergency light in the back of the bus ? most anything happened on the attempt.I thought this movie was unbelievably great. I could relate to many of the characters, and almost tag each with a real life person from my high school. That's probably why it is such a popular movie, as the dead-on recreation of the 70's era helps viewers in the 45-55 year age group warmly reminisce their high school days. Richard Linklater's effort exceeds American pop period greats such as American Graffiti and Grease.Many have written there is no plot to this movie. For me the plot lies with the main character 'Pink' as he struggles with the notion that he MUST sign the football coach's newly devised written pledge barring the players from engaging in any unlawful consumption of drugs or alcohol. The movie meanders through Pink's life for 24 hours as he struggles with the concept of conformity vs. the individuality flag he flies so proudly with his assortment of friends ? jocks, geeks, brains, druggies, drinkers, cheerleaders and even the 20 year old blue collar car fanatic that still hangs on to his high school glory days.As my children (upper teens) watch this movie, they ask in disbelief ? is that REALLY how it was? Yes, I know that today's high schoolers use drugs and alcohol probably to a greater extent than during the '70's ? but in a far more subversive manner. Still they cannot believe the craziness that was done in the open. Smoking cigarettes on school grounds in the daylight? Riding in the back of a pick-up through a car wash? An Eighth grader purchasing alcohol? Nightly public keg parties?My children deal with numbered parking spaces in the student lots, allowing quick recognition of any 'unexcused' vehicles. Cameras and microphones on the buses and in the hallways - big brother in full swing. Eating lunch in the classrooms, as students opt out of lunch period for another elective that'll look good on their transcript. Could you imagine O'Bannion speeding up to the side door entrance of today's school in his hot-rod, toting a wooden paddle specifically designed to repeatedly thwack an incoming freshman on the ass? He'd be arrested for intent to assault, and his parents publicly humiliated on the local news.Our history has changed us ? as Columbine and other High School tragedies have proved that safety is the most important priority of today's school administrators.The innocent days (and they didn't seem very innocent at the time) of the '70's are long gone. This movie is timeless, and will forever document a period that seemed a little less serious. Thank you for making this film.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this film recently made me think that maybe I missed out on something in high school. Out of college for the past few years, my high school days, although more recent than not, now seem like a total blah of status quo mundaneness. Especially in comparison to the situations in this film. Dazed and Confused gave me a chance to relive those years - moments - vicariously through characters that had some sense of purpose and wide eyed excitement at even the most petty situations. The acting was all around realistic and entertaining. The directing and writing - was as usual - of high standard from the purveyor of casual (waking?) life, Richard Linklater. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Summer of '76 with Beer and Pot Galore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The difference between "Slacker" writer &amp; director Richard Linklater's postmodern teen comedy "Dazed and Confused" and similar sagas is that he doesn't sugarcoat the past with a surfeit of sentiment. Linklater discussed the inspiration for his second movie on the Criterion DVD commentary track. "This whole movie, I can say, happened to me. It was sort of the greatest hits of my freshman year and other high school years combined into one day." He adds, "This whole movie?I will say?is the most autobiographical thing?I think?moment to moment?that I've ever done, but actually it's full of little character bits that came from other people. If it didn't happen to me, it was important that it happened to someone else." Linklater clarifies that "Dazed and Confused" was never an independent film?a mistaken idea that a lot of people have about it?but always a major studio release.This politically subversive narrative chronicles last day?May 28, 1976--of the spring semester at Lee High School, home of the 'fighting rebels,' in Austin, Texas. Essentially, Linklater's film consists of an "American Graffiti" like anthology of loosely knit relationships among the juniors and the freshmen that gravitate toward each other. Wisely, Linklater provides "Dazed and Confused" with a killer soundtrack of golden oldies from the period, including everything from Aerosmith and Kiss to Z.Z. Top. These kids imbibe lots of beer and smoke lots of marijuana without any qualms or consequences. Several cast members went on to successful careers, but most of them were nobodies when they appeared in "Dazed and Confused." Matthew McConaughey made his big-screen debut. Co-starring with McConaughey are Ben Affleck, Cole Hauser, Parker Posey, Joey Lauren Adams, Milla Jovovich, and Rory Cochrane."Dazed and Confused" deals with the trauma of change. Everybody is planning for bigger and better things. Three incoming freshmen dream about their first year of high school and all the warm and willing women who will add Technicolor to their lusty fantasies. A junior hates the idea of having to sign a pledge to shun beer and drugs before he can play his senior year on the football team. Everybody is moving on except O'Bannon. He's heading back for his second senior year. What most people may miss is that the high school groups in "Dazed and Confused" represent a microcosm of life. Ostensibly, the admission that the past was not perfect and the losses that many characters endure give this film its resonance.Indeed, on e character sums up the overall attitude of many when he comments, "If I ever start referring to these as the best years of my life, remind me to kill myself." The theme of initiation is prevalent throughout "Dazed and Confused." The older kids, both male and female, terrorize the younger ones. Indeed, only one adult family figures prominently here and the father's inference with his son has major repercussions. Again, aside from one character's ascension from youth to stud master, nobody gets what they want. Linklater doesn't look at the past through rose-colored glasses and this distinction gives "Dazed and Confused" a sense of depth. This sense of depth, or denial of gratification, is undoubtedly what prompted Universal Studios to give it marginal theatrical exposure. Since Linklater's film hit home video, the fan base has grown considerably and its status as a cult film has been cemented.Randy "Pink" Floyd (Jason London) spends the bulk of the movie trying to decide whether he wants to sign a no-drugs pledge or throw it back in his coach's face. The football coach, Coach Conrad (Terry Mross) wants Pink to stay away from stoners, such as Slater (Rory Coltrane), Kevin Pickford (Shawn Andrews) and Michelle Burroughs (Milla Jovovich), and as well as alcoholics like David Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey in his second movie). Earlier, Kevin had planned to throw a keg party at his house after his parents left on a weekend outing. When a keg salesman shows up ahead of time at Kevin's house, Kevin's father smells a rat and they stay home, sabotaging Kevin's big bash. Junior high student Mitch Kramer (Wily Wiggens) and his buddies?Carl Burnett (Esteban Powell), Tommy Houston (Mark Vandermeulen) and John Hirschfelder (Jeremy Fox)--are about to enter high school as freshman and they must submit to the paddles of high school juniors who are bound and determined to initiate them into the mysteries of pain that accompanies his promotion to high school.Three rising juniors, Michael Newhouse (Adam Greenberg), Tony Olsen (Anthony Rapp) and red-haired Jodi (Michelle Burke), are the class journalists who like playing poker as a trio. Meanwhile, Simone Kerr (Joey Lauren Adams) and Darla Marks (Parker Posy) initiate the incoming junior high girls by making to them sprawl on the asphalt so that they can dog them out and spew catsup and mustard on their bodies. Later, the girls drive the younger girls through car washes to clean them up. Eventually, the footballers, Fred O'Bannion (Ben Affleck), Benny O'Donnell (Cole Hauser), Don Dawson (Sasha Jenson) and Pink run down the younger guys like his brother Mitch to paddle them. Mitch's sympathetic older brother takes Mitch on an odyssey riding in cars with his friends. Mitch gets to smoke grass, buy and drink booze, and dates an older girl. Meanwhile, the older guy O'Bannion suffers his comeuppance at the hands of Mitch when they pour paint on him as he is about to paddle another incoming freshman.Linklater depicts an entire cross-section of teens in "Dazed and Confused" who are usually smoking, drinking, or generally trying to make life miserable for people younger than they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is one of the greatest Cult classics ever. Everyone has there favorite character and everyone knows some great lines from the movie.The movie takes place on the last day of school where the high school SR's haze and paddle the now high school Freshman. No character takes the hazing as seriously as O'Bannion (Ben Affleck). It also revolves around drug use and a late night kegger. Two of my favorite characters in the movie are resident cool guy, Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey), and stoner Slater (Rory Cochrane.) A number of reasons can be given as to why this is such a great movie but I'll give 1. The movie feels remarkably real and authentic. A lot of the kids in this movie are just kids found and asked if they would play in this movie. They are all very good and there inexperience makes the movie feel even more real. There is no real point to the movie which I suppose is the point of the movie. It's a movie where if you like it you'll watch over and over and over and over again (I think I've seen it 20 times since last year.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's deep, man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not what you might expect from a movie like this, but Dazed and Confused does deliver on many levels. Taking the setup from the classic American Graffiti and switching the setting to post-Vietnam in 1976, this is a coming-of-age story about a group of teenagers that for the most part represents what the entire young generation of that time was feeling and going through. The film covers one last day of school filled with many happenings including, hazing freshmen, playing mailbox baseball and getting shot at, as well as drinking lots of beer and smoking lots of marijuana. Writer and director Richard Linklater seems to have a good grip on the material and handles it with real sincerity and even sympathy towards some of the characters. The ensemble cast is well-cast and deliver the good dialog with a great sense of realism. Headlining it are a young Ben Affleck as a crazed senior determined to make the freshmen's summer miserable, Milla Jovovich who I don't think utters more than five lines in the whole movie, and Matthew McConaughey as an older guy who still hangs out with the high schoolers but is so cool and organizes the get-togethers.This movie is very funny in some parts, but it is also very deep. It doesn't achieve classical status like American Graffiti or The Breakfast Club, but it is a strong and realistic portrayal that speaks to all people at that age where life is either far ahead or right around the corner. Indeed, there are many scenes with some "brainiacs" talking about President Ford and his political beliefs, then switching to deciding whether or not to go to a party. Also, I credit Linklater for not pulling an American Pie and becoming exceptionally crude and vulgar with this material. Yes, many teens do talk like this but not all teens rip off their clothes and have wild sex with each other.All in all, a very good movie that gives a real sense of what it was like to live in the 1970s, and what it's like to be young in this country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I hated the characters. I hated watching all the hazing going on and no one bothering to say anything about it. I hated that even the incoming freshman accepted it so willingly and then I watched it again and realized that Linklater was a genius. He didn't comment on the hazing that went on in the '70s. He just presented it as it really was and leaves it to the audience to give their own emotional reaction to it. The movie is so timely now although the film wouldn't be as interesting today because everyone would be sitting around computers being mean to each other on myspace. Not very cinematic. The performances are great and there's many scenes you just love to watch over and over again. Matthew McConaughey has his character dead-on perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever - but I don't think it's a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie 10+ times. Mainly on the Criterion DVD, which I highly recommend. Like many who love it, I'm old &amp; it reflects my "sense" of the era, but not my personal experiences. Linklater, with a one indie film track record, got studio money and had to fight very hard to get his vision and words on the screen. He and his casting director had an eye for talent, as many have pointed out. For me, the key to appreciating this is in the "making of" feature on the DVD. More than most, it tells a great story of why it is worth it to fight for your vision, and what you have to be willing to lose in the process. Several "reviewers" here say this movie lacks a plot. IMHO, this movie is far closer to "reality" than any of the "reality" shows on TV that play out like game shows. This movie is closer to being a "time machine" without being a documentary. For that same reason, I don't think it's a comedy. I never laugh at it. The dialog is simply "real" and we are sitting in the time machine watching what happened at this place and time. So, kudos to the writer/director, and the cast who is able to bring his words seamlessly to life. In 2008, when studios make the most money from turning comic books into movies, it seems unlikely that we will ever see the like of this film again. But we are so lucky that, for 90 minutes, we can forget about what a mess our generation has made of things -- geez, I hope it's not because our leaders spent their youth getting stoned instead of actually learning things in school!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1970s period film that's just good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1950s has "American Graffiti" and now the 1970s has "Dazed and Confused." Both are well-developed depictions of life in America during those decades with a focus around high school, growing up and making important decisions about what to do and how to live life. Both also gather a killer soundtrack from each decade and the result is more about evoking nostalgia and showing those too young to know what life was like.Director and writer Richard Linklater does good work with this film about high schoolers (mostly incoming seniors) on the last day of school. He's written characters that are fun and easy to identify (by stereotype sometimes) and identify with. The plot is just one giant misadventure involving alcohol, marijuana, high school hazing and a variety of "rebellious" activity. It never settles comfortably around one character, giving you enough to get to know them and be interested in what happens to them, but not enough to truly understand them or care about them. Linklater's focus appears to be showing the many ways that teens handled life and how they felt about it in 1976 through mishaps and comedic moments.The cast is a lot of fun, especially because a lot of actors when they were a bit younger appear in the film: Ben Affleck, Matthew McCounaughy, Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams ("Big Daddy"), Anthony Rapp ("RENT") and even more. Nobody's a show stealer, but that's because the film isn't designed that way."Dazed and Confused" is just fun. At the very least the soundtrack will have you rocking out a bit. There's no slapstick, gut-wrenching humor, you just laugh and enjoy. There's nothing moving about the movie, but you enjoy the characters and what happens to them. It's a very sound movie (no pun intended, but it work I guess) in that it's just well put together. It's not bad at all; if you don't like it it's probably because you wanted more from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated R for Language,Drug Use and Sexual Content. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14ADazed and Confused is a hilarious and great movie about teenage life in the 1970's.This film is basically a version of American Graffiti which takes place in the 1970's as opposed to graffiti which takes place in the 60's.This was my favorite movie about five years ago and I have seen the film at least six times.Dazed and Confused is about a group of teenagers during one day in Austin, Texas in the year 1976.It shows the "freshman" students and the seniors and the relationship between them.The film has an excellent soundtrack consisting of great 1970's hits! Dazed and Confused is a great film that I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic Portrayal of the late 1970's mentality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to admit it, but this is probably the best portrayal of the end of the Disco-just-pre-Reagan era. This is pure Americana, depicting basically everything our culture was around that time, right down to the perfect period look of the clothes, hair styles, lingo, catch phrases, and attitudes.Even though this is quite realistic, for me, there was little that was nostalgic about it. The performances were adequate, but nothing inspired, and the dialog delivery was only close to natural. However, the soundtrack is a thing of beauty.It should be watched at least once, though it is NOT a part of my collection. this is one of those movies that...once you've seen it, you've seen it.It rates a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great period piece comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dazed and Confused" is a great period piece set in the 1970's. The story revolves around Randall "Pink" Floyd and his friends. On the last day of school in 1976, they set out to party and, unknown to them, a journey of self discovery.A great comedy, with laugh out loud antics! Although I went to high school from 89-93, I can still relate to this film. A lot of the antics in this movie, as well as the characters, remind me of my days growing up.A great cast of relative unknown actors (at the time) are in this film. We have a young Ben Affleck, Milla Jovovich, and Matthew McConaughey.Also we have an awesome soundtrack of 70's music from the likes of Black Sabbath, Ted Nugent, Kiss, Black Oak Arkansas, War and many, many more! I highly recommend this film to any fan of comedies. Great fun, and great nostalgia! I'm sure everyone can relate to this film! Should not be missed! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that is pure genius;watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of the 70's, I really enjoyed this movie and the feel it conveyed. It was just about a end of school party and so much more. Watching it made me want to go back. The music and the fashion then were the bomb; I listen to tons of 70's music, but the fashion isn't viable today unfortunately. The feel of the movie is much more American in spirit as this movie promotes freedom and is during a time of rebellion concerning, beer, pot, fashion, music, and such and really the characters seem much more mature and real than kids today are. 93' was a good time to make it, since it wasn't too long afterwards, but not too close-aka, the 80's. I recommend it to everyone, because everyone will laugh, contemplate, and enjoy this movie in someway. Linklater totally chose an awesome decade to make a film about. This is in my top ten favorite films list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Groovy Movie Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused. (1993) Review: D&amp;C is a fun movie. Set during the 70's, a time I was not around to see, sure made the 70's look like a blast. The setup is it is the last day of school and everybody is ready to let loose and enjoy the summer.The classroom scenes before school let's out are quite funny. Everybody is quite laid back. From there, all sorts of stuff happens. We have a great cast of characters to get acquainted with. One more thing is that this movie takes place in one very memorable day into night.D&amp;C delivers some clever and nice humor. This is NOT just a pothead movie, D&amp;C is about potheads, alcohol, and good times. D&amp;C is merely about the youth of yesteryear having a good time in the 70's. Also this features a young Ben Affleck as a brutal bully to Matthew McConaughey as an easy going fella who is not picky about the ladies.Dazed and Confused also has a decent soundtrack as well. With Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Peter Frompton, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, and War, Dazed and Confused is a good experience.The Last Word: Groovy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle, good natured rite of passage document</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rite of passage/high school flick without an obvious plot but much more than a montage of familiar scenes. In truth, I'm not quite sure how Linklater does it. Each set piece is quite self-contained. The main event of the film, a party, almost fails to happen at all. Instead, Linklater relies on a carefully balanced script and his cast. The kids exude naturalism, pinging from experience to experience. Linklater's documenting style refuses draw a specific narrative thread or moral from the movie. If there is any specific epiphany for a character, we don't see it.This naturalism works wonders with the retrospection of the film: we don't have to suffer the usual assumptions about the 1970s. If there is a principal character then Jason London's Pink is it, a beautiful, gifted - if slightly bland - lad whose character Sofia Coppola must have noted when casting Josh Hartnet in a similar role in The Virgin Suicides. All the other roles in the ensemble are equally well-taken.Good natured and quietly affecting 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true sleeper of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally gave in and watched this movie on DVD only because my youngest daughter (2001 highschool grad) has been continually nagging me to do so. I graduated from a small (37 grads my year) school in southern Oklahoma in 1972, and was a few years older than the kids portrayed in this film. The pothead craze hadn't happened at our school yet, but it would by time my brother and future wife graduated in 1975. So I guess everything was close enough to my youth for me to relate to this movie rather well. I had a 1970 Chevelle SS for a short while, and following it, a 1967 Nova SS which I still have. I was very much into hotrods (they weren't called muscle cars yet in the early '70s) and spent a good deal of my time and money either working on my car or drag racing it on the highway just outside of town. In fact, the main selling point of the movie for me was my aforementioned daughter's insistence that I see it just for the cars. Well, I wasn't disappointed there! I'll have to watch the film at least three more times just to catch all the neat ones from the '50s, '60s, and early '70s. I really became intrigued about the movie after I found out it was filmed on location in south Texas. My uncle lived in Pasadena, on the southeast side of Houston at the time this film portrays, so I remember the area from that time. Lots of hotrods and lots of drag racing in my uncle's '71 Chevy pickup on the Spencer Highway man! Even in the small town where I grew up, we had quite a bit of beer drinking going on at any given time, but especially right at the end of school when there was always a big beer bust either planned or happening. The kegger at the moon tower might have well been two cases on the river; very nostalgic and bittersweet memories there! The pot would come later, and I missed that, but I don't feel to bad about it. The movie really addresses that awful teen angst that a young boy has when he's between being a kid and an adult. I think that may be its strongest message to its viewers. It fairly screams that you weren't the only one who went through it, it happened to a few other people as well. Well I guess I'm hooked, it's become a cult movie for me after only two viewings, and 13 years after it was released. I just didn't think a pothead movie would have any value for me, but I was really mistaken in this case. And yes, I do remember the music because we were rapidly being submerged in the rising tide of neo-Country &amp; Western and Disco during the years of 1975 and 1976. No self-respecting rocker would be caught dead listening to either one of them, so we listened exactly to what you hear in the film. It was just like having the FM radio in the car tuned to the nearest rock station, or hearing my brother's home stereo going full tilt on Slow Ride. So if you're over 50 like I am, and you think American Graffiti is a good film, then give this one a try. It's sure a lot closer to home than cruising in southern California.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of My Personal Favourites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is one of the best movies of its genre, if not one of the best movies ever created. It features no real storyline; high school kids last day of school for the summer in 1976, the seniors plan to welcome the new freshman to high school with either a good beating or humiliation. However, the actors are superb, ones that particularly stand out are Rory Cochrane and Jason London. It has many great comic moments and memorable quotes and the soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever featured in a movie. It is one movie that I can watch over and over and never bore of, the amount of times the word "man" is mentioned is almost uncountable.. but this just adds to the beauty of the movie. I have shown many of my friends this film, and not one of them has not liked it, this is one movie it's hard to hate, and easy to love. A cult classic, and one I will treasure for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm just trying to be honest about being a misanthrope"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater's Dazed &amp; Confused is like a groovy, rhythmic mixed tape which reminds you of teenage angst but will still have you moving to the beat. A story about losers - some of whom smart, some of whom stoned and some just hanging around with nothing better to do.When I saw Larry Clark's Kids (1995) I watched with horrible recognition. It was a depressing experience which epitomised the wasteful energy of urban youth in a profoundly abject sense. Most people hated it. Some admired it. Dazed &amp; Confused works better because although we're looking at slackers, losers, potheads and wasted talents it's told with such verve and ironic humour that you won't care. We look back on our teenage years with fond nostalgia , and try to block out the pain. This film encapsulates the banality of following the crowd. Young Mitch - who is now a freshman - is being dragged through the painstaking initiation process imposed on him by the senior graduates. Later on in the film he follows them around with apprehensive adoration, buying them beers and copying their recklessness. Does he achieve adulation from them? Well, sort of.There are roles for such later stars as Matthew McConaughey, playing a twenty something stoner who just keeps with the senior crowd because he'll never be 17 again. The funniest and most ironic line in the film is "I love these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age." A man with nowhere to go, and nothing to show for. Ben Affleck plays a sociopath who's only source of solace appears to be whacking the hell out of freshman with paddles. The only characters who appear to have a vaguely non-gregarious attitude (Goldberg, Ribisi, Repp) are ridiculed for it. And THEY go to the party too!A great soundtrack, another comparison to American Graffiti, to which the film owes a lot, this is still one of Linklater's best. An intelligent film with enough mix of stupidity and irony to appeal to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is great, and depending on the school, very true. It's about the last day of school for high school kids, and transitioning junior high students in 1976.The movie mostly follows the night of high schooler Randall 'Pink' Floyd, and junior high kid Mitch Kramer. Mitch learns to have fun, and Pink learns to live. Both very likable characters. Good, fun, acting comes from Matthew McConaughey who plays David Wooderson, a creepy older guy who hangs out with high school kids. I also liked Ben Affleck's character, O'Bannion, because I know people like him. I also liked Mitch, because I can relate to him in a lot of ways. Acting all around was above average.Overall I loved the movie and suggest you see it right away. Seems to me some people could learn a bit from it.</fullReview>

I would like some of you other fans/critics to clarify something about that punk "Clint" for me. Is he a student at the same High School as the other students or not? When he first confronts Mike at the bash, it appears nobody knows him. Even when Pink first steps in to intervene he doesn't address Clint by name. Also, since the jocks and brains are friendly with one another (Cynthia, Mike, and Tony with Pink, Jody, Shavonne etc.) why does Benny completely overlook Mike getting beat up by Clint and loudly egg Clint on to continue?</fullReview>

This circa went on for years till about 1988 Then came "Zero Tolerance" and these kids coming up have no chance to spread their wings now.

		<fullReview>If you were a teenager in the 1970's anywhere in America you will enter the "way-back" machine with this movie. Almost every detail is accurate from the big belt buckles, clothes, long hair, cars, even the price of gasoline. If you weren't a teen in those days, now you can see what it was like for those of use that were there.It's presented as a slice of life rather than a story with a plot, but that's what real life is really like. The story starts in the early afternoon on the last day of school in June of 1976 and ends the following morning and follows the activities of several seniors and three freshmen.As a veteran of the 1970's and in high school at the time this movie takes place, it was a real nostalgic trip. There's quite a bit of pot smoking but it's an accurate portrayal of the times and not gratuitous.If you have kids, now they can see what you REALLY did when you were young - as opposed to what you have (or haven't) told them. ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick is well worth watching and a pretty realistic look at the last day of high school in 1976, or in general for that matter. That is with some obvious exceptions such as looser liquor laws, along with the absence of cell phones and multiple body piercings. However, tons of blue eye shadow, hip-hugger jeans, some nice classic muscle cars and an awesome soundtrack more than makeup for the lack of modern day electronics and obscurities.In the traditional sense, it's inconspicuously void of some of the characteristics that we've come to expect from teen hyjinx films. I say inconspicuous because I watched the film, absorbed it and decided that I liked it before I realized that these features were missing. For instance, there's romance but no actual sex or nudity. There's drinking and mild drug use, but nobody blows chunks or passes out. It's comforting to know that in 1993, a film of this nature could be made with some degree of dignity and still be worth watching.Richard Linklater, the writer &amp; director, does a good job of making the most of a cast that is pretty low key. By today's standards, Ben Affleck &amp; Matthew McConaughey, who play prominent supporting roles, are the biggest names that appear. Jason London and Wiley Wiggins do a good job with the primary parts, although Wiggins seems to overplay the immaturity level in his portrayal of a freshman on the verge of having the rare privilege of being accepted by the upcoming seniors. He appears to have some sort of problem with his septum. He keeps shaking his head then dropping it and grabbing the bridge of his nose with his thumb and index finger. I mention this because it was really the only feature that annoyed me about the flick.I don't own the soundtrack but it has to be phenomenal. Possibly the best Classic Rock &amp; Roll compilation ever produced for a film.If you're in the mood for some uncharacteristically intelligent teen humor then give "Dazed and Confused" a try. If nothing else it's considerably better than the majority of garbage that's produced in this specific area of the comedic genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until today, I did not know there was a teen movie that concisely and accurately portrayed teen life in the mid-70's. Well, kids, let me tell you - this film hits it right on. At the time this story is set, I would have just finished 10th grade. My life and those of my friends was EXACTLY like this film, summer-after-partying-summer. I am not talking about the plot; that is specific to the film. But the actual words used in conversations, the topics discussed, the activities, the character interaction, the clothes - it's all so accurate that it's like a documentary! I commend Richard Linklater for remembering the minutiae of that time period so clearly.

		<fullReview>I can watch this movie over and over and never get bored. It takes me back to high school so effectively its scary. The scary part is that I was in high school in the late 80's and this movie still holds true. This movie proves that times don't change that much. I most identify with Pink. This movie makes me wish I was in high school in the 70's. I would have to say this movie has the very best soundtrack compilation of any movie, ever. Seriously. It just rocks throughout. I think I read that the soundtrack has 30 tracks in all, all of wish will remind you how awesome the music of the 70's was. Drink a few beers, sit back and relive the best times of your youth...unless you were a complete prude. Have some fun...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best comedies of the 90s without a doubt. I first saw this when first released on video - I'd seen Linklater's hyped, earlier(SLACKER), which was a major cult classic that I wasn't especially fond of. This took the roving camera of SLACKER, added a vague story, or a context at least (the last day of high school, and the following night), cut the characters down to a manageable number, sent it back in time and created an independent film classic. I watched this with a roomful of friends from college, circa 1993, and we were hysterical. It helps that this is a well made film - expressive cinematography at times (the brief scene with Milla Jovovich on the hood of the car at sundown, as Edgar Winter's "Free Ride" plays in the background stands out, leading into the cruising scenes). I was just a kid in the 70s, too young for any of this (I was just in time for the BREAKFAST CLUB/PRETTY IN PINK years, though my Charlotte NC high school was nowhere near as cool or pleasant), but these scenes conjured up great memories of hanging out with friends on humid Southern summer nights, and it's the quality of the cinematography as much as anything that makes DAZED connect. I never took this to be that accurate of a 70s period piece (compare with it's dark and great companion of a sort: Ang Lee's ICE STORM, which offers a somewhat more real glimpse of 70s detail, in service of a much darker film) - but it's a great movie about being young, easily among the best (along with American GRAFFITI, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, or COOLEY HIGH). It's just as idealized as a John Huges flick, but far more spontaneous - the advantage of a cast that was then all undiscovered talent given room to move - but considerably more lifelike. There are no great statements - aside from allusions to L-I-V-I-N' and a very vaguely defined idea of youth-as-freedom, presumably a desperately endangered ideal in the "me decade." But - so many movies about being young are lame, ridiculous, exploitative or cheaply made - and this one ain't. This is the real deal. And - roundabout 1987, I was in the nerd car, and we were listening to The Replacements' "Can't Hardly Wait" instead of Frampton's "Do You Feel Like I Do."</fullReview>

I dont understand-they say the town was "dead" moontower scene but werent they a 5A school? There is a real moon tower and Top Notch as well as Robert E. Lee HS in Austin, TX where the movie was filmed. Where does the movie 'supposedly' take place? Did you ever notice, Julie (Mitch's girlfriend, Mitch himself, Slater, Don, Tony, Mel and Sabrina never really got bigger roles in life even tho they did so well in this movie? Matthew M and Afleck are the only big current stars. Everyone else just faded. Great movie bc everyone can identify themselves with a character and their HS. Wooderson made the movie awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent take on teenage rites of passage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very intelligent film that is all the better for its hints at both humour and frustration with life. Determinedly plot-less in that it follows a succession of events over a night, the great strength of this film is the numerous and disparate groups it follows. From potheads to poker club the sluts and jocks of mundane teen gross-outs like American Pie are distinctly absent in favour of a whole cast that seems somehow more human. Despite their different interests and backgrounds, no character is perfect nor wholly objectionable.Nice to see so many actors and actresses who have become famous in their youth, but nothing distinguishes them from a cast of unknowns all of whom perform strongly. Add this to great cars and fantastic soundtrack that is really representative of the culture presented.Personal favourite moments include the opening Aerosmith (and Pickford's car!), just about every appearance of Slater, and the comment about "white slave owners who didn't want to pay their taxes", representative of an entire ethos of 70's subversity in Austin, commonly called an island of liberalism in the sea of the Deep South.Watch this film, thoroughly engaging and enjoyable if nothing truly spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a really cool movie. In my opinion, even though it was a different time and styles and rituals were different in those days (if seniors tried publicly paddling freshman today, they'd probably go to jail), I think that kids today can relate to Dazed and Confused. I don't mean everything, but little things.This is just a fun movie to watch. There's a lot of good music (Alice Cooper and Aerosmith!), and the kids are all very believable. At first I thought the whole seniors hanging out with freshman at parties was total bulls**t, but I soon came to realize that it very well can happen (although I didn't have to get my ass paddled first). I also liked the fact that the movie wasn't just about getting stoned, even though that is a lot of the movie. I thought at first the whole movie was just gonna be 90 minutes of kids taking bong hits, but that actually isn't a very big part of the movie.I think my favorite characters in this movie are Slater and Wooderson. Slater was just funnier than hell, and Wooderson was like this cool guy who was also kind of a scum bag, but he seemed so innocent about trying to pick up younger chicks. Wooderson's classic line in this movie was "that's what i like about these freshman girls... I get older, they stay the same age". I love it. It's a little creepy, yet really funny too. I also liked Pink (partially because his name his Pink Floyd). I thought he was a good character. He is like the popular guy that everyone in school likes.My only problems with this movie was that there was no Pink Floyd (there were dark side of the moon posters everywhere, but no Floyd), and no Zeppelin. I could have swore they were going to play the song 'Dazed and Confused', but no dice. Other than that I loved it. It was really funny, and I can't say this from experience, but all the people i asked that went ot high school in the 70's said it was fairly accurate. I can say it was accurate in capturing high school kid's in general. A great flick! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i remember being 16 and seeing this film late one night, and thinking it was the coolest thing ever. I taped it of course, and continued to watch it religiously for like 2 weeks. And even now, i have to watch it at least twice a year. Set in the 70's, it traces the lives of several teenagers during one whole day. Not much of a plot, but with razor sharp dialogue, an amazing soundtrack, brilliant actors, and an atmosphere so relaxed and fun, you don't need a plot. Richard Linklater has his finger on the pulse of teenager-dom during that particular time, which makes it almost real to watch. You begin to feel a part of the film, like the characters are your friends, and their problems are your problems. The script is so dead on, and hysterically funny, fleshing out every character so that you can always relate to one of them. A one in a million film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film everyone was toking about. There's just something so special about this movie. It's an ode to an era of confusion, mayhem, pot, and hazing. This is nothing like my high school experience, but everyone I know wishes they could have had just one wild night like the characters in this movie.The beauty of the film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters may be from an entirely different era than those of my generation, but the feelings of being trapped in high school and just looking for something more transcends time. It is a universal feeling to all.The music is perfect, the costumes and hairstyles are laughable, and the performances are so earnest and fun. It is a retrospective tribute to the fun, wild nights that can only happen in high school or college. It invokes feelings of nostalgia, remembrance, and pure exuberance. The mood is just set to music perfectly, especially when Lynyrd Skynyrd's `Tuesday's Gone' plays at the end of the party and Seals and Croft's `Summer Breeze' plays as the sun is rising on Mitch.The scene on the football field when Floyd is trying to decide where his future will lead is truly emotional and poignant. I think we've all had scenes like this, scenes in our lives that we think will change us forever and we'll never forget. However, as the film ends, we see that these characters have plenty of time to grow old and boring. Right now is the time to have one last drunken, festive summer surrounded by friends, and the time to `wanna dance!'Lastly, I must mention the breakthrough young cast. Jason London, Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, and my personal favorites, Anthony Rapp and Adam Goldberg. They were all so great. This movie is a must for anyone who enjoys reminiscing on the good times.10/10</fullReview>

The greatest thing about the movie is the pure characterization - you really get to KNOW the characters as the movie unfolds. This is a movie that MUST be viewed more than once to catch all the fine details that Richard Linklater has included to make this such a special film.Featuring a fine ensemble cast that went on to become very big stars, the film also has two great soundtracks with all the great music used in the film.

This film is fascinating, hilarious, fun and truly honest. This is easily a film that a viewer can relate too! (so long as a viewer can look past the bell bottoms and bushes).Director Linklater has filled this great comedy with great actors (Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Jason London and Matthew McConaughey), a realistic script that does not depend on melodrama or dramatic points and one of the best soundtracks to be found anywhere.If this film doesn't make a viewer instantly nostalgic for the freedoms, pains, ambitions and spirits of youth, than you're probably dead!

Watching this movie, whether you grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s or whenever, you can see how life really hasn't changed. I'm sure we all wondered why our teenage years are said to be the best.

		<fullReview>It seems obvious that the youthful teenagers in Dazed and Confused would like nothing more than to be out of high school - older is better and more mature. So it is bemusing to see the audience response from those times remarking and pining at Linklater's perfectly realised nostalgic details. This points to a small triumph - in costume and production design, in the crude, adolescent dialogue, in the film's entire attitude towards the institute of education and building a future. And yet viewers seem enamored by the wrong details. They seem to have the same reaction watching the film as Matthew McConaughey's over-aged Wooderson, who has no visible future prospects and is instead vicariously living in the past. No doubt he too was the star quarterback, the boy that all the girls pined for, but unlike a normal person he has not let go and moved on. By definition he has peaked in high school, and is the polar opposite of Pink's struggle. But his character has become memorable for all the wrong reasons and his few lines endlessly quoted as classics. Is it perhaps an achievement for Linklater to make this lifestyle and era so desirable? He keeps building to a point, and uses music and slow-motion to establish how the seniors (and Wooderson by extension) own the places they stroll into and the kids they whack with bats. But look just underneath the sheeny of the surface and you see a dark, mean streak behind this 'bravado' and display of masculinity that Mitch so desperately wants to partake in. Bullying and pedophilia made glamorous. Granted the film has a few small moments of sweetness and authenticity. The brief kiss at the end of the night between Tony and Sabrina which, fulled by hormones, becomes a little longer. The way the intellectual trio complain and think themselves above the cliques and rituals but still jump at the chance to hang with the popular crowd. The hilarious naivety in which a trio of freshman imagine the sexual heavens of high school. This world is all about image and playing it cool even as humiliation sets in. But the film, despite promising so much, never really transcends the lazy stereotypes that is presents. It fully embraces its characters and archetypes like Linklater's earlier Slacker (a similar example of the aimless, slice-of-life), but becomes completely engrossed with making the high school world as wild and attractive as it comes (the songs becomes unironic), and quickly forgiving its shortcomings. So we have a rather tame and un- challenging resolution for Mitch, when much more has been set up (what about the facades of masculinity and how they differently affect Mike, Mitch and Pink?). See American Graffiti and how it contextualises its setting within a harder truth, instead of hiding behind nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. This movie is one of my favorites of all time, and is often cited as a cult favorite of others. When people talk of Dazed and Confused they usually mention the funny aspects of it, (Wooderson's Character), and the stoner aspects of it. I think those are just elements of what compose this film. I want to analyze this from a film making perspective.It's the last day of school in an Austin suburb. The incoming senior class interacts with the incoming freshman through a series of fraternity rituals, and everyone is preparing for a big party that night. When the party is canceled, the teenagers roam their streets looking for action. Richard Linklater doesn't really concern himself with plot as he follows different groups of teenagers throughout this film, which takes place in a less than 24 hour period. This is to his advantage and to the picture's authenticity. Too often movies of the 80s created a very plot driven teen flick. If one actually remembers their teen years they remember for the most part they were aimless, unproductive, and occasionally spontaneous. In place of a plot Linklater fleshes out a large ensemble cast that feels painstakingly developed by the end of the film. Holding the movie together is Randall "Pink" Floyd, a football player struggling to find his own worth, as many teens do. These kids drive around, look for drugs, do drugs, and then go home. There aren't any shocking revelations or villainous adults. There is no adventure. Once the beer is gone the party is over. People often classify this movie as a comedy. To be sure it is funny, but it's humor comes from the realism in the way characters behave and talk. We feel like we know these people.The 70s era doesn't feel dated, especially since this was made in 93. Dazed and Confused transcends the generational boundaries, careful to include enough culture so the era feels alive, but cautious enough to avoid being mired in it. The soundtrack is phenomenal by the way. Dazed and Confused is in the top 10 movies of the 90s hands down. It is the definitive teen film. From dialogue to acting, direction to score, the movie feels alive and vibrant. It's a masterpiece and still perhaps the best from Linklater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is a one-of-a-kind film that can be watched over and over again without losing a watcher's interest. It is comical and even a little heart-warming. The film is so easy to relate to, especially for teens nearing the end of their high school career. It even makes you a little sad because it forces you to come to the realization that you have to start thinking about your future after high school. Every character in it is easy to identify with and the way all the characters interact with each other is beautiful. The fact that it is so relatable makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen. Not to mention, the actors chosen are perfect for their characters and almost felt as if their characters were real people. I can definitely say that Dazed and Confused is one of the best films I have experienced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sister used to watch this movie all the time, and wear out the soundtrack. Despite all that, I never got around to seeing this movie. It's become somewhat of a cult classic these days. I really enjoyed this film from beginning to end. Not only is it an excellent coming of age film, but you would probably never see a movie like this get made today. I felt this movie mirrored the 70's precisely. The soundtrack is absolutely outstanding. I was already aware of how great it was, thanks to my sister, but you really don't appreciate, until you watch the movie. You can relate to most of these people in one way or another, but I felt Jason London &amp; Wiley Wiggins were the heart of the movie. Jason London is your typical jock, but a likable one. I think we can all empathize with him. Wiley Wiggins will probably have people mixed as the eager freshman. I personally loved him. We've all been in his shoes, wanting to be accepted by more popular peeps. His character lives a dream that we have all wanted to at some point in our lives, whether it's high school or somewhere else. His character embodied that perfectly. Sasha Jenson plays a party animal to a T. Mila Jovovich, Adam Goldberg, Ben Affleck, Cole Hauser, Parker Posey, Matthew McConaughey, all have roles here as well. The funniest moment in this movie for me is when Mitch (Wiley Wiggins) throws a bowling ball out the window, through a car windshield. I cracked up laughing. That is something that I would have probably done when I was that age, stupidly enough. Have you ever just wanted to say "Screw it, I'm getting obliterated tonight, and I'm gonna have a night I'll never forget" something along those lines? This movie does just that. Life is short. Live it up, take chances, get wasted, whatever you wanna do. This is a great coming of age film. It's a cult classic for a reason. See it as soon as possible8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to its reputation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often referred to as a cult classic, Dazed and Confused lives up to its name in every way. After his excellent directorial debut, Richard Linklater, who was considered an important up-and-coming director hit every right note in his second feature, cementing his status as one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Even today, the film holds up really well and makes for a non-stop entertaining picture.The film takes place in the 1970's over the course of one day, the last day of school. Seniors have now officially finished and they are looking for new freshman to 'initiate' which they usually do by means of bullying. Its something that would not fly today but very easily could have been tradition in the past. Where the film strives in its realism is in what these kids do on this last day of school, they party. And a filmmaker like Linklater is perfect for this because of his gift to let characters just walk in and out of the frame and follow a collective group instead of just a few characters. He doesn't just make a few characters stand out, he gives the whole school character.The film stars some actors that are a lot more well known currently than when this film was released, such as Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, so on and so forth. The entire cast turns in serviceable performances and it makes for one of the more entertaining ensembles to come out of the 90s. With a cast as large as this, it could be easy to make the film too clouded and unfocused, but this is one of Linklater's specialties. He captures an important human connection on film that resonates with us viewers and its part of the large voice he has in American independent cinema.Linklater appropriately uses music in this film. He chooses songs that we're all familiar with and plays them amongst parts where they're most appropriate; such as playing School's Out by Alice Cooper when school is actually out. Its obvious but fitting since these songs were huge during this time period and it accurately captures the feel of that era. Here we aren't exposed to over-the-top 70's clothing and disco-influenced culture, but we get familiarized with a setting where we could easily see our parents growing up in. The film thrives with realism.This may be Linklater's most mainstream-appealing independent feature as a director. Slacker could be pretty divisive, its lack of plot could throw off a lot of viewers. Dazed and Confused also doesn't have much of a plot but this film appeals to a large group of people because of how well Linklater captured a familiar experience onto film to which we can all relate to. It makes for one of the most enjoyable films to come from the 90's and stands out as one of the director's most accomplished features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun '70s Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to high school in the early 70s. D&amp;C does capture some of the fun of that era before AIDS, 9-11, Homeland Security, locker searches or much of the junk we put up with in 2013. In the Northeast we never had Freshman hazing, so I found that stuff a bit hard to relate to. I read here that was common in Texas high schools. I would recommend D&amp;C not as great filmmaking but simply a fun look back at high school in a unique time that only lasted a few years. For young people that want to get a feel for the 70s, watch this film. Also see Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two seasons of That 70s Show. Freaking awesome, dude!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie so many times I love it. I am a teen now and this movie makes me wish I lived in the 70's. After watching this movie I feel like I have lived and been through the 70's it's amazing. I would give up all the technology, clothes, and the music I like to get a chance to live in the 70's. I wish times were simple again with no computers, cell phones, etc. The 70's just seemed like they were amazing to live in like how so many kids were cool with smoking pot, cigarettes, drinking, etc. today that is not the case. I love this movie so much I don't know exactly what it was like to live in the 70's and I never will but this movie is the closet thing I will ever get to it. Yes I love some things about my generation but that generation was so much cooler. Whoever made this movie did a really good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is a great, funny movie that brought back some good memories of my high school days. I did not go to high school in the 1970's but many things that take place in this movie happened at my high school just in a different decade.This is about the last day of school at a Texas high school in 1976 and what happened the rest of that day and night.It was refreshing to see actors before they got famous. I barely recognized Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey. The cast did an excellent job.The soundtrack is amazing. There are many great classic rock bands I enjoy such as Aerosmith, Lynryd Skynyrd, and Foghat.Overall, this is a fun movie. I forgot how girls used to use pliers to fit in their jeans. That doesn't happen much nowadays. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Look Back at the Drugs and Rock 'n Roll of the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused (1993) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Richard Linklater's nostalgic look back at the final day of school when the soon-to-be-seniors get drunk and stoned waiting for their first year at the top of the food chain while the incoming freshmen get prepared for a year of getting picked on. A wide range of character drink, smoke and have fun talking about what life is about to offer them. I think it's fair to say that this film did for the 70s what American GRAFFITI did for the 50s in that it was a very nostalgic look back for a director who was clearly putting his memories on film so that future generations could look back and use the film to say that's what it was like back in the day. Director Linklater does a remarkable job capturing the mood and spirit of teenagers and the colorful soundtrack really packs a punch even if none of the characters are really drawn out any. If there was a flaw with the film its the character who are all lovable but at the same time there's really nothing but one stereotype after another, although some might say this was done on purpose by the director. What does work here is that the actors playing these parts are at the top of their game and seeing this movie today is a lot different than when I saw it in theaters back when it was first released. I still remember watching this movie and being impressed by all of the unknowns but when you see the film today it's rather shocking to see how many went on to bigger things. Jason London, Rory Cochrane, Wiley Wiggins, Adam Goldberg, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, Ben Affleck and Parker Posey are just a few of the familiar faces and all of them do a fine job with their characters. Another important part of the film is its terrific soundtrack, which includes the likes of Aerosmith, Bob Dylan, Alice Cooper, ZZ Top, KISS, Deep Purple, Ted Nugent, Peter Frampton, War, Nazareth and many others. This soundtrack is certainly a killer album with one great track after another and there's actually more music than actual dialogue. There's no question that the story is fairly light as there's really not too much going on except for drinking and smoking but I think there was a point to that. I think Linklater is certainly telling more messages than your typical high school film and there's no question that the quality here is much higher than you'd normally see. The young faces and terrific music are two of the biggest highlights and in the end there's no way not to be impressed with what you're seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashes me back -- every time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, it's lean on content and wit, as well as storyline, but if you were in HS between '75 and '77, you will appreciate this flick. I have watched it at least 10 times, and still can't pass it up when it's on the tube. I'm sure it's cult status has everything to do with all of us who actually had a high school experience similar to this and completely respect Linklater for recreating a snippet of our youth.Linklater's duplication of the time period is right on -- from the clothes, to the cars, the drugs, and the average-joe blue collar environ -- and even though shot in Austin, it could have been MY high school (except our doors were turquoise)and pretty much is representative of my HS experience.This was one of the first movies to really use a soundtrack in a way that hits a chord realistically with the time period it represents. Makes me want to break out a quart of Miller, slip on some sky-high clogs and bell bottoms and crank up Foghat.This movie isn't for everyone, and it's not intended to be. It's by a child of the 70's FOR us children of the 70's. We don't care what the rest of you think -- we enjoy the flashback and revel in it.</fullReview>

But since I grew up in the 60s in the rural UK, I am not one of them.I was impressed at the ensemble of "before they were famous" actors - from that point of view the movie bears comparison to Fast Times At Ridgemont High.But a large part of the movie seems to be about "initiation rituals", and that is something which I found both alien and repellent to the extent that it turned me off the movie to a large extent. It was not something which happened in my school days although I suspect that end of year mayhem is one of a number of US imports to the UK in the years since then for which I do not care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Stoner Teen Comedies Today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I entered grade 9, I never really got an initiation. Sure the older kids asked me if I was a minor niner, but I said I was in grade 10. They never paddled my ass, drew a penis on my face or made me push a penny on the bus floor with my nose. I got through grade 9 with ease. I also never grew up in the 70's so I thought I might miss the whole generation thing with Dazed and Confused. Even though it was made in the 90's.Who would think that a film about high school kids beating up younger ones, getting drunk and high and partying all night would make a good film? Well, I did for one.Dazed and Confused is not the first teen party film I've seen, but it is one of the best, so good that it transcends that genre. Can't Hardly Wait is suppose to be my generation party film, I think, but I feel more connected to Dazed and Confused then any other. Probably because Linklater is dedicated to his craft and isn't looking to cash in on a certain craze. I can honestly say this is his best film.It boasts an young cast of early talent, like Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, Adam Goldberg, Rory Cochrane, Milla Jovovich, and so on. I think it's great to see all of today's actors in a film like this, just having a good time.The film has a great soundtrack that embodies that time era, as it should. Dazed and Confused is a film that I can enjoy no matter what mood I'm in. So many teen high school films these days are moronic and try way too hard to be funny to immature kids. This is a true high school film that has heart and doesn't need to stoop to that low level, even with it's content being so childish.Sit back, relax and enjoy Dazed and Confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best High School movie ever? **Spoilers ahead**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW! Love this film, great ensemble cast, its hard to pick a favourite character or performance. Ben Affleck gives arguably his best ever performance as the guy you love to hate, the school bully who just loves beating up little kids. Matthew McConaughey exudes Steve McQueen-esquire cool as Wooderson, the slightly older guy who has two loves in life, his car, and high school chicks! The story is a freewheeling affair, basically following the last day of term in an unnamed US school in 1976. The main character Randall 'Pink' Floyd is at a crossroads in life. Does he quite literally play ball as the star quarterback, follow orders and continue to live as high school royalty, or does he follow his more rebellious friends, for parties, beer and good times?!! The great trick with any retrospective film is to make you nostalgic for an age you weren't born in, and this film achieves this with style. Its amazing just how much young talent was on display in this film, Affleck, McConaughey, Parker Posey, Milla Jovovich, Jason London &amp; Joey Lauren Adams to name just a few! Yet its Rory Cochrane who steals the film as a spaced-out stoner. If you haven't seen this film before, go and rent/buy it. If you have seen it before, watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>whether you graduated from high school 25 years ago or last week this movie is for you and (sadly) contains characters just like the kids you knew. Its an amazing film because of the way it perfectly captures the time period (Not much has changed since the 70's), and how it manages to carry so many characters and make every one of them interesting. Most films would be worthwhile if they could create one character as deep as these. McConaughey's sticks in my mind as he gives a standout performance as the creepy older guy picking up on High School girls. While this takes place in the 70's its not much different today and thats what makes it so fun to watch; It has no real *plot* its not about whether the hero gets the girl, or the nerd loses his virginity, or the bully gets beaten up. It doesn't end in a tragic car crash, although it does end in some quiet moments of truth, which are not pressed too hard.Thanks Linklater for making such a fun and surreal movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasing low budget melodrama spun out of almost nothing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is 1976. In small town USA the stoners, the jocks and the wannabe's are going about their life of doing very little beyond hanging out, listening to rock music and playing cruel games.This is a wonderful example of what you can do with next to nothing, No budget, no stars and very little in the way of a plot - and yet it really entertains and is almost on a par with American Graffiti. A B movie update of it maybe?(There are cruising and "buying booze" scenes that almost seem a tribute to the Francis Ford Copolla classic.)What is there to do in this Southern Nowhere: Drugs (and more drugs), house/field parties, smashing things up, getting alcohol underage, cruising in beat up cars and making out with girls. Some of which are rather young for that sort of thing.Writer/director Richard Linklater has obviously been there and done it all. He keeps it going around in small circles - swapping from character to character to character - like a mosquito that is always looking for fresh blood to suck.Interesting to see a younger Matthew McConaughey playing an older guy who hangs with the teens because they seem to have something. A long haired Ben Afflick plays a bully who gets his comeuppance in the end. Model Milla Jovovich hangs around the edges looking good and strumming a guitar. Otherwise it is unknowns that stayed that way.If you can imagine that the USA was a small place (like Portugal, for example) then this would be the kind of film they would make all the time. They would have no choice. As we all know it is not - more's the pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a little story to my review.....the other day I stumbled across "Slacker" in my university library and decided to rent it out (for educational purposes, of course ;-) ), on the back it said it was directed by the same person who directed "Dazed and Confused", so I had a quick look to see if the library stocked that too. Luckily for me it did! While I was watching D+C I realised that I had seen it before, but none the less i'm still glad I took the time out to watch it again, it was worth every second. It provides a lot of laughs, but its not as slap-stick as say "American Pie". I wasn't born in the 70's but I sense its authenticity, I think no matter what era you grew up in (im more of a 90's child) you should be able to appreciate/relate to what the kids in this flick think/do/see! Great film, will be looking out for more of Richard Linklater's work. P.S. I knew that was Renee!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't grow up during 1976, but I can believe the teen antics in this film. They make me wish I had grown up during '76. But I had my good times too in high school and the qualities this film presents are true of all teenagers, regardless of when they were born.Dazed and Confused chronicles the lives of teenagers in the seventies, a portrayal that seems to suggest a grander and more carefree way of life. And appropriately we see young undiscovered kids who would go on to become super stars (e.g.: Jason London, Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey). The setting for the movie is atypical -school. Sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll are pretty much the themes of the time. Guess not too much has changed since then. And crazy stunts like paddle whipping freshman, throwing keg parties, vandalizing property, illegal drinking, etc. add not only humor but also a nostalgic quality of the crazy things we all did as kids. The director's ability to show things as they might of really happened gives the viewer sort of an empathetic flashback and reflection on a time gone by. It gives us an episode from the golden years, a time of recklessness and foolishness, and whose value we would never realize until several years later, when we would turn into grown ups. For this reason, and the wonderful comedy "Dazed and Confused" carries with it in its budding stars, I highly recommend watching (if not purchasing) this one! 9/10</fullReview>

I'm sure John Hughes had to fight for Molly Ringwald. The soundtrack even supercede's this great movie, which captures keggers' in the woods and clicks which inter-mingle. Jason London?

I also found parallels between what I saw in my school years, exageratted in my case. Unfortunately, one review I read stated that Renee Zellwegger has an uncredited role. Many people make this mistake. I myself made this mistake until I learned to distinguish between Renee and Joey Lauren Adams( of Chasing Amy fame). Renee was in Empire Records, another teen angst movie. I also enjoyed Parker Posey's performance as an arrogant senior. She plays so well these types of roles. This is one of those movies that some of our leading stars can be seen in, before they were the leaders. Worth a look of you enjoyed the 70's, or enjoy "culture" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody can really say Dazed and Confused is not like high school, because what they're really saying is that it wasn't like THEIR high school experience. Personally, even though I went to school in the '90s, I found plenty of similarities -- the small town, with nothing to do but drink and smoke pot and drive around. But what the movie does more than connect factually with everyone's high school experience is capture the ESSENCE of how high school students really feel. The seniors' superiority. The need to find your own identity. Being stuck in different social groups, but every once in a while having a great time outside of one. The "if I ever start referring to these as the best days of my life, do me a favor and shoot me" quote. Trying to rebel against the teachers and coaches. It's kind of annoying that this was marketed as a stoner movie, because it's really so much more. It's a fairly accurate portrayal of the thoughts and actions of high school students, way more so than the 95% of all other teen movie junk that doesn't resemble high school whatsoever.And the actors do look their age, for the most part. Some of the seniors look a bit old, sure, but the freshman really look like freshman. It's refreshing, since these days you turn on the TV to watch someone pushing thirty pretend to go to her junior prom. Overall, Dazed and Confused is a real original, a high school movie that really doesn't try to be anything more than an interesting and funny and even poignant portrayal of high school students and their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. No cute plots recycled from Shakespeare. No romantic comedy lameness. Just real people and their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffers from reality burps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film portrays my high school generation, and while it gets some things dead on, (the clothing, the hair, the obsession with pot,) it is painfully obvious the film-makers are catering to a generation far removed from the Texas high school experience of 1976.The music is fantastic, but it should have been used to better underscore the differences between what, in reality, was highly segregated groups. (See "10 Things I Hate About You" to see it done effectively.) "Rock music" had yet to become the homogenized sound of today, and every kid was identified intimately with their chosen flavor. The drifting apart of childhood friendships were actually affected by a change in ones musical tastes. While some of us easily moved from one group to the next, it wasn't common. In our world, Aerosmith folks wouldn't have rubbed elbows with the Kiss army if they could help it, and Frampton fans would have been foolish to make their preferences too loudly known. Missing is "The Eagles" and the ignoring of Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" is incomprehensible, especially as Jason London's character was nicknamed Randall 'Pink' Floyd in the film.At times the characters bear an uncanny resemblance to reality, making it easy to mentally identify them with their real-life counterparts of so long ago. The accents are missing (except by Matthew McConaughey, of course) and the frequent use of "the F word" blows it for me every time. The eagerness to use that word in common conversation is not from my generation, as it was generally used for shock effect, and then, rarely in mixed company.I suppose if I hadn't lived through those times, I'd see this film differently, but as it stands, "Dazed and Confused" only serves to remind me that the times have changed, and in some ways, not for the better.</fullReview>

The dozen or so main characters are augmented by dozens more we see only in glimpses - the annoyed girl left mid-kiss, the easy-going washed up convenience clerk, the clumsy girl who laughs at herself after a face-forward fall.

		<fullReview>this movie is awesome. im in high school now and i think this movie is pretty close to how it really is. the jocks (benny, don, melvin), the cheerleaders (jodi, shavonne, simone), the nerds (tony, mike, cynthia), the stoners (slater, pickford, michelle), the.. mean people (o'bannion, darla) and of course pink, the popular guy, and wooderson, the old guy who still hangs around. i will never ever get sick of watching this movie. every time i watch it (which is very often) i feel like going to a party. wooderson and slater are my favourite characters. i love the part when slater asks mitch if hes "cool". haha.. hes hilarious. i think i like it because it has no plot, much like my life. wake up, hang out, party is pretty much it. the only things that bugged me were mike (i dont like how he talks) and the fact that mitch touches his nose like 30 times. other than that its excellent. ok thats enough.. check you later!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's a good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Dazed and Confused only a few months ago. I liked it. I thought it was funny,and entertaining. The movie is about a bunch of high school kids in the last day of school in 1976. Nearly every one of them are dopers. Some of them are mean. Others are cool. The movie just shows this people drink,smoke pot,crash parties,and fight. Normally I would need more from a movie that's just about people getting high,and drunk. but since most of the characters are interesting it makes the drinking,and high moments better than your adverge stoner movie. I give Dazed and Confused *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90s kids pretend to be living in the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a big fail if you ask me. I graduated in 1982 so my high school years were from the late 70s to early eighties. I lived this life. First the characters have lousy development to them, so bad I don't recall any of them by name. The film is a giant cliché. Also whats with the paddling thing. Never heard of it. Is this some weird Texas thing? The film has no real memorable quotes or scenes to speak of. Its one big bore fest. Its like they dressed these people up in 70s duds and told them to just mill around in front of the camera. Sorry but this film sucks. These kids are supposed to be in high school but they act like they are pledging a college Greek thing. Sorry but we didn't have organized hazing at high school. Fast Times at Ridgemont High looks like Shakespeare when compared to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just See It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so good it has a cult following. No other film captures the hairiness of high school culture quite as well as this one. I am not going to intellectualize, but instead just recommend you see it for yourself. What most impressed me was the group sitting in the middle of the football field (for privacy) as the sun goes down. Their conversation is so stultifying that the movie literally turns masochistic, itself becoming boring as it records the tedium of these teenagers hanging together who after all have no other place to go but home to their parents. The film makers gamble the audience will distinguish between induced boredom and lack of consciousness. But I don't know if the average viewer does. See the film. If afterwards, you feel burnt out--don't be surprised. Adolescence is like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is THE best movie I have ever seen. It covers everything about high school: hazing, drugs, and football. I think i fell in love with it from the start. Pink is the totally hot misplaced jock who goes out with Simone. Pink likes Jodi. Jodi's younger brother is Mitch who tries to run from the hazing. On the girls side the cheerleaders cover the young freshmen in ketchup, mustard, eggs, and other food. The guys paddle the young and scrawny freshman. O'Bannion has failed millions of times just for this event. The soon to be senior geeks: Mike Tony and Cynthia go to a party and try to be cool. Cynthia gets clues to a kegger by older Wooderson. The adorable Slater amongst others go through the movie stoned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone else said it - and it's true: This is our American Graffiti. This is the night I became a senior too (a week after this movie's set)... I'd been to see Paul McCartney &amp; Wings at the brand new Seattle Kingdome the night before; couldn't hear a thing the whole next day. Such a lame time, in terms of big-stakes issues, political upheaval - OK, we had a gas shortage. And that's a lot of the story of the film. Everyone's trying to find something to believe in. For all the TV shows and movies that do half-baked attempts to recreate period, here's one that nails it. The clothes, the hair, the makeup, the music, the cars, right down to the attitude of each character - spooky good. The seniors act like seniors; the freshmen act like freshmen... they make that year or two or three difference in age absolutely clear in the briefest bits of dialog and visuals. Of course, a great collection of stars-to-be. McConaughey is especially terrific here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great cast of yet-to-be stars, a great script and a movie that reflects what it was like to grow up in the '70's as a high school kid. Ya, we got baked partied hard and focused on the opposite sex - as they did in decades past, well maybe not baked, but you get the idea.This is a coming-of-age movie much like American Graffiti. It was one of the first things that came to me after first watching this movie and while it may not have the same mass appeal for anyone who grew up in the mid-70's it brings back memories of parties, friends, school and of course the music. Great soundtrack.We didn't have the initiation ritual at my school, thank god, but everything else was pretty much the same. If you grew up then, if you didn't but are interested in that time or a fan of 'That 70's Show', this is a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this is a pretty accurate picture of high school at that time, some of the music was off, at least for a "class of 76-er" from Nor Cal. We were listening more to Jackson Browne, the Eagles, CSNY, Linda Ronstadt, Dave Mason, Neil Young and the like. Sure, Lynryd Skynyrd (sp?), Frampton and Foghat were a part of our soundtrack, but where were the above mentioned bands, and Robin Trower, Led Zepplin, Kansas, and many, many more? Still, all in all, I love this film - especially I loved seeing young Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey (Matt's hair cracked me up 'cuz I knew guys who wore their hair EXACTLY like that!! - sad but true). The cars, clothes, and general scene/look of the film was dead on - kudos to the art department on this pic. It's a wonderfully enjoyable flashback to a time that was both special and sad all at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is a classic teen film depicting life as a high schooler. Everything about the movie makes it such a classic. The actors were all chosen superbly and act just like you'd find high schoolers in real life. The storyline is also well thought out and never gets boring. The mixture of drama and comedy provide for a well rounded movie. Once you see it, you will fall in love with the way the story progresses and takes you on a trip through the lives of these young adults in the 70's. All of the cars and scenery are also very accurate. The movie is extremely funny and enjoyable. Even adults can watch this movie and remember the days when they were in school. Excellent movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is by now a true cult classic and for many reasons: it is one of the best comedies made in the 90s, with a 70s style and great music. The plot is not the greatest plot ever but the way that Richar Linklater makes the film is really great and the strong part of the plot is the dialogs of most of the characters. And I love the irony part with Mitch, this fella that first is punished for be younger and later he takes his revenge and is the boy that have the best time in the party. And my favorite character is Slater, he is really funny that reminds me the character that Brad Pitt played in True Romance.If you a looking for a cult comedy whit very good dialogs this is the film.DVD: about the criterion DVD, well is just great all the bonus material, the comments of Richard Linklater,the booklet whit the profiles of the characters and the original poster so if you are fan this DVD is just amazing.PS: Jimmy Page's solo in the song Dazed and Confused, from Led Zeppelin I, is probably my favorite of him.What a song!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures The Spirit, The Essence and The Flavour Of Life As A Teenager</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two common ways of approaching a film that focuses on teens, wait, edit that, two common ways of generalising teenagers. One of those ways is to say that teenagers are fuelled with angst, confused and frustration, the other is to show teens as drug obsessed and sex-crazed maniacs. Few of them succeed in creating the more valid, profound and honest interpretation of teen life.Dazed and Confused is a film without a story, but that is intentional because the film is about depicting the best years of our lives and when you can just do things in your time and the way you want them. Dazed and Confused, quite simply charts the story of a bunch of high-school teens' traditions and interests on the first night of the '76 summer, centred around a massive party.I find it impossible how somebody could not enjoy, or even merely relate to even some of the smallest aspect of Dazed and Confused because it is documenting the teen culture that everyone is apart of. For a film that is centred on the '70s it still manages to captivate and identify with Generation X viewers today. The wide variety of flamboyant characters in Dazed and Confused are the people we all know as teens. The characters are people you know/knew in school and are detailed with finesse. Nevertheless, without becoming clichéd the characters burst with the nature of youth and bond you have with the people you know. Dazed and Confused is a true interpretation of life, it has an almost documentary effect lingering around it.One of the few problems with Dazed and Confused is the acting, which is very bland and unprofessional. I felt some of the actors and actresses did not have the same dedication as others did. Dazed and Confused still managed to launch many careers, for the young American performers, obviously having an awesome memory of acting in such an iconic modern classic. Richard Linklater provides everything to fit the era and adds a deliciously fashionable '70s soundtrack. The script is genius, mixing hysterical comedy, pop-culture and elements of drama perfectly. There are dark undertones behind the fun and games in Dazed and Confused, yet it is best you find them out for yourself.Dazed and Confused shows how being a teenager is somewhat like a metaphor for an open road of possibilities. Ultimately, Dazed and Confused captures everything about teen life and includes the needed nostalgic, bittersweet brilliance of youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes kiddies..being a High School grad from '76 I will definitely concur on the "spot-on-ness" of Dazed and Confused, especially in the music.(although it takes place in Texas, it was a bit lacking in ZZ Top.."Beer Drinker-Hell Raiser" comes to mind.)Truly a "way-back" machine with attention to detail:those polyester-nylon Little League uniforms still make me cringe and those laughable (sansa-belt?) athletic shorts worn by the football coaches -"yeah,right coach".The acting is fine through-out.Yes there was a fair amount of"sparking a J"(not to mention a laundry list of pills and powders) and cracking a brewski. The actors are very good- playing variations on the different "types" found on campus-and off- we had a Wooderson, except he drove a very souped-up Ford Falcon. Chevelles, AMC Javelins,Mustangs, along with the Mavericks,Bonnevilles and sundry now extinct- "mom's" station wagons-filled the campus parking lot.The movie did an excellent job of conveying a lost,almost innocent golden gap between a unpleasant time Watergate-Viet Nam, and the vacuous materialistic soul-deadening Reagan-MTV- 80's and the yucky years following.A film worthy of everyone's viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused played in the background of 90% of every house party I ever attended out at Texas Tech after it came out on video, and sometimes it was the basis of the party.I was a little kid in Dallas in the 70's, but the characters in the movie remind me exactly of all of my teenage neighbors that I idolized. I can only imagine how much of a flashback it must be for mid-70's high school graduates from Austin to watch this movie.For the most part it has absolutely great performances from top to bottom. Pretty much the only complaint I've ever heard consistently is about the "Mitch twitch" where he grabs his nose every ten seconds, but we even turned that into a great drinking game. When Mitch grabs the nose, you drink...you'll be lucky to make it to the end of the party at the moon tower if you stick to it.We were such fans that we took the time to find all the significant settings from the movie while on a road trip to the Guadalupe River and Austin over 4th of July weekend '95. We ate Jalepeno Burgers at Top Notch, drove through the parking lot of the Emporium and then bought some booze across the street at the Centennial. We even looked to see if there was still any paint on the driveway where O'Bannion got dumped on, but they must have cleaned it up. The Emporium outside was just gray. We were hoping the colorful wall sign was still there, but no. Last but not least we found a moon tower. There's a lot of them, so who knows which one is "the" one, but it was one of the best road trips I ever took in college. If they were selling Aerosmith tickets in Dallas or Houston we probably would have gone in tribute.I don't know if all the places are still there or not, but you might check it out if you make your way to Austin, TX. D&amp;C and Fast Times are in a dead heat horse race for the best teenage movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coolest 70's Film Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976 I was a junior in high school. Except for the seniors chasing freshman around town to beat them with a paddle (that was done in college actually), this movie perfectly depicts the all-out partying and rock-n-roll mood of the era. (The only other movie that captures the feel of the 70's this well is Cameron Crowe's "Almost Famous") This movie portrays the jocks, the (pre-computer) intellectual geeks, the babes, the jerks, and the shy underclassmen. Nothing before or after compares with the 70's. Everyone who lived in those heady times knows this with absolute certainty. Everyone else wishes they had experienced that era of history, even though they would never admit it. But thirty years later, what are we all still listening to? Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Tull, The Who - bands that take us back to that period. I also like that Ben Affleck gets nailed. This movie launches the careers of Matthew McConaughey, Parker Posey and Ukrainian uber-babe Milla Jovovitch. It is incomprehensible that Ben Affleck made it bigger in Hollywood than Jason London who demonstrates such a natural aptitude as a leading man in this film. In short, the movie illustrates that it didn't matter who you were or where the party happened to be, the 70's was a state of mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High School in the 70's &amp; 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may accurately depict high school in the 70's but I must say, It wasn't unlike my high school experience in the mid 90's. I went to a small school in an average size town just north of Boston where the landscape, both physical and economical, was very similar to those in the movie. There were keg parties in the woods, local hangers-on mulling around, nearby pool halls, big bashes when parents went away, booze was easy to get with even the crappiest fake id's, and even much of the same music was listened to. There were some popular newer bands that got some time in the 90's like Pearl Jam, Weezer, and a few others but even at this time, music at parties was dominated by Zeppelin, Floyd, Sabbath, and a whole slew of other 70's era bands as well as some 80's bands like GNR and Metallica. What is most similar to my personal experience and the movie though is the personalities and different groups that co-existed whiled driving around looking for something to do. Great movie, couldn't have come out at a better time, for me anyway.</fullReview>

I was in the 7th grade at the time and I remember the school lockers and doors getting a fresh coat of paint for the movie as well as the movie crew setting up some for the shoot during the summer. The parking lot scenes in the movie is where I use to catch the bus! The movie is such a great escape from today, a good study of the 70s for teens in America and I always enjoy it since it froze time for me at the school that I went to back in 1993...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flabbergastingly remarkable movie that is ingrained in my memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused has the kind of glee and convictions that only a film that strikes an extremely strong cord with a specific group of people (a cult classic) can have. It has incredible scope that brings out certain themes that are all loosely connected to one and other by simple truths of teenage life (and of life in the 70's). The characters-most of them-have little depth but are undeniably touching and funny. A lot of the film is just out to have fun, filled with silly pranks and car chase scenes. There are also times when the film seems to be treading water. Yet this is undeniably one of the best comedies of the nineties because of its wit, fabulous performances, innocence, and good nature (the last two attributes are nearly impossible to find in modern comedies). There aren't any characters that cream of the crop director Richard Linklater seems to have any hatefulness toward-even the nasty ones. The characters are memorable in their own two-dimensional way thanks to performances by Adam Goldberg, Michelle Burke, Matthew McConaughey, Sasha Jenson, and Joey Lauren Adams-just to name a few; when all of these characters work together they create a real high school environment (though an exaggerated one). The finest performance comes, surprisingly, from young Wiley Wiggins as a nervous junior high school student going into high school; he packs a stronger emotional punch than any other character in the movie and the fact that he overacts at one point and still keeps his screen charisma is a testament to his endearing presence; without his contribution, this film would probably be just a little bit better than your average wild party movie. Here Linklater proves that he can make a relatively mainstream movie without losing his convictions as an artist as he criticizes our schools' way of making students prepare so much for their future that they forget about the present. Also worth noting: the film has an incredible, gritty visual style by Lee Daniel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused has its good and bad moments. Realistic? Sometimes. The good parts were the props,clothes,hairstyles and music. Loved the music! The bad parts were the hazing of the freshmen. They did it to excess. Besides,if these high school kids were considered the "cool" kids they wouldn't even bother wasting there time hazing the younger kids,they would just hang out with their own friends and go do whatever they normally do. Plus that one kid with the hat got on my nerves to the point where I almost wanted to kick in the TV screen,I liked when that other kid in the car finally called him a dork. If those kids(the"cool"ones) went to my high school,me and my friends would have tormented those chuckleheads. They would be considered the retards of the school.

		<shortDescription>D&amp;C takes you back to a time and place . . . . AHHHH!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Dazed and Confused for two reasons; 1. One of the best examples of a Hollywood film that actually gets a time and place not just correct, but DEAD ON PERFECT! 2. Reminds me of a time and place very near and dear to my heart! The state of Texas in my youth! I grew up in Texas in '70's and '80's and watching this movie reminds me of my big sister and her friends at Killeen High School in Central Texas. (about 60 miles north of Austin, where the film is set.) Everything from the kids hanging out by their Pick-up trucks in the parking lot of school, to the Freshmen initiations, to the beer keg party out in the middle of nowhere is SOOOO High School in Texas at that time. I especially love the soundtrack since it reminds me of how my big sister introduced me to "cool rock &amp; roll" ala "Almost Famous." Change the music and clothes and it was pretty much the same when I entered High School four years later in 1980. Although the drug use in the early '80's was kept more on the "down-low" in my High School years. I think that had more to do with the '80's evolving from the '70's than a reduction in toking! I was a football player, so there weren't too many "Heads" in my clique, but we did drink some serious beer!!! I really feel sorry for kids today who don't have the opportunity to have the kind of fun I had with my friends and my sister had with hers. I think the PC, alcohol free, straight edge life today's kids are expected to live is completely unrealistic. I really feel that the healthy social life I had as a High School kid helped me develop into a well rounded adult. I KNOW that learning to drink beer in HS made sure that I didn't make a fool out of myself in College and as a young adult. All that partying did nothing to adversely effect my development or my sister's. We both went to college and have successful professional careers as do most of the people we went to HS and College with.I think kids today are more likely to use drugs BECAUSE they are denied beer at that age, not the opposite. Teenagers like to experiment; with sex, with alcohol and with drugs. I know if I had my choice I would rather have my kids experiment with beer and a little weed instead of coke, crystal meth, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is a classic "stoner" comedy but at the same time is a classic comedy. It's one of those films that doesn't get lopped into just the Cheech &amp; Chongs and Fridays but branches out to an entirely new audience that can really appreciate it. I love watching this movie and then thinking to myself how far Richard Linklater has come since. He's still a well respected director who can lure big actors into his independent masterpieces. After watching Dazed and Confused one may often want to get in a time machine and travel back to the 70's, since we can't do this we repeat a viewing. The remarkable thing about this movie is that each time you watch it it actually gets better. You become more familiar with the characters, and suddenly you're incredibly comfortable with them. After a certain point it's as if you're hanging out with the characters, you know them so well. Linklater is a fantastic director who always has amazing characters, Dazed and Confused does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The High Watermark of Teen-films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in high school during the late 1990s, I always wanted to watch this movie but was afraid people would automatically assume I got high were I to actually rent it. I finally watched it during my junior year with some friends who did "smoke mad reefer" and watch, you know, Cheech and Chong ad nauseum. A sucker for the 1960s and 1970s who constantly spun Pink Floyd's Meddle in his CD player, I immediately fell in love with this movie without realizing that it was, in fact, a brilliant film. Initially, I thought that my worship of Dazed and Confused revolved around my adoration of the period. The film evoked a time period that I did not know firsthand and did so convincingly. For me, at first, it was like a time machine. Then I watched it again and again and again. I noticed how well-drawn the characters were. They were, to a degree, stereotypes, but they were given depth that you don't typically find in movies about adolescents. I also noticed how, really, the narrative style didn't match what I was accustomed to. There was a plot, sort of, or maybe there were many plots. There were so many plots, in fact, that the movie appears plot less. That blew me away. I had never seen a movie that so wholeheartedly avoided a traditional narrative style. I had seen Pulp Fiction and understood non-linear narrative, but this monstrosity of plotlessness was totally foreign to me. Like Linklater's Slacker, Dazed and Confused has an anthropological fascination with a time and place and sets about recreating that time and place.Oh, and it's really funny. It doesn't surprise me that Linklater found some cross-over success with this movie. It has several good belly-laughs in addition to piquing the nostalgists' interest. If you've avoided this movie because you think it's a stoner flick or a typical teen movie in the vein of Porky's or American Pie, I heartily urge you to seek it out, especially now that Criterion is putting it out in a refurbished DVD package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused was one of those movies I saw years ago in bits and pieces on TV. At the time I was in my younger teens, and my first thoughts were "geez, these seniors are really cruel dudes" and I turned it off and watched something else. But recently I watched it again, only this time it was put on in the beginning stages of a party at a friends, where essentially there was the same mood as in the film which made it more enjoyable (this, and that my friends had a drinking game that whenever Affleck of McConaughey came up on the screen someone had to chug a beer, but that's obviously besides the point). But while watching it again I realized that what Linklater did was something like Cheech and Chong did with their films or Kevin Smith did with Mallrats, and so on... but then given that cool ensemble atmosphere of an Altman pic. His film is for people just like in the movie, those who are going through the rites and passages of adolescence, and that can either make people feel pity for the characters, or humor. Bottom line, Dazed and Confused does the one day, one night time capsule bit to as far as it can go, and it's a very entertaining like that- that, plus a fantastic set of 70's songs...speaking of which, no one should complain that the title track from Zep isn't on the soundtrack since they nearly never give license for their songs to be in movies (the only exceptions I can think of are Small Soldiers which had Communication Breakdown, and Almost Famous which had a few songs, but was only because of Zep's friendship with Crowe)...and this all being said, it becomes a little more compulsively watchable on repeat viewings; perhaps making it Linklater's most accessible film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie hit home for me as I graduated "high" school in 1977, a very realistic portrayal of the aimless partying we used to engage in, and boy I miss those days, just cruisin' with a bud and my buds and smoking some buds. A bit overzealous on the whole "jocks vs. freaks" motif, but nobody's perfect. Would have been nice to include some Yes, Led Zep, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and the real Pink Floyd on the soundtrack for historical accuracy. I think everything is always about me, but this movie was the closest thing to an autobiographical portrayal of my high school years, and I don't even know Mr. Linklater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film about the last day of school. This film is too realistic for the writer to just make it up. Sure some of the stuff could be spiced up and some of the character could be merged, but the comments and events remind me of a good story I heared form some friends while we go camping. The freshie day, and the high school jerk etc make this story one of the best. It is directed so well you get the feel you where there, and the script make one under stand what's in the minds of these people. I bet the writer was the chacater Mike in the movie, just call it a wild guess, but it makes sence. I will not ruin the story, but if you love pranks, funny coments, and crazy people you gotta see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film and a total blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused simply and delightfully tells the story of the last day of school in a Texas town in 1976. It has no plot, but that isn't the point. Its point is to create a time and place that is chock full of memories, and a lot of fun. It gets every detail right. It gets the bicentennial celebration, the gas prices, the iron-on shirts, and even the hero's nickname right. It also get the hierarchy of the school correct as well. Nerds do not have pocket protectors, not all football players are ass holes, and not everybody wants to have sex. What we get is a funny, enjoyable, richly observed day in the life of Texas high school teens. The performances are great (many of the young actors have become famous since the movie's release), the dialogue is fully realized, and the soundtrack could put a grin on even the dourest member of that generation. What makes this film wonderful is the appreciation of the moment that writer/director Richard Linklater shows us. We feel like we are watching life as it actually happens, full of spontaneity, as opposed to the manufactured, plot-driven events and dialogue that most movies give us. That means we care about these characters, and as importantly, we are there with them, experiencing life on a hazy day in May where there might or might not be a kegger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's my opinion to vote this 'movie' as excellent, because of the state I was in, while watching it. You can feel like you're 15,16 or 17 again. And all your memories, thoughts,dreams and expectations from this time can suddenly come back to your mind, while you're surprisingly realizing that you've already started to cry. You remember the freshest breath of air,the mysterious taste of your first cigarette,the pain in your heart, the time you get fascinated by someone's eyes maybe..And mostly, the things that once you had or experienced; friendship,humor,surprises,the first hardly-made-decisions,funny and hard times together at the same time,your first big crush,and the music you were listening, the meaning of beer(and how it has changed).. Richard Linklater's decision is 1976,for the story to take place in.I think there can be no certain time for it.I think that day is timeless and for everyone to remember.That's why it's so special and excellent; unique and common,to experience once again the time that never come back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this movie again for the first time in a decade.... it is holding up fairly well over time, despite the numerous imitations (TV and otherwise) that this film (which is, itself, an imitation of Lucas' "American Grafitti") has inspired. Millia Jovavich makes an early appearance, as do several other future stars and would-be stars. The story is a slice of life type thing, which seems to come naturally to Linklater. Unlike Lucas' film, this one also focuses to some extent on female characters, and also doesn't force us to reconcile our own experiences of adolescence with the picture of a group of friends that happens to include one person from each social group... in Linklater's 70s nostalgia trip, the losers definitely hang with the losers and the jocks with the jocks.Funny, not overly sentimental, not particularly distinguished, but a good film to laugh and enjoy an evening with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Linklater takes a journey down memory lane with a trip to 1976, the last day of School. Nothing too deep as we follow a bunch of students out to have a good time in their own little way. With films like these, you expect the growing up pains and all that other teenage angst. But Linklater shows it how it really was and how I remembered it to be; with the simple things in life, like drugs, booze, love and just hanging out with the guys that made it fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(-_- ) zzZZzzZZ.... It's sad that it comes as a tired and uninspired FLICK from a good Director....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's bad enough that they ripped off a Led Zep song for the title, and what is worse is that the conversations are tired and boring. If you want to watch a "feel good" or funny movie, check out Clerks or the 40 year old Virgin. I guess that i am just warning you not to see such an overdone flick that really is not worth your time. On the OTHERHAND, if you liked this movie after watching it, good for you; frankly i did not see anything worth ranting about which explains my dread for this flick. Just about the only excuse to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the following: Jason London, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, and Ben Affleck. I tried to like it since i am a fan of Joey Loren Adams. This is one of those early films for a lot of these rising stars. I don't know what funny or interesting is according to this film. These are some of the events and themes featured that are supposed to be interesting: "Stoners" that emit a sense of pride as if they were some kind of elite. Fraternity style initiations with paddles, ketchup, and crappy "mean" acting (the initiations are not even believable; i mean who the hell runs around with a colored kiddie looking paddle?!). High school queer looking freshmen trying to be mature by talking about the "babes" of the campus. A football player struggling in terms of submitting to his coach or not (come on as if any hard working varsity players would think of quitting the team for pot sessions...). More of the stupid freshmen trying to fit in (character development for the least important....). With all of the little details that the film could do with out, the entire package just gives a sense of "i-am-running-out-of-ideas-about-where to-go-with-my-characters" kind of feel. I just don't know, the whole flick is trite and cliché that it's really nothing special. Coming from the acclaimed Richard L. i am utterly disappointed. I know that this director can handle a simple and yet beautiful movie that excels due to the conversations of the characters as seen in "Before Sunset" (2004) and "Before Sunrise" (1995). I know that Before Sunset and the latter is of a totally different genre but its an example of how the dialogue can carry the movie and make it extraordinary. Dazed and Confused relies heavily on what it characters say, which is to say not much and not at all inspired.Save yourself the time and pass on this one. I guess I also hate this a little bit too much since it has Ben Affleck in it (his acting never got better than this; so haha...). But hey, just to neutralize my last gripe, there is a film that i love with Ben A. directly and indirectly involved......... Yep its "Goodwill Hunting" (thanks to Ben A. for that one!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful, nostalgic coming-of-age Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High school was the period of some of most memorable and exciting days of my life, a long four years I may never forget. Every once in awhile it is fun looking back at the good old days as a teenager when life was more care-free and with less responsibilities, endless days of cruising around in old sports cars and hanging out with friends like their was no tomorrow; except for me those days were in more recent years. Director Richard Linklater paints a fun and astonishingly realistic picture of the teenage social life and suburban culture back in the 1970s following the age of the hippies and beatniks, an endearing coming-of-age comedy filled with a classic rock soundtrack and retro-style dialogue. Set in 1976 in a small town in Texas, this film centers a large cast of high school teenagers on their last day of school as they escape into the streets cruising around in their convertibles, blasting rock music on their radios, drinking booze, smoking pot, and navigating through the uncertainties of their future. With young eighth graders exiting middle school as incoming high school freshman, the seniors engage in foolish antic involving hazing the young freshman by pinning them against the wall and spanking them with paddles as some form of fraternity-like initiation. Featuring an ensemble cast of before-fame actors including Jason London, Rory Cochrane, Sasha Jensen, Shawn Andrews, Milla Jovovich, Adam Goldberg, Wiley Wiggens, Matthew McConaughey, Marisa Ribisi, Ben Affleck, and several more; this coming-of-age period piece lets audience in on a ride of laughter and deep nostalgia.With Richard Linklater working behind the camera, it's clear that this movie doesn't go for a straightforward narrative, something like a guy trying to win a girl's heart or a group of friends forming a pack to lose their virginity. And the good news is -- it doesn't need to. Instead, it journeys you on an adventure of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll with a wide variety of characters you quickly come to know, love, and possibly even relate to. The cast brings plenty of humor and charm to the screen, and display fair amount of chemistry with each other. By the end, the movie leaves you with not all whole lot other than message saying "Yep, those were the good ole days", especially for those you remember those days and nights of getting stoned, drinking booze, blasting music by artists like KISS, Foghat, Alice Cooper, Led Zeppelin, Lynard Skynard, or any other popular band of the era. Even if you are not someone who was old enough to have grown up during these times, it's still enjoyable to spend 102 minutes not just watching the characters but simply hanging out with them as if you were joining them on their wild night. And by many means, these characters are quite entertaining. Matthew McConaughey (Alright! Alright! Alright!) is quite charming as the slacker twenty-something year old who's a couple of years passed his high school graduation, but still has fun associating with high schoolers. Ben Affleck also makes a darkly funny appearance as a high school bully repeating his senior year and finding joy in hazing on underclassmen. Yeah, he's mean, but he's still fun to watch.Dazed and Confused is a delightful, endearing coming-of-age classic full of laughs, charm, and an utter sense of nostalgia from beginning to end. This movie is by far one of the most unforgettable teen flicks that is destined to please to not just teens but anyone who's cherishes on revisiting the good old days of high school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither Dazed nor Confused: a Passive Ride through a Much-Praised Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 45 minutes into Dazed and Confused, I realized "I've seen this movie before. It was called American Graffiti, and it was actually made in the 1970s". Both are nostalgia pieces that center around the wild and crazy last days of several high school kids before entering the adult world. Both films embody their respective decades (the 60s and 70s) through cool clothes, custom cars, and kickin' soundtracks. George Lucas and Richard Linklater weaved aimless films out of cruising, chicks, and drugs/booze. The latter simply lacked the elements that make aimless films interesting to me: 1. Visual style: most shots are flat-looking and come off as long reels of footage that still need to be molded into an actual film. I understand that it's the desired aesthetic, but it's underwhelming without the support of a plot or...2. Interesting characters: I'll be fair and say that some characters interested me here and there, but the only consistently charismatic (or memorable) character was Matthew McConaughey. Had the whole film centered around him, the film might have kept my interest. He's the mid-20s burnout that still parties with teenagers and hits on high school girls. Exploring his character would be depressing, but it would show that every teenager will get older and there should be a life beyond just hanging out. 3. A point: Many reviews assert that a movie like this doesn't need a point. And, I would agree... if the above-mentioned aspects were stronger. A lot of the film is vague pothead rambling about not conforming to "The System" while other meandering films like Nashville and Easy Rider reflected the attitudes of a time and place. Easy Rider also revolved around the central idea that people resent and fear those who truly live a life of freedom. Many reviews talk about the film perfectly capturing youth in the 70s. I'm sure a film set during my teen years will make me say the same thing someday. Until then, films whose only insight is "Gee, weren't the (insert decade) great?" will only feel shallow. Since Dazed and Confused, Richard Linklater has made better films with more humor, intriguing characters, and stronger visual direction (see: Bernie or A Scanner Darkly). I don't disdain others for liking this movie, but holding it as one of Linklater's best is frustrating. And yet, I have almost no strong feelings about the movie itself. An hour and 40 minutes went by. The credits rolled, and then I checked it off my movie list without a lingering thought. But, when I express my lukewarm opinion to movie buffs, I suddenly have to go out of my way to defend a review that boils down to "meh".Additional note: it's not inherently wrong to put hazing in movies. However, it is bizarre and uncomfortable when it's highlighted so frequently in a film with such warm, nostalgic overtones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit overrated, but still decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're expecting a terrific review, or expecting me to tear this film to shreds, then stop reading it right now, and go do something more worthwhile. Right off the bat, I REALLY wanted to REALLY like this film in spades, maybe because I caught a few minutes of it about 20 years ago at a friend's house, or maybe because I'm a fan of most stuff late 70's, especially the great music and cool cars. I can "almost" relate to the beer parties in the woods in my youth, mainly because my beer party heyday was around 1986, even though this film revolves around 1976. As I do in many reviews, I like to get the bad out of the way; in this case, the very bad being Wiley Wiggins(Mitch)and Christin Hinojosa(Sabrina), as I found them both boring characters, and poor actors. Check out their lack of other acting gigs to confirm my complaint about them. That's the worst of my ambivalence towards this film. I also thought it lacked a central character, as kids seemed to wander in and out of scenes for no particular reason with nothing special to do, there's barely a plot, added with mediocre character development. What saved the film from itself is the fine depiction of the beer party in the woods, which makes this film "almost good", to be kind. I was involved in the same type of parties, although less glamorous, around 1986 or so, so it touched a soft spot for me. During these scenes, we get some real teen angst, such as tension between characters Mike, Clint, Pink, Jodi, and Benny. Ted Nugent's "Stranglehold" really worked for me during these scenes, as it was my favorite song for this film. I needed a bit more drama though, and wish there were more scenes like these, but that's not the case. In closing, would I recommend this to a friend? No, I wouldn't. If, however, someone's interested in that time period, and can relate to some of the characters, then I guess it may or may not mean more to them than it did me. If I saw this film without reading the hype, then maybe I'd like it better, so perhaps my expectations were a bit high to begin with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused (1993): Dir: Richard Linklater / Cast: Jason London, Matthew McConaughey, Joey Lauren Adams, Willy Wiggins, Ben Affleck: Observant look into the decisions of teenagers. They are seen here as dazed and confused as to how to direct their futures. Set in 1976 during final classes where senior students scout about for freshmen to paddle. At night they search for the big beer bust while analyzing possible career goals. Loud music, drugs and sex prelude the dawning venture home. Observant directing by Richard Linklater who previously made Slacker. Jason London wrestles with decisions but feels that he may be making them for someone else as oppose to looking into his own needs and desires. Matthew McConaughey plays an older guy who considers high school his high point. Joey Lauren Adams is featured among the female cast. Willy Wiggins plays a freshmen victimized by senior students but ultimately in a drunken daze as dawn creeps upon them and home is a place of consequence. Ben Affleck plays a bully who uses massive paddles on the freshmen. It is very similar to American Graffiti but the one exception is that George Lucas's film contained a sense of resolution where Linklater's film deems to highlight the adolescent behaviour to greater extremes. At any rate it deals strongly with acceptance and decisions to come. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate party movie -- loud, crude, socially irresponsible and totally irresistible. See it with a Bud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the last day of the school year in 1976, and everyone's ready for a party. First, however, the incoming freshmen students must go through bizarre initiation rituals organised by the soon-to-be- seniors, while everyone does their best to get stoned or get laid. Despite some gags which use the benefit of hindsight too much for their own good, this is a smart piece of filmmaking which suggests Linklater is already one of the more formidable talents of the 90s. Tracking 18 hours in the lives of a bunch of high school juniors and incoming freshmen as they quit school and prepare for a party that evening, it jumps around between different characters (the Stoner, the Jock, the Intellectual, the Cool Guy) and events - including some truly horrific high school initiation rituals - to give an impressionistic account of what it was really like to be a 70s American suburban teen. Its approach is mosaic and non-linear, exactly like Slacker, but whereas that first film was devoted to the excavation of a number of tiny obsessions, this attempts to archive a whole culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazed and Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is one of those movies that perfectly captures the essence of a bygone era. The 70s, in my opinion, were some of the greatest years in human history - unfortunately I was not around to see them. It is because of this that I did not experience the nostalgia that an older person may experience. I knew that I would not feel nostalgic going into the movie, so this did not bother nor surprise me. I thought that luckily I would have the plot and characters to be entertained by. I was wrong. Perhaps I'm being harsh here, but there was no plot. Three acts in a story does not constitute a 'beginning', 'middle' and 'end'.As for the characters...I just didn't like or relate to ANY of the characters in the movie (except maybe the one with the spectacles). I have never been whacked on the buttocks by a paddle, got laid, smoked pot or been to a 'party', so I had absolutely no connection to any of the characters whatsoever. I do have to give the movie credit, however, for accurately portraying a bunch of complete idiots. The people portrayed in this movie are people that I would willingly have no affiliation with in real life, so you can probably understand why I loathed them. At the start of the movie, they just irritated me, but by about two-thirds in, I just didn't care anymore. I mean, who gives an Oompa Loompa's anus whom is going out with whom? Or who gets on the football team? WHO CARES?! Okay, I can understand that there are people out there who have experienced the things portrayed in this movie, but for a movie to present itself solely as a flipping time capsule is just plain selfish. Movies such as Donnie Darko, The Breakfast Club, even Back to the Future are able to provide nostalgia but at the same time provide a rich, compelling story with interesting characters and innovative directing. Seeing a bunch of American teenagers act like tossers for an entire night is not fun, it is not nostalgic, it is not thought-provoking. The only scene in the whole movie that was REALLY any good was at the end when the main character stands up to the football coach by refusing to sign the paper. That was nice! That was actually a good scene, and it made the point it was trying to make very, very well.Once again I credit the movie for the accurate portrayal of complete morons - seriously, I was utterly convinced. The script was dead-on in its depiction of a bunch of idiots trying to seem 'edgy' by smoking weed. I must admit I did laugh at some of the dialogue as well (the George Washington conspiracy theory was particularly amusing). Still, this movie did absolutely nothing for me. It was a vapid, empty, soulless experience. I mildly enjoyed the experience of being taken to another setting, but when that setting is inhabited by mindless idiots it is a little hard to have a good time. The soundtrack, yes, was excellent. But a good film does a pleasant soundtrack not make. I could just go on the internet and listen to a bunch of these 70s hits (isn't it funny how it was only future well-known songs they played back in 1976), and that way I don't need to have good music accompanied by the asinine antics of a group of quasi-rebellious cretins.Richard Linklater has done well in presenting us with a portrayal of life as an American dunderhead (pleonasm), but when in doing so he is insulting anybody that wasn't alive then, considering he has provided them with no plot or innovative direction for them to enjoy, it is a right pain; why should I enjoy your film, Mr Linklater, if you do not give two single shinkansens whether I do or not? Okay, you didn't make it for me, I get it! And I must commend you on your ability to express yourself without caring what other people think - but don't for ONE SECOND think you can get away with transporting us to another time without giving us something decent to work with!</fullReview>

My only problem with the film was the supporting cast, but it's still okay. Some of the dialog could be better. The film is difficult to call enjoyable, but the acting is effective. This is the kind of film that tries to prove that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one.

		<shortDescription>Wish I Could Have Loved It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that I have heard a lot about, and as a fan of the "coming of age" and "high school" genres of films, I needed to check it out. The issue was, I was kind of disappointed. I think my biggest issue was that I just didn't find it all that funny. Sure, it has it's moments, but compared to other comedy films with this topic, I laughed a lot less. I know a lot of the comedy is more subtle, but I just don't think there's enough of it.The biggest strength of this film is its general realism concerning teenage life and people involved in that world. The characters all feel like real people you would meet and not you're typical unoriginal characters like the nerd or the jock. It also handles a few topics such as conformity and wanting to be free, which are always on the mind of teenagers. But the issue is that I feel like these topics are more handled towards the end and should have been more prevalent throughout. Many performances are great too, a big stand out being Matthew McConaughey. Even Ben Affleck is great in this. I think that perhaps the realism to it's characters and situations will make this movie become better the more that I re-watch it.As mentioned before, my big gripe was the comedy. There just wasn't enough for me. Moments just felt flat or made me question whether I should be laughing or not. Also another issue was relating to the whole 70s setting, which while I think was extremely well done for a 90's movie, hurt my relating to the film because I wasn't even born in the 70s (although it allows for some awesome music for the soundtrack.) I personally find I can relate to John Hughes films, even if I wasn't born in the 80s, so its disappointing to not get that from this film. If John Hughes could do it, I wish Linklater could have. In my opinion, a film that is extremely similar to this film that I can relate more too and I found funnier would be Superbad. A lot of the same themes are in both films, and both are comedies, but Superbad ends up being more relatable to me. The only advantage Dazed And Confused has is that its more grounded in reality and deals with a few more though provoking themes that Superbad, a very goofy and sometimes slapstick kind of film, doesn't really have going on.In my opinion, I understand why this film is well known. I just didn't get the experience that I wanted to get. I watch Superbad or The Breakfast Club and i'm able to laugh and relate, and I just didn't get that as much here. I do hope that I am able to watch this again in the future and have it grow on me, because I have this feeling that it needs repeated viewing to fully be appreciated.</fullReview>

The film isn't bad, but it all succeeds or fails on whether or no you connect with it on a nostalgic, emotional level, and I didn't. I guess in some way I still enjoyed it, some really good scenes, but the narrative and characters just didn't manage to captivate me as much as I wanted and as much as I thought they would. I've seen the love for the film, and I sadly don't get it. As far as Linklater's best films go, it doesn't touch the Before trilogy. I still recommend it though, I'm sure the film will speak to some a lot more than it did to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Party Never Ends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the thing about movies, man, no matter how many times I watch them they stay the exact same. Alright, alright, alright, it's the beginning of summer for me so that can only mean one thing. I watched Dazed and Confused. The year is 1976 and it is the first day of summer. Seniors abuse freshman and then go party. This is the story of one wild and crazy night from many different perspectives. This was a classic and it is timeless. There is everything in this movie from stoners to nerds to jocks to normal people. You get a sense of what high school was like back in the day. The main characters are Pink, the senior quarterback, and Mitch the upcoming freshman. There a lot of other lovable characters like the creepy Matthew McConaughey , the big bully Ben Affleck, and everything in-between. Pink is pressured from coaches to sign a waiver for next year's season and he doesn't know what he wants to do. This is a subtle problem that carries throughout the entire movie, which adds a spice to the movie. Mitch struggles with the annual beating from the seniors but soon comes to his own and finds out what high school is all about. The high school atmosphere in the 70s was incredible, I almost wish I was 18 back then. The stuff these kids got away with. The way they acted in school on the last day with the smoking weed outside and throwing papers everywhere. The group of guys is driving and take trash barrels and destroy mail boxes. Something like that would never happen today. The most disturbing scene was the hazing of the freshman girls. They poured ketchup and mustard on them and made them all gross. Hazing is a terrible thing but at least the movie made it funny. It is weird how they can abuse them one second and then a few hours later they are parrying with the girls they abused. The 70s was a weird decade. The 70s was a messed up decade but it did have killer music. Every scene had a perfect editing of music. Everything from Zeppelin to Ozzy to Kansas. The school bell rings and Alice Cooper's Schools Out blares and it was picture perfect. Music makes a movie, I say it all the time, music makes the movie, and the music made this movie. There was no original score, which is a little strange, but I knew every song they played and I love that kind of music so it made me very happy.My favorite character was the biggest stoner I have ever seen on the big screen. I forget his name but he has the long hair and the backwards cap and he is high in very scene. He speaks complete nonsense about the founding fathers and the cosmos and it is hilarious. It is between him and the Jewish guy from Saving Private Ryan. He plays a nerd who rambles on and on. Sometimes he makes sense and sometimes you just want him to shut up. His character has a lot of development and his group of friends is entertaining. So let's break this movie down. The plot is fantastic, the scenes themselves are well put together and there is really no boring part. There are a lot of characters so it can be a little difficult to follow but all are unique and mesh together perfectly. The acting wasn't remarkable but for the purpose of the movie it worked. The movie isn't really about the story or the deep emotions of the characters. It is strictly about the crazy antics of high school seniors. It is a night we all wish we could have. There are a few reality checks and unbelievable moments but overall a lot of fun. There isn't really much more that can be said about this movie other than it is a movie you need to see if you haven't. Overall, Dazed and Confused is timeless fun that can be enjoyed by anyone. It shows the ease of summer and in a way defined a decade. The music was great, the story was good enough, the acting was fine, it was funny, touching, and a lot of fun. I love this movie and I can see it anywhere, anytime. This is a great movie to see with friends, it is probably better with friends and is also a good background movie at party of something. I suggest you don't look into this movie too much but rather enjoy it for what it is, mindless fun. Dazed and Confused gets the WillyT Honorable Mention., so go watch it and enjoy and remember the days of drinking as a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Bitter-Sweet days!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Sunset I was moved and looked up his other movies and this title caught my attention. I got it and saw it recently. The plot is one which we all can connect with, which is the last day of school (probably not the part where all the drinking and smoking, getting wasted, laid happens).The craziness, rawness, carelessness of youth at that point of time is displayed on screen with much clarity. The dialogs are well written. The characters are all unique and have all performed well. We can connect to each of the character in the movie. Some are nerds, discussing deep, philosophical matters, theories, etc, who are decent and less violent as compared to the other groups. Some are violent, rash, rude and have all those character traits of a person, our parents warn us to stay away from. They make a joke of authority, care least about their own future and get involved in drugs, smoking, drinking etc.There's a line by a character in the movie which goes something on the lines of "if life's so short then we should enjoy it to the maximum while we are alive". Some kids take it too seriously and ruin their lives. I almost felt like talking to these kids and telling them its not the way of life, and that they are wasting their lives' best days. But then they would scoff at any such idea which stops them from enjoying.Some parts are very funny. Whenever Slater comes on screen, its hilarious. And there are parts where we can see how vulnerable some of the characters are to find someone to fall in love with. There is some great sound tracks running in the background which sets the mood for the 70's. Some great dialogs too.There is no conclusion shown but that bitter-sweet period is captured brilliantly. I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but feels somewhat incomplete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film.. it's just a glimpse of life. It's very different from Linklater's other films in that it's quite standard in its look and feel, but the inner substance is still richer than your average film.However, like his other films, the plot meanders a little and leaves you feeling a bit empty handed. The movie ends and you wonder "what was that all about?" "what was he trying to tell me?". In the end, probably nothing. It is like some sort of idealistic reflection of teenage life. Very very idealistic in my opinion. But it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, as if he collected the things you miss the most and placed them into one film.Overall, very enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond comedy- a movie for the ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say "Dazed and Confused" is probably my favorite 'coming of age' movie besides the quintessential and BEST movie of this type, "Stand By Me." A hidden gem and highly underrated, this sleeper came out and I remember all the stoners (including me) loved it for one reason- it made us laugh our asses off while we were...having fun. But revisiting it years later (and NOT stoned) I found a truly inspired and humble tribute to life in the 1970's. The cars were real, the music rocked, the chicks were cool and the parties went all night long.I don't know what exactly it is about this movie that I love so much. Maybe it's the fact that it never gets TOO serious, but it definitely moves you. Maybe it's the overall feel of the film; it's got a good heart. It's funny, but never stupid. It's patriotic, but it's not in your face about it. It's just cool. And of course there's Matthew McConahey's character; one of my favorites in any movie EVER.I highly highly recommend this movie. 10 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie back in 1993, a friend I worked with told me about the movie and told me it was excellent. I took a chance a rented it, and believe me it didn't disappoint. This movie about high school life in the mid-1970's, sex, drugs and rock-n-roll. I was young at the time, but my cousin was of high school age and Marijuana was everywhere at that time. I don't know if the magazine High Times was still around at that time or not. I was in grade school, but if you were of high school age it was a good bet you TOKED. This movie didn't have much of a plot, but it didn't have too, the title said it all. The last day of high-school in Texas and it's party-time. I don't know if they really had high-school hazing back then or not, but it makes you wonder. I did see the scene of students making paddles in shop, and my cousin made one when he was in high-school. I never thought this movie was pro drug use, but I viewed it as a film about high-school life in the mid-70's and the carefree style back then. This movie is a great movie to rent/own, for anyone who went to school in the 70's this one is for you.Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie about growing up and moving on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1976 and it is the last day of high school. This movie follows a group of people through this day and into the night where they have a big party celebrating them finishing school. There are two groups in this movie, those who have finished junior high and those who have finished senior high. Thus this movie takes on the theme of growing up and entering a new phase of life. The freshmen are initiated into senior high and this is done by those who are finishing senior high. The freshmen look towards high school and what that will bring while the seniors look to college and real life.There is nothing special about 1976. Watergate and Vietnam are over and America is settling into a pleasant year. This movie looks at the culture of America in relation to school students. It is not a movie where television dominates but rather where we see a society relating with each other as they graduate into adulthood. It is a movie of relationships between people, especially between freshmen and seniors. In one way they are kept apart by their seniority, but in two circumstances we have a freshmen becoming involved in a relationship with a senior. In one way there is a division but this division is broken through with these relationships.This movie seems to attack American culture though. The attacks are strong but it creates a barbaric side to them. With the seniors making bats to whack freshmen, and then chasing and smacking them with the bats, it seems to very barbaric. The girls are a little more civilised in their initiations, but once again it creates an order of authority.It is reaction against this authority that this film really addresses. The Senior guys' fun is undermined by clever freshmen, and when one of the senior girls addresses a freshmen girl, she ignores her. The main thrust is through the contract that the coach is forcing the football players to sign, that is to give up enjoyment for sport, which is something that the footballers are not willing to do. They are thus encouraged to throw their lives away so that they may seize the day.This also runs through the movie, there is no point to look to the future because if we strive for the future we miss out on the day. It is a movie which supports generation-X philosophy. Live for the day for we don't know what tomorrow will bring. This I do not support this though for if we live for the day, we affect tomorrow. We have limited control of our destiny and when we look back we may realise how much we have wasted. If we live for today and forget about tomorrow, when tomorrow finally comes, we suddenly realise that we have missed out. We have a choice now, do will go our own way and enjoy ourself, or do we look for the future and make decisions that will secure our future?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comedy and nostalgia piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dazed and Confused" is "American Graffiti" set in the 1970s. And why not? A movie about teenagers having a fun summer night out cruising and getting into trouble, set to a non-stop pop soundtrack of the times... it's instant nostalgia and works very well."Dazed and Confused" lacks the character depth of its early-1960s-set counterpart and has even less of a coherent plot - nearly all that happens is a bunch of teenagers have a wild night out, some are making the transition to high school, some are making the transition away from it. What "Dazed" lacks in conventional plot or deep characters it makes up for with great humor and a few central characters who are very well-realized.For the most part though, this movie is an idealized night from "back in the day" caught on film. It doesn't have to be the 1970s, the themes in this movie are universal teenager stuff, as well they should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun look back at a forgotten time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is a movie set in Austin, Tx in 1976,showing some of the activities of the teen world from that era. Having graduated in 1976, I really enjoyed this movie a lot and thought the producers really captured the trends and music from that year. Another thing that I thought was interesting was the fact that the movie was set in Austin, Tx in 1976, the same year, and town that one of the stars of the movie (Wiley Wiggins)was born. The only part of the movie that I didn't agree with was Ben Affleck's part of carrying around that dumb paddle,I really don't remember that happening back then. The movie never stalled and for those of us from that time you were able to relate to almost all of the characters in the film. Summing this movie up, it was a nice trip down memory lane, and one that I would recommend to my friends for a good time and a look back at a time when the only problem teenagers had was finding a place to have a party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent characterizations hampered by lame subplot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Dazed and Confused, Richard Linklater applies the free floating, wandering narrative style that he had previously used to great effect in 1991's Slacker to a high school (and related night life) 1970s setting. Although the earlier scenes, which mostly involve incoming high school freshman mercilessly degraded-both physically and mentally- by older students in plain view of adults, are both comparatively ineffective and exceedingly unlikely, the film still manages to capture the characters' juvenile feelings of uncertainty about the future mixed with youth's na?ve optimism and reckless hedonism. The strength of Dazed and Confused is that it focuses on creating complex, fully realized characters instead of the usual pop culture clichés of stock characters like jocks and nerds. Unfortunately, Linklater creates what can only be an unintentional juxtaposition within his own material since the early day scenes are too focused on the unrealistic initiation rites to gel well with the carefully observed character interactions of the night scenes.Dazed and Confused is known for its use of classic rock songs that first became popular during the '70s but these songs aren't just present to give the film period authenticity; in a rather blunt way they pull the viewer into the action of the film. Their (mostly) juvenile lyrics also suggest the simplistic attitudes even the most intelligent youths are sometimes drawn to. Still, the music suffers from nearly always being non-diegetic and a bit overused.The technical execution is above average; the editing is really the stand out aspect as the film flows well and there's a certain logic in the way unrelated scenes follow one another. Here again the strength is in the later parts of the film as the fight scene is surprisingly visceral and the very last scene with its sweeping crane shot and view of a wide open road of possibility is the perfect ending of a film about people going through one of life's major transitions. The acting is also universally excellent; I saw a few familiar faces who built careers on the foundation of their performances here and a few others (especially Jason London as Pink) who I'm surprised didn't manage to become household names after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moment In Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this film three or four times and have found it delightful each time. Like many other reviewers, this was my time also (class of 75'). The first interesting observation I had was on second viewing realizing that the movie was set in Texas. I suspect many viewers thought it was set in California. It really doesn't matter. This film is spot on it's time and subject. While the music and rituals can be quibbled with on the margins, the filmmaker has captured the essence of what the high school experience was at that time. This is really not a movie about historical facts of it's time. In fact, once the date is established at the start of the film, there are virtually no references to the time this movie depicts. It's just a slice of life at that time. Simple, true and well studied.Having lived this film I can tell you that most of my friends thought we were living the decade that would have absolutely have no identity. The music alone shows how much we underestimated that time. This little time capsule shares all the special flavors of the 70s that younger generations may not have a feel for.Dazed and Confused is a treasure of glimpses of a specific time that also reminds all viewers that high school kids really haven't changed all that much!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you can watch 1,000 times and still be entertained. It's great when you are young and thinking about what highschool might be like (even though highschool today is a lot different then it was back then), but it also is good to watch and think back to your own highschool days. So basically this movie is perfect no matter what age you are. You'll be quoting this movie right after you watch it and years to come after that. Doesn't get a perfect rating because I don't really like the lead in it. He's okay, but looks like a girl that I know....and since he's a dude it's kind of off putting.</fullReview>

Every time I watch this movie it immediately takes me back to those days of innocence before P-tests and drug task force agents wandering the halls of high schools cutting open lockers doing their search trips and it was so easy to go out and have fun and not be politically correct and stuck in the garbage we now call modern civilization. Those were truly the times of memories back then it didn't matter what clothes you wore or what brand or what car you drove hell if you had 4 wheels that run and you had a DL man you was cool .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to like about this movie? This has to be the most realistic yet enjoyable teenage movies of all time. It really brings back a lot of memories for me which shows just how real it is. This is a typical teenager's journey through life brought to the screen full of life, humor and spirit. While never taking itself too seriously, it seeks to show both young and old alike the joys and pitfalls of growing up in America. While it would be great to go back to our youth knowing what we know now, the first trip down the road of life is the best. This movie makes me feel young again, and that's the best credit I can give it. I'm afraid today's teens with their cell phones, internet and video games will miss out on these experiences altogether. I think the '70s were a unique time to live when the world was new, and I'm so glad I made this journey in my life. There is a living spirit in this movie like no other. The music soundtrack itself has spawned two CDs, which I highly (no pun intended) recommend. As one of the tracks says, 'School's out forever', but if you want to relive those days, this movie is for you. Good times indeed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I was born the year this film came out, so I never personally experienced the seventies. Man I would kill to have been 16 then instead of now. This movie is fabulous. Every single actor and actress does a great job. My favorite performances were Matthew McConaughey as the Peter Pan-ish Wooderson, Jason London as the cool but really nice Pink, Shawn Andrews as the mellow Pickford, and, best of all, Rory Cochrane as the stoner hippie Slater (one of my favorite film characters of all time, he steals every scene). This movie was so funny and also extremely realistic. I am quite nostalgic for the seventies, even though I was not there. I loved the fashions in the film, and also the freedom that the kids enjoyed, which my generation simply does not have. If I had a time machine, this is the period I would go back to and want to live in. Last of all, this is one of the greatest movie soundtracks of all time. And the funniest part is I am going to an Aerosmith/ ZZ Top concert in two weeks. See this movie! you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other of the reviewers, this movie brought back tremendous nostalgia, both sad and funny of my high school days in the mid seventies. We drank beer and we got high, none of us had a clue what we wanted to do in life, other than have a good time for right now. The director casted many characters with many overlapping story lines, but somehow you got to know each of them. There was the stoner who you couldn't help but like, even though you worried what would become of him. There was the star jock, who was losing interest in sports as he became more interested in girls and partying. There were the smart kids who knew and articulated what was going on, and you sort of resented them for it.All in all, I wasn't sure what the point of the movie was. Except that it was just like the seventies. Nobody cared. Get me another beer. Light up another joint. Put in another eight-track. Lets have fun tonight. Yet I couldn't help but feel that I would never, ever want our kids to live the way we did when we were young. It's amazing so many of us made it all the way to 2008.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, yep, yep... that's how it was back then. This is THE movie for anyone who went to high school in the seventies, say from 1974 - '79, if you're looking for some nostalgic trip back to your high school years. And also, anyone curious about those years, say to compare to your high school years in the eighties. Director Linklater put together a super cast, most of whom went on to at least fine character role careers. Hauser, here as the charismatic Benny (also a bigot in a deleted scene) is only now attempting to jump start a leading man career. We all know what Affleck &amp; McConaughey went on to (lousy leading man careers). Both play creeps in this pic, and these remain possibly their best roles - something of a revelation now. Jovovich &amp; Posey came close to being big time starlets years later. Cochrane &amp; Goldberg provide most of the biting humor, as they would continue to do in other films. London, in the central BMoC role, enjoyed a girlish fan following for several years. One exception is Sasha Jenson, for some reason, who sort of disappeared, despite a standout performance. This film has developed into the "American Graffiti" for the seventies grunge generation and has by now attained near-classic status.The pic captures the aimlessness, the grungy feel of the teenagers back then. This was at a time when many parents were pursuing their own interests, whether at work or play, mostly leaving the kids to their own devices (as opposed to previous decades, when the typical nuclear family was composed of stay-at-home moms and working dads whose focus was somehow 100% on the offspring). When some parents do appear in this film, it's almost jarring, like they don't really belong here. In the seventies, by mid-teens (15-16 yrs.old), kids were kind of expected to get drunk and stay out half the night. Oh, and smoke the weed, of course. And this was before the materialistic eighties, when American society shifted all of its focus on money and acquisition. Near the end, when London's character expresses his dissatisfaction with his current state of affairs as a football jock/king at school, you get the impression he's in for a brutal wake up call in the next decade. Then again, he might have become a stockbroker or something (oops, didn't a lot of them jump out of windows in the next few years?).It's an interesting mind game a viewer can play, guessing where all these dazed teens will end up in the eighties and onward. But, the main thrill is just immersing yourself in that time frame, which the film just oozes out of every frame. I still remember a T-Shirt I had towards the end of that decade; it read "the fifties were grease; the sixties were grass; the seventies are gross." But after the seventies, everything and everyone still managed to somehow lose their character. Go figure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linklater's best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm watching this film for the probably 10th time as i'm writing this review and i'm still absolutely in love with it. Growing up means growing confused, disguised and most directly experienced as boredom; especially in American suburbia or, to be more precise: in film versions of suburban life. The boredom in Linklater's best film and the lack of plot on the surface level both add up to something that is far more interesting than it may appear to be. Adolescence has never been (and probably will never again be) portrayed with so much love and precision. And the fact that even a 24-year-old European like myself finds himself, or rather his younger self, in this film over and over again proves that Linklater's film is nothing less than a portrayal of universal truths of the teenage soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain elements of this movie that make it worth placing high in the ranks of nostalgic movies.The lack of any huge stars of the time. Sure we can look back and see Ben Affleck (when he was actually still cool) and McConaughey, but at the time of the movie everybody was nowhere near A-List status. This lack of starpower prevents any distraction to focus on the individual actor/actress and instead allows us to focus instead on the plot and general vibe of the movie.The soundtrack. Instead of going straight for the most notable names of the 70s (Zeppelin, Stones, etc.), the soundtrack features the likes of Frampton (of course 76 was when he came alive) and Alice Cooper. Although the soundtrack may not have highlighted the absolute best music of the 70s, the songs are so appropriate and well-integrated that they augment the nostalgic aura already created by the cinematography.In the end, this movie has stood out to me as one of the great coming-of-age movies when in fact its really not a coming-of-age movie at all. It is just a chill, laid back retrospective peace at a couple of kids looking for trouble in late 70s Texas.The elements of solid acting, good cinematography, and a perfect soundtrack lead this movie to be one of the crowning examples of retrospective 70s films (***1/2 out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical Teen Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie shortly after it came out. I was 16 at the time, and it was interested seeing people in the film who were about my age, 20 years earlier. You could definitely tell this film was geared towards people who where in their teens in the mid-70's, and who have been in their mid-thirties when the film came out. They also released not one but two excellent soundtracks featuring music of the era. I wouldn't be surprised if the filmmakers made more off the soundtracks than the movie. The movie definitely is attempting to create a sense of nostalgia. The average viewer who is not from that era will likely find the movie slow and dull. Watch to see early appearances by several future stars - Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Matthew McConaughey. This is not an out-and-out comedy. There is no slapstick or gross-out humour that we typically see in teen films. Not bad. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie has one of the best soundtracks ever.all of the tracks are memorable and suit the tone of the picture.it features a good young cast before they were famous and the movie maintains interest even though it is seemingly about nothing. It simply follows the students of an American high school as they party,do drugs,drive around,fight and go through their high school traditions on the last day of school.Set in the 1970s, this film is funny, occasionally insightful, sometimes tragic(Matthew McConaughey's character)and always enjoyable. i really liked this movie, and would recommend it to most.this film is especially for high school students. its better than most high school based films, particularly the modern gross out faze we are in. an excellent film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, it brought back memories galore. It took place the year I graduated from High School in May of 1976. There were some things in the movie that we did not do such as the mailbox bashing and the initiation of the freshmen class, but as far as the hanging out at the "pool hall" and listening to classic rock and the beer bash in the woods, it was all so real to me. It brought back alot of wonderful memories for me, my classmates and friends that I haven't thought about in a long time. These were days that I will never forget. I recommend anyone from this era watch this movie and you will see how I and everyone else can relate to this movie. Rock on!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily my favorite film of all time. It used to be Dogma, but after I saw this on Comedy Central I really enjoyed it and felt that it was probably the film about teenagers ever made. It's very original and funny and had a great story behind it. I am very glad that I saw this movie and bought it afterwards. I really like that there are so many characters that are involved in the story. Really goes well for probably anyone, because probably anyone would relate to it and enjoy it. It has a catching title and important story behind it, enough for everyone to enjoy. Everyone should definetely see and at first rent this movie. I would have to give it a 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching DAZED AND CONFUSED again 10 years after my initial viewing, and it got way better as an encore performance. I didn't have a clue as to who Richard Linklater and all the unknown actors were the first time around, but as many of them have gone on to various levels of stardom since '93, it was fun to see them again "in the beginning". I especially liked seeing Ben Affleck "13th billed", as he plays much better to me as an also-ran after all the tabloid hype he's subjected me to since garnering his GOOD WILL HUNTING oscar.I'm the exact age that "Pink" and his cronies were in May of '76 (just finished up my junior year of high school), and even though I grew up about 1200 miles north of Austin, TX, most of the hijinx portrayed in the film rang true. Save for the hazing, we did it all, driving endlessly around town looking for "a good time". And once the word got out that a kegger was going on, it sure didn't take long for a crowd to form in some "secret spot". Judging from some of the posts about this film, the search for "a good buzz" is still the preferred way to make it through the high school years in 2004.Hats off to Mr. Linklater, his soundtrack, and his film. So grab a "sixer", break out your stash, and check out DAZED AND CONFUSED. It's way closer to the way it was in 1976 than watching a WELCOME BACK KOTTER rerun.</fullReview>

Unfortunately such a time piece treasure might have to be rebuilt as a replica. The egg shape on a stand with the plush black lining is so 1970's, one truly feels a part of the times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen bits and pieces of Dazed on USA and other cable networks before, but had never seen the entire movie until lately. I have to say this is one of my favorite movies ever, right up there with Pulp Fiction and American Beauty. It's just a laid back, easy movie to watch. It's one of those movies you could watch over and over and it would still be cool. The thing I liked so much about this movie is that it's so real. I was in school in the 90's but a lot of it seemed very much the same. For almost every character in that movie I can think of someone from my small town high school that was just like that. Although we didn't ever do any hazing like in the movie, about everything else was accurate. Everyone would just hop in their cars on Friday nights and drive around town looking for a party or keg somewhere, and usually nothing exciting ever happened. There were the different groups just like in the movie. The intellectuals, the pot heads, the jocks, the freshmen guys who thought they ran the show. Especially accurate is the one guy who graduated a few years ago but still hangs out with the high schoolers. I also like this movie because it flows so well. You don't have a big plot, no real story at all even. Things just happen and you go with it. Very cool movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the best American films of the 1990s and one of the greatest examples of American naturalism, there can be few greater examples of a director's genuine fondness for his characters.With an ensemble cast that has rarely been equaled, you don't need to be from Texas to be reminded of your high school days and of the excitement and pressures of bein' young. The dozen or so main characters are augmented by dozens more we see only in glimpses - the annoyed girl left mid-kiss, the easy-going washed up convenience clerk, the clumsy girl who laughs at herself after a face-forward fall. Linklater has populated a world with easy-going profundity and a warmth that matches the summer of '76 portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid slice-of-life '70s comedy with no ambitions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film comedy that gave us Ben Affleck and "That 70s Show," but it's cool to like it anyway. Taking a deep-focus look at an 18-hour period in a small Texas city just before the Bicentennial summer of 1976, "Dazed And Confused" introduces us to a group of tangentially connected high schoolers and junior high schoolers. Not much happens in this film. People make pronouncements about how bored they are with everything and indulge in politically incorrect behavior (drugs, underage drinking, and [gasp] full-contact high school initiation rites). Under the benevolent eye of director Richard Linklater, no one gets hurt, and everyone has a laugh.I like the film less for its tacked-on and suspect message of personal freedom at whatever cost and more for the unhurried, character-driven narrative. We meet a ton of people in this movie, not just the dozen or so key players but some worthwhile detours like the Birkenstock-clad history teacher whose polemic take on the Fourth of July would make Joan Baez proud, the assistant coach with the linebacker grannie and the creepily creeping pair of shorts, and the out-of-it liquor store clerk who actually thinks Mitch is 18 ("Just remember to eat a green thing every day," he tells the pregnant woman, who is by the way smoking.)This film is just oozing with period detail and a real sense of "being-there." That would be okay by itself, but watching the multi-layered main characters shoot the breeze and interact with one another makes it all worth it. I don't know that I feel I went to high school with these guys, but I wish I had. They're more interesting than the crew I did graduate with.I think I have a different favorite character every time. Parker Posey has a great rant at her freshman underlings during the initiation - "Air Raid!" - and little Mitch is quietly effective even if he does roll his eyes a little too much. But Matthew McConaughey rules in this one. He may have become our generation's Richard Gere, a too-good-looking guy with too many bad films on his resume, but this one is why people thought so much of him in the first place. He's dead on funny, and totally in command, whether it's trying to pick up girls half his age or itemizing his muscle car in a war of words with the evil Clint.Definitely worth seeing, especially if you're old enough to remember the decade this was set in. And don't feel alone if you come away frm this feeling like you missed out on a lot in high school. I did, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie literally tens of times. That is an awful lot for me - once is usually enough! Hilarious comedy about high schoolers in the '70's. The movie takes place in 24 hours, from the morning of the last day of school through the nighttime celebration that ensues.Don't expect a serious film here, anyone who is tremendously critical of the film obviously was. This is a lighthearted comedy. There are some great one-liners (many of them provided by Matthew McConaughey).The creators took a fair stab at the politics of high school. It is also fun to see so many rising stars... Ben Affleck, Parker Posey, Joey Lauren Adams, &amp; Matthew McConaughey to name a few. Definitely worth watching at least once!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This entire movie took place on the last day of school in May of 1976 (when I was 6 years old). I love this movie. There is not really a plot which is the interesting thing. It's just about these dudes and dudettes that hang out. Lots of interesting things happen....such as freshmen getting PADDLED very hard by bullys. In fact, Ben Affleck plays one of the senior bullies. There is some great stuff delivered by Matthew McGonehy. I love it when he says "Say man, you got a joint?". There are other terrific lines. Don't expect much out of Milla Jojovich. She doesn't have any speaking roles. It's quite a shock considering how well she did in RESIDENT EVIL. Go get this movie NOW.

		<shortDescription>Slice of Life Filmaking at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that this movie came out ten years ago, when I myself was a senior in high school. I can't say that this film brings back any happy memories of high school, mainly because I hated my high school and the small Nebraska town I grew up in. I mention this because Dazed and Confused is enjoyable even if your own high school experience differed from the one presented here. (My own personality resembled that of Adam Goldberg's character, so you can see what I mean.)Richard Linklater seems to specialize in making films that weave several stories into one tapestry of life. The film isn't so much about one or two characters as it is about a place and time. In fact, his forays into films with more straight-forward plots have been less successful. The Newton Boys and Before Sunrise lack the vitality of Waking Life, Slacker, and especially Dazed and Confused. I am usually a sucker for ensemble films, especially those of Robert Altman, so my comments here should be taken with a grain of salt by those who haven't seen the movie. In fact, this is one of the few ensemble-type films (along with Boogie Nights) that can really come close to Altman classics like Gosford Park, Short Cuts, Nashville, and M*A*S*H*.Some scenes have an amazing realism about them that one rarely sees on the screen. There's more than one scene of girls and boys talking to each other awkwardly in ways that counteract the bland romantic platitudes one sees in mainstream films. Other scenes perfectly capture the laconic nature of those hours on a Friday spent after work or school and before the big party begins.The best part of the film, though, is its characters. The film isn't long enough to completely flesh them all out, but each has a defining characteristic that sticks with you, whether it be the stoner Slater or the quarterback Randall "Pink" Floyd.My only problems would be with some of the acting, as Wiley Wiggins shows himself to be an amateur in some of the ways he tries to communicate his dislike of O'Bannion. Of course, Ben Affleck (younger and with more weight) has the same annoying vocal ticks in this movie as he does in his later ones</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, my first response was "This is Ocala 1985". I grew up in Ocala, Fl. during the mid 80's, which is kind of like growing up in a normal town in the mid 70's. For fun(b/c there was nothing else to do) the kids at my high school would somehow get a hold of beer and/or liquor and/or Boon's farm wine and go out in the middle of the woods and get drunk. We would listen to Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and other 'classic' rock. There would always be a fight. So if you grew up in your typical small American town, rent this movie(it'd be a lot cooler if you did) and I promise that you will relate to at least one character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seventh Seal of high school movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, like a considerable portion of Richard Linklater's other movies, has almost no plot. We see a bunch of teenagers running around on the last day of school in 1974 in I believe Austin, Texas. They skip class, beat each other up, and smoke a very large amount of pot. This movie functions on several levels. It is a nostalgia piece, a lowbrow comedy, and a meditation of existence. Similar to Larry Clark's Kids, the teenagers in this movie do things which would make parents shudder. Unlike Kids, the teenagers ultimately have to surrender to their parents.  On the highest level, these teenagers are a metaphor for the human race. They go to school and party and prepare for a future that seems as though it will never come. Anything they do doesn't seem to have consequences. They, like every teenager ever, seem to know everything. Watching this movie you become absorbed and feel as though you are actually in it. This movie takes you on a journey through a june night in the south. You can't really say too much about this movie.</fullReview>

My friend squealed while rushing to get the video case. 'Oh great' I thought. Another movie that is trying to impersonate the 70's. Little did I know that after watching the movie, that I was going to talk about how great it was for more than 2 days. This movie truly is a nostalgic treat. True, I wasnt born in the 70's, so I dont know what it was like. But I have heard from a lot of adults that this movie brings back bitter-sweet memories of their past. Who knew that the last day of school before summer, could be THAT FUN!!! Parties, drugs, Beats, sweet revenge, football, school, and a couple of surprises, are all packed in this wonderful movie. I suggest that the next time you want to rent a movie that is full of hot guys in relatively tight pants, stoners, partiers, girls galore, nerds, rebels, guns etc. Rent 'Dazed and Confused.' It truly is one of a kind. And it definitely makes you want to PARTY!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure nostalgia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to high school from 1979-1982... in a real way, mine was the tail end of the generation portrayed in this film (just before MTV came on the scene and everything transitioned into the 80's). We wore a bit more modern clothes and the hairstyles were a little different, and with some newer music added to the mix (Journey, etc.), but in most ways it was the same... this is really the way it was! For 1 hr. 43 min. I sat transfixed (dazed, confused, nearly stupified) in a state of pure nostalgia. If this is what the filmmakers intended with this movie, then kudos to them, they succeeded in spades. The film really brought back a time when everything seemed full of possibilities and the future was wide open (I love that shot of the open road at the end, it's the perfect ending the movie).I never quite got past the obvious fact that the actors were all early 90's teenagers and imitating 70's teens (although I *almost* did, which is a real compliment to everyone involved, especially the director). I also agree with other reviews that the "hazing" scenes don't fit too well (this seems like more of a college thing to me than anything belonging in high school). I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, and just plugged it into the VCR on a slow sunday cuz I couldn't find anything else to watch, but came out knowing this was a film I'd be seeing again... and again. Wonderful fun for anyone of that generation, especially those who were (or aspired to be part of) the "stoner" crowd -- and an enjoyable peek into "how it was then" for everyone else, too. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is like watching your own everyday life on film. I am 15 and this movie sums up what I've been doing the past couple of years. Running over mailboxes, smoking weed, looking for a beerbust and cheating on your girlfriends. The crowds have not changed since the 70's. You have the Popular Jocks who always mess with the freshmen, the Nerdy types who also like to party, the Stoners who ALWAYS have weed, the Bitchy Conceited group who also mess with freshmen, the girls who just want to party and there are people who fit in more than one of the groups. And of course you have the older guy who still hangs out with the high school crowd. They talk about various high school stuff like tv shows(Gilligan's Island), football, and girls with real big knockers. They are always partying, racing cars and their summer "priorities" are going to Aerosmith concerts rather than signing their commitments to their football team. It is just a movie that I think everyone can relate to. Its one of my most favorite movies EVER!!!!! RENT IT, BUY IT,WHATEVER. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie captured</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went through high school in a smaller town in Canada through the EIGHTIES, and I have to say that this movie was almost like personal home-movie footage for me! My high school experience was almost identical! The completely crazy driving...the excessive substance abuse...shotgunning...the high-school euphemisms like "Slater-san" and "John Boy"...the prankster-level vandalism (i.e. knocking over mailboxes)...making bongs in woodshop when you're supposed to be doing your term project...the older guy(s) hanging out...the conceited "crowd"...the stoner "crowd"...the intellectual "crowd"...the "super dominant male monkey motherf*er" crowd...the car-talk, and the fact that people drove real American automobiles...the freshmen getting their feet wet at a seniors' party...the prick coach (in my case vice-principal)...the infatuated romances...I drove a '76 Ford Explorer 1/2 tonne pick-up with a beefed 390cu" plucked from a '69 Thunderbird in senior high. I remember "beerbusts"; what we referred to as "parties at the farm" (an abandoned farm in the area), or "parties at the sawdust piles" (huge mountains of sawdust at an abandoned sawmill site). Instead of kegs, we preferred Texas mickies of rye whiskey, but the analogy is eerie! The word was spread the same way by word of mouth mere hours before the parties occured in the same manner at popular hangouts (instead of "The Emporium", it was the SportsPlex in my town)!The only thing that seemed out of place were the organized hazing rituals.I COULD GO ON AND ON! I agree that this movie should be memorialized as a classic coming of age film!I do believe that this movie will not relate very well to anyone who grew up in suburban sprawl in a large city like Detroit, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver, or Chicago; you really have to have came from a small to medium sized town/city to relate.EXCELLENT MOVIE!Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let an old-timer (47), one who came of age in the 70s, tell you whippersnappers something -- maybe three somethings: 1) Linklater deserves every accolade (and then some) for this masterpiece; 2) D&amp;C belongs in the pantheon of the top 5 coming-of-age period pieces, and, I dare say, among the top 50 best films of all time; 3) the 70s really were as good (and bad) as depicted.D&amp;C can stand on its own filmic merits for the superb casting, acting, wardrobe, music, dialog, and, of course, direction. But it is its stunning capture of the looks, feelings, attitudes, and behaviors of young people during that time that drives it home.There are many priceless moments in this film, despite the fact that I can't relate to all of them. For example, the fraternity/sorority-type hazing antics. In high school? Maybe they did/do that stuff in Texas; I wouldn't be surprised.Just a few of the things I enjoyed in this movie:The hot, young teacher with her radical enthusiasm (still running strong from the 60s) being pursued by the football stud.The ridiculous clothes, which we (in the 70s) really thought were flattering and cool.The drunk, amorous, and very sexy Jodi enticing Pink to kiss her at the big party, then shutting him down with a reminder about his girlfriend.The ways in which the experienced guys and gals are always giving advice to the younger guys and gals, kind of mentoring them.The car talk. In my day, it was all Fords vs. Chevys. Big gas-guzzlers. No self-respecting American drove a foreign job.The stoners slinking around, always high or about to be. I wasn't a doper in high school, but, even if you weren't a part of that group, you knew it was going on. This was well before all the anti-drug hysteria, when soft drugs were hip and fun.The head coach ranting about Pink's attitude problem. Clint's macho, ready-to-kick-some-ass routine. And, of course, Wooderson always on the make: 'That's what I like about these high school girls, I keep getting older, they stay the same age.' It's easy to see why Matthew McConaughey became a star.I could go on forever. The characters are so vivid, the humor so sharp, the story line so well woven, the good times so real. See it high. See it low. But SEE IT!And if you really dig it, there's a great soft-cover book, Dazed and Confused ('inspired by the screenplay by Richard Linklater') that gives the back story on all the characters, along with lots of historical and cultural detail on that era.I love this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Dazed and Confused' is one of those rare movies that's not 'feel-good,' but nevertheless makes you feel good. All the components (cast, setting, story, soundtrack) combine in this film to make for a unique, enjoyable, nostalgia-inducing experience, even for someone who wasn't alive in the '70s.The characters are well-developed, mixing elements of 'good guy' and 'bad guy' in several character, with only two notable personas, Darla (Parker Posey) and O'Bannion (Ben Affleck) not leaving you wishing they were your friends.All in all, this movie's a great way to spend a rainy afternoon, especially if you've got a couple of six-packs and a group of pals to share it with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The condition of the video which had "4:20 forever" and happy faces smoking pot drawn all over it should have been a pretty quick indicator of the crap that awaited me. How can this come from the same guy who directed the EXHAUSTING yet wonderful Waking Life? Mostly everything in this movie was unlikely, lazy, stereotypical.UGH! The only two likable characters and good actors in this movie were the two straight guys (the director's mouthpiece Adam Goldberg and the sweet blonde). I think that Wiley Wiggins was suppose to be the cute freshman, but he was just pathetic and a bad actor.Everything, save for those two actors, SUCKED. The soundtrack sucked. The clothes sucked. Well, the 70s sure did suck. And none of those "wacky conspiracy" theories from Rory Cochrane were amusing. And since when was there this fierce rivalry between seniors and freshman? Laughable I say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could be said about this movie that isn't true? Everything from the obscene reality of the hazing seniors to the overwhelming emphasis of nothing but the sucess of 'next year's football team'. Growing up in South Texas, the first time I saw this movie was a few weeks after getting initiated. It was an experience I shudder to remember, however, it was a part of growin' up. It was almost like a snap shot into my freshman year...but I didn't touch my nose when frustrated thirty-seven times within an hour and 40 minutes (like our friend Wiley Wiggins, a.k.a. Mitch Kramer). Other than the nose grabbing, the acting throughout the movie was superb, also with the depth that each of the characters was given. However, I think that there are two main unaccredited stars in the movie: the music and the cars. I'm sure that the crew had a hard time collecting the rare beauties in mint condition for the movie, much less securing permission from the owners to use them (nothing'll p*** off the owner of a 1970 SS Chevelle LS-7/454 more than scratching it). The music was introduced at all the right times too, it seemed to flow very well through the movie, especially at key moments, for example, when Hirshfelder and friends were snuck up on by O'Bannion and friends with Black Sabbath's "Paranoid" playing quietly, then roaring at 11, but most importantly, "Tuesday's Gone" at the end of the movie when the party's over and Mitch's innocence is long gone. I'd give it a 9...but the reality of it gives it a 10.D'ryan</fullReview>

The slacker generation's answer to the radicals of the 70s. Not an excuse to be indifferent or lazy, but a plea to the young to enjoy every moment of our fleeting lives. Richard Linklater directs his brilliant script and an unparalleled cast of nobodies to greatness. You will recognize several faces now, but it was this movie that made them prominent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a simple movie to watch, just sit back and see watch since it doesn't take a lot of thinking. The plot isn't huge and it has all kinds of conflicts that all teens experience, but not really solutions to go with it. You don't really learn anything or learn a lesson. You just enjoy since it is such a fun movie!They even show little parts for you get a tiny sample of what it might have been like. One part, when girls are getting ready for a party...one person has to suck-in and lie on the bed just to zip up the zipper on her bell-bottoms since they are just that tight! I know for sure if I asked my mother, she could recall her and all the girls wearing extremely tight jeans.This was an awesome movie and I really recommend it to only teenagers since your parents might make it less fun by going and no one. It isn't for kids of a young age (BEST for 14 and up). If I could change anything...there would be a lot less pot smoking.Enjoy everyone, By the way, Slater is the best! He's awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I am writing this review I am listening to the "dazed and confused" soundtrack being a great big fan of the movie that I am, I went out and bought both editions. Ok this movie is great, if you havent seen it...SEE IT!!I remember not even hearing about this movie, I stumbled upon a book in Barnes &amp; Noble of which I own today. And then I rented it being only about 10 years old. Ever since I watched the movie it has remained my favorite of all time.The movie is very simple, not much of a plot. Last day of school in 1976. You know what that means...PARTY!!! I guess movies like "cant hardly wait" and other teeny bopper movies tried to do over the years but have failed. No this movie is not no "american graffitti" but it is a great movie, I can't even begin to tell you.The acting is wonderful, the cast is awesome, everyone in this movie is li ke their first appearance (ben affleck, parker posey). The actors do a wonderful job displaying teenagers.As now, I am done with high school and I haven't seen the movie in a while, recently, I watched it.. and it just made me think of when I finished junior year to senior year... and man.. it just brought back so many memories.Another thing.. if you were apart of this decade..you will love the soundtrack.. Heck I LOVE the soundtrack and im a generation x.BOTTOM LINE: DONT MISS THIS FILM**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't get over how good this movie is. Since seeing it, I wished I would've lived back in the '70s. No offense, but the 21st century sucks! I think that Marisa Ribisi's character was right about that whole every other decade thing: how one decade things are great and the next decade things suck! However, I disagree with her on which one's suck and which ones rock. The 50's seemed like they would've been fun. They weren't as clean cut and innocent as they seemed to be, just go see GREASE and THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Anyone who falls for that LEAVE IT TO BEAVER crap is mistaken. The 60's probably wouldn't have been my type. All of the hippies and the beach parties, etc...it just wouldn't have worked for me. The 70's had to have been a great time. School was a breeze, parties were everywhere, and you could just do anything. The 80's would've been too gaudy and tacky for me. The 90's were good for me. I had the best times of my life in the 90's, even though I can hardly remember them sometimes (I was a little boy then, and now i'm only in my early teens). Now the turn of the century. Since 2000 came, everything has sucked. School is much harder, if the girls aren't sluts, they're bitches, and there are too many tragedies in the world, not to mention our own personal hardships in life.Getting to the movie, it was excellent. The characters were real, and I could relate to some of them. When you watch it, this movie makes you wish you were there in it. These people seemed to be having the time of their lives (even though some of them were complaining about the town being dead and the 70's sucking). The acting was excellent. It's a shame we hear virtually nothing about the actors today. But some of them have gone on to successful movie careers (Parker Posey, Jason London, but he's kind of faded in recent years). The music is one of the best things about the movie. All the songs are great and fun to listen to. I'd recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. 20/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I've seen DAZED AND CONFUSED too many times whenever I hear "Slow Ride" and in that break in the song I always yell out "Hirschfelder!," like when that kid appears in the closing credits. Now, what CD has that extended version of "Slow Ride"?I was one of the few who actually saw DAZED AND CONFUSED when it was in theatres (thank you, AMC Deptford 8 in New Jersey). At first I didn't think much of it; the great reviews I had read about it caused me to be a bit underwhelmed. But since I'm in full disclosure mode right about now, I'll admit that my third viewing of this movie coincided with the first time I really got stoned. Its clarity and beauty was finally revealed, and this is a big reason why this film is so dear to me.DAZED AND CONFUSED is obviously in my all-time Top 10. If you're looking for an expert, you've found one. I've been following the careers of every actor in this classic - and not just the stars like Ben, Matthew and Parker. I'm talking Adam, Anthony, Rory, Sasha, Cole, Marissa, Nicky, and, of course, Wiley (great to finally see him again in WAKING LIFE). (And did you know that's Renée Zellweger in the red-and-white striped tube top strolling past Pink, Wooderson &amp; Mitch while they're hanging out in front of the Emporium?)Only once a decade it seems that a "teen" movie speaks to an entire generation and features scads of future stars. The '70s had AMERICAN GRAFFITI, the '80s had FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and the '90s had DAZED AND CONFUSED. What will this decade give us? AMERICAN PIE? I hope there's a better representation of untainted talent on the horizon.Oops. It's late (4:57 a.m.), and I haven't watch DAZED AND CONFUSED in months; this brief wave of nostalgia overcame my inebriated self at this cusp of a velvet morning. I'm not here to rehash whatever plot there is in this magnificent film; I just wanted to once again bask in the glory of DAZED AND CONFUSED, if only for a short while.FeverDog</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've skimmed a few reviews, so I don't know for sure that I'm not repeating someone else. Forgive me if I am. What stands out the most for me about D&amp;C is that it's so LIGHT; it's like a rice cake. Nothing really SERIOUS happens, no major corners are turned, no major lessons are learned, and no one is scarred for life. If this movie was made in a 90's setting, there are two places where someone would be seriously hurt or killed, and another where a girl would probably be raped. The first time I watched it, I was subconsciously expecting a death or some other traumatic event. Only afterwards did I realize that I didn't see what I'd been conditioned to expect. The movie stars folks who are mostly unknown. You might recognize Pink as T.S. from Mallrats, and Joey Lauren Adams from her ex, Kevin Smith's movies, and you will see what Ben Affleck looks like with bad 70's hair. Other than that, the only easily recognizable faces are indie queen Parker Posey and Matthew McConaughey in his first movie. I heard that Linklater tapped MM for this movie after overhearing him talking in a bar. The way he talks in this movie is his REAL voice.Other people have already touched on the "quotability" of D&amp;C and the accuracy with which the time period is presented. I was only 2 when the 70's began, but D&amp;C makes me wish I could have grown up during THIS time, even with the paddling....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that can be watched anytime with your friends. At a party, sleepover, getting drunk, or even by yourself this movie will work. The main reason why is that teenagers (like me and mostly anyone who saw or should see this movie) can identify with it so much. Every high school social group is represented in this film. There are the cheerleaders (Jodi, Sharone, Darla, Simonne) the stoners(Slater,Pickford,Michelle) the jocks (Benny, O'Bannion, Melvin, Dawson) the two freshman at their first night partying (Mitch- maybe the only downside to the movie with his ratty appearance, and Sabrina) the freshman getting their asses busted (Carl,Tommy,Hersch)the losers (Cynthia,Tony,Mike) and then there is Randy Floyd who is the best though-out character in the movie. Thats because if you noticed he blends in with all of these groups. He was a football player/stoner, loved by the cheerleaders, invites the freshman Mitch out, and is friends with the losers. Also another classic character was Wooderson, the 30 year old hanging out with high schoolers.All in all, any teenager should see this movie to see an exact reflection of their lives. Like i said, every social group is present and accounted for, and the characters portrayal of them is outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The details are all dead-on--the costumes are perfect, the hair is great, and all in all, the 90s kids in the cast give excellent portrayals of 70s kids. The best thing about the movie, though, is its stream-of-consciousness pacing. The ostensible plot about a hazing ritual provides enough of an undercurrent to keep things moving, but on the surface, it's slow enough to feel almost like real time. It doesn't wallow enough to be genuine nostalgia--unlike the narrator in "Stand By Me," director Linklater doesn't need to tell us that this was the best time in his life or ours or that nothing like it will ever happen again, and maybe it's because Linklater knows that any time in life has its own problems. All he does is take you back and let you feel what it was like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my memories of the seventies, I can't seem to recall all of the pot smoking and paddling of freshmen that make up major elements of this movie. Yet, this last day (and night and morning) of school film with its ensemble cast is a wonderful take on life 25 years ago. There were many great performances by many great actors and actresses, but I can't remember their names off hand. (One of them later appeared in EDTV and another one made a movie with Robin Williams and Matt Damon and yet another one was done away with in Scream 3). The guy from EDTV (Matthew Something) has a haircut just like I did in high school, so I can attest that this movie is trying to be realistic. The pants are something else. Back in my day, we didn't dare wear anything like that.Hilarious dialogue such as the part about George and Martha Washington and their hemp growing and smoking habits run through the movie. Richard Linklater, who did a great movie called Slackers, seems to have a thing for American presidents, what with the earlier bit about the nerd who had the dream about a woman who looked like Abraham Lincoln. I'm sure Nixon was mentioned in this movie too, but I can't think of the reference now.There are some parts of the movie that are a bit slow, but the characters are drawn pretty well. Some times it is a bit confusing and dazing to keep track of who is who; hence: the title. Another actor named Wiley Wiggins (I do remember his name) really does a great job at playing one of the freshmen who gets to hang out with the seniors. Extremely amusing scene when he buys beer from a Jamie Cromwell like store clerk. The football coaches are right out of North Dallas Forty.At any rate, this movie is well worth renting or even buying. I think I've seen it five or six times. It's like one of those movies you want to see over and over but don't really know why. It's sort of a middle ground between a gabfest like The Last Days of Disco and American Graffiti. The final scene, as the group goes off to buy Aerosmith tickets, really must be analyzed and thought about carefully. Very very deep. Later, dude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before "That 70's Show" they were all Dazed and Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie over 10 times and I still love it. I was very young in the 1970's and only remember fragments, but watching this movie is like looking through my parents' old photo albums. The long hair, the bell-bottoms, the 28 year old who still hangs out with high school kids... what's not to love?Dazed and Confused takes you through one day in the life of a group of typical teenagers in May 1976. But regardless of the era, anyone can relate to this movie. I remember my high school hazing back in 1990 being very similar to what the girls go through in this movie.This movie is nostalgic, witty, and just plain hilarious. If you like Fox's series That 70's Show, you will definitely love Dazed and Confused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having graduated at about the same time as this crowd, I can tell you that most of the characters are dead-on. It's a very good,if not great, movie. I thought they went a bit overboard on the hazing angle...I mean I know some of that stuff went on, but I don't remember carloads of seniors with paddles chasing down incoming freshmen. Maybe it was a Texas thing. The soundtrack was great but they really should have thrown in some Pink Floyd and Todd Rundgren. I recall spending quite a few nights with guys like the stoner...sitting in small rooms lit only by a blacklight, passing a bong and crankin up the tunes. All in all the movie reminded me of how great it was to 18 in the early/mid seventies...after the craziness of the 60s and before disco, punk,rap,Aids and MTV closed the party down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite teen flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80's produced some of the goofiest teen flicks (Sixteen Candles, Weird Science), the 90's produced hardly any except for the latter half. I went to see this movie mainly for the fact that it was filmed in Austin, where I grew up, even though it was supposedly set in a small town, but Texas' small towns are anything but sophisticated, like most of these kids were. I'm sure every character in the film was one most anybody could relate to in their high school days; for some strange reason, the ones I related to best were the ones that had the two guys and red-haired girl, since I never was the party animal type and always a thinker, even though they were classified as "geeks', like many of the more subdued and mild-mannered teens tend to be thought of as. I also found myself identifying with Matthew McConaughey's 20-something character who still hangs onto his high school years and generally has no long term goals, so much like Paul LeMat's John in American Graffiti, only not so stoic and introspective. I consider this an overall great film with basically no plot to speak of, just a glimpse into the lives of Texas teens in the 70's. Also, I went to lunch frequently at that Top Notch hamburger joint they hang out at back when I was in high school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what planet I was on, but I did not even become aware of this movie until last year when my 18 year old nephew recommended I see it. And I live in Austin, the city where the movie was filmed no less. Duh! I am a living example of what happens to a person that acted like the kids in this film. A few too many brain cells lost and I am paying for it now.Having gone to school in the sixties and seventies in Texas, I was totally transfixed when all of a sudden I was visually transported back to my teen years. It was uncanny. I was able to re-live that glorious time with those wonderful friendships, sex, drugs and the awesome rock and roll, at least for a couple of hours, and I relished it. I knew Wooderson, the guy always talking about his Holly carb and his Hurst 4 speed. I partied hard with Slater. I had the intelligent conversation with Mike and Cynthia. And I lusted after those seemingly unattainable popular senior girls. Only the names and faces were different.Perhaps almost everyone can relate in some way to this film and its characters, scenes and places. That is its beauty. It reassures us with its truths. Richard Linklater is a master at bringing us a small slice of life out of the pie of time. This film may not be a masterpiece, but it is one I will always cherish, even after many repeated viewings.</fullReview>

It could be any time, anywhere. Besides, it is still painfully funny. If you ever get the chance, play the "Dazed &amp; Confused" drinking/smoking game. The rules are simple; match all cast members drink for drink and smoke for smoke. I think I passed out about three quarters of the way through when I did it. Another thing. Next time you see "Dazed", listen to some of the background dialogue. The film was right, you can't handle one hour drum solos on strong acid, man!Check you later!!!!

The script, music, camera-work and acting make you feel, by the end of the film, that you know all of the characters like they are your best friends. You want to find out what happens to the gang as they set out on their post-high school lives and you feel absolutely gutted when the film finishes because it feels like you've been watching real life. I would recommend this film to anyone, young or old, because the script work is so strong and the acting so real that anybody can watch this and appreciate the time and work that has gone into it.

		<fullReview>All i can say is WOW! My friend has been telling me to see this movie for awhile now. I finally rented it last week and watched it. Even though there was really no point to the movie it was still highly enjoyable.Dazed and Confused is about a bunch of high school students on their last day of school in 1976. All the characters are memorable and it's hard to forget every one of them. I think most high school students can connect with the characters whether it be 1976 or 2000. I know, personally, that each one of my friends (and including myself) is each one of the characters. Of course I have a friend who is identical to Pink, Simone, Michelle, Mike, Tony, etc..All the actors in the movie were great but Rory Cochrane's character, Slater, just stood out. Of course me being a fan of this fine actor, would say something like this, but it is true. The doped-up stoner, Slater, is one of the funniest and unforgetable characters of Dazed.Highly recommended movie for anyone regardless of age. This movie is not your average PG-13 teenaged movies like Down To You, Drive Me Crazy, (or anything containing Freddie Prinze Jr.). Because it's not your average PG-13 teenager movie, it's rated R for language and they smoke a lot of weed in this movie."George Washington was in a cult, and the cult was into aliens man!"~Slater</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The GODFATHER of 90's Teenage Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's official...Dazed and Confused is THE GODFATHER of all teenage films made in the 1990's. It is on such a higher plain than movies like She's All That, You Drive Me Crazy, Clueless, and all of the other cheaply produced PG-13 teen flicks. Note: You cannot make an accurate teenage movie with a PG-13. High School life is at least Rated R and most of the time it is NC-17.What sets Dazed and Confused apart is that it takes a time that has come and gone, the 1970's, and it proceeded to make the viewers feel like they were living in that era. With the music, the costumes, the car, the dialogue, and the characterizations, Dazed and Confused used the 1970's to its advantage while, in the process, keeping it real and giving people a chance to feel like they were living the movie.I saw the movie back when I was about 12 and then saw it again when I was about 15 or 16. From there, I was hooked. My favorite scenes became the part where "Free Ride" starts to play and then the whole initial "Emporium" scene. Wooderson was priceless and he is everyone's example of a super senior. Slater was everyone's stoner friend and the list goes on.What makes Dazed special to me is that it inspired me to go into screenwriting. I saw Dazed and then I saw all the poor teen films coming out so I figured I needed to get off my rear and come up with real life stories like Dazed and Confused. I have Richard Linklater to thank for that.In essence, Dazed and Confused is one of the three best teen films each represented a different decade but kept it to where anyone could relate. The other two films are American Grafiti for the late 50's and early 60's and Fast Times at Ridgemont High for the 80's.Throw in The Breakfast Club and Varsity Blues(a distant second to Dazed and Confused this decade) and you have a slice of the past 4 decades of teenage life represented in film.In closing, I quote Wooderson: "You just got to keep livin... L-I-V-I-N!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dazed and Confused" is a very entertaining movie, in the "American Graffiti" tradition of movies about leaving high school. There are echoes of "American Graffiti" in "Dazed and Confused" but there are a lot of things that the movie does for itself. There are also echoes of "Dazed and Confused" in movies such as "Detroit Rock City" and "Can't Hardly Wait". The story is basically about seniors hazing incoming freshmen, but then it turns into a story about growing up. The freshman that is caught first and particularly brutalized, turns out to be a big hit at the party, whereas the jerk that hurt him has paint dumped on him and he drives angrily away. There are a few minor flaws in the movie, such how realistic it is, and teen substance abuse, but it's all in good fun. The movie is hilarious,entertaining, and original, but in that grand tradition of high school movies about growing up and moving on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent and most truthful depiction of teenage life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film's massive cult following has led to the recent rise in marijuana use among teens. At least in the small town I hail from. The film does depict a carefree, consequence free and nostalgic look on an era of casual drug use. As a high school teacher, I have heard more than one fan say "I wish I could go back to that year, it is certainly a more innocent time." The jaded side of me would absolutely relish Linkletter making a sequel to this film and re-examining these characters thirty years or so later as they confront the ultimate choices of their lives and maybe even meet their offspring behaving the way they did. These characters, like most teenagers (I certainly remember my years) are all pretty much hedonistic, self centered and consumer based individuals. I really would like to see what happened to them as they matured and became producers. Would their lives mirror mine? Probably most definitely.Anyway, that weak moralizing aside, Dazed and Confused is a great movie that focuses on character, situation and setting as opposed to any real plot. There is no great conflict and therefore no real resolution to its narrative. In fact, because he refuses to judge his characters, Linkletter allows them to truly live in the unnamed Texas town. Like his earlier film Slacker, Linkletter simply allows the film to evolve without any impositions of classic storytelling. He wants his characters to tell their stories on their own terms. Scenes happen as opposed to beginning with any set pattern. His camera is so completely neutral that it manages a near documentary feeling in creating honest and personal spaces. He avoids the whip lash editing so many of his peers love in favor of long, loopy and dreamy takes. Scenes are funny not because of snappy, slogan filled one liners like so many other teen flicks are, they work because they set up truthfull situations that the characters can honestly respond to: moments sketched exactly out of the hormone driven evolutionary soup that is high school.The film is also extremely economical. There really isn't a wasted scene. Linkletter also doesn't bow completely to the audience: there isn't a tacked on nudey sex scene or all out violent episode. Such inclusions would be exploitive and common- qualities this film avoids. The film begins en media res and ends much the same way.The performances and writing in the film are seemless and natural in their execution. Many may be turned off by the super natural delivery as it opposes any sort of dramatic tension. These young actors inhabit their characters completely without a false note struck. The body language and coded language of teenage life is dead on. Granted not everyone in 76 or now uses drugs and drinks to the extent idealized in the movie (it is interesting that we don't see anyone puking or wrecking their muscle cars- again that would be moralizing, exploitive , you name it), but yet the costumes and behavior are dead on. I especially love the dorky tight shorts and pulled up socks of the super macho football coaches.Linkletter captures perfectly the fears, hopes and overall attitudes of teen life better than John Hughes ever could have hoped to. With the exception of Cameron Crowe's superb Say Anything, this is the greatest teen film ever made. A 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah.. Dazed and Confused. The title of this film does not do it justice. Although there is copious amounts of beer drinking and drug taking, there is an intelligent and good natured core that runs through. The teens during all the fun are really reflecting. From the quarterback who is pressured to sign an "anti-fun" document, to the freshman who must navigate the nuances of the social upper echelon after being ritualistically hammered on the ass.We actually get to see the realistic dynamics of highschool cliques. There are the cool kids, the jocks, the jerks, the stoners, and the smart guys. But these cliques are not nations unto themselves. The cross-over of friends between these cliques is portrayed realistically with irony and humor. This is how I remembered highschool. It was never 'the pretty perfect students vs. the ugly drug taking hoods'. I watch this movie and I think, 'Hey, I knew these guys. Hell, I was one of them.'The movie also spares us the usual contrived plot. It really doesn't need it. We are seeing a slice of life here, a part of history, not some lame moralistic story. Even though the ending suggests, subtley, that some of these 'confused' teens are on a dangerous highway, it's done without being preachy or heavy handed.Dazed and Confused is the closest thing to 'American Graphitti' today's generation has. Although, with the current popularity of Brittany Spears and drug testing, this sadly may no longer be the case.And for all those people who found their mailboxes busted, I truly apologize.</fullReview>

I just wanted the movie not to end, but to go on and on, into Senior year. Perhaps longing to enter into a movie isn't the most typical thing to want to do, but no other film has evoked this reaction from me. This is a movie I purchsed, loaned to someone who moved away, and purchased again. I own the soundtracks (question: anyone have any idea why "Sweet Emotion" didn't make it on the soundtrack?)and somehow, these songs that I know pretty much by heart sound so much better when listened to in context with this movie. Anyone else love this film as much as I do? Please e-mail me with your comments; I promise a response.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! There are a ton of great one-liners and sayings. Now, it may not win any awards, or receive high acclaim, but it is certainly a classic. Dazed and Confused is a great relaxing comedy. It is one of those day-in-the-life-of movies, not a action movie, not a tear-jerker, but a really good movie. There are a lot of actors in this movie that soon became big stars later in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, and I have probably seen it now, at least 4 times. It gets funnier every time I see it. By far, the scenes with oncoming freshman getting hazed are the funniest. I only wish that I could have hazed oncoming freshman when I was a Senior. O Bannon is hilarious. So is the rest of the cast. The place that they hung out at was great too. It was great when the geek got his ass kicked and then stared to cry. That was great. " Your f***in dead, you facist" then he starts to cry. it was great. My favorite parts of the movies are the hazing, where JR throws the bowling ball through the window, and where the fat guy gets dragged along the ground when they take off. The women in this movie are HOT too! A great movie</fullReview>

Shamelessly underrated, Linklater has created a nostalgic trip back to when life was all about good times, good friends, and good bud. Not a whole lot of plot here but who cares? See it, enjoy it, then see it again.</fullReview>

So after about another six months it was repeated again and I caught the majority of the film this time, I loved it so much i went out and purchased the film, then after watching it another 10-11 times, i went and bought the soundtrack 1 and 2, and the offical 'scrapbook' for the film. The film is an instant feel good film, and I only wish that i could go back in time to be there '76 and also in '93 so i could have been an extra in the background.

		<shortDescription>a nostalgic look back at a now gone era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater's name was put on the map with the comedic indie fave SLACKER (1991), a vignette-filled day in the life of an intertwined series of (mostly) twenty-something free spirits in the college town of Austin, Texas. Along with Nirvana's landmark record "Nevermind" and Douglas Coupland's novel "Generation X," Linklater provided in this film another reference point for delineating a cultural/generational shift from baby-boomer conventions to those of a more cynical and/or irony-oriented Gen-Xer generation, a generation which grew up after the 1960s cultural shifts were in place and to be simply taken for granted.DAZED AND CONFUSED, a fine later effort by the same director, looks back, fondly and nostalgiacly, toward the seemingly more care free days of the mid 1970s, a time in which the late 60s ethos of freeing your mind through sex, drugs, rock, and non stop rebellion had filtered out beyond the counter-culture zones and down to younger aged rebels. Linklater focuses on a group of high school partyers on the last day of the 75/76 school year. The mood is carefree and upbeat, in spite of some hazing and bullying of the incoming freshmen by the seniors. Plans for a big blowout get made. Eventually, all of the kids - cool and uncool - get together in one big beer and pot filled gathering. In the course of events, we get to know the mostly likeable charecters and feel as though we are hanging out with them.Linklater and cast do a remarkable job of capturing the details and nuances of a now gone era, and of conveying the joyous moments of being young and having a great time simply hanging out with other kids. They show kids having fun not doing what they are told by the adults. They present the rituals of potsmoking in an honest way, i.e, as a relatively benign recreational (rather than as a gateway) drug, the use of which was, and is, widespread among American adolescents. Having grown up in the same era (graduating from grammar school in 75 and high school in 79), this movie made me feel very nostalgiac about the era it depicts. It made me want to go dig out "Toys in the Attic" and my other 70s hard rock LPs from out of the storage and give them a spin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in to this movie I expected a sort of "Trainspotting" American-style. That is not what you get. Expect a "Stand By Me" for highschool seniors.Like "Stand By Me" this movie does not disappoint. There is not much plot, it's about people experiencing stuff and facing their future. The way the filmmakers bring it is excellent, it's like your coming along on this very cool and weird first day of summer. The young kids are getting their first kiss and joint, the older kids are thinking about their future and reminiscing their highschool days.All the kids are on the brink of something; leaving something behind and taking a step forwards. "Dazed and Confused" tells no story, it simply shows us a day in the life of teenagers in the seventies. And it's Far Out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I have many favorite movies but Dazed and Confused is in my Top 3. I LOVE this movie! It is sooooo awesome. Even though it is set in 1976, except the clothes and music nothing has changed about high school. You got your basic jocks, which makeup a majority of the movie, the popular girls, the bitches, the potheads, which makeup another majority, the greasers, the geeks, and the upcoming freshman, which are only 2. I love the way that mostly everyone is friends with everyone. All you have to do is drink beer and maybe smoke pot and everyone is cool with you. The main peoples are jocks Pink, Benny, Dawson, and others, O'Bannion the dumbass who is repeating his senior year, the nice girls are Jodi Kramer, Shavonne, and the girl who never talks forgot her name. The potheads are Pickford, Michelle, Slater, and more. The geeks who have a theory about everything are Cynthia, Mike, and Tony. The upcoming freshman are Mitch Kramer and Sabrina who both get with older high schoolers.Anyways, Pickford is suppose to have a huge end of the year bash at his house, but the keg guy comes early and Pickford gets busted. Meanwhile, th e upcoming seniors are somewhat initiating the upcoming freshman. The boys suffer with paddles, but the girls get trashed and are forced to do embarrassing thing. While all this is going on, Mitch gets beat and the nice guy Pink offers Mitch to ride around, while the nice girl Jodi offers Sabrina to ride around too. It's got sooo many plots, you have to watch it. I give Dazed and Confused 9.5/10 only because it wasn't long enough.</fullReview>

Watching this movie of a group of high school teenagers in the 70's from the point of view of the high school teens of the 90's it is almost uncanny the similarities in the talk and lifestyles that they lived that we live. Let's just put it this way at the high school I graduated from, half the graduating class had seen this movie at a party at least 3 or 4 times.

The interesting things about this movie are the persons and their characters and how even the intelligent folks want to have party, because they recognised they maybe could have missed something in their youth: "Look, we need some alcohol." On the other hand the 'cool' kids that have their partys, drugs and alcohol every day spend their time on thinking about their future, what they could have done better. In the end Pink said that sentence I will always remember: "If this is the best time of my life, remind me to kill myself." Watch this movie more than just one time.

		<shortDescription>Linklater's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused evolves around the lives of a group of teenagers in suburban Texas on the last day of high school in 1976. That's all you really need to know. All I can say is that this is hands down one of my favorite films ever. I think anybody between the ages of 20 and 45 has some kind of attachment to this movie. We all know at least one of the characters really well (that is, we all have somebody in our personal cliques, or have forged friendships with at least one person who is characterized in this film). The ambience and atmosphere of high school is perfectly captured by Linklater, from the parties, beer drinking, pot smoking, keggers in the woods, cars, subgroups and general outlook that high schoolers have. They live for the most part, for the here and now (except for Matthew McConaughey's Wooderson who desperately clings to his past). I've read other reviews which dwell on the film's "non existent plot". No statement about the film can be further from the truth. There is not so much a conventional plot as there is Linklater's desire to make you reflect upon your own high school years. For those few who can't see it, are you aware of the parallel betwen Pink and Mitch??? Mitch gets paddled just like Pink did ("They got me right after Little League practice."). Is it merely coincidence that Mitch winds up hanging out with Pink and his crew that evening; or how easily that group of seniors accept Mitch?? I don't think so. For me, Dazed and Confused is a bookmark in the pages of my life (despite the fact that I graduated high school 11 years after the film takes place). Its not just what you see, but even more so, what you don't see. You relate to the good times each person/group has had (both past and current) although you're not even there. Dazed and Confused is more than just a funny movie about a bunch of high schoolers, it has a direct connection to just about anybody who sees it. Bravo to Mr. Linklater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this film about 200 times (no lie) it has to be the funniest High School/Stoner movie of all time...I am not in the business of watching a film many times, but D&amp;C has something different...WATCH CLOSELY...Wooderson(Matthew McConaughy) has to be the most delicately formed character in the whole film...portrayed by a wonderful actor, he has to be the best loser ever in film...note his swagger, his tone of voice, his firing of his finger(in the scene at the pool hall in slow mo)...we all knew this guy in one form or another throughout our lives. You can sense this is how truly cool McConaughy really is (watch Ed TV you'll see it). He is quite charismatic. Next...Jason London's performance of jock tires of the jock image...it hit so close to home for me having known a couple of really talented athletes that gave it up to shake the dummkopf image. Slater typical stoner...Pickford typical guy who can make things happen(but doesn't do it well enough "Hey what can I say, it was beyond me")...this movie is so real and yet so entertaining that anyone who hasn't seen it should see it NOW. Watch Adam Goldberg...typical dork who's had enough...HILARIOUS!!!...look for the little things that make this film great...it takes a couple of viewings mainly for the purpose of regaining your composure enough to get the tears out of your eyes to keep watching. A perfect ten regardless of the voters' results!!!</fullReview>

And when someone (Wooderson, I think) asks if he's got a joint: "Ummm.........no, not on me, man." He's the true savior of the movie-- maybe 'cuz he reminds me of me. Anyhow, DAZED AND CONFUSED has a place on my top 10 all-time movies, along such diverse fare as ROSEMARY'S BABY, HOOP DREAMS, and THE BAD NEWS BEARS. This film gets everything right-- starting from superior casting, hilarious dialogue, and dozens of specific DETAILS which evoke a time and place (summer 1976-- when I was 5 years old!) This flick is all about relaxing, going for steak and eggs after partying all night, and not worrying about the future-- Randall Pink does, and look where it gets him. These are ideals which I wholly endorse. Whenever I'm feeling down, I just pop this trusty film in my VCR and it never fails to cure me.

		<shortDescription>Here comes the story of the hurricane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two aspects of Dazed that make it a phenomenal film experience: 1) It's just a great film, with great direction, dialogue, and acting. 2) It has become The Outsiders of this generation. Screw the Kevin Bacon game, play the Dazed and Confused game!I will address the latter first, because that's the kind of crazy gal I am.Let's start at the top:Jason London (Pink), half of the London twin duo.Joey Lauren Adams (Simone): of Chasing Amy, Michael, Second Noah, and of late, Big Daddy fame.Rory Cochrane (Slater): Empire Records' gambling beatnick.Sasha Jenson (Dawson): hasn't done much lately, but he was in Buffy (the movie).Ben Affleck (O'Bannion): megasuperstar!! (also an appearance in Buffy)Cole Hauser (Benny): Good Will Hunting's other drunk.Michelle Burke (Jodi): Coneheads.Adam Goldberg (Mike): Chandler's weird roomate, and one of the eight in Saving Private Ryan.Deena Martin (Shavonne): the lovely, if fast, Vegas waitress in Swingers.Christine Harnos (Kaye): the ex-Mrs. Mark Greene on ER.Matthew McConaughy (Wooderson): another superstar.and my personal fave::::Anthony Rapp (Tony): skyrocketed to fame as Mark Cohen in the Broadway smash, RENT!! Just finished the title role in You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, also on Broadway.Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, I can actually talk about the film. There is so much that is so phenomenal about this film, that I don't know where to begin. The accuracy in the portrayal of high school life is probably accurate for high school in the seventies, but in a modern context, it is more like college. Initiation, humiliation, random hookups, all night beer benders, WAAAAAAY too much weed everywhere...sounds like college to me!!Something else that many people miss is that this portrayal of high school life is sooooo Texas that it's scary. The way people talk. The way people live for beer. The way people are totally in love with their cars and all of their "f*****g muscle." The fact that driving to Houston to buy concert tickets isn't an entirely outlandish idea.The so obscenely high school parts are beautifully done. The eighth-graders (AKA freshmen) playing paper football on the last day of school made me giggle, because this film was released not long after I got out of junior high. I loved how just hanging out at the Emporium LOOKED so cool, but to the people there, life was boring. (this device was used later in Swingers. At every kickin bar, the ubiquitous phrase of "this place is dead anyway' resonates.)Speaking of the Emporium, we come to my favorite scene: the entrance of Mitch, Pink, and Wooderson into the Emporium. Watch this scene carefully, and for the lucky ones, you will feel a kinship to the characters. As they're driving up in W's chickmobile, Melba's Toast, Bob Dylan's "Hurricane" begins. The doors burst open into the hangout, and suddenly everything is in slo-mo. Wooderson's gestures, Pink's aknowledgements, Mitch's cool uneasiness, all make us realize that they OWN the place. This is their Cheers, this is their Dresden. Everybody knows them, or at least who they are. They are at home. The shot ends abruptly with Pickford's placing of a football on the table, in another delicious shot. This is some of the best directing, storytelling through pictures, that I have ever seen.Needless to say, I have seen this film WAY too many times (61 at press time). In fact, I did this entire review from memory at work in about 15 minutes!!See this film. You will laugh, you won't cry, maybe you'll yawp!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the record, in the spring of 1976 I was just out of diapers... I don't drink, I don't smoke, and in high school sex to me was like the the moon- some people have been there, but you don't ever expect to make the trip.That said, I declare "Dazed and Confused" to be the funniest and truest depiction of contemporary high school culture that I've seen. The initiations, the hierarchies, the humiliations- it's all here.And, after probably 30-odd times, I can say that it's even better on repeat viewings; the script, performances, editing and source music are in absolute syncronization. When its elements work together this perfectly, a movie seems effortless- but don't be fooled, there's a wizard behind the curtain. Exhibitionism is so often mistaken for style, but Richard Linklater prefers to remain in the woodwork and the movie is better for it.The humor in "Dazed and Confused" is based on familiarity, not shock or surprise, and so it doesn't expire like what passes for so many of today's so-called comedies. Details like Mitch's tics, and the ever-present use of the word "man", ground the elliptical narrative in character, not gimmickry- and make the movie that much funnier.There's actually much more here than yuks, though you have to listen for it. A definite perspective is threaded in the sentiments as expressed by the characters throughout the movie. The brilliance lies in the way Richard Linklater puts this point across, much more eloquently and powerful than can be stated in a synopsis or a review... D&amp;C is just about the most palatable "message" movie in existence.Side note: while I'm sure that its depiction of the era owes as much to the looking-glass of the 1990s, D&amp;C isn't, unlike some of the films to which it is compared ("American Graffiti", namely), mired in nostalgia or fetishes. And so, while firmly placed in a time, it isn't only for the Gen X set.(p.s. yeah, if I'm anybody I'm Tony- hey, at least I would get a shot at Sabrina.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this absolute gem of a movie makes me feel very good. I feel that my perspective on the last half of the 20th Century would be far weaker if not for Richard Linklater's masterpiece on being young in the 1970s. The number of times that I have "watched this movie with a bud" and had an absolute blast where otherwise I would have been bored and depressed about being stuck in the 90s is astonishing. I am downright thankful to everyone involved in Dazed and Confused for creating such a worthwhile window into one of the most amazing and underrated times in our history. From witnessing them, I already realize just how much the shameful 1980s and 1990s have sucked ass, but seeing this homage to the wonderful 1970s hammers the point in unmistakably. How anyone could feel any other way about this is completely unimaginable to me. Dazed and Confused has had an impact on my life like no other movie ever could, and it has been and will continue to be nothing but a positive factor in my life. Linklater is a genius. Dazed and Confused is as close to a perfect production as you are going to find. People owe it to themselves not only to see this movie, but to get to know it. And while you're at it, reevaluate some things in your life and open your eyes to how things should be, something that has long been lost in our society. Look, we need some alcohol!

		<fullReview>Maltin says the characterizations take precedence over the storyline. Correct. This movie has no storyline, or plot, which would be fine for a docu-drama, but its not that either. Its just pointless. I graduated high-school in 1975 and recognized nothing here, except for the music. Mindless teens race around in cars, smoking pot, drinking beer, whooping it up and fighting with each other. Some people do identify with these type of scenes. If you are one of those you may enjoy this. If you are looking for a film with artistic merit, this ain't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, did I feel messed up after watching this! Seriously! There is no plot or point to this movie. Just drugs, sex, rock &amp; roll, and gettin' loaded! I was drinking Tequila with my brother and his friends while I watched it, so I felt even more, well, "Dazed and Confused". The movie is basically just one big party that takes up the 2 hours of film. It realistically recaptures the essence and memories of high school teens in the 70's. However, watching it is not an easy task. It's very funny, but it's loaded with beer and drugs. And some scenes are tough to watch, because it reminds us of how at one point in our lives, we all got our a**es pounded in with a paddle by the older kids. That's life! But hey, life can be cool, hip, and drugged up sometimes, like the time this movie took place. It happens to us at one point in our lives. This movie is well constructed, and very funny at times. However, don't think you will come out of this movie feeling halfway normal and sober.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the all time classic movies although somewhat unknown to a vast amount of people. Dazed and Confused really brings to life the experience of 1976 high school with all the music, all the cars, all the beer and ultimately all the grass. This is a film which I would recommend to anyone looking for a cool easy to watch movie, it is a film once watched you are certain to want to see again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure cinematic genius! Though much of the focus on this film is on its lack of a discernible plot and the glorification of drugs and underage drinking, the beauty of the film lies in the way it doesn't focus. It plays like life, where there is not always a story going on. Keep in mind, the movie takes place over the course of a single day, so it could be asking a bit much to expect much in the way of an involved plot (in fact, a heavy plot would likely have diminished Linklater's effort at capturing a moment). For many people, this is life, these are people I know, people I hang with (though the 90's version of them).Never boring and frequently funny, this film never ceases to entertain me. It never tries to be something it cannot be. With the fantastic casting and acting, and nearly impeccable direction, I give it an 11 out of 10!</fullReview>

You can identify with nearly every character, or know someone who is exactly like the characters in this film. There is no real comprehensive story line in the movie, just a number of smaller plots revolving around individual characters, and their interaction with each other. Casting for this film was superb, each actor really looked the part that they played. I highly recommend that if you are between the ages of 14 and 21 you go rent this movie now.On a side note, Milla Jovovich (Fifth Element chick) is in this. She is very hot, rent it just so you can look at her.</fullReview>

Nobody goes nuts, nobody breaks down and kills themselves. You feel as though you could watch this film forever, but all great things come to an end.

Rory Cochrane (Empire Records) also has a good role as Slater. This movie showed that life in the 1970's ruled. There are so many funny lines and the music in this movie kicks. Dazed and Confused also stars Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, Joey Lauren Adams, Adam Goldberg, Shawn Andrews, Sasha Jenson, and Cole Hauser.

Now I Know that there were screw ups but still the movie sends out a message of how people have a good time and how people in athority try to control us but in a small way never do. Another thing is that this movie gave you that feeling of an adventure when the only thing that really happened was people riding around and hanging out.

The best thing is that every group is represented. The "cool group", the freshmen, the nerds, and all of course the jocks. The best thing about this movie is that there is a link between all three of the groups, which is often true in real life. The character of Randall "Pink" Floyd represents that jock who wants to stand up for his own beliefs rather than conform just to be a part of the football team. This movie continues in a funny, enlightening way ushering us through each scene with an awesome soundtrack. I think everyone should see the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands down, this movie is wonderful. Richard Linklater directs a solid cast through an amusing and often insightful script.This film is a great encapsulation of the American high school experience. It deals with the interplay between all the little cliques we grew up with; the stoners, the jocks, the football players, the pseudo-intellectuals, and the outcasts.Dazed and Confused is, above all, a study of the late 70's. However, its humor and lightheartedness are enough to make this film appeal to anyone. It's a great film to watch with good food, good beer, and good friends.</fullReview>

You get to see teens having fun, drinking beer and smoking pot. This is a time machine for everyone that was a teen in the 70's. The movie has a great soundtrack that I enjoyed to the fullest, especially when they end the movie with Slater sitting in the backseat of a Chevelle blowing out marijuana smoke while the Chevelle drives towards the horizon with Foghat's Slow Ride playing in the background. It's a really cool movie and I think every teen should watch it at least once in their lifetime. I give it a 10 because it's a great movie and I can relate so much to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all time favourite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed &amp; Confused is my favourite film of all time. I have no idea how many times I've seen it, but every watch is as enjoyable as the last. I was born five months after the seventies finished, in the UK. So as far as the social realism of the movie goes, I cannot comment. However in a very broad sense there are two things which make me love this film so very much.Firstly, it's just so damn cool. The cars look amazing, the soundtrack is great, the clothes are effortlessly hip and the male and female leads (or as close is this film gets to leads) are the two people you would have loved to know at High School, regardless of the social circle you were in. It is incredibly quotable and although not obviously funny (it was poorly marketed as a comedy), these days different scenes crack me up every time I watch it. It is also NOT a stoner flick. Yes there's a fair bit of pot smoked in it, but only because there was a fair bit of pot smoked at that time. Not a single scene has pot smoking as its focus ? it's just there, like the music, the clothes or the high school football stadium.Secondly and more importantly, it is a far more subtle and realistic examination of high school life than just about anything else I've seen (The Last Picture Show comes close in its depiction during the 1950s). Yes there are "jocks", "cheerleaders" and "geeks", but they are not so rigid in their definition. They are all interlinked by people who have friends in many camps. They all have their flaws but like the vast majority of teenagers, almost all of them are generally good kids (bar one whose redeeming scene was cut). Even though it's the last day of school, Linklater doesn't focus on the obvious graduating seniors. Rather on next year's seniors and next year's freshmen. This is not a huge day in their lives and nothing life changing is going to happen. The year's big party gets busted before it even starts and they spend most of the night just driving around or at the local pool hall. Perhaps the most astounding thing is the sheer number of characters that RL fits in to the film. There is not one conversation which I would label as clichéd or forced to inform you of character, yet I have counted 22 main roles and by the end of the film you feel you really know all of them.I could go on to write an essay about why this film is so fine, but let me just finally say this. There's no defined plot, there's no first, second and third act as such and there are certainly no great resolutions (because how many resolutions to life's problems do you really encounter when you're a teenager?). However there are cool conversations, fun times, obstructive parents and awesome Foosball!!</fullReview>

The only thing we didn't have was any hazing rituals with the underclassmen. Not that I knew about. The expressions, the gestures, the cars, even the pool hall were spot on. I also remember being that kid in the back seat who was kinda freaked out about the vandalism but wanted to belong.

		<fullReview>This is my review on dazed and confused. This movie is an instant classic. I think it is a very accurate representation of high school life for most teens. This movie is fun, funny and a great watch. This movie follows a group of friends in the 70s on their last day of school. They make sure to fill their day by smoking a lot of marijuana and drinking a lot of beer and going to parties. If you remember being a teenager this most likely sounds familiar to you. The movie follows them as they befriend a younger kid and kind of take him under their wing as it were.Now this movie does not have much of a story line or much of a back story. It kind of just follows the people around and you just watch and enjoy. There also is not much character development that is the reason I only give it a 7.Besides that though this movie is filled with fun moments great acting and a wonderful script. It is very believable and fun to watch. Its not exactly a comedy but it does have its funny moments and it is very enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this really is what high school was like in 1976 I sure am glad I didn't go to high school at the time. What a pathetic bunch of dumb half-wits, fools, idiots, scumbags, and annoying wimps the characters in "Dazed and Confused" are. Yes, I have just committed cinematic blasphemy, although I'm not sure why this movie is so respected and loved. There's a great soundtrack and then there's... um... I think that's pretty much it. I guess I just have to accept that I'll never like Linklater's writing or characters outside of "Tape" and "The School of Rock". Not much of a director either, really. I don't need to sympathize with characters or relate to situations to enjoy movies, but when a movie consists of nearly two hours of half-assed attempts at themes, one-dimensional and annoying characters (oh wait, they're not one-dimensional because Linklater gives them one or two lines that reveal them to be more human. I guess I'm too dumb for his amazing subtlety), it gets genuinely hard to sit through.It's great that people enjoy this nonsense. I'll stick to my "Freaks and Geeks" DVD's, thank you, or just that American classic which George Lucas gave us.3/10</fullReview>

The meaning is not lost on the straightest of viewers, yet it also extends to the American counterculture of the time period. Cheers to a worth wile flick. Personally, its best with a brew or two.If you are looking for a lighthearted romp or something in the background for that casual evening of beer and friends, this will fit the bill. Don't peer too far into this one and its more rewarding. Several drinking games (and less legal substance games) have been contrived for this film and may improve your experience. Watch at your own risk as lethal doses of fun may ensue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you went to high school in the 70's you will love this movie. The music and the type of characters that are in this movie brings back a lot of memories. My kids ask me if it was really like that back then {back then, you'd think it was in the stone age according to them!}and I tell them it was exactally like that. When I had gone to high school I had friends just like those that were in this movie and I also had been in many of the same situations that had happened in this movie. The first time I saw this movie I couldn't believe how right on it was for those of us who are between the age of 42 to 52. I predict this will become a cult hit, almost like that of "American Graffitti". Good music, interesting characters, accurate depiction of the time period, overall a really great flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>people who haven't seen this movie be warned for laughing your ass off, it's a great movie which makes you want to be a young adult in the 70's, what can i say flower power, rock, relationships and great friendship, not to mention pot and beer and respect. This movie also has two great soundtrack's which makes you sing out loud with friends or yourself, i should no i play it in my car a lot especially driving down those open country fields. Check it out!!!! hope it becomes a movie that its passed down the line of other young adults I'm now 25 and i still watch this film quite a lot. roll out the popcorn and crisps or cheesy puffs and enjoy a free ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie defined the atmosphere of high school life. I wasn't even born in the 70s but i was around for the 90s and this movie. We watched this movie time and time again and basically surrounded our lives around it...probably wasn't the smartest decisions we ever made but it sure was fun. My friends and I were the "in crowd and jocks" I remember waiting for senior year for many different reasons but all were covered in this movie. The last year of varsity football, the hazing of underclassmen, the sex, the parties, and the fun stuff we had always heard about but never experienced. We were seniors and we lived this movie out in real life everyday, but we were also freshmen at one time also so we also received the hazing ourselves. I wouldn't change anything about this period of time in life and this movie will allow kids 30 years from now to see how we were in high school and how crazy we all were and it will also remind parents to take it easy on that kid who comes in at sunrise because we have all been there and we have all had those nights were we ended it being Dazed and Confused!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in an out of the way theater in Seattle when it came out in '93. From the opening shot, I was hooked on the cars, music and feeling like I have been there. In '76, I was 3, but my older brother was 15 and my first memories of him were actually not far from these kinds of scenes. He wasn't an outgoing kind of guy, and never, that I know of, smoked weed, but the whole feeling makes me think of him to this day. Ironically, he passed away two years after this movie came out. His favorite song back then was Beth by Kiss. He was the reason I list Kiss as one of my top bands ever. I can imagine his life as being like this when he was not in front of the parents. This movie encompasses all of the seventies that I remember and brings it to life so that others can experience the nutty things kids did then. Much more simple than today's drama queens and computer-driven antics. The place to be was out of the house at the drive-ins and cruising, not locked in a basement with your buddies trying to beat the latest video game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a freshman at Huntsville High (HHS) the people in the movie were upset because they used their real names. Everyone that I go to school with has no personal problems with it. We've all seen it and apparently we found it funny and stupid. Our school runs a little low on hot guys so we found the actors amazing in this movie since we all know the guys here. Like everybody else here they are not to be harsh ugly coon-asses or rednecks. We would be so thrilled if Ben Affleck went to school at HHS. My Aunt who knows the men very well knows this is actually pretty close to the truth and rented the movie just for thrills. Dazed and Confused will keep little Huntsville, Texas famous for a while.

I am one of those anal retentive people with a thick mist between fact and fiction who is happy to muse over film trivia and film characters outside of the context of the film and Dazed and Confused is such an appropriate picture for this. By the way my poor grammar can be attributed to my Scandinavian origins. Dazed and Confused is a fantastic film. It isn't underrated, it isn't under appreciated, it's just under played and that's just fine.

		<fullReview>In Richard Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused' we follow a lot of teenagers. They drive around in their cars, they drink, use drugs and go to parties. In my opinion it is all not a big deal, may be because I am from a country where they tolerate soft drugs and where it is not illegal to drink beer when you are a teenager.That said I have to admit there was some fun in this movie. It was not boring and there are some nice characters here, although some of them are a little overdone. It was also fun to see actors unknown in 1993, but pretty known now. We recognize Ben Affleck, Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams, Nicky Katt, Anthony Rapp, Milla Jovovich, Parker Posey and Matthew McConaughey.I like all movies made by Richard Linklater and I think this is definitely not his best and one of the least interesting. That it is still worth watching says something about the director and of course the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another movie inspired by Joseph Campbell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is set in the '70s, but it is also very much about the '90s/ The '90s were the time when everyone in Hollywood was talking about Joseph Campbell and his ideas on mythology and ritual, and Dazed and Confused is full of that stuff.Everywhere you look there are tribal totems (the hair, the clothes, the music, pipes, the paddles)and tribal idols (the KISS manikins.) And every plot line is about a rite-of-passage ritual -- the paddlings, the hazing of freshman girls, the end of another school year.Of course, to Campbell every rite-of-passage ritual is a play that tells a story, the story that's part of every individual's life. Campbell saw myths about Hercules and Thor as allegories on human existence, and here we see the teen characters going through rituals and becoming the heroes of their own life. The classical hero of Greek mythology displayed early prowess; an example from the moving would be Mitch's performance as a freshman baseball star. And as the hero moves forward he faces challenges where he must act -- that's Pink being challenged to sign the pledge.Of course, those who refuse to move forward and go through the rite of passage are traditionally punished, and in this movie we see that happen with O'Banion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born in May of 1960... I'm 45 (going on 46) 30yrs later.... WHAT a wild ride my life has been.... Dazed and Confused STILL! I look at this movie and think.... Hell Yeah! Another Reg user "M. Wells" has already comment the true feelings... hmmm now we know the true meaning of the force.... May of 1976 I was 16years old.. (I was the retarded, no nothing, geeky, skinny, runt type kid) somewhat popular, somewhat naive.... I resemble a cross between Mitch and Tony, later on in coming years, Slater and Pickford, now Wooderson and Store Clerk... Party at the Moon Tower! man! (lol) Weed? if you were born in the 60's and NEVER smoked weed, pot, or toked a doobie.. your life was dull.... The year 1976 was the BEST time of my life in ways I wish I could go back and relive it again... My best friend was an "OLD" man 40-something... who "let" us smoke, drink, and well....... they didn't call the 70's Sex, Drugs, and Rock n Roll for nothing.... We was celebrating the 200years as a Country.. I was living and raised in Richmond, VA (close to the TRUE Beginnings of this Country) Since I was "only" 16 and couldn't "VOTE" Nixon, Ford, and Carter were the table talk of most of our "moms and dads" (yeah, this is where the family that eats together started falling away) Vietnam, Watergate, Molestation and Hazing was "hush-hush"..... The headphones! Big Bulky almost helmet-size with PUMPIN SPEAKERS... laying in bed, sitting in front, or standing and dancing or whatever you felt like doing while JAMMIN to Disco, Rock, Country, and R&amp;B (rap was slowly coming) in some forms Racial issues still exist, even in the movie... The hair, clothes, cars, and last days of school where did they go... (lol) Economy during this time is evident, in the gas prices, milk etc... SEX and Taboo Sex, Most males &amp; females my age was either a virgin or non-virgin....gay, bi,try-sex and the likes were fantasies if your were getting there...you GOT it....I was 12 when I became a non-virgin, to a "girl" who was in Highschool (15/16yr old) sister of my friend, by the time I was 16 in 1976 if you didn't have a girlfriend and you looked like Wooderson you got LAID! Roller Skating???? where was that at! EVERYONE who was someone was at the Roller Skate rink or Crusin the "strips" Beer party's and getting high was done after 10pm at someone's place or meeting place (Moon Tower)... Smoking "was" allowed in Highschool, in smoking areas, prohibited in Elementary, Middle, or Jr. High but some of us were retarded of this rule... and yes, it was cigarettes or weed being smoked...Thinking about it.... HIGH School yep it sure was! Well, this movie fits those of us who wish we could go back and relive that era of time and for those who still party like it's 1976! Hey did ya rock n roll....ROCK ON! ooh my soul!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused stars quite a few well known acting talents of today. I'm not really sure but it may have been the break out movie for some of them, like Ben Stiller. Don't get me wrong, I'm no fan of Ben Stiller specifically or in Dazed and Confused. My guess is he didn't have to act much at all to portray his flunky loser character in this film.Dazed and Confused is a look at a day in the life of some high school kids in the mid '70s. It's the last day of school, and the would be seniors are out for initiating the would be freshmen in a very typical hazing fashion, mostly using paddles and simply spanking them silly.The story continues to develop as the freshmen, mostly in vain attempt to avoid their initiations, which leads to some interesting scenes such as a more realistic than usual car chase scene. For example, no cars jump a ramp or explode. As well, being the last day of school means there's a huge party in the works, but is foiled by a hasty delivery person attempting to deliver several kegs of beer too early.Most of the characters seem to be fairly realistic, and most of us knew someone like them in high school. I'd almost swear they used my year books to model some of the characters after (I graduated in the early 90s)! The script is well written and in a couple hours, you should know some of the characters fairly well, the hippies, the jocks, the geeks, and the chicks. The acting is fairly transparent, again this reminds me of many great party nights when I was around that age group.This is a great movie and is a joy to watch. If anything, most people should be able to see a little bit of their lives reflected in the characters and situations in this film. If you like hot rods and had some good times at parties, watch this movie and enjoy it.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm another "class of 76'. I found this movie vile and despicable. I thought it would be about freedom-seeking and identity-finding (which is what the freaks, then, were all about). Instead, the movie shows us sadistic jocks. Jocks are not cool. They aren't now, and they sure as hell weren't then. I'll admit that I only watched the first 1/3 of the movie.., it enraged me so much to have to see minor children being assaulted by deranged lunatics. The scene where the boy and his friends are chased by the thugs in the black pickup to a boy's front lawn is where I stopped. I mean this in all sincerity: If the child's mother had blown a 10" hole in the assailant's chest.., I would have continued watching the film.Maybe Blue Oyster Cult was right: 1976 was not the Summer of Love, but there were still laws, and the freaks that I hung around with had good hearts. This movie does NOT speak for the class of 76, or any other class, for that matter.Oh.., and the kid who had the "Rock N' Roll Over" t-shirt on was definitely NOT on Cold Gin time: Rock N' Roll Over wasn't released until November.</fullReview>

OK, maybe it's a slow starter... then the next 15 minutes... still nothing, then the next 15 and so on until it was over. The 70s America seemed to be the best place that a teen could grow up in with the great sexual liberties and widespread drug usage and all. However this movie portrays teenagers of the period as incerdibly dull, the most "outrageous" thing they did throughout the movie was smash some mailboxes with a trashcan and smoke some pot. And that's it!! Although a huge part of the American culture at the time, LSD is only mentioned but no one even came close to doing it in the movie, and psychedelia in general is missing (a part from some clothes here and there). I can only hope that everyday teens from the period had more fun that this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare that I don't even get through a film. 'Dazed and Confused' is just one of two (the other being 'Fast Sofa'.) For the record, I gave myself THREE ATTEMPTS to get into this picture, and I failed each time.I couldn't see the point of this film. Having grown up and been in school in 1976, none of the character representations even seemed familiar. I'm sure plenty of teens smoked dope, drank, rated 'Gilligan's Island' and fooled around, but that's not ALL they did. Even the costumes are just phony 1990s nostalgic idealizations of the mid-1970s.The filmmaker could stand a lesson on how to avoid reduced characters. Awkward and thin representation of personality stereotypes is not conducive to making a strong film. (Coincidentally, I believe it was the young 'filmmakers' of the 90s who ushered us into the era of diluted screen writing. One might call it: "anything I do is good 'cuz *I* did it.") Also, the filming style is poor: colours are washed out, the lighting is wan, and the sound is thin.I can't recommend this film to anyone as I found it unwatchable. It's not even worth a rainy Saturday afternoon (even with a hangover). 'Dazed and Confused' is just another one of those vanity projects which make you question why a production company would finance it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the Most 'True-to-Real-Life' Film I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpiece for all the reasons that every other masterpiece movie is not. You cannot take the standard qualifications that you would use to rate 'The Godfather' or 'Interstellar' and expect to accurately rate this film. This is a movie that captures the high school experience from the viewpoint of teenagers without delving deep enough into their thoughts to actually try and say anything or teach a moral. It relies simply on dialogue, accurate depiction of the chosen setting, and the magnificent subtle diversities of each character. All three of these are done with glory and gusto. The dialogue are words that are easy to believe would (or even already were) said by real people. Richard Linklater also revived Austin, Texas '76 brilliantly through the cars, clothes, and especially the to-die- for soundtrack. But the characters are what blows me away, and it's the reason I can watch this film over and over again. I'll tell you why: I'm watching my own high school life. Now, I didn't grow up in the 70s, and I didn't smoke pot or participate in hazing (or get hazed), nor did I do pretty much anything that the characters do in this film. It's the quiet mannerisms, the lines delivered by each character and the way they are delivered, that makes me think of real people like even John Hughes never did. You see, Hughes focused on social cliques, especially in 'The Breakfast Club'. However, Linklater actually specifies individual people. Rather than say "I know a couple of John Benders" I can say "I know Slater, I know Wooderson, I know Jodi?" And you know what else? I'm in there too. Yep, I'm Mike. My best friend is Tony. This entire movie revolves around my high school friends, enemies, crushes? the whole nine yards. Maybe it's just coincidence, but I like to believe that this movie is not just about Richard Linklater's high school days. It's about all of ours. When I watch this movie, I find myself nodding along as Wooderson explains to Pink and me how he's thinking about getting back in school. I feel like I'm there, participating in those conversations, because the people on screen are people I know. Are these actors acting? I don't know. I could very well believe this is what McConaughey, London and Cochrane were actually like back in the day. This is a great movie because it's not a movie. It's real life. And it's because of this great realism that the movie gets all ten stars. (Admittedly, I had left it at 9/10 for some time. Given that I was not around in the 70s, I felt that no matter how much I watched this movie, I could never understand it's complete greatness given that I wasn't there. But then I thought...what the heck?) Anyway, 'Dazed' currently holds the position of my favorite movie of all time, and it comes highly recommended by me. That is all for now, Movie Riggs out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright, alright, alright...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The coming of age story is a difficult one to tell. Well that's not entirely true, it's a really easy story to tell, but it's hard to be original and innovative while telling a coming of age story. Yes there are films like George Washington, that just completely change everything, and transcend the very idea of filmmaking. But most coming of age stories just end up being carbon copies of films like, The Goonies, E.T. and Stand By Me. In 1993 the then newcomer Richard Linklater, tried his hand at the coming of age story. Linklater was never known for being conventional. So it should come as no surprise when I say that Dazed and Confused does not follow the genre clichés of the coming of age story.Dazed and confused tells the story of the last day of the 1976 school year in a suburban Texas town. That's a very broad summary of the plot, but Dazed and Confused has so many characters and stories, that it's difficult to say what the central conflict is, is it the new freshman trying to avoid the getting paddled by the seniors? Is it the football players who have to sign a sheet that says they did not take any alcohol or drugs during the last season? Is it about the stoners who are just looking for a place to party, after the previously planned one got canceled? Well Dazed and Confused has all of these stories and many more jammed into its small running time of only 102 minutes. This is already very different from most coming of age stories, the typical coming of age story will have all the kids come together to overcome some sort of challenge or obstacle, thus forcing them to grow and mature. And while all the stories are fun and entertaining the film could really benefit from having some sort of central conflict. I don't think anything should be cut from the film, as I said before their all fun and entertaining, but just something that ties all the separate stories together. Towards the end all of the characters all go out to drink beer and party in the middle of the woods. But this sort of just happens spontaneously, no build up, it's not interwoven into the story it just sort of happens. I know Richard Linklater was never known for being conventional, but the film would have been much more engaging if there was something that tied all the separate stories together under a common goal. I should say that not all people will be bothered by the lack of a central conflict, some people won't mind at all. Another thing I should say is that I don't think every film ever needs to be exactly the same, there're are plenty of great film that don't have central conflicts, some of which have been made by Richard Linklater. But Dazed and Confused just feels incomplete and a little unsatisfying. Dazed and Confused Is on the verge of genius, if it just changed a few small things it could have been much better than it actually was, I've already listed one of those things. And I know some people will disagree with me on that earlier criticism. But there are others that I think almost everyone can agree on. One is that the film is visually boring. The cinematography was done by Lee Daniel, who did wonders in Linklater's Before trilogy, but disappoints here. There are one or two memorable shots in the film, but the rest is bland dull and forgettable. Another problem would be the ending, there are so many times when you think it's going to end, and then it just keeps on going. There are so many times where the films fakes you out, by slowly fading out or having a main character resolve their conflict. Not to mention the last minute or two of the film is completely necessary and adds nothing to the film. Dazed and Confused is definitely a story and character driven film, so if you like those types of films you will almost certainly enjoy Dazed and Confused. But if you don't like those types of films, then you may or may not enjoy Dazed and Confused. But even though Dazed and Confused has its flaws, overall the pros do out way the cons. And even though Dazed and Confused is not Richard Linklater's best film, it is fun and entertaining and a must see for fans of him.7.4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazed and Confused Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused makes you think twice about your life, makes you want to stick it to the man, and most of all makes you hate Ben Affleck. This movie is a classic coming of age movie with some very brutal hazing and some classic party situations I think everyone can relate too. The story itself is not about any particular high school student, but rather a whole school of them and their many different stories and roles within it. The movie is set on the final day of school which consists of next year's seniors welcoming the incoming freshman? with paddles. Set in the seventies when teen hazing was far more casual, kids are chased down after school and earn their right to be a cool kid, with their ass. But, if you earn the right you are invited to the end of school party that night. And like a lot of high school parties, things don't go according to plan. First time partying is a huge theme in this movie along with your choice of smoking weed or not. So, naturally this movie built a stereotype around it that the movie is all about glorifying drinking and smoking. Now, while that stereotype is definitely well deserved, this movie seems to dive deeper into the minds of high school students. There is some dialogue of how teen hazing is just somehow accepted and swept under the rug in the community. You hear kids talking about what they want to do with their lives in college and whether they think it's even worth it to go. Most importantly, you get a much needed history lesson on how George Washington was the biggest stoner of all time and that's why America is so great. So was weed glorified in this movie? Yes! However, at the same time there is a general sarcasm to the stoner characters. The character Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey) takes burnout to a whole new level in this movie. You wonder how any of these kids graduated high school with a role model like him around. He's got a muscle car and a mustache that could make any woman queasy. The movie is almost worth watching specifically for him and to see McConaughey's break out role. If Matthew McConaughey isn't enough to get you to see this movie, then just know this movie has the best soundtrack to any movie I think I have ever heard. Every classic from the seventies is in this movie including songs like "Rock n' Roll All Night," "Rock me like a Hurricane," and "Slow Ride." The soundtrack sucks you in and makes you want be a part of the movie itself. You never even come close to thinking about ending the movie because even when nothing is happening there is a song to keep you glued to your seat. You might be wondering at this point why would I hate Ben Affleck after seeing this movie. He is the second year senior, O'Bannion, a bully that anyone can hate. The guy everyone can think back to high school and have a sour taste in their mouth because of the memories that are brought up. There is never a second in this movie that you think he has a good side or that he is hazing for tradition. He is out for blood and little boys' tears. That's why he's hated. He takes you back to the place as a kid where you were made fun of and creates a connection for you with the kids in the movie, whether you were paddled or not. This movie is all about growing up and O'Bannion is the type of guy I think all of us can remember. You will not regret seeing this classic comedy, you will find yourself quoting it for hours and remembering it for a lifetime. You might have a sudden want to get up and have the best time you possibly can. In the words of Wooderson, "If you haven't seen this movie yet, you'd be a lot cooler if you did. Alight Alright Alright."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film which has some keenly observed insights into not only teenage life but life in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Austin, Texas in May 1976, this is an excellent film which follows the adventures and misadventures of various groups of teenagers on the last day of school. Richard Linklater excels as both a writer and a director. The script is very strong and has some keenly observed insights into not only teenage life but life in general. The film does not have a plot per se. The characters don't learn anything, other than it is a bad idea to destroy mailboxes, and most of the time engaging in one fairly pointless activity after another. We get a snapshot of their lives rather than see a big dramatic event in their lives. In such "plotless" films, the most important things are the characters, whether there are two or twenty, and their interactions with each other. While it is not on the same level as Linklater's later and similarly character driven films "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset", it is nevertheless extremely effective in the manner in which it draws its characters, all of whom seem like real people which is perhaps not surprising since many of them are based on people whom he knew as a teenager in the 1970s. I don't think that there is a single false note in the entire film. It also benefits from a great soundtrack of hits from the era.The film has a large ensemble cast of talented young actors, many of whom went onto greater success. As Randall "Pink" Floyd, Jason London is probably the closest thing that it has a leading man. Pink is the star quarterback of the Lee High School who is poised to lead the football team to the state championships in his senior year. However, he is an individual who is not overly enthusiastic about the team mindset. As such, he is extremely angry when the coach presents the team with a pledge promising not to drink, take drugs, etc. during the summer since he sees it as a violation of his rights. Pink is also a nice guy, unlike many of the other characters in the film. After a freshman named Mitch Kramer is subjected to a particularly brutal paddling as part of an annual hazing ritual, he drives him home and invites him to hang out with his friends that evening, essentially taking him under his wing. Mitch, who is played very well by Wiley Wiggins who nicely captures the character's anxiety, is initially rather uncomfortable as cruising, drinking and smoking pots are all new to him. However, he is eventually accepted, after a fashion, by the older guys. I found that I related to Mitch the most out of all the characters in the film, actually.The other characters are a fairly colourful bunch, most of whom you could find in any school / town: Rory Cochrane as the nice pothead Ron Slater who says "man" three times a sentence, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp and Marissa Ribisi as the quasi-intellectuals Mike Newhouse, Tony Olson and Cynthia Dunn, Sasha Jenson as the blockhead jock Don Dawson, Ben Affleck as the bully Fred O'Bannion who was forced to repeat senior year, Parker Posey as his more subtle female counterpart Darla Marks and Matthew McConaughy as the 20-something loser David Wooderson. Mitch's elder sister Jodi, played by Michelle Burke, is basically Pink's female counterpart as she is a genuinely nice person who similarly takes a freshman named Sabrina Davis, played by Christin Hinojosa, under her wing. However, it was her well-intentioned interference that lead directly to her brother becoming the seniors' primary target. It also features nice small appearances from Joey Lauren Adams and Milla Jovovich. Renée Zellweger has a tiny role in the film but I didn't spot her even though i was looking out for her.The hazing rituals are very interesting as they represent the older students' attempt to gain dominance over the younger ones through violence and psychological manipulation. O'Bannion is the most enthusiastic paddler among the seniors and he gets his comeuppance as the film progresses. He is a bully who will probably turn out to be a loser and I think that he is acting out of frustration because he realises that he does not have much going for him. This is also seen in a less dramatic fashion when it comes to Darla. Wooderson is in some respects the most interesting character in the film as he is trying to recapture his high school glory days by hanging out with a bunch of teenagers. It is more than a little pathetic but that pales in comparison to his incredibly creepy predilection for seducing underage girls. At one point, he says, "That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age." In his film debut, McConaughey does not have a huge amount of screen time but he is excellent in the role. This attraction to younger girls is also seen, albeit to a lesser extent, when it comes to Tony's burgeoning "relationship" with Sabrina.Overall, this is an excellent film which nicely explores teenage life with all of its associated pain and confusion. The film takes its title from the Led Zeppelin song and it was certainly aptly named. The teenagers in the film seem like real teenagers as opposed to film teenagers. Some people say that your teen years are the happiest of your life but, at 28, I am much happier, confident and comfortable in my own skin than I was as a teenager and I am sure that is true of most people. In any event, I like to believe that the best is yet to come, not that it is behind me. That is true for some of the characters in the films. Others, not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally one of my all time favorite movies. Other than the partying that takes place and the memorable funny quotes the acting is superb throughout the film. Being the same age and almost in the same position as most of the characters it makes me appreciate how accurate they depict what it's like to be a senior in high school. Although this isn't one of the most critically acclaimed movies or one with a bunch of stars in it Dazed and Confused brought a lot out of some actors that a different movie with a different plot and script couldn't have done. One actor who I thought did a fantastic job was Rory Cochrane who played Slater. Before watching I had never heard his name, but throughout the movie while watching I thought why isn't this guy in a lot more movies. He plays the stereotypically "stoner" which obviously has its comical parts, but he displayed some intelligence and put it all together which made him a great supporting actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you had any real "fun" in your youth, this film will help you to reconnect with those moments. From the strained relations with upperclassmen and chasing the girls to seeking refreshments for the upcoming party, this film covers it all. It also showcases many early Hollywood greats before they made it big. The cars, soundtrack and wardrobe are well chosen as well. "Dazed" is the sort of movie that you can watch several times and still find new details to enjoy. The characters and scenes are so well developed that many viewers will be able to recall exactly which character reminds them of "that one guy" from high school. Some of the quotes and characters in "Dazed" will live on by taking on a life of their own in other forms of artistic communication for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1976 American youth culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused takes us back to the last day of school in 1976 at a high school in Austin, Texas. I am a child of the 70's so there is some nostalgic appeal to this film for me. The rock soundtrack, playing continuously in the background throughout the film, is what I liked most. Artists include Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Foghat, ZZ Top, Peter Frampton, Kiss,Ted Nugent, War,Edgar Winter, amongst others. The fashions and hairstyles of teenagers at the time are captured well. It was interesting to see the freedom the teenagers had in experimenting with pot and beer, not something I experienced at my high school. It was fun to see all the 70's muscle cars in this movie. Many popular actors of the present appeared as young actors in this movie: Matthew McConnaghey, Adam Goldberg, Ben Affleck, Milla Jovovich, Jason London, Joey Lauren Adams. Something apparently specific to 70's Texas depicted in this movie were the hazing rituals of the senior boys paddling the freshmen boys and the senior girls pouring mustard and ketchup and flour on the freshmen girls. Writer/director Richard Linklater does a good job of recreating the youth culture of 1976 Anglo- American America. This movie and Fast Times at Ridgemont High are my favorite high school movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A notable coming of age comedy from Richard Linklater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dazed and Confused" takes place during the last day of school in a Texas town during the summer of 1976. The next year's seniors are preparing to haze the incoming freshmen, while the incoming freshmen are devising ways to escape their inevitable initiation. Apart from that, the end of the school year naturally calls for a beer and pot-fueled celebratory bash.Taking obvious cues from "American Graffiti", the movie nevertheless has a different dynamic due to the later time period and the fact that the characters are still in high school. The characters' thoughts of the future may be less urgent but the movie does a good job of illustrating the rites of passage that go with this time in a young person's life. That it doesn't have quite the dramatic weight of "American Graffiti" is understandable since the script deliberately focuses on living in the moment rather than making life-changing decisions.The ensemble cast may have been made up of unknowns but many of the actors would soon make an impact in other movies. Early appearances by Ben Affleck &amp; Matthew McConaughey are particularly notable, while other familiar faces include Milla Jovovich, Adam Goldberg, Cole Hauser, Parker Posey, Rory Cochrane &amp; Joey Lauren Adams. Overall, the large cast is nicely varied and doesn't have any weak links.Richard Linklater's direction is solid throughout and produces some memorable visuals. Overshadowing the visuals, though, is the soundtrack, which is jam-packed with 70's rock classics. The discerning selection of popular music is another welcome similarity to "American Graffiti".In the end, I feel that "Dazed and Confused" may be just a little too laid back to completely engage the viewer but there's no doubt that the movie makes for a worthwhile viewing experience. It certainly shouldn't be dismissed as a throwaway teen comedy. There's real artistry behind Linklater's low-budget creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like George Lucas' 'American Graffiti', Richard Linklater's 'Dazed and Confused' is a loosely plotted retro slice of life tale that takes a look at one night in the lives of various intersecting young people.The first act introduces a lot of characters, and for a while that overload threatens to grind the movie to a halt. But once the players take the stage Linklater deftly handles them so that none ever feel shortchanged. I wouldn't say that everyone gets an arc (in fact, I'm not sure that anyone gets an arc), but everyone does get their time.There really is no plot here, no message to speak of and certainly no moral. Though it heaps on the 70s clichés a bit thick, it's a pretty honest look at an era (in this case, the 1970s) and a time in our lives when hedonism is a virtue and the most important things on our to-do list is hanging out with friends and scoring Areosmith tickets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfectly capturing the magical vibe of the 1970s, featuring an ensemble cast of future Hollywood big names &amp; celebrating the restless spirit of high-school life in an unapologetic manner, Dazed and Confused is a funny, affectionate &amp; expertly crafted coming-of-age drama that covers the adventures of various groups of teenagers during their last day of school in the summer of 1976.Written &amp; directed by Richard Linklater, the film doesn't have any plot but is simply a reflection of the time &amp; era this talented director himself grew up in and is his ode to those unforgettable years most people end up cherishing all their lives. The script itself is full of memorable quotes, interesting characters &amp; pop culture references and the drama is captivating enough to keep the viewers glued to the screen from start to finish.Be it the depiction of hazing, driving around, acts of vandalism, smoking weed, enjoying beers, philosophical ramblings or making out, every moment is meticulously captured, thanks to its fluid camera-work &amp; it's all edited too well to keep the premise alive &amp; kicking all the time. Even more admirable is Linklater's choice of music to go with the accompanying scenes and amongst its rich cast, it's Matthew McConaughey &amp; Jason London who end up impressing the most.On an overall scale, Dazed and Confused is a precise observation of 1970s American culture whose contribution to its genre as well as independent cinema cannot be understated. It shows life in high-school for what it is &amp; even the devil-may-care attitude of its characters has a genuine touch to it. Instantly gripping, wildly entertaining &amp; exhibiting no loss in quality, Dazed and Confused is one of the coolest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright, Alright, Alright!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Linklater is one of the best filmmakers around so I always try and see what his next project may be. So when I heard about this Boyhood film he had been working on I thought I would try and see some of his older works. After seeing all three of his 'Before' movies, I checked out Dazed and Confused. Not only is a cult classic but it's one of the most re-watchable films that I can remember. It has a brisk 100 minute run time, and with all the memorable characters, the screen time is shared incredibly well. No scene ever feels like it lasted too long or too short. So in that sense, it's near perfect filmmaking. It's also impeccable writing. Of course, there is the famous alright, alright, alright scene but there several other memorable scenes across the board.It helps that I saw this 21 years after it's release, so I realize how many people became famous after this movie. Ben Affleck and Matthew Mcconaughey are two of the top actors to get their start with Dazed and Confused. Obviously this film is about the transition between schools and the different peer pressures you may fall into. But it's also a much more laid back look at life than most films will give you. Alcohol and drugs are a flowing throughout the movie, which for me is nothing like my high school experience. But that doesn't mean the characters cant be relatable. Much of what the kids go through is similar to what we all go through at some point or another. It's also a very self aware film in that it doesn't try to get too serious at any point. The tone never shifts and it even pokes fun at itself at times. It's one of those movies that if you see it on cable, it wont leave your screen.So overall it's a really good film that doesn't try to be more than it is. My only complaint would have been that at times the stoners do seem a bit over-the-top. Besides that I cant find anything really wrong with the movie. Cant help but mention the catchy and classic soundtrack as well.+Memorable characters +Mcconaughey and Affleck! +Linklater directing and writing +Relatable +Soundtrack -over-the-top stoners 9.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70's set High School film that's pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused is a film packed with drug fuelled excitement, thrilling scenes and also a little bit of comedy added in for even more effect. Although I do feel this is maybe slightly overrated, it is still good and so I couldn't not recommended this to people to watch. It has actors who blossomed in the future to stardom and actors who even in this and it's crazy going's on, still give a great performance. I felt this was strongly pretty good and here below is why so.The story is pretty scattered and new things happen constantly all the time but within it all it can be pretty funny and also a good old fun high school film with typical characters we see a lot, although not overly dramatic like we so often see. I wasn't so keen on the end and it could be said it gets dull although it still stays fresh as it isn't a long film really. I think also it's chilled nature makes it easily watchable and anyone(of course over 18) can actually enjoy this, albeit not containing the most exciting of scenes.Jason London contributes to that chilled nature in the film and he keeps it very watchable, I also liked Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey's contributions as they are so angry and also chilled respectively and make this film much more watchable from the outset. I wasn't overall to keen on the acting front but it stays steady, some characters may seem a bit too wild and not fit in right but it is just like any other high school movie.Richard Linklater does this to in my opinion, not his best, although he certainly does it well and his great directing and writing shine in parts to make this film better as it goes along. I think writing wise it could have been better but he pretty much directs it perfectly and a screenplay to match could have made this one of his if not one of THE best films around. I liked the thrilling parts which usually have nice sets used and the suburban backdrop where they run amok is pretty nice too to see.My main negative point has to be the lack of comedy, it is classed as a kind of drama/comedy but really lacks laughs wise, you really have to have been like these lot at school to really enjoy it. As said also before, the acting, not bad as I also said but it harms it at times and even it could be said that certain people are hard to actually understand when they are either drunk as hell or blazed out of their minds on some drugs.Recommend it to people who like drug fuelled adventure but also anyone who enjoys a good high school film, maybe lacks the comedy we see so often in that genre but still has the same spirit throughout. I could just say, high schoolers go watch this, but I think this one really is for adults too, not just those who grew up in the 70's but also anyone who really likes a fun film that doesn't out stay it's welcome.Overall it is Strongly Pretty Good and it could be said it is kind of near being just Good. Any fan of Linklater may be hugely proud of him when they watch it, it is a good watch for his fans and his work never seems to let him down really. I think to say it was made quite a bit ago now and it still remains a cult film really shows just how much of an effect this film can lay down and also, just how much you can really enjoy it also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, funny, real teen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How I love this movie so. I watched it for about the tenth time just last night, with my ninth time or so being a couple of months ago with my teenage daughter, who loved it, too. I saw dazed in the theaters when it was released back in the day. I also have both soundtracks which I listen to often, as this is my era, my growing up, and my music. I'm a bit biased because I'd be the same exact age as the middle schoolers entering high school in this movie, and so much of the dialogue, activities, and such resonated. It is pretty timeless though. The movie is real, and touching, and really funny, and yet, essentially the a "last day of school" flick. I like Mr. Linklaters films very much, but when I see dazed, I enjoy it so much, and then get to reminisce about when I was a teen. So cool. It is spot on. There are definitely some aspects of the high school life unique to Texas or the south that are highlighted (spoilers, sorta) like a couple of guns, football supremacy, and the frat hazing, but the stoner camaraderie, the awkward moments, the anti authority, and having a blast doing nothing, is all so accurate. There are a number if non pro actors who somehow add real ness to the movie, and then a number of heavies getting early career roles in dazed. Love that combo. It is also not hard to lol every time Rory Cochrane does anything on screen. Mr. Mcconnaughy is also quite funny, and wise, in that never gonna stop being a teen way. Thank you Richard Linklater!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit: Dazed and Confused is a highly entertaining film and almost a class of filmmaking. Two things that are really hard to accomplish. Richard Linklater makes the viewer not only watch, but experience the film. You witness every single thing that happens. The viewer is not as someone watching the TV or the computer screen, but as someone into the 'confusion'. That is, perhaps, the magic of this film. I personally got fully immersed on it. And the best thing about it is that while a lot of things in the film are indeed unrealistic, Linklater made them look extremely natural and flowed perfectly fine into the story's context. Dazed and confused nostalgia pack is completed with a small hometown-like cinematography and a 60s/70s rock &amp; roll loaded soundtrack. Again, this film will push you into it.

		<fullReview>Loved this movie when it came out, but with each successive viewing it seems smaller and less than its first impression. Undeniably, the Criterion package is beautiful (the booklet worth the price alone), but I'm surprised that they chose to put this film out at all. The nighttime cinematography is a serious thing of beauty, the performances are mostly good to brilliant, the music plumbs the depths of 70's trash rock with curatorial zeal. Still somehow, the finished product cruises about midway between the offhand brilliance of American Graffiti and the adolescent goofs of Porky's. Watching the deleted scenes, I think it may be that the movie just isn't long enough. What did they leave out? The girls, of course. With the bulk of screen time spent with the male characters - hazing and being hazed, the hardships of being a jock AND a freak, drink and drug rants. Why no room for the other, equally looped perspective which was actually filmed? Kaye's ongoing rants about sexism and politics followed by Shavonne's mockery were unnecessarily, ridiculously sacrificed (the actresses must have been livid when they saw they finished product). Why - for the sake of a tidy run time? It's a shame, and the final edit mimics Lucas's AG so precisely in neglecting the actresses (seldom on screen unless they're relating to a male character) that it almost seems programmatic (read: studio mandate - girls are boring). Maybe it wasn't outside interference, but I have some hope that Linklater will someday sit down and eek out a longer cut. And while he's at it replace that last throw away shot through the windshield. What the heck is that? Looks like Slater grabbed the camera, for chrissakes.By the way, the reviewer who said the depiction was Not Realistic At All - he graduated in 73 and clearly missed all that shortly followed. The mid-seventies were a hybridizing period. Every guy but the scuzziest badass had a slick nylon button up shirt, even people who hated disco. Hippie style was subverted/perverted by consumer culture, the natural look gone cartoon tawdry. The worst thing you could do in 1976 was try too hard (see if you can sell that to today's crop of attention seekers). Everyone looked ridiculous, but mellow ridiculous. No, the look and styling of this film is pretty spot-on, though everyone is too clean and the girl's makeup is way too flattering (mascara in the seventies was so globby it looked like spiders died on your eyes). Also, the main character's ride between the two social camps was one of the subtle touches that really made the movie work for me. Stoners were called freaks, and jocks who did drugs were frocks. There were plenty at my suburban nowhere school - one of them was a homecoming attendant and a well known (to the students) user. It made him popular with everyone, not unlike Randy Floyd. Sorry man - you checked out a little too early to authenticate this party buzz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dazed And Confused - one of those movies that I'd been hearing about for years and never managed to actually see until 2011, 18 years after it was first released. The fact that the movie is set in the 70s means that it hasn't dated in any terrible way as it was already a "period piece". The fact that it's completely brilliant was a big surprise to me.Richard Linklater wrote and directed this coming-of-age story about a group of junior high students killing time on their last day of school and threatening the incoming youngsters who have a whole summer of dread ahead of them, thanks to initiation rites and general bullies. That's, essentially, all there is to the movie - it's a character piece built around that feeling of boredom, freedom, uncertainty and the confidence of youth.When I first put the shiny disc of Dazed And Confused in my player I was hoping that it wouldn't bore me too much. The description given, and my own comment above falls into the same trap, doesn't reveal anything about the quality of the movie. It makes it seem like something all about nothing.Featuring a superb soundtrack (especially for Aerosmith fans), lots of wonderful little moments and a fractured, interweaving series of character arcs, Dazed And Confused compares favourably to that other coming-of-age classic, American Graffiti.The script sounds authentic enough, the camera-work is capable if unspectacular but the big draw here is the cast, full of great actors and people who would go on to become leading stars in their own right - Jason London and Wylie Wiggins are the heart of the movie, Ben Affleck makes a great dickhead, Cole Hauser is fine, Rory Cochrane is hilarious as the majorly dazed participant, Adam Goldberg steals almost every scene he's in, Matthew McConaughey is fantastic and we also get Michelle Burke, Shawn Andrews, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey, Nicky Katt and a teeny tiny part for Renee Zellweger (she's the one pouring the beer into the tube and funnel arrangement for Parker Posey to chug).I've not mentioned everyone I should because the movie was so busy and so full of great incidents that I simply can't separate every detail I need to in order to give a specific breakdown of the plus points which, I think, is praise enough in itself and should encourage others to give this movie a go if, like me, they somehow haven't already seen it by now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many fine movies about high school years that do so many different things well,: e.g., THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, SIXTEEN CANDLES, the list is endless. But The obvious comparisons to DAZED AND CONFUSED are to American GRAFFITI and FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, because such movies intentionally focus more on the era, the times, etc., with generous doses of the music.D&amp;C just does so many things with limited effort. The acting and script are sloppy; i.e., with just a bit more hands on attention the scenes could've been filmed, acted, etc., much better. So easily could better minor plots lines been thrown in (see SIXTEEN CANDLES), not to mention a better major plot, however silly. The camera work, shooting, etc., is mediocre. I'm not talking about more expense: I'm talking about more attention, energy, effort, etc.I hate to use the word "unrealistic" because the film is by definition nostalgic haze, but there were so few extras, i.e., it looked like a school with thirty students and an eight person faculty. I give license to cast slightly older kids as high school students but the female "students" looked early thirties! I saw few town folk (a parent and cop or two)and fewer students not into long hair, counterculture, etc. I understand we're talking low budget here, but the absence of these background props becomes obvious and annoying.I don't want to condemn this flick. Certainly over-hype was largely responsible for my let-down. But D&amp;C is just not in the same league as the other mentioned movies.</fullReview>

Despite the film's inherent nostalgia factor (groovy lingo, far-out fashions, funky soundtrack), the movie never lapses into campy shtick, though it does swing wildly between comedy and drama, and writer-director Richard Linklater shows many of these people absolutely no mercy (is the cruelty justified by the comedic undermining? Some may say yes, but I found it off-putting). Linklater thankfully does not try to emulate other films in this genre (specifically "American Graffiti" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"), yet the fact this isn't a retread doesn't make it less sour. It's too bad the characters aren't allowed to take shape or blossom, instead becoming recognizable stock-figures in a '70's vacuum (then again, maybe that was Linklater's point). Terrific detail and a knowing sense of the period make it just tolerable. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I graduated from high school in 1973 and this movie hits the nail right on the head it is exactly like it was when i was in school.I loved it we used to have party's just like that out in fields and woods and county parks.I am from Michigan but it was very similar to the films location in Texas.I don't remember the initiations being such a big deal at my school although there were some but the rest of it was pretty close to what it as like at the time.The soundtrack was great I seen most of those groups in concert in the 70's in Flint,Mi.I have watched the movie several times and so far haven't got tired of it .I would recommend it to any one around that age and I think they would be able to relate to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, in my opinion, counts a s timeless on multiple levels. Regardless of your age when watching this film or whether or not you were alive during 1976 you feel a sense of relationship to the characters. Despite not being born until 7 after this film takes place, I can really connect with its message throughout. There is a lot more to this movie than just drugs and alcohol, its about acceptance and being happy with the person you are and doing what makes you happy. This is a film everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime. The characters in this movie, especially Pink Floyd are not faced merely with battles against society but also against themselves in the sense of finding who they want to be. I think D&amp;C captures an accurate portrait of teenage life and all of the confusion, temptation, fear, and pressure that go right along with it. Linklater really got it right, which is not a surprise, by not just making this strictly a stoner mover but a portrait of Americana. D&amp;C is a lot more than a movie, its a proud statement for being the people we all want to be, not who we are told to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazed and Confused is Completely Accurate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is actually a dumb movie, but I absolutely love it. I graduated from high school in June 1976 and can totally relate to this movie from beginning to end. The music is just what we listened to in my senior year; brings it all back. The "stoners" and how they interact with each other - dead on. The "cliques" between grade levels, and also between the cool kids and the not-so-cool kids, also just perfect. And the parties -- well, what can I say? Pass the word around and "come one, come all!" It's all just how it was. Looking back on it now from my perspective as a "forty-ish" adult (and not to mention a mom), I can see how ridiculous it all was. But myself and all my friends from that era turned out okay. Ah, the good old days ... Would love to visit again, just once - but only for a little while. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one that I could re-watch over and over, because it reminds me of junior-high (in the 70's) and high school (in the 80's). I could relate to every character and could picture a particular student I went to school with to every character in the movie. In fact, every time I watch this movie I cry. It is such a powerful reminder of what we had at that time. We had it and now it is gone. 1976 is gone. The best years of our lives, gone. I wanted out then, but would give anything to return back. Dazed and Confused lets me re-live my life from 1976-1985. It is one of my favorite movies, by far, so go RENT IT, dude!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie about ten years ago. Unlike the characters in the movie, if I wanted money when I was in high school, I had to get a J-O-B to get it. My parents divorced during the period that this movie takes place.Of course, the teens in this movie all seem to have rich or generous or blind parents. That is something that I wish I could had growing up. Instead, it seemed that whenever I wasn't in school, I was working. It would have been nice to have a life like that. Unfortunately, my parents overdid it with the caring( read controlling) part and didn't seem to know to trust us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotta add my comment although its all been said. This movie is genius, I'm just glad to hear it from people who WEREN'T there (too young, etc.). This is pure time travel for me as well, but to get all that right, the details and nuances, that is Linklater. AND I am from Westerville, Ohio so really I needed Linklater to show me that this was a common experience, because when you are from Huntsville, or Westerville or whatever, and it is that crazy while you are growing up in neo-mall America at a point in time that specific, you don't really EXPECT other people to have your experience, and certainly not down to the haircut of the guy who already graduated who still hangs out with "us". Frampton, yeah, sure, of course, whatever, but not the way we stared. I swear kids don't make that face anymore. Anyway, so awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything in this movie is spot-on for this 1977 high school graduate. I just want to know who moved my high school from Charleston, SC to Texas! As others have remarked, the soundtrack is remarkable in that it covers the stuff we listened to. I will vouch for the fact that sex was easy to get, beer was slightly more difficult, and weed was a little harder, but widely available during those times. There are three portrayals/scenes that hit home with me -- The portrayal of the football coaches as conservative Neanderthals, the threat of deadly violence following a random act of senseless vandalism (such really happened to me and my "buds") and the whole discussion of exactly why George Washington was growing hemp at Mount Vernon.

		<shortDescription>I don't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am in a rather untenable position here. I agree with all of the positive things said in the other reviews, but the film just does not jell together properly. The party in the woods was real; the hazings, although they did not happen in my experience ( I graduated high school a year before the film takes place) are not unrealistic, and the few glimpses we see of adults are not bad. The hangouts were all there, as was the magical attraction to most events including alcohol. However, there was no underlying theme here; just a series of scenes, all realistic and interesting individually, but not adding up to a cohesive entity. What was the point of all this? There are a few reference to standing up for yourself and wondering what the furture holds, but there was nothing that gave the film a direction. I know it could be argued that the point of the film was that there was no overwhelming direction in these guys' lives, but the film didn't even make that clear. A few other things just didn't work here: Pink is way too small to be a star quarterback. Come on, now. A scrawny guy like that, wearing a necklace to boot, in a Texas town, just wouldn't be playing football. The Ben Affleck character is real enough, but he is disposed of halfway through the film. Wouldn't his comeuppance have been better placed at the film's climax? The fight scene at the end is pointless -- I know, many drunken fights are pointless, but if you are going to position this at the final 20 minutes of the film it should have some emotional power to it. Also, not trying to seem like a purist here, but NOT EVERYBODY SMOKED POT IN THOSE DAYS. Since it is a heavy influence on this film, one has to compare it to "American Graffiti." That film did have a sense of direction, of meaning, and some astute comments about growing older, maintaining one's sense of innocence, and remembering an era. This film is more aimless. It is possible that it tries a little too hard -- giving a little information about a lot of characters and thereby coming up with nothing, instead of paring down the characters and making us feel a little more sympathy for them. I felt nothing for these characters, in spite of the time-period connection I should have felt.</fullReview>

I don't believe (but i couldn't really know) it's a 100% representation of what it is like in high school, but in my (Dutch) experience of that age it had surtenly a lot in commit (except the beating up of smaller kids, we just tipped their school bags...). It isn't always like that, but things like smoking pot and molesting stuff are not a bad representation, as some may think, it's just that not everyone participates in that(The people who don't have a very minor role in this movie). If it sets a bad example?; i think some kids do that anyway, and i don't think they'll end up in jail, nor should (and millitairy school.... please... don't get ' Spartanien about it). But maybe you shouldn't watch this movie as a good representation of what it's like (in hs in the 70's), or if it sets a bad example, it's just good fun. Don't make a big deal out of it, just enjoy. But for me it most surtenly made me thing (and laugh) about the thing i did (and do). oke that was it (and excuse me if some English (or a lot)was incorrect) bye...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real life does not have a plot either. We are so brainwashed by Hollywood that we don't understand it when a movie doesn't have a plot. It had great acting and great scenes. I went to High School in the 80's and college in the early 90's. This movie reminded me of college in a big way. Even though it was the 90's, we had the drugs, parties, hazing, music, unbelievable stories that paralelled this movie. The grunge scene of the early 90's was very similar to the rock scene of the 70's. The situations were funny because they were true to life. The actors spoke as if they were not on screen, almost as if we were spying on them. The movie makes you feel like you are one of the gang and you are watching your friends, which is very comforting. One thing I haven't seen anyone comment on is the parallels between the characters Randall "Pink" Floyd and Mitch Kramer. I found it to be very cool how similar they were. Both are top athletes of their class, both received heavy hazings from the seniors, both of them are the "cool" person of their class that everyone likes and respects. You get the impression that Mitch is going to have a blast in high school and be liked very much. Just like Pink. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but the first time I tried to watch this movie 20 years ago, I thought, "What high school is this supposed to be? It resembles my high school sort of. But it's all wrong.The other night, I decided to watch it again, and I can confirm definitely, this movie is trying to be about my high school, during my high school days. It's clear that that's what it's trying to be.Unfortunately, it doesn't even come close. The clothes are wrong. The hair is wrong. The cars are wrong.And the worst is, the characters and the situations are wrong. It's as though all my friends in high school were replaced by fashion model robot people, doing and saying things no one would ever do or say.Or maybe it's like someone in 1976 decided to make a lame fruit punch commercial for stoner high school kids. Mmmm Mmmm.One test is does a movie about a certain era actually succeed in taking you back to that era. And for me, that is the ultimate failure of this movie. As I watched it, it actually pushed that era away, and tried to replace it with something false, canned and plastic.I often find it annoying when people review a movie based on a book. I think a movie should stand on its own, and I don't usually care whether it sticks to the plot or not. I only ask is the movie good, in and of itself.Maybe this movie is good in and of itself and I'm not giving it a fair viewing. But in this case, the "book" is my life.

Yes, here they all are, only shown on the cusp of adulthood, being equal parts engaging, and cruel. The movie as well reflects on just how prevalent drugs are in modern America, and how the typical user is not always only whom you most likely suspect. Drugs being a are far more egalitarian an affair than most people will admit to themselves.The beautiful summer day and evening are integral to the story, how when one is young, there is nothing more desired than to be "out," out, anywhere, just simply as long as it is "Out!" You know, that time when the air is sweet, warm, and the night simply teeming with potential and portent! And so it goes, the torment, the first kiss, running from the Neanderthals with paddles! Of which this, the paddelings are a large part of the film, central to the story. A tale of how, those becoming Seniors are allowed by this community to menace the freshmen with specially made wooden paddles (Made in shop class no less!) really scary stuff if you were a young man entering into this crazy milieu!What happens to ones dreams? Is what we do ever meaningful, truly? At many levels this film attempts to answer these questions in a manner which as previously stated as with real life equal parts joy, and pain.</fullReview>

It could have been directed by whoever did Revenge of the Nerds or countless other films celebrating high-school cruelty, initiations, hazing, abuse, and the wonderfully brutal rites of organized humiliation. The fact that it rings so true for my fellow Texans is a sad indictment of their pus-infected home towns. Their laughter merely suggests that they survived, and thus can enjoy watching it all happen again to others.</fullReview>

The kids end up in a random series of drinking, smoking, partying and mayhem. Darla Marks (Parker Posey) leads the girls in the hazing. O'Bannion (Ben Affleck) is eager to paddle the youngsters while Pink Floyd (Jason London) is much nicer who takes Mitch under his wings. The nerdy trio Cynthia Dunn, Tony Olson and Mike Newhouse (Adam Goldberg) try to join in with varying success. David Wooderson (Matthew McConaughey) is a former graduate still hanging around.It's amazing to see how many great future stars Richard Linklater has gathered together. The story has no real structure but just a random series of events over the day and night. In the end, that's the only way a movie called Dazed and Confused could be structured. It's packed full of great memorable moments and the soundtrack is incredible. McConaughey provides some of the greatest iconic moments of the movie. alright alright alright</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see "Dazed and Confused" upon release (for good reason: I was 12 and all of this would've been lost on me). But this movie is more than the stoner comedy I'd always thought it was. Pictured herein are the anxieties of high school: hazing, authority, the future; it's a sample of brutal life within that culture, and that authenticity is what deepened the experience for me. It also puts you right there with these characters on that last night of the school year, ennui and freedom both hanging thick in the air.And even though it's a collection of future stars (primarily deadbeat McConaughey and sadistic Affleck, but also every young face of the '90s) the soundtrack is really the star here. A sweeter assortment of songs from the period I have not seen.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Live Rock 'N' Roll !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazed and Confused starts with the song Sweet Emotion by Aerosmith playing in the background while we get a visual montage covering a whole bunch of characters who are in the film and then when we see them interact with each other, it becomes very clear that this film is about youth, it is about counter-culture and the wild lifestyle that youngsters get seduced by during their high school or college life. But the film is also about the 70s. The dresses, the long hair, the bell-bottoms and innumerable classic rock music references oozes the carefree spirit of the 70s. There are also a few subtle, understated hints at growing feminist ideas.There are a lot of characters in the film. Generally, the experience that I have had with films with a huge ensemble cast is that there are always characters who are more interesting than the others and there will also be characters who are not as interesting as the others. This is also the case here to some extent, but overall I found the cast to be a good, enjoyable company. You get characters belonging to different groups in the high school environment. Ther are the arrogant jocks, the shy and nervous freshmen, the intellectual and studious kids as well as some kids who don't belong to any specific group. Slater is undoubtedly my favourite character. He is always absent minded and intoxicated with marijuana, but he comes up with these absurdly funny lines which are utterly bonkers, but which are in his head very philosophical. I thought most of the characters had their own identities and personalities. It is difficult to build an emotional attachment with any particular character due to the presence of so many of them. But to me the chemistry between Sabrina and Tony seemed extremely adorable and interesting. It was also great to see Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey at a very early stage in their respective careers and this film also marked the birth of McConaughey's now infamous catchphrase.The screenplay I thought is well written and the film moves at a fair pace with reasonably sufficient attention given to every character. The lines and dialogues are a bit over the top, but that might have been intentional, just to underline the superficial need for the characters to look cool and bad-ass. Richard Linklater also shows that underneath that flashy, cocky surface, the characters are all uncertain about their futures, they don't know where they are headed, but all they want is to enjoy the moment.Linklater was a relatively new director at the time and he had not yet become as polished and as sophisticated a director as he has since become. So I did find some loose edges to the directorial work in the film, but as a whole he succeeds to create this nostalgic 70s vibe in the context of the high school seniors passing out. The acting is on an average good, however there are some actors whose deficiencies with regards to acting skills are also apparent.So as a whole, this is not a flawless film and Linklater has subsequently gone on to do much better work, but it is certainly one of those films that will rekindle this sense of nostalgia in the hearts and minds of the viewers. Quite clearly this has inspired TV Shows like 'Freaks and Geeks" and a number of high school films like the "American Pie" film series.We have all gone through that rebellious stage of our school and college lives when we just couldn't find satisfaction in anything other than Rock 'n' Roll and when conforming to the rules and regulations of the older generations seemed unthinkable. No matter the age of the viewer, this film will certainly make you live those memories again.</fullReview>

I missed too much of the game on this piece of crap?!?! I really hope all the reviewers who praised this as reality do not really remember high school. I graduated in 1975 and other than kids looking for a party (this has probably always been true) and the music, this movie is from another planet. Seniors that interested in bullying incoming freshmen and everyone knowing about it and not stopping it? Please. NFW! I know political correctness was not in bloom yet but this would never happen.

The dude with the long black hair is mental and the main young lad (Wiley Wiggins) has a small part in the Faculty!!! The main part of the plot is that the freshmen get MAJOR TORTURE from the seniors. The boys get beaten up and the girls get humiliated - bit of a sexual bias for you there...anywho, i gotta toddle off now so ttfn!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I haven't seen Slacker, Linklater's previous look at 1976 high school, but I was impressed that a very peculiar time of cultural history has not been forgotten; indeed, has been immortalized, high school and the sociological angst of teenagers. Because the teen years are a joke to begin with, even tragedy seems perversely amusing through the looking glass of time. The boys resemble David Cassidy, or Roger Staubach. The girls all look like Stevi Nicks. The patter is accurate with stoner kids talking like black folks sort of. I'm high man, so high, blah, black, pass the bong. You get the idea.The hazing incidents, boys getting paddled, girls getting slimed, seem to be a small town, Mid-Western ritual, I'm not familiar with in my secure East Coast cottage, but I thought it was fascinating when the senior, dominatrix in training chick, whips the little freshman girls into shape, hmm, perverse.Every teen film has to have a party and these kids get bombed outdoors, a massive Jagger and bong fest. One of the last scenes, a romance on a blanket was unexpected, and I will not spoil it. Is there anything new or important here to learn about kids or their world? No, not much, but film is amusing at times, and it certainly nails a time and place. Watch for future stars like Ben Affleck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoot the messenger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Giving this movie a bad rating feels a bit like shooting the messenger, but I cannot remember a movie that made me more angry since - well, ever. Is this an accurate depiction of American high school life in the 70s? I am from Europe and I was born the year this movie is set in, so I couldn't tell.What I do know is that hurting and humiliating someone who is weaker than you is wrong. Doing it just because you can and because this is supposed to be fun is even worse. In this movie violence for fun is the basic premise of the plot. I could live with that, if it were shown in a reflective and discerning fashion. This is not the case. Everyone from the teachers to the parents to the seniors and even to the freshmen accepts and embraces this culture of violence. The movie makers do not convey disagreement with those practices, therefore in the best case they feel indifferent to it. The only ones who choose to refrain from violence are the nerds, but they are depicted cowardly, not courageous.I couldn't help but think of scenes from several holocaust movies I've seen. There are people hurting and humiliating others just because they can and because it makes from feel strong. However, in movies like Schindler's List or The Pianist the inequity is obvious to the viewer. In Dazed and Confused it is not. It's just a couple of kids having fun, right? Right?</fullReview>

Or maybe if you need some fashion ideas to start an retro indie band? I don't know, I'm just trying to find something worth watching that movie but overall I really wouldn't recommend to waste your time on this. And how are you supposed to write 10 lines comment about a total absence of movie plot?

		<shortDescription>Understandably an American '80s classic - wait a minute, this is a 1993 film? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy? Really? In the first part I noticed that over-the-top stoner and thought this may not be so very funny. Then I saw a guy in wood class preparing a baseball bat and felt a little funny about that - a feeling that was soon acknowledged by the hormone-driven seniors promising ass-whoopings for all juniors, and one in particular.But 'Dazed and confused' turned out to be an edgy, 24-hour coming-of-age drama with plenty of particular highs (especially in the categories acting and writing), with the only low remaining that typical, not so funny stoner (was he a blueprint for Jay ánd Silent Bob though?) and some poorer acting here and there. Uncomfortable, yes, at many times, but very well worth the watch.The open ending (but with a few clear and spirited hints from director Richard Linklater) is a perfect choice, as were so, so many of the soundtrack songs. I could go on talking about how many actors I recognized in later films, but then again, a lot of others I have never seen before (or should I say: later on).A thoroughly good film, understandably an American classic, though I would have figured it was made in the '80s. 8 out of 10 from this Dutch duderino - peace out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie recently because I read many times how good and funny it is supposed to be and I'm also a fan of Richard Linklater's work. So I expected a decent "stoner" movie with a good soundtrack and some good jokes. However, all I got was the good soundtrack.I actually quit watching after 50 minutes as I was too bored of this movie. Sure, there is a good soundtrack and this movie might even carry some of that 1970s feeling (even if it didn't really catch me), but there is just nothing happen! I'm not American so I have no idea about these high school traditions and probably can't really identify with it but anyway, the movie for me was quite boring. So I give it 3 out of 10 cause I still love Linklater and it was funny to see the "Ben-Affleck-thing" with the worst haircut of its career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very depressing recapitulation of the horrors of growing up during the 1970s. Dreadful clothes, awful haircuts, unlistenable music, teenagers abusing each other--hey, I don't want to remember all that stuff, thank you very much. Dazed and Confused attempts to update the American Graffiti trope, and I suppose you could say it succeeds, because American Graffiti is one of the most overrated films of all time. The only cast member who acquits himself reasonably is young Wiley Wilkins, who brings a refreshing innocence to his role as a nerdy baseball player who gets pounded on by the senior boys for no apparent reason. Otherwise, the paper thin story treads familiar and predictable ground, with the emphasis on sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Whoop de doo.</fullReview>

There is no story, really, and Linklater's portrayal of high school is utterly retarded. Maybe it's just been too long but I sure don't remember being taunted with hollow threats like, "I'm gonna make this next year hell for you, FRESHMAN!" That's the kind of thing you ONLY hear in extremely stupid movies and television shows.

		<fullReview>Man !!! I saw so much college/university movies about fraternity of guys doing parties and drinking beer being trash down the toilet when they where excellent on IMDb that i can't put my 2 cents here. All these movies i mentioned before, i liked them, all the American pies, all the Van Wilder, College, Accepted, Fired Up, and much more movies than sometimes dosen't even get the half(5/10) on IMDb... Dazed and Confuzed is from 1993 after all, its not like it was actually a 70s movie, so you can't consider it too much of a classic, and even then. Im sorry but sure i laugh a couple time, sure when i see dudes smoking weed and don't give a crap about rules... that remember me of something, but outside that, it feel like another random teenage movie and even there... Sure they smoke weed for most of the movie but after that.... The whole pledge thing is beyond stupid. Sure i accept fraternity movies about pledging, and in the case of American pie beta house it got funny. I also got "Going Greek" and its still funny. But in this movie, thats the point of just wanting to spank the pledge with some kind of cricket baton... i don't see it. If its just about hitting them whiteout having them crying or something, just give them a beating and ends of the line... but even there you need a reason... I mean the whole initiation pledging process is just so dumb that any normal person would find it stupid. After that the whole story seem all a waste to get Mitch(the only character i noticed his name) together with a girl and thats it... Call me classic... but we need something to fill the middle, like a bad dude doing "bad stuff" so the girl in question get mad and don't see him anymore, and then he conquer her heart again... i dunno. It just felt like over an hour an a half of 70s boys and girls smoking weed just for fun and that was the movie. I didn't totally dislike the movie, it had fun parts, but overall i felt we never get hooked to the main characters(there too many) except Mitch and the plot seem to got straight to the video club down the street.... which mean not far... For a movie i head so much good and score kind of hight on IMDb... I'm very disappointed</fullReview>

No plot, very little humor, and even less interest.Almost everyone gets into their roles with gusto, especially Matthew McConaughey and Parker Posey. Sometimes they're fun to watch, but most of the time you're just wondering what was being smoked when the script was written. Was there a script? Was there even a point? Or was this just a panegyric to 1976? If so, don't pretend there's a movie there.There's too much dramatic irony - winking at us because of what the years afterwards were like - and too little characterization to make the viewer care about what happens to these people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an attempt to be a 70s throwback but all of the effort has been put into the "look". The rest of the movie just wasn't true to the times. The lingo is not 70s lingo. I graduated in 75. There were some stoners and some girls may have had sex back then but it was before birth control was readily available and pregnant girls were KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL. They certainly didn't discuss their sexual prowess openly. "Spit or swallow" wasn't a common thought because oral sex wasn't what all the kids were doing. It's what they're doing now. What they would have all been doing was smoking. Kids didn't sneak off to the bathroom to smoke because smoking was still legal and steroids weren't even a concern. We had a smoking area in the school (not outside the school, IN the school). In those days there were also severe consequences for football players getting into trouble. There was no drug "Problem" - certainly not among the athletes. I went to a huge school and it was still the exception, not the norm. There was a clear distinction between athletes and "stoners". In those days athletes were role models. They would have been kicked off the team. There was no need for an anti-drug pledge. Anyway, long-term effects of drug use hand't been researched enough to be THAT big of a deal or publicized enough to be a public concern. Kids didn't swear openly because there were severe consequences including from the parents. The "F" word certainly didn't get used right out in public like it was a common word - it was still called the "f" word. We still used the word "homo" for gay and a black guy hanging with the "in" crowd - didn't happen. We didn't say "social function", "major bullshit" or "sux". We didn't roll cigarettes in our sleeves and drive-in restaurants, even then, were old-fashioned nostalgia from the 50s.Basically the movie is a 2000s theme dressed up in 70s clothes. It might have been produced by someone who lived it but they obviously don't remember it that well themselves.</fullReview>

First of all, if I wanted to see a bunch of high school deadbeats do nothing but get stoned, I would just go back to school and videotape them. The movie offers a non-existing plot, just a countless number of irritating characters placed in random circumstances. I don't mind a large ensemble cast but I do mind when I'm given too many one-dimensional characters with no purpose whatsoever. The movie only makes you want to beat up some of these kids in bad 70's hairdo's and tight clothes. The only treat coming out of this lame and uninteresting movie is an early look at up-and-coming actors like Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey. The rest seem to be actors with minimal acting experience trying to come up with things to say as they go along. You literally have to be dazed and confused in order to like this movie.

		<shortDescription>Dazed and Definitely Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I knew about this film was that it was a pot smoking, 1970's-set film starring Matthew McConaughey. After finally seeing the nearly 20-year old film, I was virtually left Dazed and Confused on the only other "fact" I knew about it: this was supposed to be a comedy.This movie NEVER made me laugh. I will admit it did have me snickering a few times, namely a pregnant woman who was simultaneously smoking and being lectured on the healthy habits of calcium and another girl getting her tight jean's zipper up with pliers. Other than that, I found absolutely nothing funny about the lame story of horny and disorderly punks leaving their junior year of high school and entering summer, all in one night.Allow me to back track, I'm guessing some of this is about Juniors in High School, and some about Seniors. My suspicion was that this was SUPPOSED to be about seniors, as some of the graffiti and Junior High Abuse indicated, but the majority were being coached on their final year in High School and their football careers.So, I guess this was about all ages ? Junior High to Freshmen to Juniors in High School to Seniors to Already Graduated Losers. Was that the intention of the writers?Not sure, but I am sure, I only saw this as a drama about a bunch of unruly, irresponsible adolescences who spend one night in May drinking, pot-smoking, complaining and destroying lives and property for the sole purpose of?nothing.So much so, there was a great quote two-thirds in and I love it when a character sums up the movie in the dialogue: "Fairly uneventful, huh?" Yep, that defines the movie.Heck, despite the clichés, the movie was pumping for a "raging" or "epic" party, but was shut down by one kid's mistakes, so the "graduating" kids simply drive around for the rest of the film, destroying anything or anyone in their path.Okay, fine, they do make it to one minor field party, but that was about one-one-thousandths of the "Woodstock" I'm sure it was trying to imitate.Going back to my original take on this, prior to my first (and only) viewing of Dazed and Confused, I thought Matthew McConaughey was supposed to be in this. Well, he was. Kind of. You just have to wait until half the movie was over and even then, he's such an extremely minor backdrop, he barely matters.In fact, no one really matters here. The film just follows these uninteresting teens through the course of one night of debauchery. Booooooring. If this really happened to me, and I was their age in 1976 (I had just turned two at the time), I would say the same thing then: This is boring. And apparently, I'm not alone: these characters feel the same way.Maybe, that was the point. Maybe they just wanted to show us the average night of no-nothings with no futures. Fine. If that's the point, I'll just watch You-Tube.To fans of this movie, please send me a note to explain what I am missing. I think I pretty much summed it up by saying this was about nothing. At least when Seinfeld made a career of that, he made it funny.</fullReview>

This is the only reason I give it two stars.After that, it's an entire waste of time. It's not even funny. All there is is people being stupid, drinking, smoking, cruelty for its own sake, and encouraging other younger people to do the same. There's really no plot, character development, or reason to empathize with most of the characters. I kept hoping to see someone say or do something truly thoughtful or worthwhile, but it never happened.

		<fullReview>This movie was just plain awful. No story, no point; certainly not a comedy. It is also quite sad that so many people can relate to this film. Rampant drug use, school hazing, endless nonsense parties; this certainly is not how life or school life is today, nor do I hope that society ever goes back to such a time. Do the people who grew up in the 1970s really want their teenagers to act like this? Do they really look back on such times with fond memories? This story may appeal to a select few who grew up during that time, but any one born after 1970 (or before 1955 for that matter) would do well to take a pass. This is about as timeless as a sundial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I've heard and read so many good things about this very dull film. Not only is "Dazed and Confused" boring as hell, with virtually nothing at all happening for at least 30 minutes, it strains so hard to depict the 70's that it comes across as something along the lines of a high school play in the 90s.That's not to say the "fly on the wall" technique is a bad thing, it works wonders in "The Lords of Flatbush." But who cares about this group of kids? There's no one particularly engaging, no one special here. If the characters were in the least bit engaging, then maybe we could sit through tripe like "freshman initiations" with paddles for the guys and making a mess of the girls. It's just eye-rolling material.As a matter of fact, the sole character in the entire film that is in the least bit interesting is the "older" guy, Wooderson, who makes a few funny comments (especially about how high school girls always stay the same age) and has a decent funny style. He's really the only character worth watching at all. The picture picks up a bit when he come sinto the scene, and levels off when he's around all the tripe. The filmmakers make one huge mistake that makes the film seem so fake. All the cars in the film are wrong. Sure, they are all made before 1976, when the film takes place. But they all look brand new. In other words, the filmmakers hired "classic cars" from car collectors who obviously restored them previously, and restored classic cars is all you see on screen. There's not a "jalopy" in sight, not a "beater" of any kind. Even the pickup trucks look restored, without any dirt on them whatsoever. There's never any dents, rust, or any indication of "normal use" or "age" on any of the vehicles. And in any parking lot scene, it looks like you are at an outdoor classic car show, with all the restored vehicles on display. The filmmakers really blew it here big-time.They even have a Robert Carradine-looking guy, Carradine of course being a vet of many "teen" flicks of the seventies. The filmmakers couldn't even get the KISS song right, as they use a horrible late-80s remixed "Rock and Roll All Night" instead of the classic '75 studio album original, or the hit single from their 1975 "KISS Alive" album. Not to mention a kid wearing a KISS "Rock and Roll Over" t-shirt half a year before the album came out."Dazed" can't even begin to touch something like "American Graffiti." As far as 70's flicks go, "The Stoned Age" is actually much more fun to watch than this movie. Maybe with something that resembled a script in some way, this could have been more fun to watch, even with the straining and the restored cars. There are some hot girls, with the hottest being the one the geek blond guy with the glasses gets, but even they seem strained as far as their "look" is concerned. This film is a total mess, and really it just comes across as a huge 70's dress-up party and restored classic car show from the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well there's certainly stuff to be confused about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm completely confused by this film. Nothing happens, ever. There are no central characters and there's no focus. To top it off the film abruptly ends with no climax. What's supposed to be going on? Are you supposed to care about each of the disparate groups? Are you supposed to identify with one group and support its minor triumphs? Well I didn't, I don't see how I could have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>now I'M confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did this movie get over 7 out of ten stars? I guess potheads and alcoholics who do cruel things to each other are funny? The acting was horrendous. Look at Matthew McConaughey. What a horrible job acting. Ben Affleck, other big stars, more bad acting. This movie seems to be about wasting time. This movie is kids who are wasted wasting time. I have no problem wasting time by sitting around watching a movie. But this is not the kind of movie I'd consider wasting my time to see. Plot? What plot? Ammmm...kids on the last day of school...what they do, what they think...I hope and pray not every teen is like these kids. This is supposed to be kids entering 9th grade (plus older ones), and they are smoking pot, drinking, vandalizing... What positive point does this movie have??? None. I highly recommend skipping this one. Unless you like watching underage kids blow their summer away. (well, smoke pot and drink... didn't see any "blow"...) Take my advice, unless you like seeing kids get "wasted", skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dazed and confused after seeing this. Teen rebellion film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie left me dazed and confused. Set in the 1970s, this film discovers teenage rebellion and the initiation of children about ready to become a part of high school. This film is a good look at the mentality of teenagers and some psychological issues, but it does not leave room for much else.The film is just like a typical 'day in the life' with the audience participating and looking into that little piece of life. It details initiations of some young girls into a seniority club, some young men who plan to go have a party, and a big drinking party. We also have the bullies and some of the rebels smashing mailboxes and drag racing. This film really does not portray youth in a very good light. Although I would have been just starting High School when the film was released, I didn't see it until a few months ago. It really did remind me of some of the things that took place in school.Okay, some of the film is funny - particularly the guy who is always stoned. However, a lot of the film was 'dazed and confused' in terms of the conventional storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible film, Avoid unless your a teen-movie addict.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly Turned It off after 20 minutes, There seems to be no plot whatsoever of any value. I admit i am not a fan of the genre, But if you want a teen movie or coming of age flick, There are many, many others with something more to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does everyone like this movie so much?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only one who sees how completely pointless this movie is? It is about nothing; nothing at all. There is no plot and nothing happens. It isn't even funny. It's about the last day of high school in the '70s, and some dumb one-dimensional character who refuses to get a paper signed.. or something. And why does everyone love Slater (some standard hippie guy who says nothing important and smokes a lot of weed)? Is that why everyone likes this movie? because it's "about weed"? oh wait it's not even ABOUT weed, sure it's incorporated into the movie, but honestly, that's not even the main focus of the film. The main focus of the film is.. well, nothing, as i've said before. Maybe I'm just not seeing the humour? I mean, it's not like i'm not up for a silly movie without deep intellectual meaning - I loved Eurotrip, Harold &amp; Kumar, and many others. But honestly, I'm one of the very few people i've talked to who don't like this film. Most people who bring up the film are almost always very enthusiastic about it, and quick to reprimand me once i tell them I didn't like it. "DAZED AND CONFUSED IS LIKE THE BEST MOVIE EVER DUDE!!!" Eh, no. At this point, my belief is that one dimwit saw the movie, loved it, and went on to convince his friends of its worth, who went on to convince their friends, and so on. Does anyone HONESTLY like this movie??</fullReview>
