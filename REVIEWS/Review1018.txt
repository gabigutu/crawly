		<shortDescription>Hey! The sheriff is a ni... BONG!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the days when humanity could laugh at itself? Blazing Saddles is a film that takes us all back to a more innocent era. An era where PC was just a couple of letters stuck together. I'll get this out of the way first: To all of you pc commies out there... the racism in this film is there to MAKE THE WHITE PEOPLE THE BUTT OF THE JOKES!!!! There is not a single person of color in this film who plays a negative character. The rednecks are what this film is really making fun of. I think most people realize this (hence the 7.7), but there are still a few who don't.This is such a funny film. From the opening scene along the railroad tracks to the shot of Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little riding off into the sunset in a limo, the film provides an endless stream of laughs. Every time a person views this film, they can notice something truly hilarious that they may have missed the last time. Mel Brooks doesn't always hit the mark with his comedy, but this film was by far his best effort.Cleavon Little and Harvey Korman give the best performances in my opinion. I think Cleavon Little stole every scene in every film I saw him in. He died way too young, and I wish he could have acted in more films. Korman's Hedley Lamar character is a real hoot. By the end of my most stressful days at work, I often find myself talking to everyone in his voice. So evil, and so calculating! He and Slim Pickens played off each other flawlessly.Good luck catching an un-edited version of this classic anywhere but on the DVD. Forget about any kind of an effective remake, either. Not in this day and age.Don't miss this film! 10 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailblazing "Saddles"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, Broadway producers decided to adapt a Mel Brooks comedy and made a bundle. Could it happen again with 'Blazing Saddles?' The movie already has four great songs; a half-dozen more of similar caliber would make for a strong score. 'Blazing Saddles' has a ready-made cast of over-the-top characters, strong audience identification, and some minor problems for a theatrical production (like blowing up the phony Rock Ridge) which are easily overcome.But 'The Producers' was a cult film that never made it to Main Street and needed the second act of a Broadway musical to give it a place in popular culture. 'Blazing Saddles' could never open again as big as it did in 1974. In the summer of Watergate and Patty Hearst, here was one bit of madness people could enjoy. And it wasn't just random kookiness, but a film that broke barriers and courted controversy like no other major-release film of its time. No other movie had characters that were basically likable if stupid throwing around the 'N' word before. In fact, it hasn't happened since (and I doubt it would on Broadway today.) The whole notion of white people and black people living together was not new, but the approach of 'Blazing Saddles' was certainly new. In order to live together, we have to laugh together first. The only way this film was not a trailblazer was in that it blazed trails untaken by any film that came after.Was Cleavon Little then a civil rights pioneer for the 1970s, in a way Martin Luther King and Malcolm X were the decade before? He's very good, bringing a lightness to the role that's equal parts Shaft and Bugs Bunny. Richard Pryor was one of the film's writers and Brooks' first choice for Sheriff Bart, but Pryor wouldn't have played the role in the same smooth way. Little is an amiable actor, one step ahead but never cocky about it. He makes for a sympathetic center, and he is flash in those corduroy threads.Little didn't work much after 'Blazing Saddles,' which makes no sense. It was only the highest-grossing Western of all time, and Little was the lead actor in it. Maybe institutional racism wasn't the sole cause. After all, he had a distractingly rock-solid cast around him, particularly Harvey Korman as Attorney General Hedley Lamarr. Growing up in the '70s, it was a shock the first time I saw the unedited 'Blazing Saddles' with all the casual vulgarity spewing from the mouth of Tim Conway's slapstick buddy on the ultra G-rated 'Carol Burnett Show.' 'You will be only risking your lives, whilst I will be risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor,' he tells his gang before they ride off to pillage Rock Ridge. If only the Academy didn't penalize comedies so, that might have been true.Madeline Kahn did get nominated for Lili Von Shtupp, and deserved her Laurel and Hardy handshake for sure. Her Baba Wawa meets Marlene Dietrich performance is a comic masterpiece, and it takes guts to wear that dead-weed lingerie in which she performs 'I'm So Tired.' Slim Pickens (Taggart), Burton Gilliam (Lyle), Dom DeLuise (Buddy), and Brooks himself as 'the Gov' all shine, and the level of comic acting remains high all the way to the smallest roles, like the guy playing Hitler ('They lose me right after the bunker scene') and the cowboy who chews gum in line ('I didn't know there was gonna be so many people!')Gene Wilder is a little young and ironic for the bitter ex-gunslinger known as the Waco Kid, but he grows into the role well enough. Certainly he was in tune with what Brooks was doing more than Gig Young or Dan Dailey would have been (Brooks' earlier choices for the part, with Young making it all the way to the first day's shooting before it was discovered he wasn't just acting the part of a hopeless drunk.)'Blazing Saddles' doesn't make the IMDb top 250, but it's still one of the most significant video titles because it rewards repeat viewings so well. The wholeness of the film's comic spectacle is too dense to be absorbed in one viewing, especially when you are laughing too hard. It's a cultural landmark, yes, but it's even funnier now than it was 30 years ago, one of the funniest comedies that exist today. Making it into a musical now would almost be demeaning, but I suspect it will happen anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Mel Brooks, but from cinema itself. Film stars Cleavon Little as a regular black laborer, but then a villain (Heldey Lamarr is perfectly played by Harvey Korman) wants to move a community out of the town Rockridge. So, he brings Cleavon in to make the people leave (the people in town are racist including the line: "The sherrif is a nig! "What'd he say?" "He said the sherrif's a near). Funny story, funny jokes (the farting sequence is ahead of it's time for 1974) and 2 breakthroughs- Madedline Kahn in a Oscar nominated performance as Von Shtupp and shines through. The other is Richard Pryor, who co-writes the script with Brooks and Andrew Bergman. Hilarious, forever. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Time Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I look at this film I laugh so hard that somtimes tears come to my eyes. Brooks manages to do with this film what Young Frankenstien did to classic horror films. The thing that really works is all the in jokes laced throughout the film. This shows that the cast and crew were really having fun in writing and producing this film. But the main credit should go to the late Cleavon Little. He was perfect as Bart. He took the role when many thought it should have gone to Richard Pryor (who was a co-writer on the film). However, I think Pryor might have been a little too over the top for the role. Little played it more low key and not as militant as Pryor might have.Also, this film was rated R when it was first released back in 1974. Today it probably would get either a P.G. or, at most, a P.G.-13 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks found a way in 1974 to direct two of the greatest comedies of all time. And in that one year, he found a way to cram as many movie parodies, and not have any overlap, as any director can in Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. What Young Frankenstein was to the 1930s horror movies Blazing Saddles was to the Westerns of the 1960s. And add in there the oppression of blacks during the same time, and you have a biting satire on the role of blacks in society, if not in 1974, at least the way it was in 1874. Cleavon Little (by the way, he's black) plays Bart, a slave laborer for Hedley Lamarr's (Harvey Korman in a GREAT performance as a scheming government employee) railroad who needs to cut through the town of Rock Ridge for completion. The townspeople won't sell their land, so Lamarr has the sheriff killed and replaced with Bart. He's not really welcomed into the town, but with help from Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) he is able to earn's the town's trust. Standard plot, and a plot that does not really matter. The humor is so scatological, from so many periods of time, that we know it's a movie, and the characters in the movie know they are in a movie. Take Slim Pickens when he cries out "What in the wide world of sports is going on here?" And the final 10 minutes of the movie is just odd in any other movie, but somehow works in Blazing Saddles. So much humor is cut out of the TV versions, so don't waste your time with it. It has to be seen with the language and "sexually suggestive" scenes to be fully appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where the white women at?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1974 was a very good year for the team of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder; their "Young Frankenstein" (which came out in 1974) is one of the funniest movies ever made, and "Blazing Saddles" (same year) is almost just behind it. It's a bit overrated (but just a bit); I know a lot of people look on this as the funniest movie of all time, but I can't go THAT far. But it is ONE of the funniest movies of all time, and for two such movies by the same director, with the same star, to come out the same year, to be on that list is quite an achievement.The residents of Rock Ridge (all named Johnson) need a new sheriff. They get one... Bart, played by Cleavon Little, who happens to be black. It's all planned out by Hedley Lamarr (don't call him Heddy!), an employee of the governor (Mel Brooks), in a plot to run the residents out of town so he can have a railroad run through it. At first, the townsfolk aren't happy about this development, but when Bart endeavors to save them from the evil Lamarr, who's played to slimy perfection by Harvey Korman, they warm up to him. Also thrown into the mix is Wilder as "The Waco Kid", a gunslinger who's lost his knack for shooting, Alex Karras as a huge idiot named Mongo , and Madeline Khan as Lily von Schtupp, a parody of Marlene Dietrich, complete with ridiculous German accent. She stands out heads and shoulders above everybody else in this movie, I think, and her song "I'm Tired" ("I'm not a wabbit! I need some west!") is possibly the funniest song ever to appear in a film. This is no doubt the funniest part Madeline Khan has ever had (and she ALSO appeared in "Young Frankenstein"!). It's also a kick to see a pre-"Magnum PI" John Hillerman as Howard Johnson, with an ice cream shop with a sign that screams "1 Flavor"; and Slim Pickens (Taggart, another bad guy) is always a hoot.The plot is just an excuse to make fun of westerns, racism, and movie-making in general, as demonstrated in the extremely wacky, fourth-wall breaking finale (Watch for Dom DeLuise in these scenes). None of this is really supposed to make sense or be realistic, it's just supposed to be funny, and for the most part it is. It's one of the crassest and crudest mainstream movies in history, and that's it's strength; it often plays just like a Mad movie parody. One example of this that really sticks out is the famous farting scene, which somehow manages to be one of the funniest scenes in the movie, and probably the funniest fart scene ever. But the focus is on the way blacks were treated in the post-Civil War old west, and the movie is merciless in the way it has its ignorant white characters treat the black characters, throwing the n-word around without abandon and giving them the dirty work (at one point, a character says "We can't afford to lose any horses! Send a couple of n****rs!"). The movie finds its heart in the way the initially racist townspeople of Rock Ridge become fond of their black sheriff.Its spirit, however, is in the hilarious and crude jokes that are thrown all through. This is one funny movie, and with Mel Brooks, that's what's really important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film That Made Brooks A Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks made several very popular and memorable films in the '70s but I doubt any was more popular than this one. Made just several years after the morals' code had been lifted in Hollywood, it was able to provide humor in a new and shocking way. People could fart, swear, have old ladies use the n- word, men could punch horses in the face, make fun of any religion, creed, race or whatever was there to make fun of ...in other words, no holds barred when it came to trying to get a laugh. Nothing was sacred at this time in Hollywood history and few capitalized on this as well as Brooks, especially with this film.The film doesn't have much shock value anymore but it's still fun to watch and probably always will be, thanks to the outrageous characterizations in here.On the negative side, especially if don't know Brooks does whatever he can to get a laugh and isn't all that political, this film might be too politically-correct with its reverse racism, bias against religion and overly crude situations.But - a big but - there are so many funny lines in here, so many funny scenes you never forget and never fail to laugh no matter how many times you see it (the campfire scene alone has made men cry in laughter for 30 years) that you can overlook about anything in here.In summary, a true "classic" guaranteed to entertain for many more years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howling comedy from Mel Brooks about the Old West with a script that keeps you laughing all the way through and a cast of characters right up there with the Marx Brothers. Kahn is especially tempting as a Marlene Dietrich-like performer, while director Brooks has a fine little cameo as a befuddled and distracted governor. The skits and sight gags are constant. One of the funniest films ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies of all time. Corny by today's standards but icon shattering in it's day. A stroke of two geniuses, Brooks and Pryor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only imagine the laughter in the room when Brooks and Pryor combined their heads to create this one. A Jew making fun of Jews, a Black making fun of Blacks, two Western Americans making fun of the West, movie makers making fun of the movies. The childish fart-level humor and utter cornball gags keep you rolling of the floor unable to breathe. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything more than cornball humor, but it's the all-time best at that. Let's not pretend to be intelligent adults, let's just watch this gem and laugh our heads off like the kids we are inside. Downsides are the overuse of swear words, which were funny in the early 70's because of their shock value during those censored times, but today are just annoying and unnecessary. Another annoying scene is the sexual perversion when Hedley makes love to the statue, though it's funny that the creep gets horny over the thought of money, it creeps me out. But the strength of the movie is its originality for its day, long before the Zuckors. The jokes come so fast and so unexpectedly that you can watch this movie many times before you catch them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political Correctness Is A Terrible Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt pseudo-intellectuals ( Ie People who only think they`re clever ) will claim that BLAZING SADDLES deconstructs the traditional western by pointing out how fundamentally racist the genre is . I`ve no idea how much truth there is in that because I was too busy laughing at what was happening on screen . Yeah the N word figures a lot but let`s not forget one of the screenwriters is a famous black stand up comedian and that everyone be they black , white or Jewish are targets for the outrageous events in this movie so I fail to see what`s racist about it . It is of course politically incorrect but hands up anyone who`s seen a politically correct comedy that made them laugh ? I won`t bother to go into any detail as to how funny BLAZING SADDLES is except to say I remember seeing it years ago and watched it again at the weekend . Unlike a great number of movies I have fond memories of this is one film that didn`t disappoint me after a long absence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So what movie has a black pot smoking sheriff in the old west, klansman with robes that say "have a nice day", bikers on horseback, a guy named mongo, count bassie in the middle of the dessert, uses the "n" word repeatedly without sounding racist, cattle walking through everything including waiting in line to see a movie, and ends somehow at manns Chinese theater after the cast has left the movie and broken loose onto Hollywood, why Blazing saddles of course. This comedy classic was made in 1974 and was directed by the once great Mel Brooks. I say once because he really went into decline after spaceballs (which was just o.k). This movie was written by Andrew Bergman who also wrote one of my other favorite comedies "The Freshman". This is another one of those movies I hope they never remake, it just works so why mess with things that work and yes work so well. Unless you hate comedy I dare you not to love this classic. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep hoping that one of these times, AMC will show an un-edited version of this film. It is really disturbing and disheartening that the PC crowd is able to get this once superb movie channel to censor the films it runs. If I were Mel Brooks I'd be more than a little upset over this wanton editing of an otherwise classic movie. If AMC does this to Blazing Saddles, how many other films are facing the censor's knife or edit button so that AMC can safely assure itself that, by bowing to the beast of political correctness it isn't offending anyone. It makes one wonder how the decision to edit this film was made; was it just some folks sitting around and decided, "hey, we can't show this stuff?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Randolph Scott Must Have Laughed At This One, Not To Mention Hedy Lamarr or Marlene Dietrich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a great deal of difficulty in deciding whether Blazing Saddles or The Producers is the funnier of the Mel Brooks comedies. Being a western aficionado I suppose I have to go with this film. I don't think there was a western cliché Mr. Brooks missed in this one. From the first scene with that celebrated foof contest going on at the campfire to that last shootout at the premier of Blazing Saddles, you'd better be ready to not stop laughing for one minute. Mel Brooks assembled one of the best casts of comic actors this side of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and got lifetime performances out of all of them.I've always thought that Mel Brooks for Blazing Saddles borrowed a lot from the surreal quality of the Road pictures and certainly Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder have a Crosby/Hope like camaraderie going.My favorite though is Harvey Korman as chief villain Hedy, oops I mean Hedley Lamarr. That was the role of a lifetime for him, I think his best moment on screen. Following closely is Madeline Kahn as famous saloon entertainer Lily Von Shtupp. You could tell the Code was a thing of the past when a character could have a name like that. John Wayne was purportedly shown the script and while he declined to be in it, he did say it was the funniest thing he ever read and he would buy the first ticket.Now that's the highest possible endorsement pilgrim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30 years on, it can still raise a laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For reasons I won't go into here, my "party piece" is that I know the soundtrack of Blazing Saddles by heart! And I can still get a laugh out of it, 30 years on. It is often criticised for being overtly racist, and certainly some of its language, particularly the frequent use of the N- word, could be offensive to some. But Cleavon Little was obviously quite happy to appear in it and hopefully accepted the humour for what it was. And after all, Mel Brooks has never lost an opportunity to send up his own Jewishness, as witness a Yiddish-speaking Native American chief! For me, one of the best lines in the movie has to be: "We'll give some land to the niggers and the chinks - but we don't want the Irish!" but by far and away the funniest has to be the old lady who replies to Sheriff Bart's friendly greeting with "Up your's nigger." I think people have to take on trust that the film's primary aim was to amuse, to gently ridicule, but certainly not to offend. For me it succeeds. Of course, Madelein Kahn is inspirational, but another highlight will always be Cleavon Little's rendition of "I Get No Kick From Champagne." An all-time classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You'd Do It For Randolph Scott!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Producers" director Mel Brooks took the traditional white Hollywood western down an entirely different trail with this audacious 93-minute slapstick horse opera. "Blazing Saddles" stands every convention and cliché in the corral on their respective heads and then gives the genre a boot in the butt. Were you to start watching this western satire and not realize that it was a crude, rude, lowbrow comedy with lots of one-liners, vaudeville routines, campy shticks, sight gags, dopey imitations and comic anachronisms, you might either be appalled or outraged by the intolerance toward African-Americans, minorities in general, and homosexuality. Indeed, when "Blazing Saddles" came out in 1974, during the heyday of blaxploitation cinema--you know "Shaft" and "Super Fly"--use of the derogatory epithet N-word still wasn't considered as politically insensitive as in our current multi-cultural society. Moreover, the epithet "faggot" was used, too. Brooks has said that his lowest common denominator western spoof "truly broke ground, and it broke wind." Mind you, the administrative suits at the studios cringed at the racial degradations as well as the wind-breaking campfire scene where cowboy consume copious quantities of baked beans and break wind. One studio executive wanted Brooks to eliminate this scene and the scene where Alex Karras knocks the horse down, but Brooks refused. Initially, even Brooks had some misgivings about the campfire scene and approach studio executive John Calley who advised him to 'ring the bell.' The campfire scene didn't alienate audiences, and "Blazing Saddles" emerged as one of the top cinematic box office hits of 1974. Basically, a quintet of scribes, including Brooks and future comic superstar Richard Pryor, appropriate the empire building plot about the evil railroad out to destroy a town in its way. The railroad runs into quicksand and their nefarious boss Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman of "The April Fools") decides to destroy the town of Rock Ridge to obtain the right-of-way without paying a dime. Hedley dreams up a surefire scheme, "If I could find a sheriff who so offends the citizens of Rock Ridge that his very appearance would drive them out of town." He persuades the incredulous Governor William J. Lepetomane (Mel Brooks) to appoint an African-American railroad laborer Bart (Cleavon Little of "Vanishing Point") as an all white town's new sheriff. Brooks and company couldn't have made this oater at a better time!One of the railway laborers, Bart, gets into trouble when Taggart (Slim Pickens of "Dr. Strangelove") dispatches him and a friend to take a hand car down the line to investigate the presence of quicksand. Indeed, the rails have been laid in quicksand because Bart and his friend sink into the stuff. The railroad foreman pulls the hand car out of the quicksand and leaves Bart and his buddy to die. Bart climbs out of the quagmire and wraps a shovel around Taggart's head. This insolence lands Bart in jail with a date for the executioner, until Hedley decides that he has a better use for him. Indeed, Hedley realizes that he is breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience when he comes up with his scheme. "Why am I asking you?" He turns away from the camera and heads off to see Governor Lepetomane. As upset as Lepetomane is about Bart becoming the new sheriff of Rock Ridge, Hedley spins the situation so that it appeals to the governor. "Yes," he assures Lepetomane about the egalitarian message it will send to one and all about his liberality, "the first man ever to appoint a black sheriff." Of course, Lepetomane believes that he can only reap the worst of a bad situation. Hedley struggles to convince him that Lepetomane will win a place in history alongside Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln with his appointment of Bart as the Rock Ridge lawman. A pimped out looking Bart in a leather suit rides a horse with Gucci saddle bags. He rides by Count Basie and his orchestra on the plains as he heads to Rock Ridge. Meanwhile, the dutiful citizens of Rock Ridge have prepared a reception for the arrival of their new sheriff. No, they do not know that he is black. Gabby Johnson (Jack Starrett of "Kid Blue"), a send-up of perennial western character actor Gabby Hayes, spots Bart riding into town and tries to warn his fellow citizens that Bart is an African-American. A bell cuts Gabby off every time that he says the N-word, and everybody believes Gabby is saying, "The sheriff is near." The townspeople are appalled when they see Bart. Bart ascends the platform and states, "By the power invested in me by the honorable William J. Lepetomane, I hereby assume the duties of the office of sheriff in and for the township of Rock Ridge." Not surprisingly, everybody pulls a gun on Bart and Bart imitates them by pulling his own gun on himself. The whites put down this revolvers and Bart admires his talent. Later, at a town meeting, the citizens complain about Bart. Harriett Johnson (Carol Arthur of "Making It") sums up the sentiments of everybody, "The white, God-fearing citizens of Rock Ridge wish to express our extreme displeasure with your choice of sheriff. Please remove him immediately!" Indeed, the only friend that Bart has in Rock Ridge is a prisoner hanging upside down his jail cell. Jim (Gene Wilder of "Bonnie and Clyde") surprises Bart when he identifies himself as 'the Waco Kid.' "He had the fastest hands in the west," an incredulous Bart observes. Jim adds, ". . . the world." One day a six-year kid shot Jim in the butt and Jim turned into an alcoholic. Brooks directs "Blazing Saddles" like a situation comedy. The biggest surprise occurs near the end when a fleeing Hedley winds up on the set of a movie musical with queer guys galore struggling to perform a dance number. Alex Karras is hilarious as Mungo, a thug who knocks a horse down with his fist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>40 Years Later Still Drawing Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the 40th anniversary of this comedy classic I saw a headline on Yahoo; it read something to the effect: "Mel Brooks says that Blazing Saddles couldn't be done today." Anyone that's seen Blazing Saddles knows that it really pushes the racial envelope. So, Mel Brooks saying that it couldn't be done today... I'm surprised he got away with it in 1974.The movie was released before I was born but I got a chance to see it in '07 or '08 and found it amusing. It's not my favorite comedy but I'd say it held its own for it to be funny to me and I'm from a different generation.The humor was cartoonish at times but it worked. The characters were good and the actors to play them were spot on. The ex-football player and Webster's adopted dad played a good Mongol. Cleavon Little was great as Bart and the incomparable Gene Wilder was good as always as Jim. I still prefer Mel Brooks' Spaceballs and Men in Tights because those were both more relevant to me but Blazing Saddles was nevertheless a plus movie.</fullReview>

I think we got along better when we could laugh without worrying about being Politically Correct. Mel Brooks is/was a genius and such a brilliant actor/writer/director.The cast was timeless. No group, organization or association is off limits in this movie. I loved how this movie plays on societies stupidity. Recommend this movie to teens, 20 and 30 somethings!! They need to see what true comedy really is. When we can laugh at ourselves, life becomes so much better. I didn't get a lot of this humor as a teen, but it it is brilliant now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best western of the 20th Century!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is a comedy, within a comedy, within a comedy.An all star cast of Slim Pickens, Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder and of course funny man Mel Brooks.Blazing Saddles an uproarious film about a railroad worker who becomes the sheriff of Rock Ridge as a joke by Hedley Lamar. Black Bart they call him. He is not welcomed at first because of his race but the arrival of bully Mongo whom Black Bart arrests, puts the citizens of Rock Ridge at ease and they start to respect Black Bart.Mel Brooks is a genius. I have also seen his Star Wars spoof Spaceballs. He makes no apologies in keeping all the racist jokes in the film only cutting out a small line in the middle of the film.I am sure there are people out there who don't care for this film. Whoever they are I am sure that they are missing a funny bone because Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies I have seen in my life. There is no way you could make this kind of movie today and get away with it because too many people out there don't have a sense of humor about racism even when it comes to a movie that is poking fun at it.On a side note I am a tad disappointed that Richard Pryor wasn't able to play Black Bart but he was still able to write some jokes in and work on the movie.A wonderful western classic. Blazing Saddles never gets old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times before and it has always amused me. It's not a great piece of filmmaking by any stretch of the imagination, but I have always got a lot of pleasure out of it. I guess I have to admit to being a bit of a fan of the work of Mel Brooks, he has a pretty unique way of looking at things. His take on the Western is a prime example? lots of jokes about race and class but never in bad taste.When politically connected bad man Hedley Lemar hears the railroad is to go through the small town of Red Rock he decides he wants the land for himself. In his words, "It will be worth millions!". When the townsfolk petition the governor to give them a new Sheriff, Hedley forges a plot to make the townsfolk leave by giving them a new Sheriff of his choosing, a new black Sheriff. He has chosen a troublemaker called Bart to fill the post and he is keen to impress the townsfolk. Things don't go according to plan and Bart is left in the Sheriff's office with his deputy, a drunk called Jim. Now Jim is a former gunfighter called the Wako Kid, but those days are behind him now. Can Bart get the townsfolk on his side? Will Jim stop drinking and take up his guns again? Why does everyone in town seem to have the surname Johnson? All these and many more questions are answered in the film 'Blazing Saddles'.What I like about this film is the fact that Brooks doesn't restrict himself to spoofing Westerns. No genre is safe, there are lots of references to the Nazi's for instance. Good performances all round; Cleavon Little as Bart, Gene Wilder as Jim, Slim Pickens as Taggart, Harvey Korman as Hedley Lemar, Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp and, of course, Mel Brooks as Governor William J. Lepetomane / Indian Chief.The ending of the film is a bit of a mess with a fight in the town spilling over into other sets on the film studio. I can forgive that though because this film has given me and my friends so many quotes over the years. It's not only the spoken gags though, it's the visual ones as well. The scene where a man and his horse are about to be hung I find hilarious. As a piece of filmmaking, it's a bit of a mess, it all seems to have been a bit rushed, but I love it!? Recommended.My Score: 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about the quintessential laugh riot of a movie! I LOVED this film! No matter how many times i see it i always giggle endlessly at the greatest send up of westerns ever made, and definitely one of the funniest movies ever made. Clevon Little is fantastic as sheriff Bart, Gene Wilder is top-notch as the alcoholic gunslinger, "The Waco Kid". Harvey Korman does the best performance of his career as HEAD-LY Lamar. The supporting players are all spectacular, ex specially Madelene Kahn as the saucy German, slightly out of tune, chanteuse Lilly Von Schtup. Alex Karris' "Mongo" is a cinematic treasure and so is Slim Pickens as taggart.The script and direction of this movie is so un-pc that you sometimes are amazed at how they ever got away with it back then. But that is what makes it so fun to watch. Where else are you going to have a movie where the people in church sing a hymn the goes like this.."Now is the time of great decision. Are we to stay or up and quit? There's no avoiding this conclusion are town is turning into Sh--." (Hillarous!) If you have never seen this movie. DO! You will not stop laughing for a single moment. One last praise, to the master of comedy Mel Brooks. Bless you sir! This movie is your masterpiece and i applauded you endlessly for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Up yours,n*****".Brooks mocks the elephant in America's room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a Jew to have the courage to confront racism - in 1974 the elephant in America's room - and mercilessly present it as an object of ridicule. In this respect,"Blazing Saddles" is worth a dozen solemn Stanley Kramer - type epics. From the great Count Basie orchestra to the chain gang singing a close harmony version of "I get a kick out of you", Brooks does no finger - wagging but merely puts the conventions of race and the Western to the sword. With a writing assist from the late Richard Prior - who made Eddie Murphy look like Pippi Longstocking - Mr Brooks hilariously deconstructs a few sacred cows that Hollywood had baulked at for years and has never had the balls to put under the microscope since. Making the most of the artistic freedom he was allowed 36 years ago he gleefully attacked stereotypes of every hue.Today the studio would pull the plug after the first day's rushes.I guess liberalism and freedom of expression don't go together quite as neatly as we might have been led to believe. Mr Cleavon Little as the Accidental Sheriff is quite perfect,Mr Gene Wilder as his alcoholic sidekick slightly less so as he appears to be trying too hard to be crazy,something that came more naturally to him later in his career. The sublime Mr Harvey Korman walks away with the movie as the would - be suave villain,with Miss Madeleine Kahn pushing him very close as the Saloon chanteuse Lilli von Schtupp. Will we ever see another comedy like it?I fear not. Unless some hot young writer decides to pen a script about a child - abusing Muslim survivalist who has written a musical about Al Quaeda and wants it produced on Broadway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite being almost swallowed up by the tons of bad-taste comedies that came in it's wake, this is still a lot of fun with tons of great gags, including many that would never be seen in today's politically correct Cineplex.No matter how much I try, I cannot figure out why Blazing Saddles didn't make a big star out of Cleavon Little. His and Gene Wilder's winning performances and easy going camaraderie are an absolute joy to watch.My favorite parts are Sheriff Bart's welcome party, his introduction to The Waco Kid, and of course the rowdy climax where the final battle spills out of the set and turns int a full-scale riot on the Warner Brothers' lot.My least favorite part is Madeline Kahn's endlessly tedious Marlene Dietrich parody. Sorry everyone, I just can't figure out why so many people think it's brilliant.One thing that most people don't catch is the reference to old-time western actor Richard Dix.

		<shortDescription>My favourite film EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I worked as a cinema projectionist for 30 years from 1971-2001. Most projectionists (like critics) are a difficult lot to please, simply through the amount of product you got to view. No film in that 30 year period 'hit' all our crew like this film did. A roaring Frankie Laine song over the opening credits falsely lead you into thinking this was going to be 'another cowboy movie', how wrong could you be? It hit us like nothing before and whilst films like Airplane &amp; Life of Brian rose to challenge it was, and still is, the best comedy (and my favourite film) ever. You need to watch this film at least half a dozen times to get all the gags, both visual &amp; oral (those that saw the noose around the horses neck fell out of their seat laughing - those that missed it were bemused). I must have watched it 200 times or more. The jokes are great, many stand up to this day and whilst some people simply don't get the irony or the change in scenario (e.g. Lily Von Stupp leading a Nazi singalong or the end sequence), at the time this was (and still is) hilariously brilliant. The casting was perfect, Little, Wilder, Korman, Khan, Brooks, Pickens, Deluise and a wonderful supporting cast ran with a gem of a script. As someone correctly stated, this is a film made when we were all allowed to laugh at &amp; with each other rather than the political correctness of today. In the UK this film was a 'sleeper' which meant it started off to average audiences but once word of mouth got around the cinema was full for weeks. It returned for several other runs and when it was doubled with Airplane it took a boat load of money once again. If you can get the DVD with Mel being interviewed it's worth the effort. Never give a saga an even break?</fullReview>

They are entitled to their opinions ...even if they are wrong. This is one of the best comedies ever made.Firstly it's not just Mel Brooks as scriptwriter which seems to make a big difference to the quality of the film he produces (Yung Frankestein is co-written by Gene Wilder) but then you have a cast in fine form, especially Harvey Corman as the fantastic Hedley Lamarr (Not Hedy, It's Hedley!) add to that a fantastic series of sight gags and word play, with a good dose of racism ridicule thrown in for good measure (...and they is so DUMB!)and it all makes for a brilliant mix of inspired film-making.There are numerous scenes of note, but the scene of the townsfolk looking at their work and Bart chasing after the bad guy still makes my skin cold as they are genuinely moving moments.best visual gag though has got to be the Wako Kid versus the goons at the railroad top drawer Much Love Mike</fullReview>

While there Bart is treated with resentment and hostility from the town. But he does find a friend in a washed up gun slinger, Jim aka "The Waco Kid" who has the quickest hand in the west. Bart with the aid of Jim, the town, and some of his old friends, must foil the devious plan of Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) in order to save the town from demolition.

		<fullReview>I recently purchased Blazing Saddles on DVD, to replace my well used and abused VHS copy. I was amazed at how funny this movie still IS.Although I've never found humor in flatulence, that scene is a classic; the bad guys all sitting around the campfire, eating beans and ripping loud ones while Taggart (Slim Pickens) attempts to contrive a new scheme for ridding them of the new Sheriff of Rock Ridge. "Well, what about Mongo?" I always felt uncomfortable with the use of racial slurs, and this movie made me uncomfortable in that way, but it was Mel Brooks's intent to make us uncomfortable with racism. You can't correct a problem until you drag it out and lay it on the table, which is precisely what he did. He left no stone unturned, and even took a few pot shots at himself in the process.This movie should have won about a hundred awards for its edge, wit, boldness, and the wonderful performances brought to the mix by these veteran actors. While Madeline Kahn did win a nomination for her portrayal as Lily von Shtupp, she should have won..and won..and won.That is my favorite scene in the entire movie.Gene Wilder is brilliant as the "Deputy Spade." While he was a bit young to be cast as a washed-up gunslinger, he molds himself into the role very quickly and lends a strong endearing presence to his character. Endearing is a good word. It fits Clevon Little's character, as well. He was honorable, clever, and completely smooth as the Sheriff of Rock Ridge. I highly admired his performance, and still do.The dark humor in this movie is astounding. Brooks leaves no ethnic group unscathed by his cutting wit. There is no wonder this is the top grossing western attempt to be put on film. In the 1970's, when this was first released, America needed this form of release. There were serious racial tensions throughout the country, Watergate was still ringing in our ears, and the drama that was Patty Hurst's life for a time was still very much front page news. We, as a nation, needed a diversion which was not afraid of controversy and harsh reviews. The box office gross demonstrated just how much we DID need this movie, at the time it came out.For that; being there for us when we needed it most, many thousands, if not millions, are loyal to Brooks and his productions, regardless of the subject matter. The laughter and lightheartedness he gave to us lives on. I was so pleased to see this movie redistributed on DVD.Now, another generation can see and enjoy it as much as we did. Though they may not understand how we could laugh at a bunch of idiotic rednecks singing slave songs, using the "N" word every other line, and comparing anyone with any level of culture to "a bunch of Kansas City fagots," hopefully, the humor will not be lost to the misunderstanding that these slurs were meant to be taken seriously. The intent was to LAUGH AT those ignorant rednecks for BEING ignorant rednecks.Long live Mel Brooks, the Crowned Prince of Parody!! It rates a 9.5/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

Don't take things too seriously. Mel Brooks is one of my favorite directors/producers. The end of Blazing Saddles always makes me cry (when they're riding off and them get in to the limo).

		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" is a classic comedy, though it is not Brooks his best.Like many other comedies, the movie has hits and misses. There are some incredible good and funny moments but also some very lame one's but all of that is just a matter of opinion. Most people will have more than a few laughs while watching this movie.There are some totally hilarious characters played by some good actors such as Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens and Harvey Korman. The main part is played by an unknown but talented Cleavon Little who died in 1992. The role in this movie was the only one he ever really received fame for.The story is totally crazy and hilarious and makes this movie better than most of the other comedies. The ending is one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen, it involves a couple of fighting cowboys, gay dancers and even Hitler, I say no more...Yes, the movie has at times some unusual humor but that's what makes the movie classic, special and not easy to forget.There isn't really much to complain about this movie. Only thing might be that Gene Wilder's character is introduced a bit too late in the movie for my taste and that I would have liked the movie to be longer but those aren't really complains, are they?A truly classic comedy and still one of the best.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Good support from Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Brooks himself, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens and a host of others.Bound to offend the dial-an-offense crowd (who are usually offended on behalf of a group they don't belong to, and who probably don't take offense themselves).

		<fullReview>If there was one year that could be proposed as the year of Mel Brooks, it would be 1974. With two of his films, "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frankenstein" represented in the Box Office top 10, he was America's funniest man. Mel Brooks has his own atypical style, but both pictures differ in their ways of being funny and it's almost an impossible task to agree on which one is the best. So in retrospect I watched his "Blazing Saddles", probably the funniest Western ever made. The story line is quite... well, let's call it unstructured. Though we can find a certain plot in this total mess. "Blazing Saddles" tells the tale about some untrustworthy land speculators who are constructing a railroad, with only one problem. The railroad needs to run through a town called Rock Ridge and they need to find a way to drive the townsfolk out. They hope to accomplish this by sending a black sheriff so the townspeople will revolt. Then again the film has so many things happening at the same time it's hard to give a good synopsis. Because in the end this film was created for the purpose of being funny, and damn it is! It feels like as if Mel Brooks can literally get away with anything, and people will let him say or do anything because he has earned this privilege since the distinctively funny debut: "The Producers (1968)". Brooks does everything to keep us laughing at the screen, and overall he succeeds. To truly understand these kind of films you must understand that this is an "audience movie". It is pure entertainment for your jaws and doesn't try to be an over-polished film in any way. And "Blazing Saddles" is pure entertainment from beginning to end, sure there are some slow bits though maybe these are a necessity to rest the jaw muscles for a while. "Blazing Saddles" is the perfect introduction for those who are not yet familiar with Brooks' work. What makes him stand out from your typical satirist is his ability to willingly embrace the redundancy of everything . His humor is more than just vulgarity and something he will always be remembered for. Brooks has no taste, which makes it in some weird way tasteful, and well, if you don't understand that, stick with your "Scary Movie" franchise I'd say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western spoof that pokes fun at everything from prejudices to politics, and looks for more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles", released in 1974, was not a typical western. Yes, it had railroad construction, saloon brawls, hanging parties, some gun play, but those staples were mere parts of the major spoof the film was eager to place on western cinema. And, it succeeded on all counts.The story opens at the railroad construction site, where two of the crewmen, two Africans, are made to go look for a possible quicksand sighting. They find it, also fall victims to the site, but manage to rescue themselves, then Bart, the hero, slams a shovel against the head of Taggart, the rail boss that had put them in jeopardy, to begin with. From there, the film goes to the political scene, where Hedley Lamarr is attempting to pull a land grab scheme which will enable him to sell land to the railroad and make lots of money for himself. Only problem is that there is a small town, Rock Ridge, on that land, and the townspeople are very reluctant to give up their land to the railroad. Bart is named the new sheriff of Rock Ridge, it is hoped that the people will leave in disgust, but they rally behind Bart and his new deputy, the Waco Kid, played by Gene Wilder. The ultimate showdown between Hedley Lamarr's pack of villains, and Bart's good guys takes place in a hilarious, free-for-all brawl that erupts everywhere.Besides Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, and Harvey Korman, the cast is ably supported by Slim Pickens, Alex Karras, David Huddleston, Liam Dunn as the town's preacher, and Madelaine Kahn, delivering a spoof of another western classic, Marlena Dietrich in "Destry Rides Again."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and dumb, but always entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is one step away from being a Saturday morning cartoon. If you have any doubts, the movie at one point plays the Looney Toons theme. If you watch it as a cartoon, the weirdness of the film will thus be received much better.Blazing Saddles is a Western comedy about a black sheriff. It is set in the Wild West but treats its time an place setting very loosely. One of the characters introduced early on is an executioner that is clad in chain mail in a cowl, with a big axe behind him. It tends to break the 4th wall as well...once literally.It is quite funny, and also really not funny. It has a lot of weird childish and dumb jokes that really miss as well as a lot of nonsensical slapstick, but it also has a lot of cute and sometimes outright brilliant stuff. It throws enough of them and a fast enough pace to let you pick and choose. Overall the movie is witty and enjoyable enough. Also, it is SUCH A WELCOME CHANGE from the modern comedies that use blunt gross extremes or dumb spoofs instead of actual comedy. The comedy is direct and a bit dark, racism and rape jokes included of course. I am glad someone had the guts in 1974. I know I just earlier mentioned that it was different from the modern gross comedies, and I maintain that. This humour works. It has effort put into it and does not go overboard.Frankly, this may not seem a favorable comparison to some, but Blazing Saddles is like a good episode of Family Guy. Unlike Family Guy, this film has a really good story to it. It is competently shot and has a smooth progression in scenes.Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder have really good chemistry as the two main characters. Gene Wilder is ?Gene Wilder.This movie does not deserve as much praise for all the stupidity it brings to the table, but it is really cute and has a lot of heart. Its entertainment value greatly exceeds any of its weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As expected from a Mel Brooks movie, the story, actors and characters do not take themselves seriously as a young black man (Cleavon Little) is appointed as sheriff of Rock Ridge, a fictional western town where in the late 1800's. As a railroad is planned to pass through the town, the price of land in the town and surrounding area is guaranteed to increase dramatically prompting civil servant villain Hedley (Harvey Korman) attempt driving the townsfolk away to seize the land for himself. Little and Wilder are great as the two law enforcers entrusted to protect the town through whit, charm, charisma and skill as they face numerous hilarious challenges to save and enlighten the local people. Often silly and sometimes ridiculous but very entertaining especially considering the year it was made. So many movie parodies crammed into one Wild West movie spoof it's untrue! Inconsistencies in plot and poor acting don't really matter to the viewer as such but make this movie score lower in comparison to other, better executed comedies produced since. Only 6/10 but a classic move you will enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy legend Mel Brooks had a true banner year in 1974, reaching a career high with two undisputed classics, the black &amp; white horror spoof "Young Frankenstein" and this often hysterical send-up of the whole Western genre. It's packed with one-liners, sight gags, numerous anachronisms, delicious performances in virtually every role, and some absolutely brilliant exercises in the breaking of the fourth wall. Gorgeously shot in Panavision by Joseph F. Biroc and wonderfully scored by John Morris - there's also some catchy ditties with lyrics by Brooks - "Blazing Saddles" is fun from start to finish, and remains a very quotable movie 40 years later.Villainous attorney Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to get rid of the town of Ridge Rock to make way for a railroad line and does his best to ensure that the townspeople are unhappy. One of his methods is hiring a black sheriff named Bart (the engaging Cleavon Little), and of course the "good" people of Ridge Rock don't take kindly to this. But Bart vows to make a go of things, and makes a friend in washed-up gunfighter Jim (ever likable Gene Wilder); eventually he starts gaining supporters as he comes up with ways to combat Lamarr and his goons.This whole cast is a delight, and it reads like a who's who of talent: Slim Pickens, Madeline Kahn (doing a priceless Marlene Dietrich parody), Brooks himself as the governor, Burton Gilliam, Alex Karras, David Huddleston, Liam Dunn, John Hillerman, George Furth, Jack Starrett (hilarious as the incoherent Gabby Johnson), Carol Arthur, Charles McGregor, and Dom DeLuise.It's no surprise that AFI would name this as one of cinemas' best comedies. It has a very high quotient of successful verbal and visual jokes, enough to sustain it for a lively and irresistible hour and a half. That scene where a gang of cowboys enjoy a dinner of baked beans and the obvious result is still quite funny. Best of all is that ingenious finale.Modern movie lovers who tire of the kind of spoofs being cranked out nowadays are advised to see this gem, an example of how to do this kind of thing right.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Mel Brooks made a few Excellent Movies. This is one of them. It could be called the First Raunchy Comedy. It made the N-Word innocuous with some Help from Richard Pryor, it made Farting Funny long before the Family Guy and it Changed the Face of Movie Comedy Forever.Comedy either works or it doesn't. It is a very Subjective Artform. You either Laugh or You don't. This Movie might be a tad Overrated, but it surely is Groundbreaking. Lenny Bruce was just too ahead of His Time to be appreciated, but Mel Brooks arrived just when things had opened up in the Arts and His Rowdy, Sex-Obsessive, Ethnic Satire was Ripe and Everyone was Ready.This is a Classic and most of the Scenes and Gags have become Folklore. Madeline Kahn steals the show as a Marlene Dietrich take off, but the rest of the Cast cannot be Denied. The Movie cannot be Denied its place among one of those that spun things in a New Direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gritty Racial Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its script full of racial slurs and foul language, 'Blazing Saddles' was a film that John Wayne ultimately turned down, but told Mel Brooks, "I'll be first in line to see it." Set in the old west, the territorial governor (played by Mel Brooks), wanting to expand his political horizons appoints a black man (Cleavon Little) as sheriff of Rock Ridge, a town run by murderers and thieves. Harvey Korman plays Hedley Lamarr (not Heddy), a corrupt politician who manipulates the governor and ultimately is the head of the gang that controls Rock Ridge.It is a post civil war film, and the racial slurs were (and still are) racy in nature. The film was almost pulled by Warner Bros. in 1974 for this very reason. However, final cut of the film lay with director and star Mel Brooks. Ultimately, the film that was released is what you see, a gritty comedy where you laugh at racial inequality and stereotypes. But it's all in fun.The only part of the film that doesn't fit and make sense is the ending, but don't let me ruin it for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This became my favourite film when I first saw it. It's is still my favourite film today. Mel Brooks did an absolutely fantastic job with this masterpiece. This movie delivers comedy through song, speech, stupidity and even flatulence. It's comedic genius. Yes it might be edgy due to the use of the words 'Nigger' and 'chink' but who cares? I think comedies need edginess like this to be able to make anything even close to this. It's such a shame that political correctness ruins things. Cleavon Little (RIP) and Gene Wilder were a fantastic comedy duo. Such a tragedy to lose Cleavon so young. Such a great actor. I think we can all agree that this is a fantastic film and a true piece of comedic gold. Well done Mel Brooks, Well done. -James Age 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a comedy, it fires on all cylinders. Brilliant film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terrific cast (led by the utterly likable Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder), a wonderfully crude sense of humor, and the sense that nothing's sacred make "Blazing Saddles" a undeniable classic. The film sets its sights on the small-minded townsfolk of the Old West (not to mention every Western cliché in the book), while keeping its feet firmly in the present, including a Jesse Owens joke and even a climax that spills over from the WB sets onto 1970's Hollywood Blvd. Little and Wilder clearly had a marvelous time working on the movie, but the show is easily stolen by Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman. The script is loaded with priceless one-liners, the sense of humor tends toward the manic, and the film features Mel Brooks' funniest role as the philandering governor (complete with "GOV" painted on his back. It's a great Mel Brooks movie, a great satire, and an all-around fantastic time at the movies.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Genius of a Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Madeleine Kahn deserved her Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance here. In fact, the ensemble which include Cleavon Little, Mel Brooks, Harvey Korman, John Hillerman, and Gene Wilder deserved an award as an ensemble cast. Blazing Saddles is a spoof of the country western movies. Madeleine Kahn is fantastic as the Marlena Dietrich spoof from Riding Destry as a German singer and entertainer in the Wild West. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant especially Cleavon Little who played Black Bart. He is saved from execution and sent to be a sheriff in Rock Ridge in the Wild West. There, Hedley Lamar is determined to destroy the town in order to build a railway there but it's not that easy. Mel Brooks is great as the lovable corrupt governor. Gene Wilder played the Waco Kid who helps Black Bart. John Hillerman is one of the townspeople. It's a great comedic film if you don't mind political incorrectness for the time period. There is the n word a lot and Black Bart being a black sheriff in a white town raised a lot of eyebrows of course. Then there is the campfire scene with the cowboys not to be missed or forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny satire ... punctuated by a few hilarious moments ... too few ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" reminds me of a French expression that can be translated as "it was dumb, but no one ever thought of it" as if it would take a certain genius to create an impact from very silly things. No one ever thought of making fun of Hitler, yet it inspired "The Producers", one of the funniest comedies ever, "Blazing Saddles" works on the same principle, only in a smaller proportion: no one ever thought of a Black sheriff (Cleavon Little) in a small Western town, Brooks did.As usual, Mel Brooks embraces political incorrectness with the enthusiasm of a little child, getting away with so many frank lines like "I like rape", "Where's the white women" and I won't do a drinking game with the number of times the N-word is uttered, hell, it's almost like a punctuation mark. Mel gets away with that because it betrays his profound desire to make us laugh, by any means, not wasting any frame, any minute without a gag, visual or verbal, slapstick, absurd and at some points, so blatantly racist I hesitated to qualify him as desperate for a laugh or irreverent genius. Maybe it takes some irreverent genius to be so desperate for a laugh, or maybe Mel Brooks' comical mechanisms work on a Freudian level in the way they invite our most shameful impulses to laugh at the un-laughable. I more enjoyed "Blazing Saddles" for the gags that satirized the Old West myth than those involving racial stereotypes, simply because they were much funnier and all the racist jokes combined together would never beat the part where Mongo (Alex Karras) punches the horse, probably one of the most defining moments of American Comedy's history. It's so unexpected, so perfect in the timing, that the joke works with the same level of perfectionism than the wall falling on Buster Keaton in "Steamboat Willie Jr." and these are moments that lack in "Blazing Saddles": moments of comical discipline and precision. I don't mind cheap jokes, but sometimes, they tend to make us forget how the set-up is almost as important as the pay-off.Where would I classify the infamous campfire farting scene? This one reminded me of some of the best Simpsons jokes, when it starts being mildly funny, then it's annoying, but the scenes drag so long that it becomes funny again and almost hilarious. The timing is perfectly handled in the scene but the same can't be said for all the other jokes. I get it that it's funny if a Black man says he's got a Dutch grandma, or if an Indian chief speaks Yiddish, but it's only funny if the film doesn't contain other racial jokes, hell "Blazing Saddles" is loaded with them. I reckon that the story is about a black Sheriff and in a way, "Blazing Saddles" can be considered as a film dealing with racism and a landmark in political correctness, but all the political incorrectness in the world can't beat the hilarious wagon train moment, I laughed us so much I almost choked up. I appreciate political incorrectness but I hate the way its card is used as an alibi by the hardcore fans to justify why the movie is so great, as if it was impossible to love "The Producers" and consider "Blazing Saddles" inferior. I loved "Blazing Saddles" for its satirical aspect, for the way it extended all the limits of parody. It uses as some point a gag ? la 'Looney Tunes' with the same music, while I believe Mel Brooks owes more to Tex Avery. The Yiddish-speaking scene reminded me of the Oxford English speaking Indian in "Big- Wheel Watha" and the Indians attacks of "Homesteader Droopy" or Goofy's unforgettable "Californy'er Bust" These are my references in humor, and I felt that they inspired the best of "Blazing Saddles". Mongo uttering the famous "Mongo, only pawn in the game of life" is pure comical genius, not to mention the song of Lili Von Schtupp (Madeline Kahn perfect as a Marlene Dietrich or the poor) or Gene Wilder proving his shooting skills.The rest is just a bit overused but never unfunny. If I wasn't laughing, I was at least smiling. Mel Brooks signed a film that was begging for laughs and for not to be taken seriously, and it couldn't have had a better ending to illustrate the fact that it's a big joke. I used to dislike the ending, but now I feel it's one of the most surrealistic extents of the limits of meta-referential satire. But while "Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail" did it with a certain level of sophistication, Brooks doesn't embarrass himself with that, he's like a craftsman who builds a beautiful oeuvre d'art and then took a hammer and starts destroying it, and it takes some genius to have the guts to ruin the premise of a film, for jokes. And apparently, it worked since the film was the highest grossing of the year. People laughed and that's that.I like the film but I sometimes dislike the reasons for which it's loved by its fans. "Blazing Saddles" delivers what we expect from a comedy, but at some point, it just forgets to be a film, with a story, something that some of the best parodies did "Naked Gun!", "Top Secret!", "Airplane!" and how about Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein" which is, in my opinion, his best film, precisely because he wasn't overdoing it, each joke has its time, each character a moment to shine, and the film had an atmosphere, a little something that elevated it above the comic genre. "Young Frankenstein" is like a delicious pie served in a beautiful plate, while "Blazing Saddles" is no less delicious, but is thrown at our face.That's all, folks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Time Classic Parody That Straddles a Dozen Comedic Styles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing, looking back, just how much variety this succinct satire of the western genre is able to put on display. Crammed full of every type of joke, pun and ruse imaginable, it's the perfect vehicle for an in-his-prime Mel Brooks to show off his devastatingly effective abilities in each style. More impressively, it's able to make those wild leaps from pointed, hilarious dialog to silly sight gags to dense, dark satire without disrupting the flow of the story and becoming an undisciplined series of loosely-related skits (though it does come awfully close once or twice). That it can also be so funny amidst a subject matter so heavy, (Brooks tackles racism and government corruption amidst the obvious parodies of an overpopulated genre) is further testament to his talents. I'm not a huge fan of the bizarre non sequitur ending sequence, but given the non-stop laughs that precede, it's a small price to pay.</fullReview>

It is silly and it is not subtle at all, there are those who will flinch at some of the language used. But it is very funny, and works really well as a spoof. The story is a lot of fun, and there are enough slapstick and jokes to amuse as well as a wonderful script. The production values are very good too, while the acting is spot on. Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are both great as the smart-as-a-whip railway worker appointed first black sheriff and the drunken gunman who helps him out, while Madeline Kahn(in a Marlene Dietrich send-up), Alex Karras and Harvey Korman are even better. Overall, not subtle but still great. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A town in the Old West gets a new sheriff who turns out to be black, which doesn't sit too well with the people. This is inspired lunacy from the warped mind of Mel Brooks. It's a crude, sophomoric spoof of Hollywood Westerns that strives to offend as many social, political, racial, and ethnic groups as it can and it mostly succeeds in its assault on political correctness. The comedy is hit-and-miss, and while the hit rate is not much above 50 percent, it does land a few home runs. While any self-respecting filmmaker would be embarrassed by this, thankfully Brooks is not one of them! The cast has a field day, particularly Korman as Hedley "Not Hedy" Lamarr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May go overboard with the silliness and immaturity at times, but most of this western spoof works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "Young Frankenstein" for the first time last month, it didn't take me very long to get around to seeing "Blazing Saddles". Quite a while before watching either film, I knew they were both very popular spoof movies from Mel Brooks, and were released the same year, over a decade before I was born. Brooks' spoof of 1930's Universal horror movies came into theatres in late 1974, and this western spoof of his came into theatres early that year. These were apparently his two most successful films. "Young Frankenstein" is an excellent flick, and after watching it, I may have expected to like its direct predecessor more than I did. The 30's Universal horror spoof is the stronger of the two, but this one is still good.In 1874, a new railroad is under construction in the Old West, and it eventually turns out that quicksand is in its way. Because of this, the construction must be taken in a different direction, and an evil state procurer named Hedley Lamarr plans to have it built through an area of land where a town called Rock Ridge currently stands, where everybody's surname is Johnson! First, he will have to find a way to drive all the townspeople out, so he sends in a group of henchmen to raid the town! After the sheriff of Rock Ridge is killed, the residents demand that Governor William J. LePetomane send them a new one. Hedley then gets an idea. He convinces the governor to appoint Bart, a black convict, as the new sheriff of the town, another scheme to try and get all the townspeople (all white) to leave. So, Bart rides into town and is obviously not welcomed by the town's racist residents. With the help of a town alcoholic named Jim (a.k.a. "the Waco Kid"), the new sheriff tries to win over the townspeople, while Hedley continues his attempts to bring down Rock Ridge! With a white worker named Lyle on the railroad trying to get the black workers to sing a spiritual song, the quicksand scene, and finally the "tell them I said 'ow'" gag, this spoof begins well. Occasionally, there are some pretty lame gags, such as the elderly woman being punched repeatedly by intruders, and cowboys sitting around a fire, eating beans, and farting. I also felt like I should have found a medieval executioner in the Wild West funnier than I did. However, most of the film is pretty funny, sometimes hilarious, and other highlights include the meeting in the church after the raid, Mel Brooks himself as the idiotic sex-crazed Governor William J. LePetomane (with the "meeting adjourned" gag and such), Bart's escape from gunpoint, Gene Wilder's first scene as Jim, and Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp. As usual, there are too many to mention. The first scene with Mongo is kind of annoying, and it seems like this character will really hurt the film, but fortunately, this quickly changes, as Mongo has some really funny scenes as well. The movie gets surprising towards the end, but in a good way.This hit 70's comedy from a renowned parody filmmaker may be slightly overrated, and too silly and crude for some viewers, but for the most part, I can understand its wide appeal. It's sometimes too silly and juvenile even for me, and may have been ahead of its time in that regard, but it doesn't get like this often enough to ruin it. I strongly suggest you don't watch "Blazing Saddles" if you can't take filth, political incorrectness, irreverence and immaturity in comedy, though far more shocking and raunchy comedies have been made in more recent years. However, if you like lunacy and edginess in your comedy, can take risqué humour, and are in the mood for some good laughs and a clever parody, this could easily be right up your alley. It's not the best spoof movie ever made, but Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have done SO much worse in the past several years, and I shouldn't even be comparing them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddle up for laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was way under aged when I saw Blazzing Saddles for the first time. I was nine maybe ten, And I can very distinctly remember being sick that day. My dad mentioned the healing power of laughter, and he put this on the box. I was too ill too scream will laughter, but ironically I chuckled so hard that I almost got a hernia. Physically I felt a little better when the movie was over, but it left a much bigger impression on me. i learned just how absurd comedy can be.Blazzing Saddles is regarded as the most satirically racist pictures. Set in the VERY wild west, a crooked politician has a plan to snatch an expensive piece of land from the town of Rockridge, where the railroad is about to enter. after the sheriff dies, He thinks he can drive all the townsfolk away, by advising the governor to appoint a black sheriff, which he does. the plan backfires, and the new sheriff ends up becomes a hero, when he leads the town in attempts to save the town from destruction.I don't think I need to give an introduction to director Mel Brooks, everyone knows who he is. For Blazzing Saddles he throws out some of the wackiest ideas I have ever seen in Comedy. A medieval hangman, a Yiddish speaking Sioux tribe, and a bar fight in a movie studio, are just a few of them. As offencive as it may be, Blazzing Saddles will always be one of the great American Comedies.</fullReview>

My favorite quote from my favorite movie.This movie has everything: great acting, great writing, satire, wit, bite, great cinematography, great directing, distasteful jokes, and a never-be-serious attitude that really makes it work.People call this movie racist. They really need to get a grasp of satire, because every idiot in this movie is white. The WHITE people are the stupid/racist ones! I saw that at the age of 10! The first line of this movie sets the tone. From the first line to the last the viewer is led "nowhere special", and rightfully so. This movie really, when you think about it, goes nowhere. The two main characters, in a western set back when railroads were still being built as the main mode of long distance travel, ride off in a limousine at the end! But it's hilarious! You don't expect it, and when you do, you still laugh because its so absurd, yet so fitting to this movie.I could ramble on all day, pointlessly, about this movie. I know every line, have known every line since I was about 10. This movie is still funny 8 years, and probably 800 viewings, later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What's a dazzling urbanite like you doing in a rustic setting like this?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of it's great and funny sight and sound gags, I can't help feeling that "Blazing Saddles" was brought down a considerable number of notches with it's deplorably vulgar treatment of serious subjects like rape and murder. I don't get why Mel Brooks would sink so low in an attempt to get a laugh, when subjects like those are hardly a laughing matter. I had a similar reaction to a line in Alfred Hitchcock's 1972 film "Frenzy", when a bar patron suggests rape as a 'silver lining' compared to the murder that follows. Brooks showed that he could direct great comedy without resorting to the 'lowest common denominator' style of making pictures with "Young Frankenstein", which came out the same year. That was funny without being offensive.With that out of the way, there are some genuinely fine and funny moments in "Blazing Saddles". I particularly get a kick out of those fleeting scenes that suggest a surreal and manic look at the world, like hangman Boris with a noose around a horse's neck, or a business sign heralding Howard Johnson's one flavor of ice cream. Depending on my disposition, the campfire scene even gets an occasional chuckle out of me, juvenile as that might seem.What probably works best for this picture is it's way of deconstructing the entire issue of political correctness, poking fun at a white red-neck brand of racism and contrasting it with a black pride and sense of dignity for the workers on the railroad. The notion of setting up a black man to fail backfiring was a brilliant concept to explore, so that by the end of the story, the whole 'why can't we all just get along' agenda is put in it's proper perspective.As Mad Magazine would put it, the usual gang of idiots is here in fine form - Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Dom DeLuise and Madeline Kahn looking better than ever as the Teutonic Titwillow. Cleavon Little as Sheriff Bart is at the center of the madness, providing the anchor to keep the story moving to it's inevitable conclusion. The proverbial ride into the sunset is given new meaning here in keeping with the character of the picture and Brooks' own brand of insanity.</fullReview>

Mel Brooks put out some great comedies like High Anxeity, Young Frankentstein, History of the World Part I and Spaceballs, but in my opinion this is his finest. There are just so many classic lines to quote from this one. If you expected a Western spoof with barely any laughs, then you were dead wrong. This on the other hand is a western spoof with non stop laughs.Honestly this is just a classic comedy movie. With a strong lead from Cleavon Little along with Gene Wilder and then supporting roles from the always wild and wacky Harvey Korman, Mel Brooks and Slim Pickens. This is definitely worth the checkout because it delivers some of the hugest laughs in the whole comedy genre history.Plus remember, That's Hedley, not Hedy! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest and most important films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the category of satire, no other film has been as aggressive or socially important as this one has been. Rated as one of the 10 funniest movies ever made, the screenplay and plot take every opportunity to make fun of the ignorance, past and present, of white racism in its most ridiculous context. But in addition to covering the issue of racism, the movie also brings to satirical accountability other sensitive social issues that were not only present in 1974, but that were present way in the past and far into the present. At some point in the movie, all of the sensitive hush hush social issues were somewhat abused.The targets of a scathing satirical call to rational accountability by Mel Brooks include a little of everything. "Dock that chink a days pay for napping on the job"; "Can't you see that this man is a ni... !"; "Bah-dgesss! We don't need no stinkin' bahd-gesss!"; "Ready faggots! 1 and 2 and...." and "look girls, they've hit Bunny!", etc. Many more social nuclear warheads were detonated in the many different scenes in this ground breaking landmark film. All of the characterizations were memorable by all of the main characters. But among them, Madeline Kahn must be mentioned as perhaps the funniest, with her quasi Marlena Deitrich and saloon stage presence rendition of "I'm Tired". But, as mentioned before, the main brunt of the satire was the ridiculously stupid white cowboy racial mentality, and the closed mindedness in which he lived in small town western American in the late 1800's. "Howard Johnson is Right!".In being taken aback and totally absorbed by the satirical tonality of this monumentally innovative story, we tend to overlook the plot and scenario where the actual premise of the movie is based. From the very beginning, we western fans knew that this was all about the western genre itself, in all of its glory, and the pride of them all, High Noon, from 1954. Even Frankie Laine in the opening musical introduction made the movie hilarious. He sang "Blazing Saddles" with the same gusto that he did when he sang High Noon 20 years before. Right from the very beginning, and all the way through to the end, the western genre fanatics were laughing and rolling their eyes with glee. The icon of the American Western, with all of its merciless clichés, brought to its knees in 93 minutes.This film deserves only the highest praise on many accounts. Most notably, the courage with which it portrays the social absurdities of today, then and now. In 1974, it was outrageous; and today, it's still a classic. "You'd do it for Randolph Scott!".</fullReview>

Had I known what I was missing I would have made an effort to see it long ago.I'm not a huge Mel Brooks fan apart from the "The Producers", which I also discovered recently, but this film definitely ranks among my favorite comedies. It's got all of the necessary ingredients: a great cast, a snappy script and the chutzpah to pull it off.The subject matter is the always touchy matter of race relations. While Brooks and company drop slurs left and right they somehow don't come off as hateful. The defining quality of the movie is a sense of unity, of overcoming the ridiculous barriers erected in the name of racism. The movie isn't preachy about it but it does have a positive message amidst the hilarity.What can I say about the cast? Cleavon Little, Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn and Brooks himself; hell, even the bit players are funny. If they don't make you laugh you should get your funny bone checked out.But all of those talented individuals would go to waste if it wasn't for a script that is both daring and inventive. There are many memorable lines and gags throughout the movie, including some that would still be considered risqué today (particularly those based on race). You've gotta admire the unabashed mayhem of the ending as well.Alright, I've said enough. Quit reading this and watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good luck finding the original theatrical release version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I've rated this movie a 10 out of 10. It's the only movie I've ever actually paid to see in a theater nine times.However, that was all when it was originally released. Every time I've seen it more recently, what I saw was a watered-down PC version. While still funny, it had lost most of its original hilarity. I am not convinced it's even possible to see the original theatrical release version any more.Here's how to tell if you're seeing the original: After Mongo rides into town, the sheriff has to deal with him. If you see an underwater scene involving a diving helmet, you are NOT looking at the original theatrical release version!Huh? That's correct; in most movies, editing means scenes are left out. But in Blazing Saddles the original theatrical release version included the word "nigger" in about every other line of dialogue. This became wholly unacceptable sometime later, so the film was edited to remove most of these lines. That left the film so severely shortened that scenes that were originally left on the editing room floor -- such as that scene with the diving helmet -- were resurrected and put back INTO the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what can you say about a movie that is designed to make you laugh with Marx Brothers like gags every second? You'll probably laugh too hard to say anything. The plot? A crooked aide to the governor tries to wipe out a town in the way of his railroad, but he must appoint a new sheriff, so he sends in a black one whom he thinks will be killed the first day. But the plot is just something that happens to be there while great comic actors deliver the lines of a great and timeless script. This is very much like the zany Marx Brothers or Monty Python. Nothing is supposed to be credible. It is televised vaudeville, and it is excellent vaudeville. You know a movie is a classic comedy when so many people will pick out so many different parts they think are great. My favorite is the part where the bad guys teach the railroad workers how to sing. But there are so many great gags to choose from. Just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly one of the funniest movies ever made, and this is not a term used lightly. Mel Brooks has created a whole new genre of comedy with these unique, hilarious, outstanding movies. Blazing Saddles was recommended to me by a fried and when I watched it I was actually surprised that I had not watched it sooner. Blazing Saddles has a lot of off-beat and sometimes edgy humor, but that's what makes it so good. I usually don't love western movies but this movie is an exception. It should be on the top 25, why isn't it? Oh well, it's not up to me suppose. I was watching a program on E! (which is surprising right there) and it was the 100 Funniest Movies ever made, this movie was #4 I believe, and Mel Brooks' "The Producers" was #7. He has a real taste for good humor. Unlike all these modern comedies which are all exactly the same. I rate this 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't typically enjoy the comedy or musical genre of film, but this one is an outstanding exception. It almost seems counterintuitive, since the humor is often sophomoric and offensive at best, racial slurs run rampant, and it is an odd mixture of comedy, western, and musical.But perhaps therein lies the magic. No matter how many times I watch it, it will always get a hearty laugh out of me. Even the liberal use of the "N" word makes me chuckle, not because racism is funny, but because it is a word that is taboo nowadays and just not used very often.I'd like to comment a bit on the racial slurs herein. It is obviously done tongue-in-cheek and never comes across as mean spirited, being more of a satire highlighting the stupidity of racism. Ironically, the only truly likable characters in the movie are black, with the exception of the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder). The epithets are certainly not reserved for one racial group, but are liberally dispersed amongst Asians, Latinos, American Indians, and Irish, not to mention homosexuals. It should be also noted that stereotypes such as the stupid cowboy and greedy railroad men are ever present as well.In the end, Blazing Saddles is a very silly, yet clever comedy/musical that has stood the test of time. Even the soundtrack is original and great. Many of the actors involved have either passed away or are now in the twilight of their lives, and this is a glimpse into many of them at the peaks of their careers. I will admit that this movie is not for everyone, and it is not without some flaws. But the whole really shines through and will forever remain one of my favorite comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Mel Brooks movie is made. This time he takes on western, and boy is it unbelievable. Brooks plays the governor of a nice town, that gets a rude awakening where his men controls it by attacking the town-folks. What's worse, they have the new sheriff who was worked with the railroad crew, who would want nothing more out of him. Because he's a black man. When the folks finally accept him, he takes on Hedly Lamar's(Harvey Korman) biggest henchman Mongo(Alex Karras). When he was caught by Sheriff Bart, he wants nothing to with Lamar nor the governor. He only trusted Bart. Along with the crazy Waco Kid(Gene Wilder), Bart could do no wrong. The real funny scene is when German singer Lili Von Shtupp(Madeline Kahn) was performing, she hits the audience member in the groin, and later says, "Everything below the waist is kaput!" I wish I could say more about the the movie, but it's unbelievable all over the Warner Bros. Studios. The brawl was totally non-stop, and the humor was unbelievable. Great cast, great action, great everything, this movie's a gem. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BLAZING SADDLES is one of the best satires ever. Mel Brooks, who himself is probably the last of the great slapstick comics, offered up this satire of the western film over thirty years ago, but it ages well. Sheriff Bart (Cleavon Little), black as the night, is sent to rescue the town of Rock Ridge, which sits in the path of the incoming railroad (of course), which in its turn is overseen by the biggest crooks in the county. But that's okay, because Rock Ridge is lived in by the most bigoted and inbred community in the country. Sheriff Bart is assisted in this task by the reformed drunk gunfighter The Waco Kid, played by Gene Wilder. The genius of BLAZING SADDLES can be seen in Brooks and his co-writers taking the actual history of the settlement of much of the United States, and making everyone laugh at some of the stupidities that have governed us for most of our existence as a country. No one is spared by this group of satirists (Richard Pryor contributed to the screenplay), the ax swings every direction. And thirty years after its release, the work remains screamingly funny. Every John Wayne-Garry Cooper-Randolph Scott cliché is up for grabs. If you've seen it before, watch it again. And again. And again. You'd do it for Randolph Scott.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks First Big Success: Blazing Saddles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddless (1974): Starring Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, Madeline Kahn, Dom DeLuise, Count Basie, Slim Pickens, David Huddleston, Liaam Dunn, Alex Karra, Carol DeLuise, Harvey Korman, Burton Gilliam, Karl Lukas....Director Mel Brooks, Screenplay Mel Brooks and Andrew Bergman.From 1974, this is comedian Mel Brooks' first major success. His comedy films, a blend of pop culture, Jewish humor, sexual innuendo, satire and funny dialogue, each take after this first hit. Blazing Saddles is a parody of the Western, but in a more in-your-face and unapologetic manner than the more subdued "Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid" (1969) a fllm which this film may also be satirizing. Mel Brooks stars as a corrupt sheriff who, to preserve his position in a small Western town in the 19th century, deliberately appoints a black sheriff (Cleavon Little) Bart, which provokes controversy and ignites mayhem. Cleavon Little is not as well known today but he typified the comic black actor of the 70's, the kind you saw on Saturday Night Live. He was never as popular as Eddie Murphy who could have easily taken on this role, but he is hilarious, mannered and the one who steals the show in this film. It's especially enjoyable (and not racist one bit) to see him succeed and outsmart the whites in the town. The powerful comic duo that was Mel Brooks and Madeline Kahn would work together again in various subsequent films including High Anxiety (1977) and History of the World (1980). Brooks is his usual great self but he does seem fresh and had not developed his full comic powers at this point. On the other hand, Madeline Kahn displays the talent she would show audiences in each of the films that followed this one. As a saloon dancer/showgirl, complete with a Marlene Dietrich impersonation, she's hilarious and superb, but never over-the-top. It's interesting to note that this film would have floundered if all the actors had stepped up the comedy. They are clearly comic actors doing a prolonged Western skit but they act as if this is a serious Western and take themselves serious, AND IT WORKS! Gene Wilder had done comedy before and he is doing a fine job here as The Wacko Kid, especially funny because he always looks so sheepish and vulnerable. He is a fine actor. At this time, he had just finished work on a memorable performance as Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1973) only a year earlier. He is clearly better as Willy Wonka because he had more of a chance to act on that film whereas in this film he is almost a secondary actor and more subdued. The look is great, almost too great for a comic film, but this is exactly the kind of "anti-movie movie" that Mel Brooks was famous for. It's a movie that makes fun of the movies. And audiences saw the first glimpse of the kind of entertainment Mel Brooks would deliver for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious spoof western ? a work of inspired lunacy if ever there was one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funniest comedy film of all-time? While that might be stretching the praise a little far, Blazing Saddles is certainly a hugely enjoyable hour-and-a-half of inspired lunacy. Fast, rude, radical and so-racist-that-it-isn't-racist, it is a film that needs watching over and over just to pick up on the sheer number of verbal and visual jokes thrown at the audience. Mel Brooks, who co-wrote and directed this film, has probably never made anything better during his up-and-down career. Likewise, you'll have to look long and hard to find Gene Wilder in better form, giving a performance of comic genius as The Waco Kid. I only have to hear the deliriously silly title tune, with its over-the-top whip-cracks and wacky lyrics, to burst into fits of uncontrollable laughter.A railroad company fronted by the villainous Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman ? wickedly funny) runs into a patch of quicksand whilst building a track across the Wild West. Their only option is to re-route the rail-line through the nearby town of Rock Ridge. Lamarr instructs his heavies to empty the town, scaring the townfolk away by killing their sheriff and intimidating them with violence. But when the townspeople refuse to budge, Lamarr has to come up with a more radical plot. He spares the life of a condemned black railroad slave Bart (Cleavon Little), and sends him to Rock Ridge as the replacement sheriff. Lamarr figures that the locals will be so disgruntled at having a black sheriff that they'll give up the ghost and skip town. It seems the scheme is going to plan as the citizens give Bart a less than glowing reception. But soon, the black sheriff proves himself to be quite good at his job, especially when he ingeniously disposes of a psychotic, gigantic bad guy named Mongo (Alex Karras) who comes to flatten the town. Bart teams up with an alcoholic ex-gunfighter named The Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) ? renowned for having the fastest hands in the West - and together they try to wipe out the army of outlaws and gunslingers allied against them.Blazing Saddles has moments of sheer hilarity that get funnier every time you watch. Madeline Kahn's deliberately out-of-tune rendition of "I'm Tired" for a bar-room full of rowdy cowpokes is utterly fabulous; then there's the brilliant opening sequence in which a bunch of cowboys try to hold a singing contest against the black slaves; Wilder has a priceless moment where he seizes a chess piece so fast that his opponent doesn't even see him move; and who can forget the insane climax in which a brawl in a Wild West street spills over into the Hollywood studio next door, where Dom DeLuise's camp director is trying to shoot a musical number?!? Cleavon Little is rather limited as the black sheriff Bart (perhaps Richard Pryor might have been better for this role?) but he is surrounded by such proved comic talent that he just about gets away with it. The dialogue is marvellous throughout, with verbal witticisms coming so thick and fast you'll probably miss half of them on the first viewing. Few films can match Blazing Saddles for sheer belly laughs ? terrific fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever Blazing Saddles is on T.V. I always try to catch it. Blazing Saddles, like Revenge Of The Nerds, is a movie that simply can't be made today unless the producers are willing to deal with the complaints from various ethnic groups about the way they portray their people. It has become tiresome to see every ethnic or focus group complain about the stereotypes shown when in fact they are based on truths and that if they made a film based on their ethnic group i.e. My Big, Fat Greek Wedding we'd see the people portrayed the same way others would see them. Back in the 70's, people laughed at themselves and their mannerisms. Blazing Saddles did more to unite the races with laughter and Mel Brooks deserves a lot of credit for this.Blazing Saddles also takes a lot of heat for its "cop-out ending" but people need to realize that this is a spoof of the western; nobody should take it seriously as if it was High Noon. Some people whine and say that they could have created a suitable ending to the film but to be honest, the one provided seems feasible to me. Besides, the characters in this film are wacko. You had to know that something crazy would happen in the end.The film still stands at the top of the great comedies. The performances from Harvey Korman, Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens, and Alex Karras, among others, still are top-notch. Also, like Evil Dead, what movie has so many memorable lines and quotes? Whether it is Mel Brooks' Gov. William J. LePetomaine mocking Harvey Korman's Hedley Lamarr by calling him Hedy Lamarr (and stating that "She isn't born yet, you could sue her.") to the classic "Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!" to Madeline Kahn's Lili Von Shtupp saying for the second time that "I want to slip into something more comfortable" or Gene Wilder's Waco Kid delivering his hilarious stories, it never loses it zing.Still, the story is entertaining and intriguing and the characters make this movie work. Whether we will see people return to the laid-back 70's beliefs in public is debatable but we will always have these films that shows us that we could laugh at ourselves over our ethnicity. Maybe someone like Al Sharpton will look at these classic films and realize that the way it used to be wasn't so bad...ah, probably not. He would no longer have anything to offer news-wise.</fullReview>

Governor's assistant Hedley - not Hedy! - Lamarr (Harvey Korman) hopes that the townspeople will want to flee, opening the way for a railroad extension.That's the official plot, but of course the movie is really an excuse for a series of crazy gags. Whether it's Jim/Waco Kid's (Gene Wilder) "fastest hands in the West", Gov. William J. LePetomane's (Mel Brooks) sexual follies, Lili Von Schtupp's (Madeline Kahn) songs, or the last names of Rockridge's townspeople (pay attention there), this movie shows that infantile humor can be hilarious. And I must say that it's almost surprising how much they used the N-word, especially considering that this was a comedy. But anyway, you're sure to die laughing.

		<fullReview>In Blazing Saddles, Mel Brooks managed to run the gamut from slapstick to refined wit (with sexual and scatological humor falling somewhere in the middle), all the while parodying everything from westerns to Looney Tunes, and ruthlessly satirizing greed, corruption, and racism. It's also quite possibly the only context in which "The N-Word" is used to strike a blow against racism.Even the character names are gags: for example, "Lilli Von Shtupp" is named after a Yiddish sexual term, and "Governor LePetomaine" was named after a French performer whose act was based on flatulence. And of course, there's the whole town full of rather-inbred people named Johnson, and Harvey Korman's character, whose name is a reference to Hedy Lamarr.Many have labeled the humor racist. Those who do, simply don't get it. The whole point was to show the inherent idiocy of racism: in short, to satirize it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this film numerous times, and as one who owns a copy of the film on video, I have to say that this film was definitely ahead of its time. Brooks himself has said that if this film had been made in any other period of American culture, that they would not have been able to make it, or been lucky to get approval from the studio for it.I have a copy of this film on tape and it's interesting to watch this film air on Fox Family Channel and then put it in the VCR and see the differences. However, not even editing for television can ruin this film. It's just that good.Mel Brooks was at the height of his creativity with this one, and it shows. You couldn't even beg to get this film made in today's world, and you'd be hard pressed to get it done in the days of yesteryear. It's a wonder it even got off the studio lot --- which it does, literally, in the film.This film wasn't made for children, and it was barely made for adults. But if you are looking for a good laugh, then watch this movie. Many people will be offended who watch this film, but it was made entirely with that idea in mind. A definite classic, and Kahn's performance is truly worthy of the Oscar nomination which was given to her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles, by far Brooks' best work, shows how silly racism can be. Chock full of disparaging remarks about those of other ethnic backgrounds, this movie makes a 'dazzling urbanite' black man sheriff of a small fictitious town in the old west. He was greeted with slurs and guns, but his quick wits saved his life. Old-fashioned friendliness doesn't work, but stopping Mongo wins the townspeople's trust. "Pretty soon they'll talk to you in broad daylight," offers Jim. Eventually, Sheriff Bart leads the townspeople to a victory over the evil Hedley ("that's HedLey!") Lamarr.Blazing Saddles is my favorite movie of all time. From start to about 20 minutes before the end, I love it. I can live without the Hollywood fight scene, however.

		<shortDescription>Riotous Westen spoof by Mel Brooks with raunchy and amusing gags</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wacky spoof is packed with lots of silly laughters and great entertainment and fun . Most of the laughs and sight gags galore work acceptably and the jokes come machine-gun rapidly. This likable silly farce with numberless comedy set pieces deals about a newly contracted(and conspicuously African-American) sheriff of Rock Ridge . The surprising beginner Sheriff named Bart (Cleavon Little) join forces with Jim (Gene Wilder) to foil the railroad-building plan of the villainous Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) who is helped by Mongo (Alex Karras) and Lili (Madeline Kahn ).It's an entertaining story and very amusing tale with the Farceur Mel Brooks-his first hit film- as director and secondary acting . This bemusing movie is packed with tongue in check, slapdash and slapstick , a steady stream of gags, lively situations abound, sheer belly laughs, crazy humor and too much fun . It contains simple and raunchy humor and lots of entertainment and fun . The spoof is surrealist,extreme and gross-out with the ordinary bunch of loonies and loopies , but is also bold and intelligent with a myriad of imaginative sketches with no sense, many of them unabashedly tasteless .The picture contains an unstopped string of gags each thirty seconds and silly jokes from the start to the ending with some lively touches . The comedy and humor are interminable for that reason the viewers will laugh uncontrollably with the habitual quirky and lunatic characters . The late Cleavon Little steals the show, the puts paces, grimace,and overacting by means of excessive mimic gesticulation especially in his hilarious scenes when as new sheriff arrives in the little town. Furthermore , provides a sprinkling of self-parodic guest stars as Madeline Kahn as a Dietrich-like singer, Harvey Korman as General Attorney nicknamed Heddley Lamarr , Slim Pickens as racist cowboy , Don De Louise as joyful gay, Mel Brooks as unlikely Governor and many others . The screenplay is credited to five writers ( Richard Pryor , Andrew Bergman , among them) and it shows in the confused melange of styles and some bad taste. Lively musical score by John Morris with catching song sung by Frankie Laine . Rated PG (parents guide) for some sexually gags with occasional adult content and profanities ; if it weren't in such raunchy humor , it would be perfect for the kiddies and adolescents. The film will appeal to absurd,unruly,wacky comedy fans .This raucous Western spoof is a Gene Wilder-Cleavon Little vehicle ,if you like his crazy, maniac performances ,you'll enjoy this one .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest comedy of all time? Possibly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One golden rule of Hollywood is to never underestimate the great call of serendipity when replacing a dedicated role in casting. Cleavon Little was never intended to play Bart, that was Richard Pryor's role. Pryor couldn't take the role because of other commitments, and the role went to Little. And therein lies the magic of Blazing Saddles. Little was THE actor to play Bart, a suave, urbane fellow who shines well above the hysterically funny peckerwood riff raff that surrounds him in this film.Never mind that this is probably the greatest comedy script ever penned, and that Gene Wilder, in retrospect, may be most remembered for his genius portrayal of the confused, laconic and perpetually drunk Waco Kid. Mel Brooks committed 100 percent to Little and arguably the funniest film in Hollywood history was born. And I haven't even mentioned Slim Pickens, Madeleine Kahn and Harvey Korman, each whom is nothing short of magnificent in their roles.Virtually every single line of dialogue in this film can be quote dropped at a barbecue, cocktail party or card game, and everyone laughs their butt off because they remember how funny it is. If you haven't seen this film, see it immediately. If you don't love it, watch it again. It's brash, it's obnoxious, it's crude, but it's true comic genius at its very best. It's more than a classic, it's an epic two hours in motion picture history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Old West lunacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest comedies ever made. Mel Brooks was a demented genius at these genre satires, and this send up of every Western cliché ever thought of, blended with his typically insane slant on modern social aberrations is a true comic masterpiece.Somehow, Brooks's unique style gets away with roasting otherwise volatile issues, and with laugh out loud results. Soundbites from this movie are classic, and quoted even today. This is the kind of cult classic which a group of people can run from time to time, everyone reciting their favorite dialogue along with the characters. And there's a hilarious line or sight gag almost every moment. The campfire scene is one of the best-timed jokes ever put on film. The hiring of the assassins is another standout. The concert in the desert. The toll crossing. The false-front town with cardboard cutout "townsfolk." The list goes on.The cast in this movie were nothing short of brilliant. Cleavon Little, as the sheriff, was not known for comedy, but demonstrates exceptional comic smarts. Others are also terrific: Gene Wilder, Madeline Khan, Harvey Korman, Andy Devine to name just a few. The film never lets down, maintaining high levels of chaos and silliness throughout.This Old West lunacy can be viewed again and again, and remains fun each time. Along with Young Frankenstein, one of Brooks's two crowning achievements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Sadles is a classic Mel Brooks film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Sadles is an hilarious Comedy made in 1974 about a guy that is appointed a sheriff and when the people of he town at first trilled to learn that a new sheriffs coming they learn of one little catch- hes black. Mel Brooks makes a tiny cameo in this film as the president and made me laugh around 4 times in the 6 minutes screen time he has in the film. The movie is good because of Mel Brooks I reckon because he took a hard thing to spoof and made it one of his most favourite and highly rated movies of all time along with stuff like Young Frankensten and The Producers. Another good thing about this movie is the characters I mean not just is the script funny but the characters make it even funnier in my view. Overall I think movie is a classic movie that I hope is always loved and bought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Never Get Tired of This Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies I have ever seen and it gets better with age. It's gotten even funnier since I started watching Westerns. It's not politically correct, but who cares? It's all in good fun, and if folks can't take a joke...This is Mel Brooks at his best. Better than YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, HIGH ANXIETY, or SILENT MOVIE, although they are great in their own right. It's really funny when they start to lose control at the end and carry their fights to some of the sets at Warner Brothers studios. I damn near howled the first time I saw this. There are also subtle shades of humor that are easily missed with just one viewing, so I would suggest several viewings of this movie to the uninitiated.What the hell? I feel generous today. I'll give this one a perfect 10. (Head them off at the pass? I hate that damn cliché'!!!)Warning: Don't light a match during the campfire scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make them like this anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After trying to sit through some movies with a friend of mine this past weekend, we finally decided to watch "Blazing Saddles" and we're glad we did. Previously I had only seen this movie on network or syndicated television with a lot of edits and missing scenes. I'm glad I finally decided to watch it on DVD.The story isn't really important (about an old western town that finds itself in the path of a railroad development and in the way of some despicable politicos who try to destroy it) it just gives the brilliant Mel Brooks a long clothesline on which he can hang hundreds of old jokes, then-current jokes and timeless jokes. Mel Brooks is one of the best directors when it comes to tackling racism. He is so even handed that he can deliver a message when you don't even realize you are receiving one. It's the openness of overall acceptance that sits with you afterwards that is the final reward.When I watched this I wondered what had happened to a lot of the actors and actresses who appeared in it. I think only Gene Wilder is really still very active in making movies these days (or as of 2005). The cast was a tremendous collection of great comic and dramatic actors and actresses who all turned in wonderful performances, combining to turn a complicated storyline into an apparently seamless comic farce. I particularly liked seeing David Huddleston as Olson Johnson. He's a long time favorite supporting actor and, he too, is still playing some small roles (see the new "The Producers").My only complaints about "Blazing Saddles" are that some of the "current" references don't hold up too well after all this time and the ending gets a little complicated. I wish Mel Brooks could have kept the story in the same time line instead of resorting to "return to reality" ending he used.And it goes without saying, "Blazing Saddles" has the all time greatest farting scene in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLAZING SADDLES (1974) *** Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Alex Karras, Slim Pickens, Mel Brooks. Wild and woolly western comedy send-up with Little as a former chain-ganger cum new sheriff who teams up with gunslinging Wilder to face snidely Headley LaMarr (Korman at his most unctuous) and lecherous governor (Brooks). Best scene: the campfire sequence and Karras cold-cocking a horse (noteworthy trivia: this was actually based on a true incident involving Sid Caesar and a horse paid in tribute by Brooks). Richard Pryor has a co-screenwriting credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks found a way in 1974 to direct two of the greatest comedies of all time. And in that one year, he found a way to cram as many movie parodies, and not have any overlap, as any director can in Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. What Young Frankenstein was to the 1930s horror movies Blazing Saddles was to the Westerns of the 1960s. But this one is of the funniest movies of all time, and for two such movies by the same director, with the same star, to come out the same year, to be on that list is quite an achievement. Now, the story, The residents of Rock Ridge (all named Johnson) need a new sheriff. They get one, Bart, played by Cleavon Little, who happens to be black. The film doesn't have much shock value anymore but it's still funny to watch and probably always will be, thanks to characterizations in here. On the negative side, especially if don't know Brooks does whatever he can to get a laugh and isn't all that political, this film might be too politically- correct with its reverse racism, bias against religion and overly crude situations. Overall, a very nice movie with the nice story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is left to be said that hasn't been already about Mel Brooks' seminal piece, Blazing Saddles? Comedy genius Mel Brooks was at work in 1974 creating a classic that has more than withstood the test of time. Starring Gene Wilder, Cleavon Little, and Harvey Korman, Blazing Saddles brought an all-star cast together with some of the greatest comedic writing to result in a film that is still shared over 40 years after its release. Gene Wilder had a brilliant year in 1974, and Blazing Saddles was part of that.The year is 1874, the rules of the Old West still rule the country, and Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) needs to find a way to get a whole town out of his way in order to build a new railroad track. After his first attempt to evacuate the town fails, when he sends in henchmen to rid them, he must come up with a plan B. The town then demands a new sheriff to help keep them safe. Lamarr decides to send the town a black man to act as sheriff, an idea they are sure to disdain. Once the newly appointed sheriff, Bart (Cleavon Little) arrives, the town revolts just as expected. With the help of prisoner turned only friend, Jim (Gene Wilder) Bart's sophisticated ways and effective law keeping eventually win over the townsfolk as they see they are safe under Bart's reign. Becoming quite displeased that none of his plans are working, Lamarr then goes, with guns blazing towards sheriff Bart with his political muscle behind him. Blazing Saddles goes the distance to show how the west was really won in the 1870's. Mel Brooks, even at his zaniest is king of the spoof. This time spoofing a western, Brooks found his home at Rock Ridge. This movie was the best of Brooks and Wilder and an absolute gift to audiences everywhere that they shared their peaks with us. Another film that will make you wish they had collaborated more together, Blazing Saddles is one to watch again and again. The comedic writing was exceptional in this film. So many subtleties exist that there is bound to be something you missed the first time you saw it to pick up the next time you see it. That is the true beauty of this film that so much of its comedy is subtle. Any comedic writers/directors/actors of today should be required to watch Blazing Saddles; perhaps then, this generation would not be devoid of great comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not racist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was mentioning this movie a while back to a co-worker, and she said, "Oh, that movie is terrible, it's so racist..." She didn't get it. There is a lot of politically incorrect language, a lot of use of the "N" word. But you have to pay attention to the context. All the racial slurs are done in such a way that the object of ridicule is the racist whites, not African Americans. In that sense, it's just brilliant. In one scene, when the black sheriff greets an old white woman on the street, she responds with "Outta my way, n****r! Later, after he has proved his worthiness as sheriff, she brings him a pie she baked for him as a token of appreciation "for saving our town from that horrible "Mongo..." Then, before departing, she says, "Oh, and, sorry about the "outta my way n****er..." Some 40+ years later, whenever I hear that line, I find myself rolling on the floor laughing... Pure genius!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old West, with a satirical twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks is known for his unique brand of comedy, typically blending the best of low brow humor, old school Hollywood musical numbers, and parodying of genre films and Hollywood as a whole. His films walk the line between tasteless raunchiness and comedy gold, which is why we love him so much. Being co-written by the one and only Richard Pryor, his 1974 film Blazing Saddles could be described as walking the line backwards while blindfolded and juggling plates. It takes the audience on a wild ride of laughs that pokes fun at the racial climate of America in the early 1970s and the absurdity of Hollywood under the guise of a traditional western.Blazing Saddles follows the story of Bart, a simple black man who wastes his days building railroads and being oppressed for his skin color, who unseemingly becomes the sheriff of the town of Rock Ridge. The villainous Hedley Lamarr uses his political influence to appoint Bart as sheriff, hoping it will drive the citizens of Rock Ridge out of town so they could build the railroad right down its main street. But once Bart becomes sheriff, he and his new partner Jim, prove to the townsfolk that his skin color does not dictate his character and ends up saving the town for Lamarr and his baddies. The film is shot beautifully with camera work that calls back to Golden Age westerns, with wide shots capturing the beauty of the landscape and closeups showing the focus of the cowboy's faces during a shootout. The cinematic charm of this film bleeds through further with the extravagant costumes and sets, and old west personality that each actor brings to the characters. Cleavon Little transforms the tired old west sheriff into a cool, easy going urbanite. His role seems to be making a more figurative statement to the literal saying "there's a new sheriff in town," in the broader metaphor for race in Hollywood that Brooks is trying to make. Post civil rights, many African American actors were getting their time in the spotlight, which obviously rustled some feathers in the industry. Brooks is known for rustling feathers even more, and his main character does that quite well, using tired race jokes and sarcasm to say to the prejudiced, "I'm here now and I'm not going anywhere." The film makes a very general statement on the absurdity of race throughout, pointing out the bigger racial and ethnic conflicts of the 20th century; Native Americans vs. White settlers, Blacks and Asians vs. Whites, Jews vs. Germans. The famous line "We'll take the blacks and the chincs, but not the Irish," is a good example of how ridiculous Brooks sees the idea of racism. Blazing Saddles is one of those films that will be quoted for decades thanks Brooks' knack for saying the wrong thing at the right time and the incomparable chemistry felt between the cast, thanks to it being a typical Mel Brooks ensemble cast. Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, and Dom Deluise are Mel Brooks regulars, and people are used to seeing them together in the wild romps. Wilder's stoic sarcasm, Kahn's firecracker personality, Korman's sinister dimwittedness, and Deluise's explosive voice and movements are all commonplace in Brooks films and this one is no different. A lovely pseudo-satire that brings golden age charm with pretty racy comedy, Blazing Saddles is one of the best examples of Mel Brooks' filmography. Poking fun at Hollywood and racism while still delivering a musical number that many adoring fans know the words to is something only Mel Brooks can do. This is a very good entry into his brand of comedy and should only lead you to dive into his collection completely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching this movie, and I can confidently say, to my mother's chagrin, that I can quote the entire film verbatim. Blazing Saddles is parody perfected. The entire western genre is both celebrated and mocked at every turn. Harvey Corman is eloquently nefarious, and there is not a word in the English language to describe how funny Slim Pickens is. For those who are offended by racial slurs, sexual innuendo, violence against the elderly, implied bestiality, stereotyping of the LGBTQ community, scatological terms, fart jokes, or anything resembling comedy, you might not find this movie entertaining. But if you can take joke, and like Mel Brooks, this movie is right up your alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically incorrect (gleefully so) and absolutely hilarious! -- the king of spoof movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of SPACEBALLS, I am, as of yet, not well-versed in all things Mel Brooks. I have been aware of his cultural influence through soundbites and clips of his films, but BLAZING SADDLES represents my first serious foray into the godfather of the spoof. Seeing as it is a spoof, the plot really doesn't matter too much since the entire genre is basically an excuse to poke fun at other things. And, I must say, BLAZING SADDLES does this quite well. Parts of it are kind of corny, and the middle 20-30 minutes is a bit dry, but the way it sends up the Western and makes fun of racial stereotypes more than compensates for whatever weaknesses it has. My favorite parts were Madeline Kahn as a Marlene Dietrich parody, Lili Von Shtupp, and Harvey Korman as the verbose Hedley Lamarr. Those were probably the most substantial running gags and they never got old. The opening and closing sequences (which goes more meta than I've never seen pre-90's) were also quite good. When it comes down to it, renting this was certainly a good choice but I'll probably have to add some Mel Brooks to my Blu-ray collection in the future. And for the few people who possibly haven't seen this yet, you don't know what you're missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not only a casual viewer but also a serious viewer interested in comedy who can enjoy 'Blazing Saddles'.Hailed as one of the most innovative comedy films to have been made in Hollywood,this Mel Brooks film has both elements of fun as well as learning in equal amount.A lot can be said about political correctness of this film as the offensive word 'nigger' has been used many times.However,it is only racists who are humiliated through the use of 'nigger' word as the film's black actors use the word in order to express their inner feelings.The depiction of black actors has changed a lot in last three decades.Blazing Saddles was one of the first films which showed them in a positive light even when it was becoming difficult for Mel Brooks to do the same thing.This film teaches the importance of unity in order to defeat the enemy.Apart from Robert Altman's McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller, Blazing Saddles will continue to be remembered as one of the handful of films which ridiculed westerns to speak about racism in a small American town.</fullReview>

I can't really say that Blazing Saddles was a disappointment, because it wasn't: the movie made me laugh, and a lot, at times. But I found the movie to try really hard to make the audience laugh at way too many fart jokes and most of them are really hit or miss. And considering the movie's status as a hilarious comedy classic, the movie was over hyped for me.The best parts of the movie are the scenes in which Mel Brooks is in as the Governor, those parts made me laugh out loud and are some of the funniest moments I have seen on screen in my entire life. Gene Wilder and CLeavon Little are also great in the movie.But all this being said, I do think the movie feels uneven, some parts made me really laugh but most of it just didn't quite do it for me but nevertheless I will still say Blazing Saddles is a good comedy, but it doesn't deserve the status it has.</fullReview>

No. Today (2015), racism exists just like always. Maybe not as strongly or in the same form, but it exists.Maybe the film also does not hit as hard with me because I was never a big western fan. "Young Frankenstein", by comparison, appeals more to my love of the classic horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks directs, writes &amp; co-stars in this 1974 comedy starring Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn. This takes place in 1874 during Western times in small town, Rockridge. Korman (The Carol Burnett Show) plays Hedley Lamarr (Not Hedy Lamarr), a corrupt politician who tries to make Rockridge unlivable and decides to appoint black slave, Bart (Little) as it's new sheriff thinking he won't be able to bring order to it. Bart gets off to a tough start, but eventually succeeds and wins the town's support. Wilder (Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory) plays Jim, aka The Waco Kid, a former gunslinger who befriends Bart, the late, Kahn (Young Frankenstein) plays German singer, Lili Von Schtupp and Brooks appears as the Governor, William Lepetomane and as an Indian Chief. This is a good, entertaining Western spoof that also pokes fun at racism with a great cast and it's clearly one of Mel's best I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks has directed some of the greatest comedies ever made and this is the best of the best. It's most definitely one of my favorite comedies. I think it's on the AFI list of greatest comedies of all time too and for a reason. I have to admit the comedy may rub people the wrong way. A lot of it seems and is a little off color and even sometime downright racist, but I don't think it's gratuitous. It's also so darn witty, it's easy to look past the racist under and over-tones. It's kind of a spoof on old 50's and 60's western movies. Harvey Korman is a corrupt politician who wants to build a railroad, using slave labor through a little town of Rockbridge leaving the residents homeless. They obviously resist this, so Korman sends Cleavon Little to the town to replace their sheriff who had been killed by Korman's cronies. Cleavon Little, being black does not go over so well at first, but after a while everyone comes together to defeat Korman and the idiot Mayer played by Mel Brooks. The jokes are some of the funniest I've ever heard and there are so many quotable lines in the movies. It's one you will want to watch over and over unless you are offend by the humor. I hope not though. Times have kind of changed and the humor isn't accepted anymore, but I just take it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- Blazing Saddles, 1974. In 1874, the railroad is secretly coming to a small town, Rock Ridge and evil government forces want to land speculate to make millions off the innocent townspeople and their land. The evil government forces want to destroy the town morale by sending in a black sheriff to help, but the clever sheriff rallies the townspeople and railroad workers against the outlaw army and dirty government leaders. Eventually they win the day over the land speculators, outlaws and racial prejudices of the old West. *Special Stars- Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Slim Pickens, Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Mel Brooks, Alex Karras.*Theme- Prejudging people before knowing them is prejudices and dumb.*Trivia/location/goofs- American, comedy, satire. Warner Brothers studio. Be sure to see the theatrical release of this film over the heavily censored TV version. You loose all the jokes. Richard Pryor was cast as the original lead here but lost the role due to his 'unreliability'. He was on the film writing staff. Gene Wilder was second choice casting for Waco Kid, Brooks wanted a leathery older clearly hard-drinking recognizable cowboy actor like Dan Daley. The film was shot on the (now gone) Larime Town back lot and prairie scenes at Aqual Dulce's well used 'Vasques Rocks' movie ranch (now country park). Watch for Mel Brooks to appear as many characters in this film. *Emotion- A classic Mel Brook's comedy film with excellent writing by his team and Richard Pryor. A satirical look at the classic Western movie genre in all of it's institutional glory for laughs. A low-key serious message film about the comedic examination of racism. *Based On- Myths on racism and old Western films.</fullReview>

The more you 'get' the humor in Mel Brooks' style the funnier the movie is.Warning: do not try to eat while watching this movie - you will spit food everywhere due to laughing so hard. And it is one of those movies that will have you snickering to yourself when you think of the film days later.A good Saturday afternoon film matinée that will bring humor to an otherwise dreary, boring day.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Comedy that Still Holds Up So Many Years Later,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is a fantastic movie with a very well written and hilarious storyline with an outstanding comedic cast.The movie is a pure Mel Brooks film and definitely some of his finest work.The film was definitely a risky one for its time,topics such as slaves and the KKK were still very much a sensitive subject and it surprises me a movie like this was even released in 1974,but it is a hilarious comedy and became a big hit that year despite its risky storyline.I loved the use of breaking the fourth wall in this film,Mel Brooks always tends to go overboard when he breaks the fourth wall and this is no exception,especially towards the end of the film when the characters crash a set for a different film and even go to a movie theatre to see Blazing Saddles,the joke certainly went too far but that's what made it hilarious.Blazing Saddles is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good western or comedy.In order to take down a peaceful western town,a political boss hires a black man as the towns new sheriff knowing it will cause a lot of tension for this racist community. Best Performance: Cleavon Little Worst Performance: Dom DeLuise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, where the white women at?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino wishes this movie didn't exist so that Django Unchained would look original. If that isn't true, he could have just asked hadn't they ever seen Blazing Saddles when journalists kept probing him on the use of the word N****r! There are many classics that I love from this era (late sixties and early to mid-seventies) and comedies especially. Today, if you want to be cutting edge, you have to attack what makes people uncomfortable. Back then if you wanted to be cutting edge, you made fun of the worst, most despicable and ignorant that people could be. But you did it with immense observational humour to lampoon the worst of human nature.I love M*A*S*H, Catch-22 and especially Blazing Saddles. These are three films that really get under your skin as comedies, all for different reasons, but they share the same quick wit and jaw dropping slapstick comedy that have more a theatrical charm that cinema doesn't often have the privilege of witnessing.To think that before the comedy partnership of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor there was Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little. This is a partnership made in comedy heaven and yet Blazing Saddles is made of comedy partnerships all around with an excellent cast.Getting down to brass tacks, Blazing Saddles is an outlandish western comedy from Mel Brooks (which says it all) and possibly his best. Centered around the introduction of slave Bart (Little) as the new Sheriff of a western town, at the suggestion of the very man trying to destroy it, he teams up with Jim aka Waco Kid (Wilder) to stand up for that very town, which is very big on despicably out and proud racism.What makes that okay? It's not okay. It's quite dismaying the first few times and those that said the same about Django should have seen this first, came out of their protective shell and realised that it was nothing new.Blazing Saddles pokes insurmountable fun at the calibre of racist folk and Cleavon Little is both hugely charismatic and hilarious as Sheriff Bart, in comparison. Not surprisingly, he goes on to win the people's hearts and minds, despite the fact it doesn't stop them being big dumb and very possibly inbred racists.That's the charm of this movie. It doesn't preach that you have to change. It gives up on the possibility of change and settles for knowing that morons will never change. That's the truth and we should accept it, because nothing's worse than a moron pretending to be anything but a moron, right? I recommend this to anyone so far up Quentin Tarantino's a*** that they no longer know how to laugh at anything actually funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the railroad runs into quicksand, they have to reroute through Rock Ridge. When the town demands a new sheriff, the corrupt Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) gets the governor (Mel Brooks) to send Bart (Cleavon Little) the black man about to be hanged as the new sheriff. He hopes to make the town easy pickings, but Bart with the help of Jim (Gene Wilder) resists the scheming Lamarr.Everybody loves the farting. But I love punching out the horse the best. If Mel Brooks is your kind of comedy, this is definitely one of his best. I downgrade this movie a little bit because I really wish they could have used Richard Pryor instead of Cleavon Little. No matter how much I like this movie, it would have been 10x better with Pryor. The role is tailor made for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Then it would be banned and lambasted by race-based groups so fast, it would be funny in a sense. Almost makes you want to make a movie like this just to see how much hate you can conjure.Blazing Saddles is a story about a corrupt man wanting to run his railroad through a nearby town, but unfortunately must somehow run the people off the land so he can do so. His solution? Hire a sheriff who he figures will only last 24 hours. So what kind of sheriff is that? A black one. However, logic and common sense is lost in a sea of jokes and dirty humor that will keep viewers rolling on the floor, and eventually, laughing so hard they'll crash through the walls of the Warner bros. movie studios.Sadly, time and political correctness have overtaken the world and there would be so many groups that would criticize this movie for it's extreme usage of unacceptable words and stereotype. But really, the real humor is directed at everyone equally, no matter what color your skin is or your sexual orientation.I highly recommend you check this movie out, it's filled with so many gags and jokes that you'll have to watch the movie several times before you get them all.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Saddles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was first shown this movie from my dad who thought I would find it hilarious. Indeed it was as I am a sucker for comedies and this one took the gold. Mel Brooks is an amazing director and took the risk about making a racist movie just after the civil rights movement. The reason why I am writing a review about Blazing Saddles is due to the laughter that it brought me.Summary: So there is this town in the middle of the American West called Rock Ridge. Looks like the stereotypical west in the late 1800's. However the town is threatened by a railroad company who are trying to build the track through their city. However, there are loopholes keeping the town intact. So the owner of the railroad company orders for the citizens to be scared off by hired mercenaries.After attacks on the town, the citizens request a new sheriff to run off the bandits. the sheriff turns out to be a black guy whom everyone is scared of. (the movie uses the word "Nigger" at least 100+ times). So after gaining a little bit of trust, the sheriff finds out that one of the current prisoners is "The Waco Kid". The sheriff befriends the Waco Kid and he and the town band together and stop the railroad company.It is hilarious, racial slurs, parodies, crossovers, and historical gangs, this movie will leave you in stitches. It is hard to explain in such a review, but I recommend you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Mel Brooks' Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks has made so many great movies and a few misses. "Young Frankenstein" is his best, but "Space Balls" is downright boring in spots! My personal underrated favorite is "Men in Tights." Also "To Be or Not to Be" is a brilliant remake and I love both versions of "The Producers". So many classics I haven't even mentioned. Originally written by and for Richard Pryor, Cleavon Little plays Sheriff "Black Bart" to the hilt. Gene Wilder is surprisingly likable as "The Waco Kid". Madeline Kahn's performance almost won her an Oscar! Look for David Huddleston (best known as "Santa Claus") and Harvey Korman as Heddley Lemarr. Alex Karas is Mongo! Superb. Slim Pickens plays the stereotypical cowboy parody-of-himself to new comical heights. Ever notice how stupid the "White People" are in this film? The townspeople are all inbred and all named "Johnson". Hilarious! Several thoughts as I watch this for the 30th time (or more): What's with the cows running thru every scene? Far too much use of the "N Word" for my taste. I never liked the ending that much but the pie fight in the WB Commissary is still a riot. I wish they had stayed in "costume" in the Old West instead of the modern ending, driving off the set in a 1974 Cadillac. Otherwise, one of the funniest, irrelevant, and most ridiculous movies of all time. Not for the easily offended, as it insults everybody! Rated "NC-17" for it's salty language. A close runner up is "History of the World Part I".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perilous Mix of High-Brow and Low-Brow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My introduction to the wacky world of Mel Brooks came from the admittedly mediocre medieval parody Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993). Its funny for the most part, but those in my generation who are adamant supporters of the merry romp probably haven't seen it since they were knee high. Today the movie is as aged as a pair of hand-me-down gym socks. Though I suppose for children of the 70's Up in Smoke (1978) probably existed before there was "bad taste".Blazing Saddles (1974) lives beyond the realm of bad taste and mediocrity. While aiming to please a mass audience and appeal to baser senses, Mel Brooks created a timeless classic that is masterful in its execution of politically incorrect irreverence. A western parody of epic proportions. A wondrous side splitting comedy?I may be getting ahead of myself.For those who are not familiar with Mel Brooks and his perilous mix of high-brow and low- brow comedy, Blazing Saddles concerns the troubles of the western town of Rockridge. The people are being forced out by a politically connected bad guy (Harvey Korman), looking to cash in on the railroad craze. Requesting a new sheriff from the corrupt governor, the townspeople are surprised and angered by the appearance of Bart (Cleavon Little), a black man willing to take the job.In addition to being famous as the mainstream introduction to the fart joke, Blazing Saddles is also noted or its frank and often hilarious treatment of racism. The N-word is uttered over thirty times over the course of a 90 minute movie, and the attitude towards African- Americans, Chinese-Americans, Native-Americans and the Irish is over-the-top bigotry on the part of the townspeople.Cleavon Little plays Bart as a bright, savvy and appealing young man who is constantly at odds with the narrow-minded townsfolk and greedy villains. His only friend is a former gunslinger turned career alcoholic, The Waco Kid (Gene Wilder). Working together they devise several schemes to foil plans for a monopolized take-over of the local economy, all while slowly gaining trust with the people.The fourth wall is broken several times over the course of the movie, one time near the end as been recorded in the annals of film history as the most outrageous Hollywood spoof of the seventies. It reminds me of an interview with John Cleese of Monty Python fame who divulged that the troupe could never find a good way to end their skits so they just smash-cut to the next scene. Mel Brooks obviously didn't want to end his movie in a cliché way so he ended it with a similar tact only with much more mayhem.As I have grown to love and appreciate westerns I have grown to appreciate Blazing Saddles more and more. There are subtle references to Shane (1953), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Stagecoach (1939) and of course Destry Rides Again (1939) all of which are syncopated and propped up against references to Count Basie and Cole Porter. John Wayne was even approached to play a small role in the film but he refused saying it was too vulgar; he then told Brooks "...but I'll be the first to see it."Those of the younger fold were probably introduced to Mel Brooks through Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995); that's if they have been introduced to his genius at all. I try not to be a golden age thinker but I can't help but feel sad for those likely to miss out. From The Producers (1967) to Broadway's The Producers, Mel Brooks is no doubt one of the funniest, most original writers, directors and performers to ever exist. If you have not been introduced to his works check them out before its too late.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, stupid, and risky: elements of a comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" is probably the best possible definition of Mel Brooks's humor, but it's worth taking a shot at a verbal definition anyway: most of the sight gags are straight out of Looney Tunes, and most of the dialogue is unspeakable in polite society. On the Looney Tunes point: Sheriff Bart (a very funny Cleavon Little) shows up in a period-inappropriate bellhop uniform, marches up to a rampaging lunkhead named Mongo, and says in a high-pitched Bugs Bunny-esque voice, "Telegram!" Mongo accepts the delivery, Sheriff Bart crisply walks away with his fingers in his ears, and the package explodes in Mongo's face, leaving him sullied and smoking. The Merry Melodies theme plays and the scene fades to black. You might not expect that kind of thing to work in live action, but it does. As to the dialogue, Mel Brooks hardly exaggerates when he says in a recent interview that the movie could not be made now. Strangely, it might skate by with a PG- 13 rating, going strictly by the MPAA's infamously stupid "de facto censorship" system: there are few or no F-bombs and no nudity. Yet the overall impression is that far more sensitive taboos than these are being lampooned, and many are the jokes that might prompt boycotts, demonstrations, and general condemnation today. In 1974, though, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and Warner Brothers not only released it but was a character in it; the studio's iconic lot?tour groups, cafeteria, and all?is the setting of one of the most memorable scenes. The movie's repeated acknowledgment that it is a movie is another Mel Brooks hallmark. His films parody Hollywood, but they exhibit real affection for it too, and this one is full of references to the likes of Cecil B. DeMille, the Academy Awards, Douglas Fairbanks, "High Noon," "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," and so on. In other words, this film contains the kind of smart, flattering stuff that Hollywood loves to reward, the fart jokes that audiences want, and the fresh, risky content that gives critics something to write about. It is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a refreshing movie. It addresses racial prejudice in a very open forum. Clevon Little is great as the up lifted black man who gets appointed sheriff to all white town that is under threat of attack from a bunch of rednecks working for the governor of the territory. the townspeople don't like it until Clevon comes with a plan to save the town using the labor of some black railroad laborers. There are just too many great stars to single out all of them. However, I like Alex Karas as Mongo (I actually know that a man can drive a horse to its knees because my Grandfather did it), Slim Pickens as the totally committed redneck boss. Madeline Kahn plays a role that I don't think she is suited for. She plays a temptress and I personally don't think she is sexy enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks succeeds in this Western farce that shoots from the hip at stereotypes while letting slapstick run shod over the small incestuous troubled town. The first Black sheriff in the West (Cleavon Little) sophisticated beyond his subjects, makes do along with sidekick The Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) to win over the town confidence. Full of tasteless jokes and comments that generally served as a social mirror (the truth seems funny when revealed as simply ridiculous), "Blazing Saddles" has Mel's signature cast of himself, Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, with a perfect casting of Slim Pickens, the infamous Alex Karras scenes and an ending that was slick and still in character.

		<fullReview>This is the parody that the whole (By that I mean partial) family should see. It is (In my opinion) one of the best comedy's ever made. I laughed my A** off at the scene where they moved from the west into Hollywood. The scene where Harvey Korman get's shot in the doodle. Aside from that, Blazing Saddles is a story about an African American man (Cleavon Little) becomes a sheriff in a small western town. The towns people hate that they have a black guy as a sheriff. They start to get along with him by the end. What i like about this movie. Is that there is so many jokes like the fastest hands in the west. The censorship joke when cleavon rides into town. It is just a funny comedy. I Don't think the movie is rated R. It is PG-13. If your kids know the time period. Than the movie is fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, if wayward, satire that's aged more than most - 74%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may have taken some time after recording it but this was one of those films I was initially weary of. Everyone had told me how funny it was but bawdy humour doesn't really appeal to me. But this has something else besides fart gags and rampant stereotype-bashing - it's a legitimate look at the hypocrisy of racism, the ineffectiveness of government and the shady business of movie-making itself. To be fair, there is also much for the less-discerning viewer but frankly, you should know what to expect from the film-maker who memorably brought us the song "Springtime For Hitler".It's 1874 and after encountering quicksand during construction of a railroad, shady politician Hedley Lemarr (Harvey Korman) reckons the best way around is to go through the sleepy town of Rock Ridge and dupes the infantile idiot governor (Mel Brooks) into sending a black sheriff to the town. He figures that they'll either lynch him on the spot or be so outraged that they'll leave - either way, it clears the town to make way for the railroad. But it turns out that Bart (Cleavon Little) is a worthy sheriff, slowly winning over the racist inhabitants of Ridge Rock with his sharp-shooting deputy the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) and surviving every attempt on his life that Lemarr and his cohort Taggart (Slim Pickins) throw at him.The only other Mel Brooks film I'd been exposed to previously was "Spaceballs" and like that, "Blazing Saddles" is a movie that dares to challenge convention from the off. Liberal use of the 'N' word, blatantly sexist characters in the "Carry On" tradition and scenes of mind-bending logic combine to make this feel less like a film and more like a random stream of consciousness from the early Seventies - cutting edge, this isn't. And yet it's hard to think of a film since that illustrates as well how absurd racism is. I'll admit that while there were some scenes I found funny (the now-legendary campfire scene still stands the test of time), there were some that simply didn't work - the ending, for example, felt rushed and written to a deadline and didn't work for me despite Dom DeLuise camping it up superbly. Wilder and Little are a great double-act as Korman hams it up as the baddie and it's great to see nobody taking things too seriously.It may be as contemporary as a Shakespearean comedy but "Blazing Saddles" remains a solid comedy and probably Brooks' best film. Maybe I'm the wrong type of viewer but I simply didn't find it gut-bustingly funny as I'd been led to believe. It is a brilliant piece of satire, however - every bit as good as something more modern like "Team America: World Police" - and on that basis, I do recommend this movie. I was just expecting to get blown away and it didn't happen so I guess my expectations were too high. Still, if you like the movies completely off the chain then this will certainly float your boat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still One of a Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outrageous romp that still has its hilarious moments, though I suspect much of its cutting edge shock has thinned since I first saw it 40-years ago. Now its politically incorrect as heck with use of the N-word and the gleeful beating of the gay chorus boys. Inside all the surreal nonsense , however, a couple of serious themes emerge. There's the steady commentary on race as Bart (Little) tries to win over the town to the idea of a black sheriff. No need to dwell on the obvious.The other, however, only emerges at the end when the movie merges with reality as the battling factions carry their fisticuffs through the Warner Bros. lot onto the street. To my knowledge, this is the only film to switch from fictional narrative to the sound stage where it's being filmed. It's as if fiction blends into real life as Korman gets into the cab and announces he's tired of the picture and wants to go home. Looked at another way, Brooks has managed the difficult trick of spoofing a spoof.No need to recap the much discussed hilarious parts. It is a shame, however, that Madeline Kahn's droll brand of humor was lost at such an early age. Here, her underplayed comic effect makes a colorful counterpoint to the film's broadly done style. Anyway, despite some wear, the spoof is still funny as heck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hail to the Chief!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Western of Mel Brooks is just a fun ride through the old American West. There are many memorable moments with hilarious characters, most of them are just fools so that works perfect. The governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks), definitely my favourite character in the entire film even he only appears in a couple of scenes, leads the authorities and has in Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) is right hand. Lamarr has his own right hand in the chief of the people working in the new railroad. So in these characters we have the classic bastards with power in the Old West. Their future victims are the people in the quiet town of Rock Ridge because is the place where the new railroad is going to pass so they MUST leave their town even if they don't want. But here is when the great and funny things of the film are because the people of Rock Ridge are the classic victims but actually they are just racist morons so the governor and pals send a black man as the new sheriff (Cleavon Little) being sure that the people in town will never accept him and they are going to leave the town. But what those morons don't know is that this new sheriff is going to be the hero in this story and also the one who ends with the ignorance of the people in the town where the only normal man was the drunk of town (Gene Wilder) who was actually a true legend of the old West and he was known as The Waco Kid.Is just great how Mel Brooks makes fun upon the classic politicians but at the same he is making fun upon the people for the town, a town full of ignorance and racism. So the protagonist roles are for two unusual heroes that make that the people learn to work as a team even with simple and absurd plans that works perfect if your enemies are politicians. And the end is just original and very funny leaving a bizarre thought to the tourist of how the people eat in Hollywood and with the protagonist watching his own film. A great end!The Cast: is magnificent. Cleavon and Gene are a funny and a unique couple but my favourite performances are the ones of the politicians. My favourite is Mel Brooks with only three scenes (one as the Indian chief) that are just hilarious. Madeline Kahn is also very good with that famous dance scene but I don't really know if her Oscar nomination for best actress in a supporting role was really deserved.Conclusion: "Blazing Saddles" is definitely one of my favourites films of Mel Brooks and a really funny Western. Nothing else to add just that if you haven't seen it, well go and get it. Hail to Mel Brooks! Hail to Mongo for hitting that horse!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Telegram for Mongo!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American film comedy in the '70's was dominated by two men - Woody Allen and Mel Brooks. The latter had made the hilarious ( though unappreciated at the time ) 'The Producers' and the little-seen 'The Twelve Chairs'. With two flops to his credit, that should have been the last of him. Fortunately for us, Warner Bros. gave him the finance to make this outrageous Western spoof.Andrew Bergman had written a script called 'Tex X', about a black Sheriff sent to 'clean up' a crime-ridden town in The Wild West, only to find the bigoted locals don't appreciate his efforts. Brooks bought it, and along with other writers such as the brilliant Richard Pryor, made it funnier still.I didn't get to see 'Blazing Saddles' until 1978, when it was shown on a double-bill at my local theatre with 'Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail'. In those days, there was no Internet to give away the plots of movies, so I came to it not really knowing what to expect. By the time the final credits rolled, my sides ached from laughing too much. I was not alone. Even the usherette could not hold her torch properly.Before the Python movie got underway, we were treated to a trailer for a reissued Lee Van Cleef spaghetti Western, and the audience laughed. Having just sat through 'Blazing Saddles', it was impossible to take Westerns seriously any longer. Indeed the genre went out of fashion shortly after its release, and has yet to make anything resembling a full recovery.It brought a dose of much-needed reality to the cowboy flick by focusing on something the others had ignored - racial prejudice. When railroad workers encounter quicksand, they test its depth by ordering two black men to ride a handcart straight through it.Predictably, it sinks, yet the foreman is more concerned with saving the handcart than the men. Later, a wagon containing a black family is forced to travel in a circle by itself during an Indian attack because the whites don't want it in theirs. The 'N' word is bandied around an awful lot in this movie, I'm afraid, but serves a useful purpose. It reminds us how ignorant prejudiced people are. Only idiots ever use words of that calibre.The movie broke new ground in another respect. The now infamous campfire scene features cowboys eating beans and farting like there's no tomorrow. We are so used to farting in comedies now that it no longer has shock value, but back in those days it was akin to someone stepping on the moon for the first time.Cleavon Little, Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens, Gene Wilder and Brooks himself all contribute marvellous comic performances, ones we will treasure for as long as people love to laugh.Bad taste abounds; in one scene, an old woman is beaten up by thugs, and in another, a retarded man ( 'Mongo' ) blown up. P.C. this sure ain't. The ending in which the cowboy fight spills out of the studio and into an adjacent set where a Busby Berkeley-type musical is being made has proved controversial over the years, with many branding it a cop-out, but I disagree. Brooks knew exactly what he was doing.Funniest moment - it has to be the aforementioned campfire scene. I don't normally laugh at farting in movies, but here it feels so right. Mind you, it put me off beans for life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely One of the Greatest Mel Brooks Films Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks has outdone himself this time around. He has not only made fun of the Western and added a few traits at the time to it, he has also made fun of the blaxploitation genre that was thriving in the underground cinema in 1974. You see, this was not just something that Mel had pop into his head and start making immediately. He saw what politically correct can do, so he made this whilst combining blaxploitation and Western genres to make this parody.Cleavon Little stars as Black Bart, a railroad worker destined to be hung because he hit his boss in the head with a shovel, is appointed mayor of Rock Ridge, which is to be destroyed, by greedy Attorney General Hedley "Hedy" Lamarr. At first, Bart is d by the town, made up of a bunch of Johnsons, but finds a friend and soon defeats Mongo, an enemy of the town who becomes their biggest ally. Bart finds out about Hedley's plan to destroy Rock Ridge, so he gets some friends of his and makes the town work together with them. They end up making a faux Rock Ridge with faux people and the enemies, which include Mexicans and Hell's Angels, get fooled. Somehow, the town attacks and they end up breaking the fourth wall to the extent that they fight at Warner Bros. Pictures and Hedley is shot at Grauman's Chinese Theater.I give this move a 9/10, because it can drag on and doesn't have as much laughs as his later films, like "Spaceballs" or "High Anxiety".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I jinxed it by reading about how important it was too many times, but it was unquestionably funnier and a better film than The Producers, which had me beginning to wonder if Mel Brooks was anything like what he was cracked up to be. While there seem to be some lulls, Brooks overall succeeds at depicting outrageous racism, often without much humor to shield the audience or the protagonist from its blunt impact, and then succeeds in depicting an almost cartoonish comedic effort to squash it. It's a "deconstruction" of the western in that it fills in the blanks, rather than, say, the thoughtless revisionism that leads to casting Will Smith as the lead in Wild, Wild West and hoping we'll accept that no white character in the film notices.It is, then, interesting to see how positive and forceful the political message of this film is, considering that the most one gets out of Producers is that gays and Germans are allegedly funny. The film isn't always a laugh-riot, but it earns our patience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest movies ever. We all know it is slap-shtick but that is what makes it so funny. Mel Brooks, Richard Pryor as writers, how can you go wrong! Slim Pickens is great as Taggert. Alex Karras plays Mongo better than anyone could. Cleavon Little does an awesome job as Bart, he went on to do a lot of TV after this movie. Gene Wilder is very funny as the recovering drunk the "Waco Kid". Harvey Korman will make you laugh out loud over and over as the dastardly Hedly Lamarr. Nothing is spared in the parody department, westerns, Jewish people, black people, white people this movie hits them all, and takes no prisoners. So sit back and enjoy, you'll be quoting from this movie for weeks.I was trying to explain this movie to a friend who had not seen it, he heard several of us talking about the movie. We just had to play it for him, he is a art house type so movies with low brow humor never appealed to him, and yet he laughed out loud through most of the movie. He said later that he had avoided it these years because he had thought it was going to be sophomoric, we told him he was right it is, but that is what makes it so funny, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. Next we will introduce him to Young Frankenstien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike your Average Western Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the mind of everyone's favorite Jewish Comedian Mel Brooks.Brings you a Western Comedy: Blazing Saddles.Takes place in 1874 in the back lot of Warner Bros. Studio in 1974.A small western town is torn upside down when some Railroad Company Owner named Hedly wants more land for his rails to go through.The town is in need for a sheriff. But they meet their new sheriff, they didn't expected him to be black. Bart who was once a poor railroad worker was selected as the new Sheriff. But pretty soon the town folks will see him as a hero instead of your average black guy.But can Bart stop Hedly's evil plans in demolishing the town he's suppose to protect. With the help of his black railroad friends, the town folks and a deputy named Wakco Kid aka Jim, you surely expect to see who'll beat the odds of winning.This was released during the same year as Mel Brook's other classic, Young Frankenstein. Has the humor and Jewish jokes you'd find in Brook's other comedies. It makes fun of average western films.Just know this movie might not be for everyone. Due to it being rated R for language, mild humor, and race jokes. It's not hatred racism, just harmless fun. Just know this film wasn't made to offend anyone in either way.Renting this movie would be a good idea. Just in case if you'd like it or dislike it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nine out of ten is a very healthy number considering the history and breath of film making the last 100 years. I'll qualify my vote as a nine out of ten for landmark and timeless comedy. Mel Brooks is a comedic genius and it doesn't take a genius to say that. His lifetime scope of work, the characters created, and the view of the world he has lives on in his two greatest motion picture parodies, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. Many younger people today are well aware of Brooks' smash Broadway play, The Producers, and it would serve them well to see the above two movies as a further testimonial to his artistry.I won't even go player by player, including Brooks himself, other than to say the characters played by this all-star cast will live on in movie history. Everything from the writing, to the concept, to the homage paid to the westerns of past movie generations, and to poking fun at our own view of history is wrapped up in this thoroughly enjoyable film. See it and I dare you to swear you didn't laugh out loud. Listen carefully though cause like an old Marx Brothers film if you laugh too loudly you'll miss the next classic line.</fullReview>

Another Mel Brooks film to must watch if you love this one would also be History of the World Part One and of course... always and forever... his "Young Frankenstein". And I vote that Gene Wilder is easily one of the greatest comedic film actors of all time. And yes, his partnership in film with the late great Richard Pryor was extraordinary. Richard will be missed. Love you Richard! Well, enjoy watching and I don't work for any of the above so I wasn't paid to write this! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks managed to parody westerns, make a biting social satire and make a fall down funny movie all at the same time!I just bought the 30th anniversary edition DVD and it is even funnier than I remember.Though I am a big fan of Richard Pryor,i feel that Cleavon Little was perfect as Bart.Harvey Korman was delightfully E-ViL as Headly Lamar.Madeline Kahn,Gene Wilder,Slim Pickens were all excellent! Even Brooks himself as the Governor And the Yiddish speaking Indian chief was a classic bit in my mind.Even the minor characters delivered some classic lines! In a real way I feel like we as a society have regressed instead of progressed.Blazing Saddles probably couldn't get made today because it would offend to many liberal PC-loving nincompoops. Not that should make any difference,but I am a 49 year black man.I loved the movie when first came out and I still love 30 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite comedy movies along with another from Mel Brooks - "Young Frankenstein". I first saw this movie at a theater in Phoenix, Arizona soon after it was released and had trouble hearing some of the dialog because of the laughter. Since then I have seen it several times at home and enjoy it very much. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys great entertainment. One caveat however: I have also seen the "cleaned-up" version on regular broadcast TV and the edited movie just isn't as funny as the original in my opinion. The "N" word is used many times throughout the original so if that is not a problem, enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may convince me that there's a tie between B. Saddles and Young Frankenstein, but the world-class, drop-dead hilarity of this flick cannot be denied. Most scenes in Blazing Saddles are so good as to be able to stand alone as their own comedy bits. The fact that they can be watched as a single,continuous whole as opposed to as a sketch film ala Amazon Women on the Moon is incredible to me. I have seen it many times and come away with something else at which to laugh after each viewing. The cast is impeccable, the dialogue unrepentingly irreverent (where all the white women at?) and the jokes are nonstop. Run, do not walk to see it.</fullReview>

In my social circle, someone will quote a part of the movie and the next 5-10 minutes is spent with the rest of us filling in the lines. Truly one of the best comedic efforts ever put to the screen. I first saw this movie in a theater in 1974 with my father. I had never seen him laugh as hard as he did watching Blazing Saddles. We sat through the next showing and laughed even harder at all the bits we missed the first time through.

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other people will point to The Producers or Young Frankenstein, but for me this is Mel Brooks's best movie. It has just got so much going for it and contains so many types of humour - parody, slapstick, visual gags, innuendo, toilet humour, etc. The cast is generally great but there are some stand-outs: Cleavon Little has a lot of charisma in the lead role, Gene Wilder plays the sheriff's washed-up sidekick well and while Harvey Korman is over-the-top as the villain, it works - presumably because he knows he is being hammy, that is his character. A lot of the great spoofs and gross-out comedies of the last 30 years owe a debt to this film. That it's not in IMDb's list of top 50 comedies suggests that there is a problem with the qualifying system - Blazing Saddles will have you laughing a lot more than the majority of the stuff that did make the 50.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would rank this film among one of the greatest comedies ever made, going alongside such classics as Dr. Strangelove and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.I'd say about 80% of the gags work, which is a lot better than most movies (especially ones nowadays).JOKE SPOILERS.My favourite gags would have to include "Rape, murder, arson and rape", "We'll give some land to the n*ggers and the chinks, but we don't want the Irish", "We don't care if it's the first act of Henry V", and especially the toll-booth gag.SPOILERS END.The film isn't perfect, however, having a rather simple story, but with so much humour it's easy to overlook.Throw in a great score and opening theme song, good acting, and a truly surreal ending, and you've got one very under-rated movie on your hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just one of the funny memorable lines from Mel Brooks' classic comedy. Another memorable one is "Where all the white women at?!" This movie would receive such criticism today if were released as it is peppered with many derogatory words and expressions. In fact, it probably would be so watered down if made today that it would be a entirely different movie. Not that prejudice is funny but the movie shows how stupid these bigots are so it makes you laugh. Actor Clevon Little excellently portrays Bart, the sheriff put in place by Heldey Lamarr in the hopes that the residents will leave town so Lamarr can build a railroad through it. Lamarr's plan backfires because Sheriff Bart wins over the townspeople with his willingness to put his life on the line to save the town from demolition. Mel Brooks often uses clichés and jokes about the customs and traditions of particular groups. He often pokes fun at the Jewish and he himself is Jewish.Actors Harvey Korman (Heldey Lamarr) and Gene Wilder (the Waco Kid) are also excellent and perfectly casted. When you find out Richard Pryor co-wrote the screenplay, it all makes sense that such an original and fresh movie came out in 1974. Pryor is arguably one of the greatest comedians of the 20th century. The ending of the movie is over the top chaotic fun, but it's hard to picture the movie ending any other way.If you haven't seen "Blazing Saddles", you're truly missing out on a comedic gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing a trail of hilarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attorney General Hedley Lemar, convinces the simple-minded governor to send Rock Ridge, a dying old western town, a new mayor. The catch being that the new mayor is Bart (GASP!) a Negro (Cleavon Little, in the role of his lifetime). Obviously these racist cracker townsfolk won't stand for this dark uppity day. However Bart, along with his new deputy, a drunken sharpshooter, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder, excellent as always) proves to be a thorn in Hedley's side. This, along with "Young Frankenstein" are the two most crowning achievements of not only Mel Brook's films, but comedy cinema on a whole. Most of the jokes work and the laughs just keep coming no matter how many times you watch it. All the character in addition to the main two are all memorable as well, from Alex Karras as the over-grown, dim-witted Mongo, to Harvey Korman as Hedy..um.. I mean Hedley, and everyone in between. The non-ending ending, I'm not so much a fan of, bu the rest is gold.My Grade: A 30th Anniversary DVD Extras: 'scene specific' Commentary by Mel Brooks (which is really the same POS half-ass one as in earlier versions of this movie); 28 minute &amp; 20 second 'Back in the Saddle' retrospective; a small piece on Madeline Khan; 'Black Bart' failed pilot; 9 minutes &amp; 41 seconds of deleted scenes; and Theatrical Trailer</fullReview>

Cleavon Little stars as the first black sheriff in a kind of red-neck town in the cowboy days. Befriending him is the Waco kid played hilariously by Gene Wilder. The film is jam-packed with racially insensitive humor (I think it might be impossible to count how many times the 'n' word is used in the film), but it is freakin' hysterical. Written by Richard Pryor and Mel Brooks (among others), 'Blazing Saddles' boasts an ingenious script filled with lots of laughs. Mel Brooks plays both the cross-eyed mayor and an Indian chief, while Oscar nominee Madeline Kahn is great as Lily, who finds out that the myth about slave folk is true. I recommend this to anyone willing to excuse the out-dated humor. Definitely a comedic classic! Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks was the symbol of film comedy beginning in the late 1960s all the way through the 1980s, a period of nearly twenty years. His films include "The Producers," "Young Frankenstein," "History of the World: Part I," "Spaceballs," and, of course, "Blazing Saddles.""Blazing Saddles" is one of the funniest films ever made, it is the epitome of serious sarcasm, and it is the influence of many popular films and television shows since, such as "What's Up, Doc?" and "Seinfeld." The film stars Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder as Bart and Jim, and it details their absurd attempt to overcome "Hedy" Lamarr's insatiable greed to steal land from, as he puts it, "the rightful owners." Also playing supporting roles are Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp and Mel Brooks himself as Governor William J. LePetomaine. So, if you're looking for a film that will make you laugh as much as "The Exorcist" scares, think "Blazing Saddles."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Saddles - A Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have screened this several times, seen the TV version, met one of the characters (Slim Pickins) and have several good things to say about the film.It is classic Mel Brooks, great comedy, and deserves a place in the comedy-western genre. (Can you think of many others?) The parody of many of Hollywood's classics are easy to define throughout the production. The characters are memorable, as are many of the lines and sight gags. This movie will endure.My only reservations are the numerous "rough spots" found in the movie, too many errors and gaffs in the acting that I think a more seasoned Mel Brooks would not have allowed. Too often my suspension of disbelief was intruded upon by something that should have been more seamless in the production. All of that aside, I still very much enjoy Blazing Saddles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: Mel Brooks, Script: Andrew Bergman, Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Richard Pryor, Alan Uger. Cast: Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, Madeline Kahn, Mel Brooks.Where do I begin with this movie? It is rude, crude, tasteless, not politically correct--- this is why it is so dam good! Blazing saddles has all the requisites for a great comedy. This is one movie where the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts(did I say that right!) Every actor is good in their own right but together-- wow! It is non stop laughter. For example, the scene at the beginning when the two black guys are on the cart and they end up in quick sand and the white guys come to rescue not them but the hand cart. And of course the famous farting scene. Also, the skit with Madeline Kahn in the bar still makes me roar with laughter. The scene with Mel brooks as 'the gov', it goes on and on. It seems as if everyone has seen this movie but if you haven't, go out today and either rent it or preferably buy it.As far as the cast goes, they are all great. Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman are hilarious. Gene Wilder and Cleavon Litte are great together. Richard Pryor was originally chosen for the part that was eventually given to Cleavon Little but was unable to do so. He did help write the screenplay however. I thought Cleavon Little was great in this part.And of course there's Mel Brooks who not only acted in but also directed, co-wrote and did the music for(I love the theme song!) This movie has been accused of being racist but it is not at all. In interviews Mel Brooks has stated that most black people that he talked to were not offended and thought that the movie was funny. It was white people that thought it was racist. My only real complaint about this move is perhaps the end when the cast goes running around Warner Brothers studios and Hollywood. I'm not so sure that was necessary. Anyhow, it does have some funny moments and it features Dom Deluise. This along with Young Frankenstein(also by Mel Brooks)are among the all time funniest. They don't make comedies like this anymore!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The granddaddy of the comedy spoof films. Mel Brooks had his first box office bonanza with this comedy western. Its as funny now as it was back then. I don't need to tell you anything it is sheer nonsense in a nutshell. Every western ever made is goofed on here. Cleavon Little is great as Black Bart, Gene Wilder Brilliant as the Waco Kid, Harvey Korman is so sensational as Hedley Lamaar. Mel Brooks as the Govonor,, who googles after his secretary played by Robyn Hilton. He also plays an Indian chief. Dom DeLuise in a kooky cameo as Buddy Lazare is funny. Slim Pickens is wonderful too as Taggart as is Alex Karras as Mongo. John Hillerman, David Huddleston, Liam Dunn, Burton Gilliam and Carol Arthur are all delightful as the townfolk of Rock Ridge all with the same last name Johnson. The real star of the movie is none other than Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Schtup. She got her second academy award nomination for her extraordinary comic performance. She did the best take-off of Marlene Dietrich in history. Whenever I see a Markene Dietrich movie I always think of Madeline Kahn. The movie has a silly ending, but doesn't hurt it nevertheless. Always keep your eyes open for sight gags. The songs are all great too like I'm Tired, Put Out Your Hands, The Rock Ridge song and the title track Blazing Saddles. A comedy classic with a cast of pros. Like the Warner Brothers said back then You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet. Sit back and relax and laugh yourself into hysterics. If they were to remake this movie it would be pointless, you can never top the originality of this one. It was the first of its kind. Our children's children will be loving this gem as much as we did. Buy it and own it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad this film was made when it was, because there's not an icicle's chance in Phoenix that the Sensitivity Police would let it be made today. It's POLITICALLY INCORRECT in capital letters, and one of the funniest films ever made. Besides the gut-busting quality of the humor, there's also a high quantity. The wordplay and sight gags are packed so tightly that it takes several viewings before a viewer can catch them all. I must admit that, when it first came out, "Blazing Saddles" made me slightly uncomfortable, but I finally rationalized my laughing at it by figuring that Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor had the right to make fun of Jews and Blacks if they wanted -- and stupid Honkies while they were at it -- so why not join the fun? I don't give this movie a 10 because I don't feel that it's consistent all the way through. In my opinion the laughs peak at the fireside flatulence scene, and after that the film wanders off in some directions which aren't as funny as the first part. It's still worth seeing, as long as you aren't offended by scatological and racist references delivered with great enthusiasm and hilarity. I especially like Madeline Kahn as Lily Von Schtupp. The interplay between her and Cleavon Little contains some of the film's best moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Mel Brooks Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a sheriff is killed in an old western town, a black sheriff is sent to take his place. But the politically connected Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) doesn't like this idea. He wants the town for himself so he sends his henchmen to take it from the townspeople.Meanwhile, the new sheriff (Cleavon Little), meets a drunken cowboy (Gene Wilder) and they befriend each other. The two of them, along with the townspeople, come up with a plan to stop Lamarr and hilarity ensues. The plot even involves a singer/dancer (Madeline Kahn) who tries to stop the new sheriff from succeeding.If there was ever one film that made you laugh at least once every time there was a joke, this is it. Everything from the seriousness to the punchlines is executed with hilarious consequences that it's a wonder why the film wasn't up for a Screenplay Oscar when it came out.My favorite character is Gene Wilder's portrayal of The Waco Kid. He actually looks and acts like he's drunk. And even when he's not drunk, he's still very funny. That's the comic genius behind the film and Mel Brooks.It deserves its place as one of the top ten funniest movies of all time on the AFI list. So if you like comedies and westerns or at least one of those genres, then you'll love Blazing Saddles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best of the brooks films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i was 5 when i seen this at the drive-in,(a drive-in was a movie screen that was outside and you was in your car watching the flick. for those who don't know what a drive-in was.) i didn't get half the jokes at the time. but the funniest scene for a five year old was the campfire bean eating scene. man i almost wet myself laughing so hard. but as an adult i like the intro of "the kid" in the jail, that cracks me up every time. mel brooks is a comic god, the multi-role is the backbone of the film. wilder and little are a comic duo that's tough to beat. kahn is as funny as she is good looking. korman plays the bad guy great, with that smug attitude. and one of my favorite actors slim pickens as korman's stooge was the ideal role for him to play. one of the greatest comedies of all-time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite films. One of the things this film succeeds in is recognising the fact that political correctness is not always the way to go. Racism is pushed high up the agenda - but purely in MB's typical way of mocking it to prove the point. It's a shame that such a film would not be made nowadays; by sending-up racism it does more to condemn it that by pussyfooting around.Anyway, rants over - it's a very funny film, with some great one-liners and of course there's the famous bean-eating scene. It's funny the first time you see it - because of the way the unexpected happens - but also because of things going on that you recognise on the umpteenth viewing.Highly recommended from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Work, work, work! Work, work, work!" was definitely not the problem while they were filming Blazing Saddles. The movie looks as if the actors and technical staff had a mighty good time in bringing this western-genre-spoof to the big screen. You probably can't make a real comedy without having the time of your life.It makes hilarious fun of racism ("We'll give some land to the Ch**ks and the Ni**ers, but we DON'T want the Irish"), costumes, movie conventions (we all know that chorus-boys in movie musicals are probably all festive-types), government (yes, probably a lot of western governors were drunken womanizers in the bad old days 1871, before there were cameras from Sixty Minutes), preachers too cowardly to defend Christian principals ("You're on your own, son."), inbreeding in isolated western towns (everyone is named 'Johnson'), authentic frontier gibberish (Gabby) and traditional movie sets.Some of the humor is very dated, but we still love the plot-line and think that Mel Brooks is a comic genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is a hilarious western in true Mel Brooks form. If you are in the mood to see something that is going to make you laugh really hard then look no further than this movie. It is pure comic genius. All of the characters are original and Gene Wilder is awesome as he always is. If you like Mel Boooks and haven't seen this movie then you should see it right now. It is classic. Period. The story is pretty basic but it is full of humor so it is all good. The movie is classic like all of Mels works and it is very recommended if you haven't seen it. The movie has a little something for everyone in it. This is one of the movies that never gets old. If you want to laugh then this one will definitely come through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a genre as ripe for satire as the classic western it is difficult to produce a satire that avoids mere copying of the form. By aiming for the cheapest of gags and mixing in the most un-PC language imaginable Brooks/Wilder/Pryor et-al have created one of the funniest movies in its class. Madeline Khan as the Marlene Dietrich alike Lili Von Stupp is superb and Slim Pickens parodies himself to a great effect. Gene Wilder is sly and knowing but ultimately a minor character behind Cleavon Littles jazzed up black sheriff. There is no subtlety, No attempt has been made at plot development or establishing depth of character; rather the film rushes from one gag to another breathlessly. This movie is funny - simple really.</fullReview>

Mel Brooks spares no one or anything when it comes to humor, Old Ladies, blacks, Nazis, kkk Methodists, gays, bikers, Mexicans. you name the group he made fun of it. The action and comedy start right after the opening credits and never ease up. I do see a similarity with the work of the Three Stooges in that generally speaking men love this "in your face" type of comedy and most women don't. Loosen up and don't worry about what other people might think, this movie is really funny, REALLY REALLY Funny. While you are at it watch the rest of Mel's work, you won't regret it.

		<fullReview>BLAZING SADDLES (5 outta 5 stars)Wow... when Mel Brooks was hot he produced and directed some of the greatest comedy movies ever. This may be his best (it's a toss-up between this and "Young Frankenstein")! Cleavon Little stars as "Black Bart" a black ex-slave who becomes the sheriff of a small western town... and has to combat their prejudices... as well as the evil Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) who wants to take over the town... after he drives all the people out. This movie is a send-up of every western movie ever made... hundreds of clichés are mercilessly made fun of. Very, very rude and crude at times... the movie is nonetheless hysterically funny at times. It may seem less shocking today than it did 30 years ago... but the famed "campfire scene" still packs a wallop. The extremely un-PC humour would probably never be allowed in a mainstream movie nowadays (numerous uses of the infamous N-word)... but it's important to note that it's use is not *condoned*... in fact, the movie is a pointed attack against the ignorant and the bigoted who use it so casually. An amazing cast keeps the jokes and slapstick coming non-stop... Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickins, Mel Brooks, Alex Karass, Dom DeLuise and the incomparable Gene Wilder (who did his best work under Mel Brooks' direction.) I could rattle off a half dozen classic funny lines but why deprive those who have not yet seen the movie from discovering them on their own?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A spoof of the entire western genre as seen through the eyes of Mel Brooks. This is also by far Cleavon Little's best movie. This movie allows him to do everything from drama, to singing, to action and even dead-pan humor. There are great performances all around, with the cast consisting of Brooks' company : Wilder, Kormann, Kahn and even the director himself. While this is a spoof of the western genre, it as a subtle and satirical critique as well (of the genre, and of the American west - as it truly was). For example, in the western the hero is typically the sheriff. And true to form, the sheriff is the hero except with one twist : he's black. This is juxtaposed right next to sights gags (aka - telegraph for Mongo) and physical comedy (aka - campfire beans farting joke). This is a must see for any Brooks/Wilder fan. It is extremely funny, however, I still enjoy Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is a "classic" comedy from the early 70's, so it's pre-Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, etc. any comedian that just swears to do it and get a laugh. The comedy is a higher form of low-brow Mel Brooks humor and thankfully NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT AT ALL. It doesn't beg you to know what's coming next, and it is a little subtle on the humor with loads of double entendre and silly stuff, i.e. new Sheriff Black Bart says to the towns folk, "'scuse me while I whip this out" and reaches into his pants... then pulls out a document to read. It then goes on to make fun of just about everyone including stupid white country males. Mel just loves to do this at any turn, and It was made in the early 70s after all so some things today would get cut even on Comedy Central, like the "N-word" too thankfully. Cleavon Little didn't do much following this movie, which is a shame, but Gene Wilder did including Young Frankenstein, another great Mel Brooks movie. I've seen it many times, and now I just need to get the DVD to save all the rental costs.</fullReview>

It's also enhanced for widescreen TVs, so anyone with a TV that has a 16:9 mode will see a third more resolution.The disc also has a 70-minute retrospective documentary, tribute to Madeline Kahn and the complete pilot episode of a proposed TV series spin off.As far as missing scenes, the original movie has not been cut. The new DVD is the director's cut, as Mel Brooks originally wanted it. The deleted scene you are talking about was added to the TV version to get the running time back up because so much stuff had to be cut out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't decide which Mel Brooks production I like better, "BlazingSaddles" or "Young Frankenstein". One has good qualities theother doesn't. Brooks really found his element when he did thisspoof of Hollywood westerns. I just remembered it's the 30thanniversary of this film. The legendary scene featuring whatcowboys usually did after a baked-bean supper and they weren't inmixed company had the audience rolling in the aisles. Somepeople thought it was crude, but give Brooks credit for using thatkind of scene only once. Too many filmmakers have used that toomuch to get laughs. Brooks did it because nobody who madeWesterns ever included that bit of realism. That's by far not the only laugh-out-loud scene in this film. There'sMadeleine Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp doing her take-off of MarleneDietrich in "Destry Rides Again" . Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid.Brooks in cameos as the dimwitted governor William J. LePetomane and a Yiddish-speaking Indian chief who encountersthe young Cleavon Little and his pioneer family. Harvey Kormandoes a nice turn as bad guy railroad man Hedley Lamarr (who hasto keep correcting everybody when they say "Hedy").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSDuring my life, I must have seen some of Mel Brooks' main films countless times. One memory is one New Years Eve when I was about ten where I stayed up late, intentionally so that i could set a video recorder to tape "Young Frankenstein". With both that film, "Silent Movie" and "Blazing Saddles" I was hooked on Mel Brooks. Whilst I would later fall in love with his original version of "The Producers", it was "Blazing Saddles" which originally caught my attention.In this film, Brooks has the brilliant Harvey Korman as Hedley Lamarr, state procurer and assistant to the General who decides that some land where the town of Rock Ridge is placed is going to be worth a lot and worthy of his attentions. As a way of attempting to scare the owners off the land, Lamarr sends Cleavon Little's Bart to the town as Sheriff. As America's first black Sheriff, Bart faces the challenge of winning the towns folk over and thwarting Hedley's evil plans.In this film, Brooks has created a masterpiece of comedic genius. Whilst times have changed since 1974, in particular the attitudes towards racism, "Blazing Saddles" remains fresh and funny. In characters like The Waco Kid and Lili Von Shtupp, Brooks gives Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn and company a gift.It's hard to know what to say about this film really. Simply put, it's hilarious and amazing. The characters are brilliant, the lines are great, and ultimately nothing can really be criticised. Watch this film and enjoy it, I know I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is arguably the best pure comedy parodies ever! It takes a comedy view of old western movies and, with a writing team including Richard Pryor and Mel Brooks, it does so with a panache that can't be replicated in this day and age of political correctness. The acting is astounding for a Brooks film, and with the talents of Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder, and Slim Pickens, is it any wonder that it is as funny as it is? I laughed so hard at points that I thought my side would burst! It must be seen to be believed, especially when you compare this with other Brooks films, such as High Anxiety, Dracula: Dead and Loving It, and To Be or Not To Be. All in all this is a must-see-movie for anyone, and one can't be a comedy enthusiast if this movie hasn't been seen. Go Brooks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter how many times I've seen this film, I've always laughed as hard as I had from the first time I saw it. In fact, I find myself catching little hidden gags I didn't quite notice during the previous viewing. Sure, much of the humor is labeled "offensive" in this hyper-PC age. But those who criticize it for that reason miss the point. This picture uses satire to point out the ignorance, prejudice and crassness of the world. And let's all admit -- we see a little of ourselves in at least one character in the phantom hamlet of Rock Ridge. This picture and Young Frankenstein prove without a doubt that Brooks was batting 1000 in the mid-70s. Those two pictures, along with "The Producers" cemented a legacy for Brooks that puts him in the same category of screen giants such as Mack Sennett, Charlie Chaplin and contemporaries such as the Farrely Brothers. As for my favorite line: You guys act as if it were 120 degrees out here ... can't be more than 114!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Smart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks' spoof of the Western ushered in a new style of film comedy, a freewheeling, wacked-out, referential genre parody with a fair amount of sass; it would later be refined by the Zucker/Abrahams team (`Airplane!', `Top Secret!') and given multi-dimensional characters by the Farrelly Brothers (`Kingpin', `There's Something About Mary'). Surprisingly, it holds up because the quality of the writing is a cut above (the writers include Brooks, Richard Pryor and Andrew Bergman) and because it has something to say about racism in a very liberating, yet gentle, way--it's never offensive but still has a bite. (It's hard today to justify its `R' rating.) Brooks would later begin to take his film parodies far too seriously and, with the exception of his follow-up, `Young Frankenstein', delivered labored and flat comedies such as `Silent Movie' and `High Anxiety'. Here, however, his inspiration and passion for movies seem fresh, smart and fearless. With Cleavon Little as the African-American sheriff sent by dastardly Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (the delightful Harvey Korman) to throw the town of Rock Ridge into chaos so he can run the railroad through it; the likable Gene Wilder also stars as the Waco Kid and the cast is populated with familiar supporting actors such as Slim Pickens, Liam Dunn, John Hillerman and David Huddleston; Brooks appears in several roles, drawing heavily on his Borscht Belt persona. But it's Madeline Kahn who very nearly steals the show mocking Marlene Dietrich as chanteuse Lily Von Shtupp: her hilarious musical interlude (`I'm Tired') is near-perfect comic timing and in itself a reason to watch.</fullReview>

Having the Lead two actors go to the Cinema to see the end of the Film that they are in is a touch of class, the kind of class that can only be found in a film by this master of the Parody.Blazing Saddles is a romp through the West, destroying every tradition that Western films have built over film history. Whilst destroying the reputation of the Western - a genre that has no place in 21st century society - it still manages to be amazingly funny.But, its no Spaceballs. Blazing Saddles is a great film, but for anyone who wants a good Laugh, Spaceballs is the answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best, and funniest comedy of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some Spoilers... Blazing Saddles is the best, and funniest comedy of all time. The luney, spoof box office hit that changed comedy for showing that a comedy can be extremely funny while still having an interesting/great plot, and story. Some movies like Tootsie aren't funny but is interesting, and have a great plot, and story. The script is probably the #1 thing of this movie. The lines that are tremendous such as: P*** on you I'm working for Mel Brooks, and the outrageously funny raid on Warner Bros at the end this movie, has many tremendous lines, makes a good spoof of a movie, and comes out with a thrill to. Blazing Saddles also has songs that are great, such as the theme song, the song when the people raid the town, and the funny part is at the end you find a swear word in the song. The next best thing is the acting, Gene Wilder, Cleaveland Little, Slim Pickins, and many more give much enthusiam to the lines, and really tell you that these western folk don't give a hoot, and they just do what there told. A fun blast, and anyone who has respect for comedy, and Mel Brooks will enjoy this movie. Ten out of ten stars, see it right away if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Saddles: The best comedy directed by Mel Brooks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" is a really fine, good comedy. Seldom a movie makes me laugh as much as when I watch 'Blazing Saddles'. I think it is a good idea to make a comedy with a western-motive. I also like the Trinity-movies, with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill (and of course 'Il Mio nome ? Nessuno').Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are very funny, they really seem to like working together (but maybe that ain't true). It is really fun that everybody "hates" Bart, though he is a good sheriff that makes everything as good as he can!A great anti-rasist movie! Jim: 'Where you goin'?' Bart: 'Oh, nowhere special.' Jim: 'Nowhere special. Always wanted to go there.'Rating: 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks is a great director, to say the least. He did a great job. If you watch the movie you can tell when Brooks just lets Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little talk. This spontaneity can make or break a movie, and this made the movie. If you look closely, Mel Brooks is in the movie twice, the Indian chief and the governor. Although the movie is racial at times, it makes fun of stereotypes, but people do take the language the wrong way. This is a great movie, rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great! Along with The Producers and Young Frankenstein, Mel Brooks has made three of the all time funny movies. I remember seeing this when in was first released and the audience in the cinema were in hysterics of laughter throughout and today it still is a hoot.Great cast, crazy script(such as it is)and just a great vibe throughout combine to make a movie classic. Mel Brooks has tried many times to recreate the wackiness and great spoofery of Blazing Saddles and has never succeeded.What makes Blazing Saddles so good is that he went for it 100% and was inspired. Most of his movies since have been merely crude and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like comedies, you have to add this to the top of your list! Directed by Mel Brooks, Blazing Saddles was the modern western in which 1974 took place in 1874. It's directed by the great Mel Brooks and partially written by comedic genius Richard Pryor, and if you haven't seen it, you are definitely missing out. On top of that, add an exceptional cast including Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Cleavon Little, Alex Karras, and Madeline Kahn. The crude and ridiculous humor that's found in movies today I firmly believe started here. And this was the first movie to feature flatulence - to be more specific, it was a symphony of smelly, loud farts. If you've never seen it, rent it; if you have seen it, buy it on DVD. No matter how many times you watch it, I promise you'll never get tired of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is witty satire that pokes fun at humanity without losing sight of the meaning of true friendship and camaraderie. We know who the "good guys" and "bad guys" are, and each is portrayed in typical (humorous) Mel Brooks fashion. However, the movie is far from predictable--although some of the slapstick routines are puerile, you will still find yourself laughing.

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" was a time when he was at his best. And that year he went from a writer/director with two failed (financially speaking) comedies ("The Producers", "The Twelve Chairs") to one of the biggest comedy writer/directors of that time. As this film, and "Young Frankenstein" did both big box office, but were hits with critics and audiences alike. Brooks was a lucky man though, as this story wasn't his idea, and it came along to him as he was looking for change in gutters of New York. Brooks picked up the project, hired on the original writer (Andrew Bergman) as well as a few others (Including Richard Pryor) and along came "Blazing Saddles". It is the greatest spoof of western films and will continue to be that forever. The racism jokes may get a little old, and there are some cheap jokes (as there are in all of Brooks' film), but all in all, you laugh quite a bit at this film. There are a couple of hilarious and outragous moments (including the camp fire scene, and the wacky ending that could only be a part of a Mel Brooks film) and there are a few funny moments and jokes, as well as a truck load of small, cheap, so-so, and failed jokes. This was the time when Brooks was the master of complete lunacy, and he continued to do so up until just after "History of the World", he toned down a bit. In his later comedies such as "Spaceballs", you still find some hilarious and crazy moments, but you can tell that Brooks lost his edge some. Not that I don't recommend that film, as I pretty much recommend any Mel Brooks film, for the fact you will always find something funny. Overall, this is a 8 out of 10, or **** out of *****. Ranks up there with "Young Frankenstein" and "History of the World Part I" as Brooks' best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Brooks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" (1974) is one of a select few films which can be said to be as funny upon the fifth viewing as upon the first. He, with Richard Pryor--who Brooks'd originally considered to play the lead role--wrote an epic sagebrush spoof which, in terms of laugh-worthiness, surpassed his spy spoof TV series "Get Smart" and in terms of madness... closely matches Stanley Kramer's "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World!" A band of outlaws are appointed supervisors of a railroad construction crew by a shady lawyer, (played by Harvey Korman.) When they realize that the track's going through a pool of quicksand, they reroute--to go straight through the peace-loving town of Rockridge. After the outlaws' rampage through the town, the folks send a telegram to their "gov", (played by Brooks), demanding a new sheriff. They get a black man,(played by the late Cleavon Little.) It's only with the help of the once-was-the- fastest-gun-in-the-world, The Waco Kid, (palyed by Gene Wilder), that Sheriff Bart manages to earn the trust of Rockridge's folks. Also in the cast: John Hillerman, Alex Karras, and what would a sagebrush spoof be without ol' Slim Pickens. Oh, did we mention the late Madeline Kahn and Gilda Radner? For all you old-time movie buffs, watch for Mel Brooks' impersonation of a '30s character actor who--although he wasn't a big name star--his filmography is anything but small: Hugh Herbert (August 10, 1887-March 12, 1952). And as for Madeline Kahn's mocking of Marlene Dietrich (December 27, 1901-May 6, 1992) ... mah-vah-wahs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a review by a person from England who hated this movie. It didn't take long to understand why. Much of the humor in Mel Brooks movies is based on the whimsical homage to another movie. If you haven't seen the other movie(s) you just won't get it. Thus, when the Mexican bandit says,"Badges! We don't need no stinking badges!" it's not funny unless you remember the similar scene in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Blazing Saddles is Brooks at his early-postwar-New York-Jewish humorist best. If you know the references, it's hysterically funny. The fart scene now seems a bit sophomoric but try to imagine seeing it when it was the first time this had been done in the movies! I saw it first in the movies with a large audience. It brought down the house. I do agree,though that the ending is too over-the-top. It looks like Brooks just couldn't think of a good ending and just decided to dynamite the fourth wall.</fullReview>

It isn't refined, or a high class film. It dosen't promote peace in the world and try to solve world hunger, but it does so very much more.There are some things I am thankful for in this movie, one of which was that I am so glad that all those guys by the campfire weren't sitting any closer to the flame than they were. I am thankful that they went to certain barriers in this film and stomped all over them, especially the racial ones. I am glad they made fun of rednecks, nazis, japanese, blacks, whites, Hells Angels, women, men, gays and just about every other group which thinks it is too high and mighty to be made fun of.I loved the part of the horse getting punched out. I loved the idiots paying a toll out in the middle of the open plains. I loved many aspects of this movie. So why did I only give it a 8 out of 10?It could have been better. Mel Brooks could have tightened up a bit on the editing, cut back a little on all the bashing, could have bettered the timing on some of the jokes.But all in all, I can highly recommend this movie, unless you don't like your ribs to hurt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To really succeed at comedy is to push the envelope. This doesn't mean be offensive or exploitive. Anyone can do that. What it means is that to succeed, one must be willing to try anything but also be able to tell a good story. "Blazing Saddles" meets this challenge. Mel Brooks has taken the typical "classical" western story and turned it upside down. The basic story is still followed but the hero is a black man with a 1970 attitude, the villain is misnamed after Hedy Lamar and the love interest is a thinly veiled parody of Marlene Dietrich's Frenchy from "Destry Rides Again". The ending is truly inventive and memorable but somehow stays true to western theme. With this film, "The Producers" and "Young Frankenstein", it appeared that in the mid-70's Brooks could do no wrong. Sadly, nothing he has made since that heady period has come close. Of those the three classics, "Blazing Saddles" is still the best and also timeless.</fullReview>

This movie didn't let anyone go untouched. I saw this movie at the drive-in when it was released and have watched it at least 60 times since on tape, laserdisc, DVD and TV versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny spoof of old-time westerns but with a message about racism. This is one of my all-time favorite movies for its parody and its plot. The plotting is very tight until the end, but at that point the unravelling is part of the parody and not at all the disaster it would be for a serious movie. All the performances are wonderful, and the music is memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in ages, possibly *because* it is so ridiculously over the top. Yes, the subject of the jokes can be offensive, but as I believe has already been said, the jokes themselves are not so much truly racist as they are poking fun at the idiocy of racisim. The black sheriff is so much smarter than the people of Rock Ridge that they are the ones that come off looking like idiots! I knew this movie was going to be hilarious as soon as I saw the Count's band playing...in the middle of the desert. Turn off your mind, and see this movie as it was meant to be seen, a spoof of the bigotry and attitudes that were very real in the Old West. And the ending...quite possibly one of the better comedic endings I have seen in ages. It literally explodes off the screen, off the set and, finally, into an air conditioned limo on the way to 'nowhere special'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" is a fine example of a film that could never be made today. Coming nowhere close to political correctness as we know it, "Saddles" is Mel Brooks' finest and funniest film.Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder head a fine cast in this yarn about a black sheriff who is assigned to an all-white town. Back in the old west, this was not heard of or popular. Complete with racist and crude jokes galore, "Saddles" takes a swing at just about everyone. But man is it funny.Brooks uses all of his resources here, and gets a laugh out of nearly every scene in the film. Slim Pickens steals every scene he is in as the bumbling Taggart, and Brooks himself is very funny as Governor Le Petomane. The late Madeline Kahn is also sensational as a drunken entertainer."Blazing Saddles" will always stand the test of time with its edgy humor and hilarious performances.

Not because it was funny I kept thinking of Ms Kahn's performance throughout Blazing Saddles. Especially, when they played the scene's from Destry Rides again. I wonder if Ms Detrick ever saw Blazing Saddles? I hope she would take Ms Kahn performance as a completement not an insult. The rest of the movie was just as hilarious.

		<shortDescription>Why hasn't Brooks made more films like this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Mel Brooks fan, yet his latest work ("Dracula: Dead and Loving It," "Robin Hood: Men in Tights") didn't live up to the old standards of his films. "Blazing Saddles" is one of Brooks's best.The film's about a cold-hearted guy named Lamarr (great Korman) who wants to run his railroad through a miniscule town called Rock Ridge. In order to run the town's residents away, he decides to make black convict Bart (Little) to be sheriff.Lamarr's plan works and the very racist people don't like the idea of an African American sheriff. Alcoholic Jim, (some people call him Jim), a.k.a. the ex-Waco Kid. They plan to foil Lamarr's plan.I LOVE this movie! I can watch it and quote a lot of it. I find it funnier than "The Naked Gun: From the Files of the Police Squad" and "Airplane!" which are two of my favorite comedies. Brooks himself appears as the perverted mayor and briefly as a Yiddish-speaking Native American.What was controversial in its time is still controversial today but is now a comedy classic that never gets old.Also recommended: "Young Frankenstein."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS] The movie starts with people building railroad tracks.The evil, and stupid, boss Taggart, says there's quicksand down the line and since he doesn't want to lose any horses, he sends a couple of workers. So Bart and Charlie climb aboard a handcart and pump off. They run into the quicksand, so Taggart get's a rope and rescues the handcart because it cost him $400, he then gives Bart a shovel and tells him to put it to good use. He does--he bangs Taggart in the head with it. Hedley Lamarr, the state procurer, is after big bucks. The railroad will go through the town of Rock Ridge, and when it does, the land will be worth millions and Hedley wants it. But there's only one thing that stands between him and the land: the rightful owners. Hedley comes up with an idea to drive everyone out of town, so he appoints a new sheriff: Bart. The town hasn't had a black sheriff before and they don't take kindly to him at all.Bart also meets Jim (a.k.a The Waco Kid) who had the fastest hands in the world. But Jim is also a raging alcoholic. Taggart sends a giant muscleman into town to get the sheriff. His, or rather, It's name is Mongo. Bart takes care of him with a dynomite rigged candy box. Hedley Lamaar then appoints beauty, because beast has failed. He get's an attractive lady, Lily Von Schtupp, to seduce him.Even her attempt fails. So Hedley rounds up every criminal and vicious gun slinger in the west. But Bart has a plan to prevent them from destroying Rock Ridge, so he get's the townspeople and the railroad workers together and they build a fake Rock Ridge. By morning it's done. But they forgot people. So they build people, as well as a toll booth to slow the bad guys up. They soon come into town and the good clashes with the bad. The fight takes them right into Warner Bros. movie studio lot where they attempt to shoot a musical. Hedley Lamaar escaped to Mann's Chinese Theater to see the movie "Blazing Saddles". There's a showdown with Lamaar and Bart. So after he's disposed of, Bart and Jim watch the rest of the movie that has a happy ending. This is a good Mel Brooks film. If you liked YoungFrankenstein, you'll like this one too. It's got Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman (The Great Gazoo), Slim Pickens, and more! -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude and witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks' best film, and one of the all-time great comedies. Known for its crude humor, it contains many other elements of humor as well, something for everyone. And not to downplay the crude humor--if it is done well, it's funny, not stupid or silly, and Brooks does it well.This film has it all in spades (haha), with a black sheriff (Bart, played by Cleavon Little) in an all-white western town), accompanied by his phenomenal gunslinging sidekick (Gene Wilder). They are surrounded by an amalgam of characters, many in racial or role-playing categories (e.g., Mexican bandits, Mexican bikers), and many anachronistic, like Madeline Kahn in a Marlene Dietrich take-off. Most of all, we have Mongo, more of a "what" than a "who," played by ex-pro football star Alex Karras. Brooks himself makes it in too, as a nonvirtuous but somewhat detached governor, manipulated by chief villain Hedley Lamarr, pun intended (Harvey Korman), and as an Indian Chief. Slim Pickens (define perfectly cast) is Lamarr's sidekick and chief instrument.The crude stuff is great, but racial and religious elements -- indeed all elements -- are subject to both the crude and the very witty. Cliches and one liners are satirized, and there are evocations of previous films. Brooks' mockery of the white townsfolk (all named Johnson, and all ignorant, except for one educated history expert who uses possessives when modifying gerunds with noun adjectives) produces some of the best lines: "Randolph Scott" and the Irish line (if you have seen it, you know it, I won't give it away). But my favorite (Waco Kid to Bart, re the townspeople): "These are people of the land, you know, morons."A wild time and never a dull moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Commonly thought to be Mel Brooks's best movie, "Blazing Saddles" is a true gem. Definitely the funniest western around. The movie is fast-paced and the jokes keep on coming. I could go off telling you about all the hilarious one-liners, running jokes, and sight gags, but I want you to see the pure magic in this movie for yourself (okay, maybe "magic" is overdoing it).The actors take on the roles of these goofy characters very well. There is no character acting in this movie - everyone's a character. The script, if not too silly, is over-the-top hilarious. Mel Brooks is one of the funniest people alive. I would highly recommend this movie.P.S. If you're a parent wondering if this movie is OK for your kid to see, I think you should go for it. Not an f-word is uttered, not a bare breast is shown. All the violence is just slapstick. There's a little sexual humor, but it's not too bad. Maybe rated R for racism? I think, were it made today, "Blazing Saddles" would get a PG-13.</fullReview>

But we DON'T WANT THE IRISH!"Of course, in this era of political correctness, such a movie is viewed as a horrible relic of the decadent 70's by the smarmy. But trust me, Mel Brooks makes as important a political statement as any activist. He also makes you pee your pants while he does it.

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks has the keys to the kingdom...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great comedy is born, forged, fashioned and bred in a crucible of sensitivity, learning and icon-worship/iconoclasm. Mel Brooks, a man who I believe could have made his career as a historian, a film-critic, a political columnist, has opened up his vault of talents to create a comedy that will persist for generations. Why? Why does Mr. Brooks have the keys to the kingdom?Well, for starters, someone once said that genius stands on the shoulders of giants. Mr. Brooks is well versed in American movie history and has viewed and sublimated the cannon adroitly and with considerable flare and facility. From Cole Porter references to "Gabby Johnson," Brooks unfurls a flag of American film history and a quick hand at the card table of American comedy. He knows when to drop the right line, the correct reference, he understands how films and human knowledge build upon the advances made by their predecessors. Brooks could be a historian because he knows what films work together properly, how they are connected and why if you cross certain themes the result is unmitigated hysteria and gut splitting laughter. Who else would have paired Cole Porter's "I Get A Kick Out of You" with an inter-racial western complete with Yiddish Indians? Who else would have the sense to know how to properly assault the genre of the American Western with just the right dose of absurdity? Brooks is a sensitive man. Comedy is the result of those who must laugh at themselves, their short comings, their myopia. Comedy is born out of the humility imposed by suffering, therefore if suffering is to be remedied and good fortune and mirth restored, whose suffering is safe from the razor-blade of satire, self-reflection and parody? To laugh is to forfeit the sanctity of the human mind in order to reap a whirlwind of instant gratification, a luminiscent gratification that can only come when one makes a joke or becomes the butt of someone else's joke. We remember folly and foolishness much more readily than morality and the lessons of profound wisdom. Why? Because we are all, deep down inside, confronted with our own appalling inequities and a horrific sense of timing. A comedian knows this and unlike a psychologist or psychiatrist who takes these coups seriously, the comedian knows that truly great art, born of suffering, is still more irridescent when it evokes a laugh, at least for him bent on instant gratification.Brooks knows his stuff. He understands how to cross genres and he has been blessed with an immutable gift for irony. Everything is ironic! Watch this movie! And learn a little about the mythic and cosmological past of your entertainment industry as well as find out what it could have been like on the range with all of those fools who thought they were doing God's work in settling our wild frontier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, not your typical movie that you'd expect as a favorite family movie to watch together BUT three generations of my family can now recite the lines along with the stars as we're watching. First time I saw it was in a theater with my teen-age kids. I kind of embarrassed them when I was one of the few people who laughed (snorted loudly actually) at the "Mongo, Santa Maria !!", line. I explained to them who Mongo Santamaria is and thus the subtle comedy that is Mel's trademark. Since then, no more explanations have been necessary. Many of the popular quotes are now part of our family language (That's Hedley, Where the white women at, I'm tired, Watch me, fa....., The new sherrif's a-comin and he's a ni, We don't want the Irish, and the ever-popular You said Rape twice - I like rape) I could go on and on. The ending? What a stroke of genius! How did he ever think of it?To those who are offended, you gotta lighten up! The movies that are out today are so violent and intense. I feel the need to laugh hard once in a while and when I do, I just pop this move into the VCR because no matter how many times I've seen it, it still makes me laugh until I just about __________ (fill in the blanks).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so thankful that Mel Brooks made this film when he did. He'd never be able to do it today. The slurs fly thick and fast, making this one of the most Politically INcorrect films ever made. I think that all the slurs are done in an obviously non-threatening and light-hearted way, but I'm certain that some sensitive people were probably offended by the film. However, if you are not sensitive to that sort of thing, this film is absolutely one of the most hilarious ever made. Set in a typical western town, Cleavon Little stars as the new Sheriff in town. None of the townspeople knows that he is black until he shows up. Gene Wilder plays a burned-out gunslinger. Harvey Korman is the bad guy, abetted by Slim Pickens. Mel Brooks plays the Governor. Alex Karras is Mongo. The late, great Madeline Kahn portrayed Lili Von Schtupp, the Teutonic Titwillow. The laughs come faster than the slurs and this film loses nothing over the years. This one is one to keep!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you've never seen a Mel brooks movie before or you've only seen Mels recent movies like Robin Hood:men in tights or Dracula Dead and Loving it and been disappointed by them, then Blazing Saddles ( or Mel's other great works like History of the World, Young Frankenstein and The Producers) show Mels ability to be incredibly crude, non PC, sleazy, ribald and HILARIOUS! Everything that could have been or shouldnt have been made fun of Brooks lampooned skewered and otherwise ridiculed.

		<fullReview>Just saw this movie again, after seeing it in 1974. It is even better a second time. This is Mel Brooks best movie. I doubt very much if anyone would make such a politically incorrect movie today. Madeline Kahn was utterly marvellous as Lili Von Shtupp and when she is Marlene Dietrich she is utterly delicious - what a loss, her death was to the movies. Cleavon Little, Harvey Korman and the whole cast were excellent. Anyone that has not seen this movie should see it and have an evening of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks' comic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" is argubly Mel Brooks' best and funniest film. It also ranks up there with "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun" as one of the funniest movies ever made. Brooks has been well known for his movie spoofs. He has spoofed Hitchcock suspense-thrillers ("High Anxiety"), science fiction movies ("Spaceballs"), old historical epics ("History of the World Part I"), and the horror genre twice ("Young Frankenstein" and "Dracula: Dead and Loving It"). With "Blazing Saddles" Brooks sends up the western genre and does a pretty darn good job of it. There are laughs galore in this picture with most of the jokes done in bad taste. This is one movie that shouldn't be watched on television. Rent it or catch it on cable because if you watch "Blazing Saddles" on a network station or a basic cable channel I imagine most of the crude jokes will be edited (especially the uproarious flatulent campfire scene). "Blazing Saddles" also has a great cast. Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are terrific as the new sheriff in town and his new sidekick who team up to save their town from being destroyed by the bad guys. Harvey Korman is a riot as the villainous Hedy Lamarr, uh I mean Hedley Lamarr; Madeline Kahn in a small but memorable Oscar-nominated performance as Lili Von Strupp, the Marlene Dietrich sendup; and Brooks himself cast himself in two very funny small parts as the Governor and a Yiddish-speaking Indian. Slim Pickens, Alex Karras, and a pre-"Magnum P.I." John Hillerman also register big laughs throughout. With "Blazing Saddles", the Old West will never be the same again. This is an absolute must-see for fans of comedies with big laughs. **** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Mel Brookes Comedy of all time, that would never get made these days!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles just about offends everyone whether it be race, people with physical/verbal/mental disability, women, animal lovers and probably one or two other elements. However, the great thing about Mel Brookes' comedies is that that any offensive suggestion is subtly implied and directed most pointedly back at the offender rather than the victim in question.But I greatly suspect that if Mel tried to make this movie in today's politically correct climate the studios would take exception to the majority of its content and as a consequence would end up with a dull, lifeless, sanitized movie.As it is Blazing Saddles is a classic comedy, not just for Brookes but for comedy in general. Not only is it very witty with the rapid-fire one-liners, but there's also huge amounts of visual slap-stick and relatively subtle sexual innuendo that has a certain innocent but amusing charm about it. These days of course script writers would just use explicit language or even a sex act itself to get the point over which only goes to show how poor comedy writing has become.The ending is probably the film's weak spot. Brookes always seems to have problems with conclusions and BS is no exception. For even though the movie becomes more &amp; more surreal the joke soon wears off and we're left unsatisfied as the two stars drive off into the sunset.But I suppose we can forgive Mel for such weaknesses. The other 95% of the movie is pure comic genius and will have you in pain with laughter, unless of course you take the jokes too seriously in which case you will be instantly offended and switch off.Mel hasn't really reproduced that kind of magic since, although I did like Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie &amp; High Anxiety. But they were all mid 70s films and none of his latter offerings even come close to those classics.****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Mel Brook's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my view, Mel Brooks did three great comedies - The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein) and then never matched them again with such disappointments as History of the World Part 1 and Spaceballs.I think possibly the funniest of the three was the Western spoof Blazing Saddles. Although I think the end was a bit disappointing, the start and middle contained some of the funniest moments in comedy ever. I won't ruin any of the jokes by typing them here, but I suggest this film to anyone with a sense of humour.Although the film is thought by some to be offensive and/or racist, it is in fact the white people that r being made fun of, whilst Cleavon Little as the black sheriff is clever and sophisticated.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Mel Brooks. I admit it. Even if he did "Men in Tights" and "Dracula: Dead and Loving It", his older movies are insanely funny in a sweet kind of way. I can think of 3 movies that fit this description: Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles.Parody can be incisive and vile (just watch South Park any day), and this attribute can make for some pretty nasty jokes. But they will lack substance, since this kind of humour is the easiest one to make. Now, try making a parody with a sense of respect for the original, which is funny and sweet. That's though.Although Young Frankenstein is my favourite Brooks' parody, Blazing Saddles rates quite highly on many fronts. First, it is a very clean comedy. The jokes are funny, but never insulting. Witness Brooks previews in History of the World; those are cheap laughs. YF and BS never fall for this kind of comedy.The best of the movie comes at the end, though. I had to watch it to believe it. It's a great ending to one of the best comedies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film in years and decided not just to rent it but purchase it. It use to be on TV frequently when I was young (with editing) and I always made time to see it.Having seen it again after so long there are still scenes that are notoriously funny, however, I did not find the movie as funny as when I was younger. One thing that's great about seeing it now is that I get a lot of the jokes that I missed and it turned out that those were the ones where I got the most laughs out of.It was also a pretty good comment on racism and use of stereotypes, even though of course the movie is a comedy. Such classic lines as, "Please stand back while I whip this out" , and "Where are all the white woman at?" were just perfect and even done in good taste. To make comedic fun of races in movies is tough because it can either turn out: 1) In bad taste 2) Horribly offensive and very UNFUNNYBut Mel Brooks handles it perfectly by making it very funny, and enjoyable.Rating 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how to make a comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks was in full stride when he came up with this idea. It uses the timeworn plot of the railroad coming to a small town and the greedy politician trying to scare the townspeople off so they can make a fortune. That's where any resemblance to a John Ford western ends. The Governor(one of several roles played by Brooks in the movie) sends a black sheriff to the town hoping to so offend them that they will pack up and leave. What follows is pure Mel Brooks comedy at it's best with probably the best casting job ever! If you have a classic comedy section in your video library, this one needs to be included!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"P.O. I'm Workin' for Mel Brooks!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks and his usual cast of characters (Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, et al) are at it again in "Blazing Saddles." Korman plays Hedley Lamarr, a corrupt politician who is determined to acquire a tract of land occupied by a western town. To ease his plot, he dispatches a black sheriff named Bart (Cleavon Little) to oversee the rule of law in 'the village of the Johnsons.' To find out what happens from there, see the movie. Some of the gags in the movie are so funny, you might almost forget about the plot. These include the Camptown Ladies scene, Mel Brooks as a Yiddish Indian, and, of course the part where they're eating beans around a campfire. Songs are always an integral part of Brooks comedies, and this one is no different; included in the film are "The Theme From Blazing Saddles," "The Ballad of Lili von Schtupp," and "The French Mistake." For the record, Schtupp is a western seductress played by Madeline Kahn. Also take note of ex-Detroit Lion Alex Karras' performance as Mongo. Rent "Blazing Saddles" when you get the chance, or "...you'll be surprised YOU'RE doing the French mistake. Voila!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Johnson is Right! This has to rank among the greatest comedies ever put on the silver screen. When I was younger I'd save this for much meaningful movies such as "Home Alone." But it took me a while to realize, I never laughed at Home Alone. If you are to name the best comedy movie, you should not look for how important the plot is or the number of times a robber falls on his back. You should base it on how many times you laugh, how hard you laugh, and how many times you can listen to the same joke and laugh again. Wayne's World is like this. Holy Grail also comes to mind. Blazing Saddles I go back to any time I can, because the jokes are cruel but hilarious, and seem never to get old. Using the joke-a-second rule that the Zuker/Abrams and Marx Brothers films rely on, one can just sit back relax, and cough up a lung or two. What I'm trying to say is this is a hillarious movie, and God I hope I will never get bored of it!</fullReview>

Cleavon Little plays the awesome "black sherrif), Gene Wilder is always good, and the inclusions of Mel Brooks, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens, and Alex Karras is a thing of genius. This is an almost non-stop riot of dark humor and messing with all that sucks about westerns. It's almost impossible to forget some of the scenes in this movie (there are at least 3-5 scenes that are classic from this flick). The only thing that keeps this movie from being my favorite comedy is the fact that a lot of the jokes start to get overplayed and the ending isn't done to it's fullest potential (both of which are normal Brooks' faults. In a fantastic collection of Brooks-made comedies, this is by far his best. I gave it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Brooks' parody of the whole western genre is gloriously politically incorrect, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I watched it with my wife for the first time a couple of years ago and, to my surprise, she found it hilarious too; in fact, any time we go to the video store and can't decide what to rent, she'll say, "Let's get Blazing Saddles. I'm in the mood for a good laugh." And it is a good laugh. The last time I saw it, I was already laughing in anticipation of the "Sing us a good ol' nigger work song" scene (if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about). In fact, I was working shift work at the time, and was watching at about 3am, between graveyards, and laughing so hard, I woke my wife up. All in all, a whole lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing Blazing Saddles 41 times over a 24 year span, I have become convinced that it is indeed the most meaningful and entertaining movie ever made. My children were raised on the dialogue and we all can recite every line (eg:" Matthew, Mark, Luke and----Duck !"--" The Sheriff is a _______,. What did he say? He said the Sheriff is near.. No, goldarnit, I said the Sheriff is a _____.") This film is rivaled only by Mel Brooks "Young Frankenstein" (that's Fraaankensteen !). and "High Anxiety".. The fun poked at our every convention, our societal hang-ups and the seriousness with which we take ourselves, has something to insult everyone. With the sole exception of "Saving Pvt. Ryan," every other movie ever made doesn't deserve to even be in the same universe with Blazing Saddles.* It will provide a continuing commentary on our history and culture that will be as contemporaneous in the 21st Century as this magnificent comedy illustrates for our past. Every American home should be required to have a few compulsory items: WW II histories by Stephen Ambrose, "Diplomacy" by Dr. Henry Kissinger, JFK's "Profiles in Courage," Harry Truman's biography and a video copy of Blazing Saddles. *"The Frisco Kid "with Gene Wilder comes very close to joining that elite duo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the standard by which all others should be judged. A classic pre-PC comedy with all the elements that became Mel Brook's trademarks.Though some of the material is overplayed in later Brooksfilm productions, I never tire of watching this movie.If you can find it, there is a release that has multiple additional scenes where Sheriff Bart tricks Mongo. Also look for the alternate end scene where The Governor visits the fake Rock Ridge.I saw this in theatrical release in 1974 when I was still in high school, and I am still laughing from that experience. This movie is a "must see", bring a sense of humor and check your politically correct attitude at the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is a classic American comedy directed by Mel Brooks. It makes a good companion to Young Frankenstein, also made by Brooks later in the same year. It satirizes American western films and racism.The plot is wild and has many (intentional) holes. The comedy takes priority over the plot, which isn't a bad thing. A frontier town is raided by bandits and the sheriff is slain in a hilarious sequence with custom vocal music. The government appoints a replacement, the black sheriff Bart. Bart believes that he was sent to protect the town, but in reality the government chose him (being black) to scare away the townspeople to clear the area for a railroad. The town hesitantly accepts him. Bart and his assistant Jim (the Waco Kid) then protect the town from the government's ploys. It culminates in an epic brawl.The acting is good, although most of the characters are simply caricatures. Gene Wilder (as Jim) and Harvey Korman (as the government official Hedley Lamarr, mastermind behind the railroad plans) give the best performances. The small roles by Mel Brooks himself are much appreciated as well.Blazing Saddles is one of the best comedies of its decade. I enjoyed Young Frankenstein a little more, but together they make a brilliant combo from Mel Brooks. If you like comedies, don't miss this classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, wild, out-of-control. It is the Wild West with a taint of insanity that beats the comedies of today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that push the envelope. There are movies that push the envelope off the table. Then there is Blazing Saddles, a film that not only pushes the envelope, but also eats it, digests it, and disposes of it. Decades later there still isn't a movie quite like this, and could not be released in the sensitive time period of today. Whether it's the extreme racism, the humorous abuse towards animals, or total lack of remorse towards any minority whatsoever, Blazing Saddles bends, breaks, and eats the rules of courtesy. Becoming the highest-grossing picture of 1974, and emerging into one of the greatest comedies of all-time, this is one of those movies that everyone has to see at least once. Here we see Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor at their prime.In this western satire and criticism, we find a black man being appointed sheriff, must to the disdain of the white citizens of Rock Ridge. What none of them know is that the reason for the hiring is that Rock Ridge holds some very valuable land and a greedy political figure by the name of Hedy Lamarr (oops?Hedley) is doing whatever it takes to obtain it after wiping out the citizens. Unfortunately for Lamarr, the new sheriff Bart, armed with a drunken partner the Waco Kid, is winning the hearts of the folks in the town. Throughout the movie it's a constant struggle to run out the citizens of the town and end Bart's reign as the top cop of the area.There are very few spoofs that carry a good plot as well as an abundance of comedic material. Written by Brooks and Pryor, they were determined to hold no punches back as they weave a slew of unheard of humor into the film. They range from modern physical humor involving body parts, to racist wisecracks, to animal abuse that would make PETA go psycho, to below-the-radar analysis of the mythology of the Wild West. Blazing Saddles went out to prove that the West wasn't as simple as heroes against villains; we have corrupt politicians, Manifest Destiny ideals that desecrated Natives, Blacks, and Asians, and we have gullible people left and right accepting all the wrongdoing going on. Besides all the racy material, Brooks and company were daring in terms of challenging an entire genre and its portrayal of a beloved time period.The one-liners, gags, and subtle moments are thrown at you from the beginning to the very end. Thankfully and luckily for Brooks, there was a very talented staff to hold it all together. Standing out amongst the actors was Cleavon Little as Bart, and Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid. The two have excellent chemistry together and play their parts with such ease. Everyone else delivers in once scene or another, most notably the brute Alex Karras as the dumb yet physically overpowering Mongo. His first interaction with a horse stands as one of the funniest moments in cinema history?and certainly one of the most shocking. Madeline Kahn was decent in her Oscar-nominated portrayal of Lili Von Shtupp, as she gives a musical number worthy of yawning over.Not for the easily offended, Blazing Saddles makes Borat look like Sesame Street. Packing a heavy punch of vulgar language, no religion or minority is safe, as we see insults towards the Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, Irish, Germans, French, Indians, and folks from Kansas. We see Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, renegade Mexicans, cowboys that violate animals, and worst of all flamboyant musical dancers. Not all jokes hit, but when they do miss, it usually is ricocheted by an even better joke. For example, contrary to popular opinion, the low point of the movie is when it slows down to make way for the major musical number; but afterwards we get a funny sequence involving breakfast and sausages.The fourth wall isn't broken here either; it's pulverized. At first it is lightly cracked, but when the third act and the main climax approaches, you'll feel like the actors and actresses are parading across the screen and into your world. Adding to the mayhem is one of the longest yet most ridiculous and satisfying fights in history. Starting out in a small setting, it expands into places so unpredictable; it can wind up confusing the viewer. Blazing Saddles has something for everybody, as long as you are willing to laugh at offensive material that exists merely to prove a point.Bottom Line: One of the funniest movies of all-time, Blazing Saddles holds up well even after all these years. The writing is what excels here, but great acting and good directing also helps. The pacing is a bit slow like the average Western, but with so much humor flying at the screen you won't care. By the time the movie is over you'll see it all; from exploding horses to farting cowboys. See it once for the humor; see it again for the commentary. This is Brooks at his creative peak, and Pryor in one of his few successful cinema stints."Someone's gotta go back and get a ****-load of dimes!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Saddles: One of the Funniest Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing SaddlesMel Brooks is a genius. He is one of the greatest comedic minds I've ever witnessed. One of the greatest examples of his genius is Blazing Saddles. This movie takes issues such as racism just when we were leaving that period behind and makes a joke out of it. PURE GENIUS! It also parodies the western genre.Plot: The story is about an evil man named Hedley Lamarr back in 1874 who wants to drive people out of a town. He decides to send someone to scare them off. Therefore, he simply sends a black man to be the sheriff of Rock Ridge and the laughs never let up.Acting: One of the strong points in this movie is the acting. This is one of the few comedies to have someone nominated in acting for an Oscar. That someone is Madeline Kahn who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress with barely 15 minutes of screen time. Cleavon Little gives a great performance as Bart The Black Sheriff. Gene Wilder also gives a great performance as The Waco Kid or Jim. Even Mel Brooks and Alex Karras the football player have roles. Mel Brooks plays a dimwitted governor and Karras plays the large but dimwitted Mongo.Genre/Quality: This is undoubtedly a comedy and one of the funniest movies ever made. This movie takes racism and westerns and makes a joke on them. For anyone who thinks this movie is racist, get a life and a sense of humor. You'd have to watch the movie without paying attention. Bart the Sheriff is the hero. The music in this movie is great nabbing an Oscar nomination. The script is good which was if I'm not mistaken was co-written by Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor.In conclusion, this is one of the funniest movies ever made. This movie is one of the major examples of Mel Brooks' comedic genius.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last good Mel Brooks film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is a great comic film and shows off Brooks' mastery with the art of the movie parody. It's interesting to watch now, because while the film is one that I, along with pretty much everyone else whose seen it, really liked, it shows traces of the side of Mel Brooks that likes gravitating towards cheap and crude humor that would take over the rest of Mel Brooks' career.Blazing Saddles, a parody of the Wild West, centers around a railroad magnate who plans to clear a town he needs for his rail line by using his influence with the governor (Mel Brooks, in the best part of the movie) to convince him to appoint a black sheriff (Cleavon Little) for the new town. He figures that the town will run the sheriff out of town rendering them defenseless when the railroad strongarms them out of their homes.Blazing Saddles still had the relatively intelligent humor that one could see in his other parody released in 1974 "Young Frankenstein." A film academic could appreciate its clever metacinematic ending in which a brawl in a Western town spills over onto a studio lot and a movie villain tries to escape his own fate by going into a movie theater. It was also just plain hilarious and jam-packed with laughs that left audiences and critics defenseless. At the same time, the movie repeatedly dipped into crude humor and had the potential to be offensive in the way that his later films would soon follow the pattern of. It's possible for a movie to both deliver intelligent humor and be really stupid at the same time and I would give a good review to Blazing Saddles for its intelligent humor but I would be doing so because its pros outweigh the cons and I think (and most would agree) Brooks has unfortunately gone downhill since then. This is unfortunate because it was only his 4th film.</fullReview>

There I would disagree, I would still recommend Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs over this any day. But still, I have to admit, there are some extremely funny moments in the film. Such as the ending Hollywood scene or the sheriff's welcoming to the village. Especially the line "Where the white women at?!".This movie really bordered on the edge with it's racism and sex jokes, that is what makes Mel the king of comedy, he always knew how to push the rules. Just to be honest though, I wasn't laughing as hard as I did for Young Frankenstein, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, or Spaceballs.

Its blaintant disregard for racism is a little 'close to the boarder' in parts but other laughs give it a fairly strong backbone. After watching Blazing Saddles i felt that after the halfway mark that the writers just gave up and concentrated on ending the film as soon as possible, for example the jokes in the first half were well thought out and timed extremely well whereas in the second half jokes were lacking that HaHa factor as you could see them coming a mile off.Slightly impressed, but wouldn't say that Id be watching it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks is one of the most talented comedians. His movies are still quoted and popular today, and no one seems to forget them. He is truly a genius, and he needs to get back into his groove (if he doesn't break a hip first).Brooks' directed this classic 1974 piece about the small western town of Rock Ridge in the 1800's. Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman), not to be confused with Hedy Lamarr, wants to build a railroad through Rock Ridge. To do so, he needs to get the people out of town, so he decides to get a sheriff that the townspeople will kill immediately, so they will leave. He hires Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged.The "plot" kind of thins out from there. I judged Blazing Saddles purely on entertainment value. I really love Gene Wilder, who played the Waco Kid who helps Bart. His sarcastic tone of voice and his love for comedy really shines through. Little was enjoyable as the sheriff. The town of Rock Ridge had it's own jokes (i.e. Johnson, etc.) that were funny throughout.Some jokes didn't have any taste (the campfire scene), while others were perfect for a Disney movie (a laurel and hearty handshake). Brooks' role in the movie, even though it was small, was very humorous, and it's fun to go along with Bart and Jim (aka the Waco Kid).If there was one thing I didn't like, it was that Madeline Kahn didn't have a larger role. She is a very talented actress (she got an Oscar nomination for her role), and I'm still sad that she died. The jokes were usually steady throughout, and it's a fun romp that you soon won't forget, coming in the year of what critics call his best piece, Young Frankenstein.My rating: 7/10Rated R for racial slurs and mild sexual humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brookes' classic western spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the route of a new railroad is blocked by quicksand a new route is chosen; the only problem is that the town of Rock Ridge is in the way. Corrupt lawyer Hedley Lamarr sees it as an opportunity though? he will drive the people out of town, seize the land then make a tidy profit selling it to the railroad. His thugs ride into town and cause mayhem as well as killing the sheriff. The people contact the governor asking for a new sheriff but he gives the task to Lamarr? he decides to send somebody they will they will hate? a black man named Bart! Their response to him is as expected; the only person who doesn't immediately hate Bart is Jim, a former gunslinger who is now the town drunk. Opinions of Bart change when he defeats and befriends 'Mongo' a slow-witted man-mountain sent by Lamarr to kill him. That isn't Lamarr's last plan though; Bart, Jim and the townspeople will have to face a variety of thugs including ruffians, Klansmen and even a few Nazis!This highly inventive spoof western is full of laughs from start to the rather surreal finish. Not all of the gags will appeal to everybody but there are so many that if one doesn't amuse you another will be along soon. The film nicely plays with western tropes as well as having a less than subtle message about racism. That isn't to say that it is annoyingly preachy as it is done in such a funny way. Cleavon Little is great as Bart and Gene Wilder is a delight as Jim 'The Waco Kid'; the rest of the cast is pretty good too. Anybody concerned about realism will be disturbed by all the anachronisms but I think most viewers will think they add to the hilarity. Overall I'd definitely recommend this classic western spoof? it may not be politically correct but it is funny.</fullReview>

I have seen Young Frankenstein and The Producers but I was disappointed in them, I would always think of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka ever since he came into my childhood. I'm really sad that he died, he was such a good talented actor out there. RIP Willy Wonka &#x2661;Anyways,I really found the movie very hilarious, the jokes were funny but the rape homes kinda threw me off a bit. I felt there shouldn't have been rape jokes because, it can upset some viewers such as survivors of sexual abuse. I would've think Mel Brooks would be a bit smarter in relation to that rape is a serious offense to mankind! Apart from that hiccup including the racial slurs too, I actually really enjoyed Wilder's and Cleavon Little's teamwork together. It's too bad that these great actors are not with us anymore, no one can ever replace them for their talent they had during their acting careers!The movie ain't the best but it's certainly not the worst. Its good but again, improvements would've been made a little better! I give this movie a rating of 8/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest comedy of all-time, but certainly a very funny one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Mel Brooks ran out of juice he used to make some very funny movies, and "Blazing Saddles" is one of them. Best remembered today for its infamous "farting scene," the film also boasts many other humorous sequences - such as Madeline Kahn's dance and just about any scene with Brooks or Gene Wilder.Cleavon Little, Wilder, Brooks, Kahn and Slim Pickens head an all-star cast about a corrupt town sheriff who appoints a black man to be sheriff in order to ruin the reputation of the area. The black sheriff actually winds up becoming far more respected than anyone would have imagined and becomes the politician's enemy.This is not as laugh-out-loud funny as Brooks' "Spaceballs" but, like "Young Frankenstein," is better structured. It is a classic comedy, one of Brooks' finest. Apart from satirizing racism and western movies, it takes a stab at just about everything in sight."Blazing Saddles" may disappoint some people who are under the impression that it is regarded as the "best" comedy of all-time, but if you approach it level-headed you'll find it a rewarding and unique comedic experience.</fullReview>

You have to keep thinking what!!! Can they do that!!! Will he/she actually let that happen on stage!!! Mel Brooks achives this effect on his personal films especailly Young Frankinstein and High Anxiety.Watching it a second time I begin to wonder, why did Bart decide to actually stay and be the Sherrif of Rock Creek nobody would have noticed if he just ran away in the night. But Randolph Scott never would have and I guess you just have to accept when the chance to be a hero arrives some people will take it. I wonder if the Waco Kid will teach him that really fast draw since he seems to only be a good set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blazing Saddles" contains some of the funniest comedy I have ever seen in a movie. Like most of my favorite comedies ("A Night at the Opera" or "Tootsie"), the laughs build until they explode into a few explosively funny scenes at the end. The stupidity of the characters in general brings many of the laughs, though I mostly laugh at the ridiculous and absurd situations, such as building a phony replica of the town, the singing of a bogus hymn in church, or the gathering of all the great warriors for battle toward the end. The scenes on the various movie sets, which I won't give away by describing in detail, are some of the funniest ten minutes I've ever seen on film. Cleavon Little is perfectly cast as the sheriff, and Gene Wilder is nearly as good as he was in "Young Frankenstein." Madeline Kahn, in her Oscar-nominated role, is very funny as usual. Although there are a ton of big laughs in this film, I object to the general crude and sexual-related humor in the film. The constant "N" words are also a downside to this film. The film could be controversial for these reasons. Don't get me wrong. You're guaranteed to get some great laughs from this movie. It's hysterical, but there is a fair amount of offensive humor and content. Watch at your own risk.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the best out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is, Mel Brooks' masterpiece, obviously, and also one of the greatest landmarks in American cinema out there. This one, when it came out in 1974, was probably one of the most vulgar movies ever made, (which today just means a couple of boob jokes, a fart scene, and some s-words) but that was insanely crude back then. That is why this infamous film opened things up for stuff like "Clerks" and "American Pie." The film also smashed racism in the face. Every black person in the movie is a genius, and pretty much every white guy is an idiot. This totally spoofs every western out there, and can be enjoyed by all ages. You've also got to understand, all this was, was a couple of guys, (Mel Brooks, Richard Pryor, Andrew Bergman, Norman Steinberg, and Al Uger.) sitting around a table, drinking beer, coming up with random stuff, and putting it into a major motion picture. This was, when it came out, entirely socially inappropriate, entirely funny, and really the beginning of the kind of comedy we see today. There will never be another blazing saddles. Never.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film to View Over &amp; Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have not seen this film in years and decided to enjoy the great masterpiece of a slap stick Western by Mel Brooks. This story deals with a small Western town that needs a sheriff and there are not too many people that are willing to accept this position. There are bad dudes running the town by their powerful boss, Hedley Lamarr, (Harvey Korman) who does not like the new sheriff recently elected mainly because he is African American and he does not want the law enforced in his town. The name of the sheriff is Bart, (Cleavon Little) who is being helped by a prisoner named Jim, (Gene Wilder) who is a fast gunslinger and he does hit the bottle quite often, like all day. There are some great veteran actors in this film, Slim Pickens, (Taggart), Madeline Kahn, (Lili Von Shtupp) and even Mel Brooks appears in his film as a governor and Indian. Cleavon Little was not the original actor that Mel Brooks was considering for this role, Mel wanted Richard Pryor who was turned down for the role. Great Comedy of a film and worth seeing over and over again. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it my imagination or does Mel Brooks characterization of Govenor La Ptomaine remind me of President Bush? And I'm a conservative Republican!! But anyway, it still is one of the more hilarious movies of all time. One that you cannot even think of re-making today. All clichés and stereotypes are bashed, it is still fun today. How about Mongo knocking out the horse? Or "excuse while I whip this out"? Always fun, never mean-spirited. One on my friends can't watch this movie without thinking of the OJ Simpson low speed chase, when Cleavon Little holds the gun to his own head. "Help me, help me, somebody help me." Or the pot usage? One cannot make a movie these days with all this without the PC police coming down hard. Remember and enjoy the fun and freedom of the 70's and 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and classic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am making this great Mel Brook's comedy a tribute to Harvey Korman (HIGH ANXIETY, THE FLINTSTONES, HUCKLEBERRY FIN,HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART 1) who plays a nineteen century wild west American small town Government official, Hedly Lamarr. He gets rid of the sheriff so he can get a railroad built through the land owned by the residence of Rock Ridge. He appoints an African -American Sheriff in this bizarre and hilarious send up of the American wild west. The scenes of a huge dumb cowboy Mongo in a dinner scene where they are all eating Backed beans which erupts into a massive farting session is one of the great classic scenes of the movie. The comedy focus on the negativity and stupidity of white trash America at this point of history. An extra Jewish trade mark of Mel Brooks is having the red Indians speaking Yiddish almost as a celebration of America's oppressed minorities. Any lover of Film Comedy or just your average punter who doesn't find this film hysterically funny is a schmuck of the highest order. The performances of Gene Wilder, Slim Pickens, Dom De Luise to name just a few added to the brilliant mix of Zany characters. I would recommend all Mel Brooks movies but this one is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the five best film comedies ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filled with non-stop laughs from start to finish, BLAZING SADDLES is Mel Brooks' comic masterpiece about a bumbling govenor who wants control of a tiny western hamlet called Rock Ridge where all the citizens have the last name of Johnson. He hopes to scare them out of their town by sending a black man (Cleavon Little) to be the new sheriff and that's where the fun begins. This movie is a true classic with one of the most quotable screenplays ever and features a perfect cast. Writer-director Brooks has a dual role as the dim-witted governor and a yiddish speaking Indian chief; Harvey Korman is brilliant as the governor's stooge Hedley Lamarr; Gene Wilder became a star playing the drunken ex-gunfighter who saves the day at the last minute; and Madeline Kahn's turn as chanteuse/spy Lilli Von Schtupp is nothing short of brilliant and earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Dom DeLuise is also very funny as a prominent figure in the film's off-the-wall finale. Highlights include Kahn's musical number, "I'm Tired", the campfire scene (enough said), the slaves rendition of a Negro spiritual, the governor's staff meeting and the one-of-a-kind finale. An instant classic and make sure you see an unedited print...a director's cut would be a dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The recent death of Frankie Lane who sang the title tune of this movie which sets the tone for a great film. It puts together all the elements of great comedy, message &amp; classic comedy sequences, &amp; music. It is the correct length, &amp; it engages the viewer with a plot that just lets an extremely talented cast show off it's talent.Cleavon Little is the Sheriff who conquer fear &amp; hate in his greatest role.I already knew him from television's Temperature Rising when I saw this, but believe me, the saddest thing is he could not achieve this level any other time in his career. What a waste of great talent. Gene Wilder (the Waco Kid) is great in support of Little(Black Bart), but then Wilder has a group of films he was very good in that are excellent films including Young Frankenstein.Slim Pickens to me is in his best form in this supporting cast. He is better in this than he even was in Dr Strangelove. Harvey Korman as Headley Lamar, not Heddy, is great too. The sequences he does with Slim Pickens are just classic movie scenes as they play the sequences as well as Harvey ever worked with anybody. Lets not forget top of career performances for Alex Karras (Mongo), John Hillerman (Howard Johnson), &amp; a whole bunch of others &amp; even a great cameo for Count Basie &amp; his orchestra. This film is loaded with everything you can imagine. Howard Johnson was right, this is a great film to be sure. Even though some tastes might get offended by the use of some terms, &amp; the admission of what baked campfire beans could do for most cowboys, you have to admit that this film does it with style, not crassness that would insult the intelligence of the viewer. This marks brilliant script work by the late Richard Pryor who was one of a team of writers who put together a hilarious script. Dare I say, this one is Mel Brooks best work. Never have terms like "up yours" , "bullshit" , "let me whip this out" ever been funnier how they are used in this movie. Put this film on your must see list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as controversial as before,still very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks will always be considered a hyper-kinetic impresario of the schticky,post-CAtskills,post-Vaudevillian movie parody,and while his formula for generating laughs may be better suited now for Broadway,his movies still have a strong tug in late 20th Century lore. Such is the case for both Young Frankenstein and this film,his homage to the Western.A small town sitting on top of a mine isn't budging,much to the great chagrin of shifty landowner Hedley(not Hedy!!)LaMarr(sniveling Harvey Koorman,who,unlike his parts for "The Carol Burnett Show",has to stay on mostly one note the entire show,as well he isn't the straight man for much of it,either). He schemes along with a corruptible lout of a property-hand and subcontractor(memorably played with spit and grit by none other than Slim Pickens)to try to get the town folk to abandon their property. After many means of violence as intimidation don't work,they opt to go with planting a black sheriff from one of their cheap labor,believing the townies will refuse to obey the new sheriff and proceed to kill him and themselves,if not flat out abandon the town. What they don't count on is the man they pick for the job,a sly,wisecracking dude named BArt(Cleavon Little,who uses an almost Bugs Bunny-like ease in playing the part),is a lot more clever and willing to turn the situation to his own advantage. With the help of a boozy yet still sharp gunman named Jim(Gene Wilder,slow talking' and dry as a bone but just fine here),and Bart's ability to convince the town folk that their real enemy is LaMarr,they are able to steadily turn the tables on their corrupt overlords.With great turns by Alex KArras(still fresh off his football career,playing a mentally-challenged thug named Mongo who's as strong as he is stupid),John Hillerman(as one of the town elders,HOward Johnson,one of the many Johnsons that inhabit the village),Mel Brooks himself(as both the absent-minded and easily-rooked governor AND a wise Indian chief) and Madeline Kahn(a Brooks favorite as Lily Von Schtupp,the enticing,Marlena Dietrich-like chanteuse)and even a well-placed cameo by Dom DeLuise,this movie stands up pretty well over the test of time. Co-scripted by Richard Pryor and meant to add plenty of themes of parodying racism in movies,as well as the whole OAter genre itself,this film may seem a little less eyebrow-raising as it might've in 1974,it STILL is able to illicit raw laughs and keep to its message. Mr.Brooks has directed,starred,co-written and produced many television shows and movies in his day. This,along with Young Frankenstein,represent perhaps the most fertile and lasting parts to his legacy. A must-watch for the lover of the crass comedy that doesn't mind breaking all sorts of dimensions and standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this flick when my dad watched it on CMT two years ago. Back then, I didn't really get it. But not too long ago I watched it on Beta. And guess what? I chuckled, giggled, and laughed. Cleavon Little is fantastic as the charismatic Bart, Gene Wilder shines as the Waco Kid, Harvey Korman is delicious as Hedley (NOT HEDY!) Lamarr, and seriously, who can forget the late, great Madeline Kahn as the singing and dancing Dietrich spoof Lili Von Shtupp? Going from dead-on Dietrich to a female Elmer Fudd (but that's a good thing), she totally deserved that Oscar nod (although it was Korman's Lamarr who pretty much asked for one).Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend this Mel Brooks' classic to the younger generation who's looking for a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The railroad will run through the little town of Rock Ridge and land there will be worth a fortune ? unfortunately there is one thing standing between Mr. Hedley (not Hedy!) Lamarr and that property - the rightful owners. How do you drive them out? Appoint a new sheriff whose very appearance will send the people into uproar and into refuge. A black, high-spirited sheriff.Western parody 'Blazing Saddles' is blazingly, side-splittingly funny at times and not-so-much at others. It is Mel Brooks, after all. This also means that the aforementioned plot outline is not at focus nor does it boast of a very solid template story; rather, it takes a backseat to numerous detours and diversions. A hurricane of howlers, puns, in-jokes, deadpan deliveries, references and parodies substitute for the lack of story, and often brilliantly so. The real quality humour kicks in when Gene Wilder first appears as an outrageous drinker and former gunslinger, initiating a heartfelt buddy-relationship with the new sheriff in town. He wields his supporting character aptly and well complements Cleavon Little.Yet for every token dynamic sing-and-dance number ? la Mel Brooks, the story tips over into fart-jokes territory. It is consistently shaky and uneven and that is just the level of humour ? don't even get me started on the plot. Some gags will undoubtedly leave you cold and some will even manage a raised eyebrow, such as the mandatory cameo by Brooks himself as a loony, wacky and dumb Governor. In other words, there is a surprising and disappointing number of things that need to be taken back to formula.But 'Blazing Saddles' is such a cinematic staple today ? and has been for over thirty years ? that its status alone convinces me that it must be doing something right, and certainly it often does. Moving away from the comedy side, it touches upon some highly salient issues like identity and racism but without becoming too serious in doing so (in fact, probably the opposite). Between the brilliant 'Young Frankenstein' and the stupidly hilarious 'Men in Tights' however, it fatally fades.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blazing Saddles-the DVD (30th Anniversary Special Edition)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is such a network favorite on TV that it is refreshing to view the film in its unexpurgated form. Mel Brooks says that he hates the TV network version and I can see why. In fact, clips of the TV version are shown on the DVD in the extras sections, particularly the campfire/farting scene.The extras are interesting as far as they go but they are also rather repetitious. The Mel Brooks comments section where the film is replayed so that Mel can comment on it is not what it purports to be, since his comments are in general and not pertaining to the specific section of the film being played. In fact, most of the film is played in this section with no comments at all in the later scenes. This could have been handled just as well in an interview format and I suppose it was done this way to deliberately take up more space.The transfers and Dolby sound are fine but I wasn't impressed with the extras. I'd give the DVD itself a 5 or 6 only.The original film is something else. Certainly, it has to be one of the granddaddies of outrageous comedy and, as has been pointed out often enough in the comments, the film could not be made today. The N word especially would make it quite politically incorrect but the import of the film is not to put down the black; quite the opposite. And apparently Richard Pryor wrote most of these remarks.But I always thought the final scenes were rather a stretch with Mel not knowing how to end the film. Mel's putdown of gays in general may not be simple homophobia but it certainly seems to come close in this film. (The comments make sure that Dom DeLuise's wife is mentioned though she is also in the film.) Yes, it's funny but I'm not sure what the scene is doing here.And, yes, Madeline's song as the Dietrich character Lili Von Shtupp ("Schtupp" is a Yiddish word for the sex act.), the Teutonic Titwillow is hilarious and, indeed, very "dirty" as Mel describes it and the "German" chorus boys who back her up are straight out of "Springtime for Hitler" in "The Producers" despite the 19th century costumes. "Hitler's" appearance in the commissary is probably a reference to the 40s actor, Robert "Bobby" Watson who played Hitler quite often in films of that time and even up to the early 60s. The character names are generally references to other characters or real persons such as Mel's Gov. William J. LePetomaine who references a popular early 20th century French performer who could play tunes by turning around and breaking wind (No, I'm not making this up!). Carol Arthur (DeLuise) is Harriett Johnson who was a music critic for the New York Post, Gabby Johnson was George "Gabby" Hayes, a famous western "sidekick" of the 40s, and Boris the Hangman was Boris Karloff who played a similar part ("Mord") in "Tower of London" (1939).Mel's Yiddish Indian, of course, is pure Mel and variations on this character seem to occur in many of his other films such as Yoda/Yogurt in Spaceballs and Friar Tuck/Rabbi Tuckman in Robin Hood: Men in Tights. (Neither of these films is nearly as good as Blazing Saddles IMHO.) In short hilarious and a real classic, but don't expect any real discipline from Mel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Amusing Parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first in Mel Brooks's successful series of film parodies in which he sent up the conventions of a number of established genres. The tone is struck right from the song `He Rode a Blazing Saddle' which accompanies the opening credits- a brilliant, slightly over-the-top pastiche of every song from every Western you've ever seen.The plot is a familiar Western staple- the one about the dedicated lawman or mysterious stranger who helps the inhabitants of a small town rid themselves of a gang of desperados- familiar from films such as `Dodge City', `High Noon', `Gunfight at the OK Corral' and even `High Plains Drifter', made only a couple of years earlier. A corrupt politician named Hedley Lamarr (invariably referred to as `Hedy Lamarr' in one of the film's running jokes) has sent a gang of outlaws to terrorise the people of Rock Ridge (who, in another extended joke, all have the surname Johnson) so that his railway company can acquire their land cheaply. The people petition the state governor, William J. Le Petomane, to send them a sheriff to protect them. Le Petomane, however, is in Lamarr's pocket and is persuaded to appoint a black man as Lamarr believes that the townsfolk will not accept a black sheriff. At first Lamarr is proved right, and Bart, the new appointee, is met with hostility and prejudice, but he soon wins the people over, and the rest of the film details his attempts to bring Lamarr and his bandits to justice.The film has attracted a lot of negative comments because of its use of racial humour, particularly the frequent use of the word `nigger'. In my opinion such comments miss the point of the film. Mel Brooks might not have been interested in political correctness, or whatever the 1970s equivalent was, but he was nevertheless making a serious point about racism. By this I do not simply mean that he was attacking racism by satirising it, although that was part of his aim. I also mean that he was making the point, through humour, that the Old West was a deeply racist society and that many traditional Westerns had unconsciously echoed one of its racist assumptions, namely that America's manifest destiny was to make the continent safe for settlement by white people of European descent, primarily Anglo-Saxons. There had been a few films made from a viewpoint sympathetic to the American Indians (`Broken Arrow' is perhaps the best example), but these were the exception rather than the rule. As for black and Chinese inhabitants of the West (and there were plenty of both), they were largely omitted altogether. (I am talking about what was still the position in the 1970s; things have changed somewhat since).Apart from the fact that it is played for laughs rather than seriously, the presence of a black man is the one thing that distinguishes the film from a traditional Western. Brooks shows the townspeople reacting to Bart in precisely the way in which many whites in the Old West did react to blacks. (This is hardly surprising given that many of them were by origin Southerners who only a few years earlier had been fighting to preserve slavery).Despite its serious overtones, however, the film is best remembered for its humour, which largely arises from its parodying of the standard Western themes and situations. There are a number of excellent performances- from the wisecracking Cleavon Little, who plays Bart as a mixture of Wyatt Earp and Shaft, from Harvey Korman as the camp and exaggeratedly odious Lamarr, from Brooks himself as Le Petomane (the archetype of every bumbling politician who doesn't seem to know what day it is), from Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid, a broken-down alcoholic gunfighter and from Madeline Kahn as Lili von Shtupp, a German prostitute who seems to be modelled on Marlene Dietrich's role in `Destry Rides Again', right down to her Berlin accent. (Lili is supposed to be Bavarian, but the guttural `r' sound she uses is not characteristic of Bavarian German).The one thing I did not like about the film was the ending, which might have been post-modern irony (if such a thing existed in the seventies) but was more likely a way of avoiding thinking about how to bring the film to a worthy conclusion. That apart, however, I found this a highly amusing film. 7/10 (which would have been 8/10 if the ending had been up to the same standard as the rest).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly comedy based on western clichés - but not without charms.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Very minor spoilers*A black railroad worker and a alcoholic gunfighter team up to rid a Western town of corruption.Hard to know where to start with a Mel Brooks satire of, not only everything western, but everything about film making and movies. It's sense of school yard fun and nothing-is-sacred shocked and titillated the 1970's audience - but today the crude lines and the farts come as standard.Many of the joke are re-workings of clichés and Brooks (like a desperate prize fighter) is prepared to walk through anything to get in a blow. Despite his success a lot of his gags are like 1950's TV, only here there is no innuendo, they are merely thrown in your face as the camera closes in.Racism and clichés about black men are naturally not left out - because Brooks, when has thought of a joke, cannot leave it out. In interviews he even seems to suggest that some are left in "because they are bad."Brooks isn't a great comedian or a great film maker because all he can do is copy. In copying he actually takes aboard a lot of the tricks and devices that make the original work: Here, the bad guys get routed, the townsfolk realise that the black guy isn't so bad after all, that the washed up gunfighter is not washed-up after all, etc., etc.Madeline Kahn as a kind of Marlene Dietrich character is the real winner with Cleavon Little (standing in for an "ill" Richard Prior) not being able to do anything with his role other than keep a straight face. Brooks repertory company of glad-to-have-a-jobs come on to do their bits with the one-note Slim Pickens, perhaps, getting the best of it.The thing that strikes you is that Brooks is like a session musician, in that he can play anything that people ask of him, but ask him to come up with something of his own he falls down. There is enough gags that are funny - and enough of a plot to keep it going (just) - but you have to do more than steal little bit of other people's films to make a good product, even if it is a satire. However if you accept his limitations, then he is more than able to make movies that play well on late night television; especially after a hard day at the office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really funny movie. It's got some gags that don't work, sure, but on the whole, it's a big hit. It isn't, however, the greatest comedy of all time, or even close to that. It does have some great comic performances, mainly from Madeleine Kahn and Gene Wilder. But the ending, sadly, is a disaster. I realize what Brooks was going for, but.. well, I just lose interest every time. There are still some funny gags there at the end, but... Let me put it this way, even in a very broad parody like this, the story remains important. Not nearly as important as it would be in a real (i.e., "straight") Western, but not utterly disposable either. The story is a loose (very loose) framework of characters, motivations, and events, within which the comedy can occur. In a comedy of this type, there is a lot of room to stretch the story (anachronisms, for instance). But it can't be stretched forever. The ending goes too far, and falls flat as a result. But, watch it at least that far, anyway, and then turn it off. I do the same thing with "Monty Python and the Holy Grail".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Politically Incorrect Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles (1974)*** 1/2 (out of 4) A greedy and crooked businessman (Harvey Korman) decides to try and destroy a small town by sending a new sheriff into it. This sheriff (Cleavon Little) must happens to be a black man, which isn't going to sit well with the townspeople but with the help of The Cisco Kid (Gene Wilder) he might be able to turn them.Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES is one of the most loved comedies of the 1970's but it's easy to forget how ahead of its time the thing actually was. It's funny to think of how controversial the film once was but it's also a fresh reminder that at one time you could tell politically incorrect jokes and not have to apologize for it. I mean, can you imagine a movie like this coming out today? There are all sorts of nice laughs throughout the movie, which is basically Brooks' love story to the Westerns that he grew up watching. Once again the strongest aspect of the film are the performances from a terrific cast. This includes Wilder who is perfect as the gunfighter and Korman is also excellent in his campy role as the villain. Madeline Kahn and Brooks himself deliver as you'd expect them too. Little is good in his role but at the same time you can't help but wonder what would have happened had Richard Pryor gotten the role. The greatest thing here is the performance of Slim Pickens who brings that wonderful charm to this role, although of course this one here adds a racist and comic touch.I'm not going to sit here and say the film is flawless because it certainly isn't. With that said, it's easy to see why this was a landmark film and why it continues to gain new fans each passing year. With this type of humor being pretty much outlawed today the film has an even bigger importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overrated comedies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks here. If you've watched a bit of his work, you know the sort of humor we're dealing with here. This is your thick, and I mean THICK, old timey New Yorker humor that thinks anything over-the-top and outrageous is the good kind of silly, that mindset where laughter should be provoked rather than earned, like it's therapeutic - ah come on, just laugh a little will ya ! And although his work can sometimes really be funny, and I don't always disagree with that take on humor, this here is just lazy, lazy, lazy. This is self-indulgent and even more. Clearly, however different we may be from one another, this certainly can't be considered strong humor when it's so obvious, so blatant, and tries so hard. It may have Gene Wilder, it may have guns n a Western Spaghetti setting to work with, and some okay gags, but it's certainly no 8/10. Won't spend too much time commenting this, I'm done here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just read a mundane review of this perhaps it is worth considering:The film is basically Mel Brooks' tribute to classic westerns - by using dialogue from them, taking camera set-ups from them, plots from them and also over-egging the music heard in them.OK - there are unexplained excursions into Marlene Deitrich parody and some over-the-top slapstick gags but there is also some sharp social dialogue and smart ass comment. As Mel Brooks recently stated - the film could not be made now, thanks to an over PC aware censure board (the word 'nigger' is considered offensive - hence it is stressed throughout; not to mention 'methodist' and 'irish' - creeds which also are the butt of comedy at various points but would not pass in todays' climate. [Hey, if you are so credible, how come you can't take ridicule in a comedy vehicle?])I feel the film still works on many levels apart from the basic plot. It manages to both salute the classic western whilst ripping the hell out of it. This film, along with The Producers, is surely Mel Brooks finest hour and still makes one laugh, both with and at its surreal take on 'the western'. If your only impression is one of a low grade cornball comedy and the 'fart scene' is the only one you recall, then you have really missed the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It might not be a 4 star film really but Blazing Saddles must be one of the most riotously funny satire-farces I've ever seen. Political incorrectness was well and truly headed of at the pass in this spoof western in which a corrupt political puppeteer introduces a black sheriff to run down a town - only for the new incumbent to be a raging success.Gene Wilder is the big-name draw on the bill but Cleavon Little as sheriff Bart is by no means cowed by this comic titan as his buddy. The late Harvey Korman is on premium form as the dastardly Hedley Lamarr and Mel Brooks himself plays the ridiculous Governor, who everyone would have instantly assumed to have been a direct mauling of George W Bush had the film been released in the last five years. The jokes are often obvious but highly effective, either dispatched absolutely within the confines of their assumptive genre or tearing the same to shreds. Hilarious. 7/10</fullReview>

This is not the original version. It has been cut. I know these scenes should be present as I have seen them when the movie was shown on television.

		<shortDescription>It may have killed the Western genre... who cares?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the best way to get a message across is through comedy. Mel Brooks, however unintentionally, achieved this with "Blazing Saddles", which through off-color humor shows how truly idiotic racism is. That's not to say the movie is preachy or maudlin; on the contrary, it's easily Brooks's most outrageous film. "Blazing Saddles" is filled with shameless ribaldry and constant use of the n-word. The fact that Richard Pryor assisted in the scriptwriting must have compounded the shocking humor (he was originally going to play Black Bart, but was considered too controversial). It also contains the now legendary campfire scene with its symphonic chorus of flatulence. It's the American west in 1874, and the verbose and dastardly Hedy, er, Headley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) has an evil scheme: to drive out the citizens of Rock Ridge in order to build a railroad through the town. He devises a way to scare off each and every one of them: send a new sheriff who is so shocking, so offensive, that they leave in fear and disgust. Who is chosen to drive away the inbred (all the citizens' last names are Johnson), racist, citizens? Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker, who immediately earns the hatred of Rock Ridge's rednecks. Yet the ever cool and unflappable Bart refuses to be cowed by a little bit of prejudice, so he sets out to earn some respect from the townsfolk. He first achieves this by taming wanted menace Mongo (Alex Karras, who would later play George on "Webster"), a monosyllabic brute who rides an ox and can lean his who body into a fire to light a cigar without getting burned (even fire's scared of him!). Once everyone gets wind of Headley Lamarr's scheme, Bart unites everyone to win back Rock Ridge in the longest, funniest drag-down fight ever. The plot is tissue thin and the ending is utterly absurd, but "Blazing Saddles" is such shocking fun and full of hilarious characters, you won't mind. There plenty of appearances by Brooks's staple actors including a laid-back Gene Wilder, taking a break from his usual neurotic shtick, as the Waco Kid, a washed-up gunslinger who becomes Bart's loyal sidekick. Then there's the ever-reliable Madeleine Kahn as Lili Von Schtupp, a sexy, lisping Marlene Dietrich-style saloon singer who tries to ensnare Bart. Brooks himself plays incompetent horndog Governor LePetomane, a cross-eyed fool whom Headley Lamarr easily manipulates. All the actors seem to enjoy tweaking the familiar formulas of westerns. Prissy-faced Korman is uproarious as an effete and utterly ineffective villain, and has some of the best lines ("You will be risking your lives, whilst I will be risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for the Best Supporting Actor!"). Cowboy star Slim Pickens is also a hoot as Lamarr's sidekick Mr.Taggart, who's long on ethnic slurs but short on intellect. Little is slick and hilarious as Bart, even though he sometimes comes off as Richard Pryor Lite. It's a shame he never became a bigger star... he truly had a charismatic screen presence. There is a sort of potential star-making scene when the newly appointed Sheriff Bart rides to town in his color-coordinated cowboy suit, horse, and Gucci bag. As always, Brooks uses his patented formula of combining edgy humor with tried and true vaudevillian buffoonery and cartoon slapstick. For instance, Bart pulls a Bugs Bunny by trapping Mongo with an explosive candy box (they even use the familiar Looney Tunes theme at the end of the scene). And when Bart and a colleague take a railroad cart and sink into quicksand, an overseer rides up and lassos? the railroad cart, leaving Bart and his friend to suffer. Yeah, this movie may have all but killed the Western, but, when it's Mel Brooks, who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst DVD of a Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Mel Brooks all of my life, and growing up, I enjoyed watching "Blazing Saddles," "Young Frankenstein," "Silent Movie," and "High Anxiety." Of these 4 movies only "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frankenstein" are on DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed the extensive special edition DVD treatment of "Young Frankenstein" and I own it as part of my DVD collection, but as for "Blazing Saddles," it just doesn't have the DVD touch. The movie itself is one of those special comedies such as "Young Frankenstein," "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," "Airplane!," and "Caddyshack". "Blazing Saddles" is a timeless spoof of the western genre and time gets kinder to it as the years pass. This movie stars Brooks and his usual gang of cronies - Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder, Dom DeLuise, and Harvey Korman. Everyone in this is memorable. We will always remember Cleavon Little as the black sheriff who is subject to the N-word by the prejudiced denizens of Rock Ridge, Harvey Korman as the crafty attorney general Hedley Lamarr who upsets the town with the sheriff and a railroad running through it, Dom DeLuise in a cameo as a Hollywood movie director who gets coldcocked by the hero Slim Pickens as Taggart, Mel Brooks in dual roles as a Yiddish speaking Indian Chief and the corrupt, womanizing Governor William LePetomane, and Madeline Kahn, in her best role, as the sexy Lilli Von Shtupp, the German saloon chanteuse who seduces the sheriff, uttering one of the most imitated lines among viewers of Brooks films, "It's Twue! It's Twue!" The humor may be too crude or too Jewish, but that is what makes Brooks films great. Oh, and let's not forget hulky Alex Karras as the horse-punching Mongo who gets blown up by the sheriff into smithereens. As for the DVD itself, I found it to be a major disappointment. This is one of the first DVDs to come out, and ever since DVDs have taken special treatment with more and more extras. Other than cast and crew bios and production notes, there is a rambling 55-minute interview with Mel Brooks. We do not see his face, we only hear him whisper like a golf game announcer through footage of the first half of the movie, and I know that Brooks did a better job in his interview in a subsequent DVD of "The Producers." Likewise, Gene Wilder did a great job in his interview in the DVD of "Young Frankenstein" where he talks about "Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein." The worst part of the DVD is the setup of the movie. Most widescreen DVDs have thin boxes, but this movie has such thick boxes it makes the movie look too small to watch, as if we were looking at the movie through a telescope. Next year, "Blazing Saddles" will be a venerable 30 years old. I would save my money to buy a 30th Anniversary re-release of "Blazing Saddles" with a better setup of the movie and more extras that would make the DVD worthwhile, if Mel Brooks and/or Warner Brothers bothers to re-release the DVD into a special edition, as so many earlier DVDs of classic movies are being made into right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, but still okay...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..."Blazing Saddles" is mostly a parody of the cheesy westerns of the fifties and sixties, about a crooked railroad boss (Harvey Korman) who appoints a black sheriff, Bart (Cleavon Little) to a town where he wants the land to put a railroad through. Bart gets help from the Wacko Kid (Gene Wilder) in his fight against the raving, moronic bandits assaulting the town (led by Slim Pickens). This is directed by Mel Brooks, and along with 'Young Frankenstein' and 'The Producers', makes the trio of his most popular films. Compared to the other two, 'Blazing Saddles' is swimming in a pool of mediocrity.Aside from Little's overacting ? even for parody ? the actors are the best part of the film. Gene Wilder wipes the floor with the rest of the cast in his quiet, wise, hilarious parody of the quick drawing characters of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne. Korman and Pickens are funny, and Madeline Kahn is fantastic in an early role (and Oscar nominated too) as the 'tired' Bulgarian lounge singer Lili Von Shtupp.The actors are mostly great, but what they're saying isn't. It's all just too over the top. In 'Dr. Strangelove', 'The Holy Grail' and 'Airplane!' the characters didn't know that they were in a satire. In 'Blazing Saddles' they do. A good example of this is when a drunken man shouts in cliché western terms, and then David Huddleston stands up and says 'I'm glad he said it in good, clear western jargon'. It's just too forced.Mel Brooks is definitely one of Hollywood's biggest egos. He has a short, funny scene as the governor, which worked fine for a short cameo, but then we see him again as this character, and then again as a different one, and he stops being funny ? fast. I'd go as far as to say he ruins potentially good scenes.The script, well?Brooks and Wilder had to make cuts on the 'Young Frankenstein' script because for every one joke that worked there were three that didn't. Should've done the same for this one, 6.5/10.</fullReview>

He is best behind the camera. As I said before most of the jokes fall flat and some of the actors deserved better. Young Frankenstien also came out the same year and was better and funnier. Even Airplane was a million times better and I laughed more at that one than Blazing Saddles. Airplane ages better. I couldn't believe Blazing Saddles ranked higher than Airplane. Airplane should higher than Blazing Saddles. If you want to watch a great Mel Brooks movie, watch Young Frankenstien. Blazing Saddles is overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This parody of prejudice isn't really funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, "Blazing Saddles" misses the mark as a good satire. In its supposed effort to spoof the movies over their stereotyping of races, this movie has degrading racist overtones. Making a black sheriff in a Western town might bring a chuckle. But then, racial slurs, innuendos and other portrayals of stereotyped African- Americans soon dispel any spoofing of racism. I didn't think this was very funny when I first saw the film shortly after it came out. And, it's still not funny, decades later. I suspect that this film got a lot of play and ballyhoo in the beginning because of a huge publicity and promo campaign that built it up as a spoof of prejudices. After a while, people will begin to believe the propaganda. Then, when watching some racist portrayals that actually feed such biases, many audiences are made to think that they are only appreciating a putting in place of the bigots. Yet the prejudicial pictures remain in one's mind. The idea of subliminal perception and its use in films to affect audience behaviors goes back a long way. Yet, blatantly derogatory things can be masked or covered over by the propaganda and publicity efforts of promoters who can convince many of the public that something just isn't so ? or that it's something else. Hans Christian Andersen's story comes to mind ? "The Emperor's New Clothes."I don't think that Mel Brooks was a racist, or that he intended to spread racism in the making of this film. I think he is among those folks who look at humor first, and who see humorous aspects in things that may also have very dark sides. Whereas, for most people, the dark aspects take away any perception of humor. So, Brooks and people like him want to be able to laugh at what they see is funny, regardless of the dark side. I think that's what he was doing with this film. He made it for others like him who could see humor in otherwise bad, pathetic or distasteful situations. And, since most people would not be of the same ilk, in order to make his film acceptable to the mainstream public (if not to avoid outright criticism and picketing of the film), Warner Brothers had to make it palatable. So, they publicized and promoted the film as an assault on and spoof of prejudices. Just look at the promo on the DVD cover for the 30th Anniversary Special Edition. The promo calls it a "spiffy spoof set in an 1874 Old West where 1974 Hollywood is just one sound stage away." It's a place "where nonstop fun blasts prejudices to the high comedy heavens." What in the world can that mean? It's nothing, really, but a protestation that covers up the fact that the humor in the film is dark.In the world today, people abscond with words that we associate with good sentiments all the time. Wholesome, good things used to be described in the old phrase as befitting, "baseball, motherhood, and apple pie." But today, people use such words to describe things that in their real direct language are quite distasteful or even horrible. Why shouldn't we expect anything less with the moguls of media ? the experts and creators of mass communication in film, when they want to push a project or a movie? The bottom line of this film is that it's racist in itself. It is prejudiced in some other portrayals as well. It has very little witty or clever dialog. Few of the situations are funny. But it's wrap as being a film under production at the end, with fisticuffs breaking through other Hollywood sets, only smacks more to me of a clincher to deny the very racist and prejudicial nature of the film's portrayal of humor. Ever wonder why this movie wasn't set in the Deep South instead of the Old West?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough Hilarious Moments to Overcome Dated Stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Mel Brooks's western spoof, "Blazing Saddles," retains some hilarious moments and delicious performances, the stereotypes and racial epithets are badly outdated. Westerns produced since 1974 have illustrated the place that African-Americans played in the old west. Thus, the over-the-top reactions of an all-white town facing the appointment of a black sheriff will strike many as quaint and others as ridiculous. The repetitive use of the "N" word is difficult for modern audiences to hear, and many viewers will flinch in embarrassment each time it is uttered. The sight of an elderly woman meeting up with the sheriff and spitting out "Up Yours N*****" is patently offensive. While Brooks does not stereotype the film's African-Americans, he has no qualms about deriding Gay Americans. Besides a bevy of Gay insults thrown around during the film, the ending features a bevy of dancing queens who mince and answer to "Let's Go Girls!" Perhaps that was funny in 1974, but that attitude is way out of date in the era of "Brokeback Mountain."Does "Blazing Saddles" have any redeeming values left? Yes, there are enough bright spots to outshine the bad. Madeline Kahn as the Marlene-Dietrich-like saloon singer, who is brought in to seduce the sheriff, provides a jewel of a performance. Harvey Korman is nearly as good as Hedley Lamarr, who strives to be the Boris Badanov of the film. The famous campfire bean-eating scene is classic, the cowboys singing "De Camptown Ladies" is a hoot, and Kahn's seduction of the sheriff in the dark is hilarious. While the title song was intended as a parody, as sung by Frankie Laine it ranks with some of the best western themes, many of which Laine also crooned.Unfortunately, the film begins as a fine western spoof and ends in a surreal mess. When "Blazing Saddles" concentrates on being an affectionate send-up of the western genre, the film is on solid ground. If he had remained focused, Brooks and company might have turned in a parody as fine as the subsequent "Young Frankenstein," arguably the best movie genre spoof ever. Unfortunately, the writers seem to have run out of ideas, and a surreal aspect sets in towards the end that destroys the internal logic of the film and breaks through the barrier between 1874 and the present. However, if viewers can get beyond the epithets and stereotyping, there is enough hilarity to sustain at least two viewings, the minimum needed to catch all of the throwaway lines and visual jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bean Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks' humor is always time-consistent. He uses a joke, then holds off a few years before telling it again in later works. As such, his work from 'Saddles' to 'Frankenstein' to 'History' to 'Spaceballs' to 'Robin Hood' resembles a large, monochrome smear working with the same principles.It is for these reasons that I'm against Brooks and his style of humor. It isn't funny anymore. I'm also against the vein of "straight comedy films" because sustaining jokes is a pitiful waste. Film works when humor comes in small pieces, not at once. That's how life is anyway.So here Brooks uses his usual gags from sex to bodily functions, spanning the first- through eighth-grade level. These are superficial laughs, nothing else. 'Back to the Future' has similar problems, but mixes it with a little sophistication (notably reverse-Oedipal symptoms). 'Beetlejuice' and 'Death Becomes Her' have the advantage of taking a human issue (death), but 'Saddles doesn't have anything.He hasn't changed, his method of deriving humor from the work of others has, unfortunately, helped spawn the garbage of the Zucker brothers.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh riot. Not the way the west was won.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Brooks directs, writes and stars in this western spoof. Sight gags and quick quips galore. One belly laugh after another. When released in 1974, this was pushing the line on offensive rudeness. Today it may still be funny; but the shock value is gone.A crooked political boss(Harvey Korman)wants to run everyone out of a little town, so he can claim the land to sell to the railroad. He appoints a black sheriff(Cleavon Little) in hopes of offending the townsfolk. The sheriff, with the help of a former gunslinger(Gene Wilder),rallies the town in defending itself against corruption.Situational humor will have you laughing your butt off. This movie compels you to urge your friends to watch it. I am not a Mel Brooks fan, but think this is the best project of his whole career. Also appearing in this fun filled romp are: Slim Pickens, Madeline Kahn and Alex Karras. Sharing writing credits on this comedy classic is Richard Pryor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat overrated but enough laughs to satisfy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blazing Saddles is a movie which, if you have never seen it, definitely has a reputation that precedes it. That reputation indicates that this is one of the funniest movies of all time. When you finally get around to watching the movie you find the movie's reputation unfortunately exceeds its actual content. This movie is purported to be a lot funnier than it really is. So watching the movie can be a bit of a letdown. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie though. It may not be one of the funniest movies ever but it's funny enough. Mel Brooks tosses anything and everything into the comedy mix in this one. Some of it doesn't work, much of it is just passable. But there are those moments of comic genius sprinkled throughout. It is a movie of comedic bits and pieces with the scattered pieces that work brilliantly enough to make the movie a success.In a movie like this the plot is almost besides the point but the story revolves around an Old West town in 1874 which gets a new sheriff. The new sheriff is black. The townspeople are horrified. Comedy ensues. That comedy is largely hit and miss, the movie never really manages to sustain the laughs for any great length of time. All the performers do admirable jobs with what they're asked to do. But a lot of what they're asked to do just doesn't end up being as funny as you would hope. Madeline Kahn is a prime example. Her character of singing seductress Lili von Shtupp has great potential and Kahn performs beautifully. But her big song falls well short of Springtime for Hitler-style genius. Kahn gives it her all but it's just not funny enough. If you're waiting for the big laughs you'll be waiting a while but they finally do come in an ending in which Brooks sends his movie careening wildly off the rails. The ending is bizarre and outrageous and preposterous and pretty much perfect. With this ending Brooks went for broke and it worked. There are a whole lot of laughs crammed into those final few minutes. The movie may have been just a touch disappointing most of the way but Blazing Saddles definitely leaves you laughing in the end. Maybe the movie doesn't match its reputation but there's enough good stuff here to keep you satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie would have been great if Brooks wasn't 100% in control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than THE PRODUCERS (and possibly Young Frankenstein), Mel Brooks' movies suffer from TOO MUCH Mel! In other words, just because Mel Brooks can be very funny does NOT mean he knows everything about movies nor should he write, direct and act in them (the Jerry Lewis Syndrome). Most of his movies in recent years have amply proved this (Robin Hood Men in Tights as well as Life Stinks come to mind).I picked Blazing Saddles to review because, in my opinion, it sparked the beginning of the end of his brilliance. The beginning of his unchecked excesses became so apparent here and only got worse in his following efforts. Unlike The Producers (where he is in the movie for a VERY brief instant during the Springtime for Hitler scene), he is on screen through much of the movie and he is about is as subtle as a brick upside the head. Sure, comedy can be this unsubtle, but I feel that the quality of his movies is inversely related to how much time he seen on screen. Take High Anxiety and Life Stinks for example--both feature him as the lead actor and they are terribly unfunny flicks.So back to Blazing Saddles. The movie has MANY brilliant bits throughout (such as those with Mongo or with the town's reactions to the new sheriff) but also has such infantile segments as the "eating beans around the campfire" segment as well as Mel's acting as he plays the Governor. ENOUGH already--get a co-director or a STRONG producer to tell him ENOUGH--STOP!!!! But instead, the movie goes from moderately funny (and very funny in parts) to a horrific mess by the end. Instead of a real ending, it degenerates to a fight scene which spills over into other pictures. Is the ending original? Maybe--but certainly not funny. And from here on, it only gets worse.So, my recommendation is watch The Producers. It's a nearly perfect comedy--too bad it was at the beginning of Brooks' film career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate Mel Brooks movies, but my friend told me he'd seen Blazing Saddles 15 times, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Expect the usual lame Mel Brooks humor: bad jokes about Jews (greedy and money-loving), blacks (they dress snazzy and are well hung), and women (they love well hung black men!); and just overall backwards, old-fashioned sensibilities. There are a few funny scenes like when a man on a horse gets hanged (and the horse too!), how Bart tricks the townspeople when he first meets them, and the hilarious ending saves the movie from being a total wash. However, if you grew up watching comedy in today's time, I think you'll find that 75% of the humor in this movie falls pretty flat.Worth seeing once, but I wouldn't pay money for it.</fullReview>

I can appreciate the originality, it's dark and ballsy humor, and of course,"Where all the white women at?" But seeing it for the first time in 2013 with all the great comedies that came after it. It falls flat on it's face and hobbles it's way through the credits.The movie is poorly acted and slowly paced, and a lack of any sense of ambiance. Meaning when nothing happens you are begging for someone to do something.The jokes range from a few chuckles to a lot of lame misses. And probably most importantly: this movie can be extremely offensive, especially by today's standards.Not a movie for date night by any means..The movie has big ambitions and is well remembered for such, but became worn down overtime by it's bad production, acting(lets face it--the ending was atrocious!)and outdated humor and lack of political correctness. I'd recommend this movie only if you're a fan of classic comedy and cannot be easily offended.Overall I gotta give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although funny, "Blazing Saddles" suffers in comparison with "Young Frankenstein," which is one of the greatest films ever made. The humor here tends to be drier and there is less of it. My teenage daughter put it this way, "Westerns are not as good for comedy as horror films." I also found the frequent use of the "N" word to be distracting. I wonder how folks would take it if the situation was reversed: A black film-maker making a comedy in which the "H" word and "K" word were used to refer to a Jewish character. Can't think of any films like that. Can you? I still recommend this film for the moderately effective humor and the incredibly good performance by Madeline Kahn.

		<fullReview>A Western parody by Mel Brooks. Dastardly Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) needs to run a railroad through a town. To get rid of the townspeople he has villains run wild, attacking townspeople. Black sheriff Bart (Cleavon Little) and the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder) fight back. This was a huge hit in 1974--it was considered daring and uproariously funny. Seen today it doesn't hold up. The daring parts are very tame in the wake of comedies we have today and some of these jokes are pretty despearate. Also I got more than a little tired of hearing a certain word beginning with "n" constantly used as a joke. And there's virtual nonstrop swearing from the rest of the cast. Most of the movie is pretty dull (when the jokes in this movie bomb they REALLY bomb!) And the last 10 minutes are just dreadful (and horribly homophobic).I'm giving it a 6 for a few reasons. Little is very good, handsome and heroic in his role. Wilder is VERY funny as the washed up Kid. Some of Korman's snearing and scheeming is funny. And Madeline Kahn is absolutely hysterical doing a Marlene Dietrich impersonation as Lily von Shtupp (she's terribly underused but got a nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Also there's a Count Basie cameo and some very good songs throughout.Still, all in all, this isn't that funny. The movie's most infamous scene has a bunch of cowboys sitting around a fire eating beans and breaking wind. THAT'S what this movie considers funny. Mel Brooks' best film is still "Young Frankenstein".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cleavon Little plays the black sheriff in a tumbleweed town who is having trouble with the sex-crazed locals, and must eventually lead the residents into battle with the bad guys. Prurient, anything-for-a-laugh western slapstick from Mel Brooks, who also appears as a bosom-mad governor and an Indian chief. It looks tacky and shabby, and some of the jokes completely bomb out, but the picture can get you laughing if you come across it in the requisite silly spirit. The loosely-hinged plot is just thrown away in the last reel, when Brooks apparently loses interest and turns the whole shebang into a spoof of Hollywood. Most of the cast survives the morass: frizzy-haired Gene Wilder nearly goes into his brand of weird mania (though he seems held back), Madeline Kahn is the belle of the ball as a Dietrich-like saloon singer with a Barbara Walters-like speech impediment, Harvey Korman is practically on fire as sniveling Hedley Lamarr (his name used for the basis of many jokes), and Dom DeLuise is, blessedly, brief as a director. Cleavon Little is well-suited for the sheriff, but he isn't given anything funny to say or do, and being the straight man doesn't work either since he's at the center of the action (Brooks turns him into a stationary prop). Despite more and more affection being heaped upon it over the years, "Blazing Saddles" is a hit-and-miss affair, though the jokes that 'hit' really do linger in the memory. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Brooks comes at you a gag a second with farts, silly puns and racial slurs, I mean we're really talking bottom barrel "humor" here-- I just couldn't believe that this was the great classic comedy I'd heard about. I respect the guy, I've seen other things of his that I found at least somewhat amusing, just not this one. Perhaps there's just something of this movie that's been lost to time. I tried watching it with the mindset that it would be dated and I freely admit that a lot contemporary humor isn't much better, but normally I can make it through those films, even the bad ones, this one I stopped watching at about 3/4 of the way through. I just couldn't take it anymore. It's not so shocking or offensive that you won't be able to handle it or anything like that, that would at least be something. No, it's just really dumb and boring; it's an utter waste of time. I can honestly think of nothing redeeming about it. The fact it is so universally cherished really makes me scared for the future of my species.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose this movie can be considered a classic of comedy, but only if you are prepared to lump into the classic category such movies as Airplane.It's a matter of what you find amusing. If slapstick and childishly simple puns and one-liners, puerile plays-on-words or bathroom humour are what gets you rolling in the aisles, then BS (an interesting acronym) will not only float your boat, it will wash it away in a veritable flood.On the other hand, if more subtle and clever comedy are what you prefer, then I'd suggest staying well clear.It's not that BS isn't a reasonable film. It's just that its comedy hails from an era when nothing like it was ever seen on film or TV. It was a hit because of its difference, much like Airplane would be later. But, like Airplane, BS's humour doesn't stand the test of time very well. Audiences, for the most part, grow up and mature. The simple humour shown here won't make it today.As a result, the movie is disappointing. Living on its laurels from yesteryear - being hailed as a classic - is a hard crown for any film to wear successfully for more than a few years, let alone thirty. It's remembered fondly by those that saw it way back when, and those that may have seen it later without anything else for reference. But, being subjected to the deluge of "other" comedy in the intervening years since its original release, the movie fades from the bright star that it once was into the somewhat struggling, tarnished movie that it now appears as.The most redeeming feature of the movie today is its utter and complete lack of anything that remotely resembles political correctness. It's nice to see the N-word uttered by someone other than a black actor. Not just uttered, but uttered without much trace of vitriol or menace.We should give a nod to these old movies for, despite the clumsy scripts and poor humour, they remind us of a time when things were simpler, easier to understand. When things were (if you'll pardon the pun) black and white. Simpler movies for a simpler time.Shake your head at the shallowness of it all if you will today, but remember that there was a time when this was entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Blazing Saddles" --- "B.S.", indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how many more laughs are to be found in an old five-minute SNL sketch than in this 93-minute piece of sludge. Yes, that's right, it's only 93 minutes long, but if you make the mistake of checking this one out, you'll feel like it's a 3 hour yawnfest. In fact, the early scene with the characters caught in quicksand will sum up your viewing experience: an imprisonment in a slimy, stolid muck and the struggle to pull your way through it.Of course, a big part of the problem is that most of the would-be jokes simply aren't funny. I'm amazed that a movie like this received the critical praise that it has. Comedy can be so much more than what "Blazing Saddles" throws on the screen. I think that some of the critics and award-peddlers might have been tricked into applauding the film because, unlike many comedies, it makes an attempt to examine --- or rather, to incorporate the issue of racism into its humor. Thus, some may be convinced that the movie exhibits intelligence by trying to deal with a "serious" theme, but any social statement it musters is neither solid nor accurate. Much of the movie's humor is based on the unrealistic supposition that all white inhabitants of the southwest were crass, easily-duped white supremacist WASPs who used racial slurs out of habit and detested blacks. Racism is a difficult subject to form comedy from, and here the concept is beaten over the viewer's head. The jokes are shouted out with no subtlety or wit, as if heavy-handedness makes them clever or socially perceptive. And as a source of humor, it wears out quickly, for that matter. The director Mel Brooks thinks it's funny to give all the white racists the generic name of "Johnson." Har har. Never mind the fact that the US president who fought for black civil rights and appointed the first black Supreme Court justice was a white Texan named Johnson.It's true that some of the jokes could have worked, but the movie has such a poor sense of pacing that it fails to build anything resembling comic mood or momentum. You could call it dull, unappealing, even unimaginative. And it seems like Brooks was very determined to mug for the camera and bore the viewer during his lengthy on-screen appearances. His face kind of resembles Don Adams from "Get Smart," but when it comes to being funny, make no mistake, Don Adams he ain't.While trying to stay awake around the 40-minute mark, I said to myself, "OK, well, Gene Wilder should be showing up soon. He can be funny sometimes." But his presence is barely memorable at best. After Wilder delivers a slurred speech or two, the film introduces the quick-handedness of Wilder's gun-slinging character, which proves to be the film's only gag that is remotely funny and interesting. Alas, this provides but a minute or two of material. The writers seemed to have trouble finding a purpose for him, and so Wilder inexplicably spends most of the movie hanging around Cleavon Little's office. Instead of doing comedy, he is left to recite long stretches of forgettable dialogue.Let's see, what other "comedy" does the movie offer? There are the ho-hum attempts to recreate Monty Python-style absurd humor, especially at the end. Simply flat compared to what those British boys have done, and not enough to lift this picture out of the mud. And no discussion of the movie can ignore the bulk of the material, the continuous vein of low-brow, puerile rubbish not worth anyone's time. Another IMDb reviewer or two have labeled it "seventh grade" stuff. Well, I even bet there are a number of 7th Graders who would feel that this humor is beneath them. (That is, if they managed to sit through all the other boring scenes.) I am perplexed that such dreck is being held up by some critics as high cinema.Unless you feel it is absolutely essential for you to hear Slim Pickens spouting the S-word, skip this one.</fullReview>

When Brooks is the Gov or the Indian chief? You wonder why he didn't just (over)act every part and save everyone a lot of time.The only thing saving this from the bottom of the barrel is an excellent cast (Little, Kahn, Korman, Wilder) that tries SO hard to make something out of a junior high school script by a man that is seriously not all that funny.Okay, this movie is still about 100 times better than Spaceballs...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this film from actor/producer/writer/director Mel Brooks (The Producers, Young Frankenstein), and I knew I couldn't miss it. It is a politically incorrect comedy, mainly because of the many racist terms, but a very funny one. Basically, it is based in the American Old West of 1874 in a town called Rock Ridge, with all but the Governor Lepetomane (Mel Brooks, also playing an Indian chief) with the surname Johnson. A gang of thugs, led by the dastardly Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman), often mistaken for the actress Hedy Lamarr are invading the town, causing the townspeople demanding a new sheriff. When one comes along, they weren't expecting a Ni... (that a quote by the way, "Ni..."), African American railroad worker named Bart (BAFTA nominated newcomer Cleavon Little) to be the new sheriff. The only friend that Bart has for a while is alcoholic gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder), once known as 'The Waco Kid' for his fast hands. Anyway, they eventually convince the town to build a fake town to fool the bad guys, they fall for it, and they attack, and doing this happen to crash into a Hollywood studio production. The bad guys and Lamarr are defeated, Bart and Jim get to see the end of their movie, and Bart makes everyone accept coloured people. Also starring Slim Pickens as Taggart, Oscar nominated Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp (a character with a "gweat" German accent), David Huddleston as Olson Johnson, Liam Dunn as Rev. Johnson, Alex Karras as Mongo, John Hillerman as Howard Johnson, George Furth as Van Johnson, Claude Ennis Starrett Jr./Jack Starrett as Gabby Johnson, Dom DeLuise as Buddy Bizarre, Richard Collier as Dr. Sam Johnson, Count Basie, Burton Gilliam as Lyle, and apparently an uncredited Anne Bancroft as an Extra in Church Congregation. The racist jokes are amusing, the farting (because of beans) round the camp fire is classic, Korman and Wilder both have their moments, it may be funnier than Young Frankenstein. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Song for "Blazing Saddles", and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay. It was number 8 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having viewed and liked several other Mel Brooks movies, I thought this would be a classic. But unlike "The Producers", which worked because the bad taste was ridiculous, the bad taste in "Blazing Saddles" is just plain bad taste.We start with a mixed racial group of laborers working in the hot sun on a railroad track being visited by several supervisors. One worker faints from the heat and the supervisor says, "Dock this Chink a day's pay for sleeping on the job." Ha, ha, cruelty is funny. Then we hear the supervisor asking why the black workers aren't singing like they did as slaves. They sing a song the supervisor doesn't expect, and pretend not to know "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot". Two workers fall into quicksand, but the supervisors are very casual about rescuing them (though they do). Next, the supervisor goes to the big boss to tell them the rail line must be rerouted, and to do so requires them to destroy a town in the way. The supervisor brags about how they want to cruelly slaughter the town's residents, but spare the women for raping. After twenty minutes of this sidesplitting hilarity, I had enough and turned it off.Yes, even bad taste can be funny, but not so with this movie. We're supposed to laugh at people making cheap racial insults and plotting to do terrible things to innocent people. If you think rape is funny, this should be the movie for you.Some reviewers make the case that the movie is supposed to be an attack on racism because the white people who spew racial insults are supposed to be idiots and the blacks look good in comparison. So why is it then that women are the ones who hate "Benny Hill"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Blazing load of rubbish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This the first time that have got to See Blazing Saddles and i wish i hadn't bothered. This is so bad that i cant believe how it has got a 7.7 out of 10 rating. It looks dated , is does not have one funny moment in it (including the childish farting scene)and it has constant referenced to German's and Germany which in itself is not funny and makes sense only to Mel Brooks.The story is silly and uninteresting and just when you think the film cant get any worse the ending is farsically bad and yet again makes no sense. I have seen Mel Brooks films before and they are all bad but not as bad as this. If i was to try to find any flicker of good from this crap is that it has Gene Wilder in it and even he has an expresion as if to say " What have i let myself in for!" . A MASSIVE STINKER ! 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated "comedy" blazing dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time "Blazing Saddles" came out in the mid seventies, racial relations had already been given a great deal of comedic treatment for years on prime time television with the likes of the pioneering "All in the Family" and later, "Sanford and Son." But even those shows, which seemed so groundbreaking at the time, have not dated well.So it can hardly be argued that "Blazing Saddles" deserves praise for being so cutting edge at the time. Instead, what is suppose to pass for an audacious comedic plot comes off now in the same exact way it came off to me back then - as nothing but mere pandering: why, the very idea of a hip black sheriff in a bigoted white town! What a hilarious premise! This pandering is reinforced by the fact that Cleavon Little's character is so hip and cool - as if Brooks was afraid to make him the butt of any jokes - that Little, as the sheriff, is consistently and remarkably unfunny.Other aspects of the film, involving Brooks' typical overly broad and obvious style of humor, are also remarkably unfunny. For example, what elementary school grade were you in when you last doubled over in laughter at some kid crossing his eyes? This stupid, sub-adolescent shtick, employed by Brooks himself acting in the role of the governor, is pretty revealing of the extent of Brooks' comedic talent. I mean, if given the chance to be a player in his own movie, if he really and truly is the comedic genius that some claim he is, wouldn't he make more use of the opportunity and show us what he can really do? Or was that the best he could do - the cross-eyed lecher with "THE GOV" in bold letters on the back of his coat?Brings tears of laughter to your eyes just thinking about it, doesn't it?Add that kind of pathetic effort to the pandering, toss in an overly-indulgent use of sexual vulgarity as well as redundant bits that aren't funny to begin with, and you've got a film that is far more painful than funny to watch.What also doesn't help is watching talents like Harvey Korman, Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn trying their best to give it the old college try with such overbearing, poor material.On the other hand, if Korman getting off on a statue is your idea of funny, then you will probably love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a dozen attempts to watch this film all the way through, I have failed. It is so racist and dated I can't finish it.It might have been funny in the 70's, but today it is just painful. From the attempts to poke fun at different cultures to the random cuts from other period pictures it is not worth the investment of your time.There are scenes like a hangman hanging a horse and a rider. I recognize them as a reference to the Lone Ranger, but it still wasn't enough to keep my interest.The same was true of the multiple references to someone's shaded view of history that attempts to color the film (but fails).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>somebody please tell me why this film is even considered funny. i couldn't even watch it all i only watched the first half hour and i really couldn't help but think "well maybe its not the same movie everybody else keeps tellin me about. i mean they are always telling me how funny blazing saddles is. Geeee maybe i got the wrong one" sadly it was the same blazing saddle movie all these di*kheads keep telling me is a comedy classic. urgg i just couldn't laugh. As mentioned i only watched the first half hour, but that was more than enough for me to realise what a steaming pile of dog terd this really is. After half hour all i could gather was it was a western set in a small town where every person is racist. seriously!! All the time i could just hear "ni*ger" this and "ni*ger" that, and the films pacing was awful, it was one of those slow comedies that involve patience(but this movie requires something stronger than that). This might have been funny 30+ years ago, buts its just not in this day and age.THIS is widely considered to be one of the greatest comedies in film history? Can't understand why. Maybe ill try it again one day, but i'll need a strong drink before it!By Scott Dewhurst</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the least funny comedies that I've ever sighed through and one of the most overrated pieces of crap I can think of. I like a couple of Brooks' movies. Young Frankenstein I would call his masterpiece, and The Producers is pretty funny. After that, Silent Movie is okay. Spaceballs is good for some cheap laughs. But he can make quite the awful film when he wants to. Remember the Hitchcock parody, High Anxiety? That sucked big time, but I liked Blazing Saddles even less. I giggled a couple of times, but there was only one big laugh. Most of the funnier jokes were ruined by a 60 seconds long promo I saw on Comedy Central! Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, and Slim Pickens try their damndest to make it work, but they have no material to work with whatsoever. Some of the racial comedy might have worked back when Richard Pryor first started his career, but it's all hopelessly dated in 2002. And is it just me, or do others cringe whenever Madeline Kahn shows up in a Mel Brooks movie? I guess I laugh at her in Young Frankenstein, but she does little but embarrass the production when she comes on screen. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I watched Blazing Saddles, having heard all the hype, and expecting to see one of the funniest films ever made. Instead, for the majority of its running time, I sat there thinking to myself how tedious and crass it was. Was there ever a time when exchanges like "You spare the women?" "No, we rape the s**t out of them" were considered amusing? Just about every racial stereotype you can think of is here, including Mel Brooks as a very Jewish native American chief, as well as plenty of slurs and insults that grate on the nerves and numerous sequences that drag their heels and wind up absolutely nowhere. After such a promising start with The Producers - where Brooks made his intentions clear from the get-go, filling the screen with parallel universe grotesques, broadly drawn caricatures and bad taste madness that effectively defused criticisms in the manner of the most florid twenties slapstick - Mel Brooks seemed to fall into the trap of thinking everything he did was comic gold, and there weren't enough people willing to tell him it wasn't. That's probably as good a reason as any why Blazing Saddles will test the patience of anyone with half a brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get it why people give this movie that much of a credit! I still find Jerry Louis comedy much more striking. Most of the credit in this movie goes to Hedly Lamar, being the funniest character. The scene that made me laugh best was when Lamar having his bath and lost his froggy. Other than that there were smart parodies with other movies but not that funny. Gene Wilder was still young and I still like him better in his other movies. I even believe that Mel Brooks matured more in his later movies.And just for the fun of it, all Jews always make fun of Hitler in their comedies, have you noticed this? Like Jerry Lewis in "Which Way to the Front", Jerry Seinfeld in one of his episodes with Elaine's boss, Mel Brooks in "Blazzing Saddles", Woody Alen, etc... I like all these comedians and consider them the smartest of all.</fullReview>

I have worked in a comedy club and love comedy movies, but this one just does not need to be seen. I read other comments and it said that this movie was great. I am sorry people but even with the racial slurs and common stereotypes this movie did nothing for me. I am glad I got to rent it for free cause I would never want to pay for it.

		<fullReview>Funny, how some legendary comedies aren't funny. Did "Blazing Saddles" work in 1974 when it was released? Yes. Does it work 30+ years later?No.95% of it is staggeringly tedious and boring. The other 5% (namely Madeline Kahn and the baked-beans scene) are wonderful.Like a five-year-old discovering the "humor" in fart jokes, "Blazing Saddles" revels in its then-shocking use of the n-word. (Note: in today's politically correct environment, spelling out the n-word could get one kicked off of IMDb.) Unfortunately, Richard Pryor had already laid to rest the n-word's ostensible shock value in perhaps the most audacious and brilliant comedy album ever, "That Nigger's Crazy" (released the same year, 1974).Pryor's genius also exposes the utter lack of humor and sophistication in what is Mel Brooks' worst film. Like a grade-school child spewing newly-discovered "bad" words, Brooks' grandiose exercise in "look-at-me-being-bad" schlock arouses nothing so much as scorn.Coming after "The Producers" (brilliant) and before "Young Frankenstein" (also brilliant), "Blazing Saddles" is a cheap melange of adolescent minds trying to get a rise out of the grownups.Neither shocking nor ugly, it's just boring -- except for the one or two moments mentioned. Its silly, contrived "studio ending" is yet another smug Hollywood "in-joke" (among many in this wanna-be-funny film) that doesn't work.The performers are all fine. Madeline Kahn stands out, as she always did.The script and conception are the problems. Today, thirty-plus years later, they're just excruciating and pointless.Compare to Richard Pryor, who wove these same "dirty" words into an everlasting record of socio-comic genius through his writing and acting and sketches on, "That Nigger's Crazy." Then you'll realize what a low point "Blazing Saddles" was for the otherwise remarkable Mel Brooks.Not because it was "tasteless" (tastelessness can be hysterical, and is one of Brooks' hallmarks) but because it's so boring (there's never an excuse for being boring).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I typically don't like Mel Brooks films but after hearing others rave about this film over the years I finally decided to rent it. Needless to say I should have followed my instincts. While I enjoy comedy of all types- sophisticated, slapstick, lowbrow and even scatological, I am of the opinion, and I mean no offense to others here, that this film can only be enjoyed if you are about 10 years old. The plot is weak but that can be forgiven as this is suppose to be a silly comedy. But the use of the racial slur joke is overworked and just about any other joke offered up in this film is sophomoric at best, stupid at worst. And while there are a couple of scenes that may bring a smile or a laugh to the viewer, I think most would be better off watching this film for what it is: A bad film that is a showcase for the various supporting Hollywood actors and actresses from about 30 years ago. If you want a western comedy I would recommend renting "Support your local Sheriff" as I think you will probably be disappointed in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for a few scenes, I did not find this movie to be very funny at all, quite contrary to what "everyone" seems to be saying about it. Overall, I found it was in poor taste. Was it funnier to people back in 1974? Yes, I realize that the racism, etc. was poking fun at everyone; I don't think that it was intended to be derogatory to any particular people (except maybe turning the table on white people!); it just wasn't as funny as it was made out to be.Perhaps you just need a crude sense of humour to fully appreciate this movie; If so, then I'm glad I don't appreciate it. There are certainly enough crude, tasteless movies out there to glut the movie industry. I wouldn't say Blazing Saddles is up there on the top of that heap, but I can't say it doesn't suffer the same fate in my book. My family and I wanted our time back after seeing this movie. Hopefully you won't waste yours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all that anyone complains about racism in "Blazing Saddles" -- jokes about race in the movie range from actually satirical to stupid -- there are very few who will call Mel Brooks on his consistent, career-long homophobia. It wasn't funny in "The Producers," it's not funny here. I've always been suspicious of comedians who say that as long as they offend everyone, it's okay. Actually, it's really not. There is a way to use stereotype to examine and question, and there's a way to use it so that it simply makes you sound ignorant. Brooks falls in the latter category in "Blazing Saddles."</fullReview>

Watch Pythons' "Life of Brian", watch "Spinal Tap", watch "Doctor Strangelove", watch Brook's own "Frankenstein Junior".

There are many BETTER films Mel made; like "The Producers", his BEST!!, "High Anxiety", "Silent Movie" &amp; so on. Why is this piece of crap constantly on cable TV or touted on DVD/VHS rental/purchase sites?? To please the dopey rednecks that view it? It is also obviously full of OVER use of the dreaded "N word" &amp; synthesized 'animal abuse', fortunately NOT real but cleverly rehearsed, BUT is the kind of thing that gives redneck 'boys' ideas to carry out in 'real life'. I'm not blaming Mel -- just the constant re-issuing of THIS film &amp; unfortunate 'popularity' that IT &amp; so many other lousy films keep getting that should really tossed into Hollywood's trash compactor.

		<fullReview>First thing: a rare time I'm breaking my own rule with this - wasting my valuable time watching and then reviewing a film I don't like. But it doesn't seem to matter in this case - nearly everybody loves it, I just want to air a definitely minority opinion! Second thing: I give the 1 mark for all the technicians behind the scenes simply doing their jobs and not involved in the "artistic" content of the film itself. Or maybe all those people like me who gritted their teeth to sit through this witless horror to the bitter end.A relentlessly crass and unfunny hour and a half, this was billed from the start as a groundbreaking and original riotous comedy Western - it took me 30 years to temporarily disable my moral firewall to anything by Mel Brooks and his cronies (caused by unfortunately watching that "classic" The Producers in the early '70's) to watch it and find it wasn't. Any scene in the film that appeared to be moving toward genuine humour was instantly swamped with swamp, a mental floss would be handy. To me, it's a sign of the moral emptiness and gullibility of generations of the hype-makers and hype-followers, and a pointer to the future with slime uttered by slimeballs generally masquerading as comedy nowadays. In these enlightened times it's not funny anymore if it's not utterly crude and pushing back the boundaries of acceptable good taste further than the horizon - but what on Earth for except it's easier than working or having talent. I didn't see Brooks or Monty Python or any other succeeding brave and challenging alternative comedian ever try this kind of thing on with Islam (it's safe to continuously attack Christianity though), because their careers would have probably been very short: it's easy for hypocrites to target people who won't hit back forcibly. Rape is a serious subject but so long as Brooks was never raped himself he thought it funny to rape our minds. Unlike most others I don't kid myself: many black people love this film mainly because if they're already racist it can stoke up their hatred of all white people and not just the rednecks shown here; it should be pretty obvious why it appeals to white racists. Many non-racist white people love it partly because they think it shows only racists, sexists, horse-punchers et al in a totally negative way: I got news for everyone whether they're black, white, rich, poor, straight, gay, racist, non-racist, man, woman or beast: it shows everyone and everything in a negative way but especially film itself as an art form. Kick everyone and everything for the Hell of it and it eventually produces Hell. And in the meantime Brooks laughed all the way to the bank, probably wondering just how insulting to his audience he could get without them getting it or understanding how talentless he was. It's nothing to do with being Politically Correct either: to their credit this grim effort would have probably been banned and burned in ye olde un-PC times and the director and production team jailed. It's purely a question of whether or not you can recognise a set of charlatans bombarding you with filth and gutter-humour and whether or not you like your nose rubbed into the metaphorical mire for 90 minutes. By the end of this relentless laughlessfest we are all taken down yet another notch, demeaned whether recognised as such or not. I trust all of the people who think comedy must be as or more offensive as this aren't offended by my opinions.At least Plan 9 was funny in places - even Dumb And Dumber wasn't as bad as this - that was aimed at 10 year olds after all, this was intentionally aimed at the general public and people in particular who dislike all forms of discipline. The only film ever made anywhere in the world (although Pasolini's Salo comes close) I wouldn't lift a finger to save from decomposition, but would give it a one finger salute if that unlikely day ever came.</fullReview>
