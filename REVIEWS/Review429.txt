		<shortDescription>Café Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the 1930s, a young Bronx native moves to Hollywood where he falls in love with the secretary of his powerful uncle, an agent to the stars. after returning to New York he is swept up in the vibrant world of high society nightclub life. Café Society opened this year Cannes Film Festival and is the latest film directed by Woody Allen. It's a story that mixes various parts of the Allen back catalogue to varying degrees of success. A film that wants more than anything to entertain. In many ways Café Society could be said to restate almost all of the key ideas and themes of Woody Allen's films in one way or another: life, chance, fate, love and guilt. It also comes from the movie providing the performances. Jesse Eisenberg is so seamlessly cast as the prototypical Allen protagonist that when the film shift from Allen's voice over to Bobby speaking it feels continuous. Bobby's broken heart has caused him to undergo a Bogartian growing up: from a gauche boy to a mature disillusioned man, trapped in the wrong marriage. Moreover, Kristen Stewart sad eyes, throaty delivery and slightly heartbreaking aura make her almost interesting, ad an easy chemistry between her and her third-time co-star Jesse Eisenberg and he fits perfectly into his role while she simply overflows the screen. But if Café Society is Allen quoting Allen, sometimes literally, at least he's quoting his better bits. Surprise comes from the movie providing the honeyed cinematography by V. Storaro which uses silhouette, graphic compositions and glowing close ups in an often genuinely breathtaking manner. "Life is comedy, but it's one written by a sadistic comedy writer" says Bobby. The comedy writer Allen on display here is more wistful and nostalgic for the very concept of unfulfilled true love, for the heyday of the Hollywood star system, for a New-York of gangsters and back alley craps game and stolen kisses at dawn in Central Park. And all of that nostalgia is okay. Because we were getting pretty nostalgic for the good odd days of warm, witty, fond and funny Woody Allen too. Make no mistake Café Society is still late-period Allen. Men are described in terms of their characters and complications, while women are still described in terms of their beauty and their effect on said men. When Blake Lively's character motherhood becomes the butt of an exchange between two men, about how women who become mothers devote way too much time to their children (and ultimately not enough to their husband); it's a sour note that reminds us that Bad Allen is always there, underneath. Overall, this film is Woody Allen's most charming film since Midnight in Paris and maybe most beautiful to look at, maybe ever. It's a little pretty little reminder of what once was</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That teardrop on the elegant profile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's latest, which opened yesterday in Paris and at the Cannes Festival, is a gentle and thoughtful examination of love. Jesse Eisenberg, best known for his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, plays Bobby, a young New Yorker who heads out to Hollywood in search of an exciting future. He falls for Vonnie (Kristin Stewart of Twilight fame), the secretary of his Uncle Phil (Steve Carell), a successful producer, and is soon confronted with the fact that she has a mysterious lover. The resulting confusion is worthy of Allen's mentor, Anton Chekhov. In an interview in the French magazine l'Obs, Allen remembers his own experience in Hollywood, talking to a producer who cut him off to take a call from Fred Astaire. We soon meet all of the rest of Bobby's family, including a gangster brother and a sister who is married to an intellectual, who offers such wisdom as the quotation, "Live every day like it's your last and some day you'll be right." With brilliant cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and great performances from Eisenberg, Carell and Stewart, the film is one of Allen's most enjoyable in years. The poster features a stylized profile of a woman with a teardrop - love always includes an element of sadness, even as it brings laughter and self-realization. A French review of the Cannes opening compares Allen to Ernst Lubitsch, master of urbane comedies of manners in the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody Allen's weaker projects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot going against this movie. Jesse Eisenberg's character comes off as a complete asshole within 10 minutes of the film, thanks to a really terrible scene between him and a Jewish hooker. None of the humor in that scene landed, which just made the situation really sad and uncomfortable to watch, and then kind of difficult to root for Eisenberg at all after that. Steve Carell isn't bad by any means, but he seems incredibly miscast in a role like this (not to say that he can't act in roles that are more serious, but this Hollywood film executive didn't really suit him). Both of the Dorfman parents come off as really awkward on screen and thus kill any of the jokes that they're meant to deliver. The only actor that gives a notable performance in this movie is Corey Stoll as the brother, but it's not enough. Kristin Stewart was mostly fine, but occasionally started picking up some of her infamous Kristin Stewartisms throughout. Carell and Eisenberg become really close out of nowhere, both of the couples' relationships are sped up by Woody Allen's narration (which doesn't really add anything to this film), and this movie is only 90 minutes long, so I feel as if they could have definitely spent more time with all of these relationships, instead of just having Woody tell us what was happening. And on top of all of this, while this is a beautiful film to look at, there is nothing new in this movie. It's another Woody Allen movie with the same romances and love triangles centered around white people who like jazz with a pretty inconclusive and unsatisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody as we know him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, seeing a Woody Allen movie is like spending an evening with an old friend. It's something to look forward to, because you know each other well and the two of you go back a long time. You know what the conversation topics are going to be, because he has his favourite subjects and lately he seldom talks about anything else. But that's alright, because he knows a lot about those things and is an expert in making nice conversation. Some evenings you spend together are more memorable than others, but it's always nice to see each other.Seeing Café Society was no exception. This was Woody Allen as we know him: jazz music, New York, a socially awkward lead character, jokes about being Jewish, complicated love affairs - all those typical elements were there. The story is not even the most important part of the movie - it's about a love triangle set in 1930's Hollywood and New York, and about people betraying their own ideals only because they get older. It's entertaining, intelligent and elegant cinema. During the years, Woody Allen seems to have perfected his style. He is like a chef with a legendary signature dish: the taste hardly varies, but it's always delicious. Jesse Eisenberg, playing the classic Woody part, and Kristen Stewart as his love interest are adequate. They don't stand out as Cate Blanchett did in Blue Jasmine, but are quite believable as two lovers who ultimately marry the wrong partner. The thirties setting is nice: the way Allen and his cinematographer capture the elegance of the period is a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen rediscovers his winning ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Café Society" (2016 release; 96 min.) brings the story of Bobby Dorfman (played by Jesse Eisenberg). As the movie opens, we are told it's the late 19302, and we see Phil (played by Steve Carell), Bobby's uncle and a powerful Hollywood talent agent, host a party in Beverly Hills. It's not long before Bobby arrives in Hollywood from New York, looking for a new life. Phil asks his secretary Vonnie (played by Kristen Stewart) to show Bobby around the town, and Bobby has an immediate crush on her. Vonnie, though, tells him she's already seeing a journalist, to Bobby's disappointment. At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comment: in life, there are few certainties: taxes, death, and every year a new movie from writer-director Woody Allen. The man delivers his movies like a Swiss watch, and frankly makes them like that too. Here, Allen tackles a topic near and dear to him: a relationship rom-com, set party within Hollywood, and within the Jazz Age. From the first shots, we stand amazed at the picture-perfect camera work, I mean the movie is just eye-candy from start to finish (with much of the West Coast scenes brought in a beautiful orange glow). In this film, Jesse Eisenberg stands in for the Woody Allen character (Allen does provide the frequent voice over, though), and Eisenberg thankfully doesn't try to imitate Allen's stuttering speech that we are used to when Allen played these roles himself back in the day. Steve Carell plays, his role straight up. Kirsten Allen has the toughest role of all, for reasons I don't want to reveal. At times she is great, at times she is a bit wobbly. The two big surprises for me are: Blake Lively, fresh off her winning role in "The Shallows", and here in a very nice supporting role as another possible romantic interest. And the other one is an even smaller role, by Sarri Lennick as Evelyn, Bobby's sister. But truth be told, this movie brings an all-star ensemble performance. With a soundtrack full of jazz music from the 20s and 30s, you know that Allen is in his wheelhouse here. There are at least 4 or 5 Benny Goodman performances, and that's just the beginning. Bottom line: after the head-scratcher that was last year's "Irrational Man" and the so-so "Magic In the Moonlight", Woody Allen has rediscovered his winning ways."Café Society" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was very well attended (as it should be on the opening night of a new Woody Allen flick). Assuming that Woody Allen continues his streak of writing/directing a new movie every year, we will see his 50th movie in 2019. What a momentous occasion that will be. Meanwhile, please enjoy "Café Society", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. "Café Society" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a very romantic look at a moment in time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I myself am a sucker for a movie that gives a take on old school Hollywood and Woody Allen did a beautiful job with Cafe Society.The cinematography on this one did a great job of capturing the feel of 1930s California and New York city. I can't get over how beautiful this thing was shot. A knock out combination of lights setting and music to bring out the mood.And the jazz numbers that lace this flick did just that for setting that beautiful tone Jesse Eisenberg started off a little too much Woody Allen at first (one particular scene in the beginning that acts like a hilarious sketch routine, where Jesse's character Bobby buys a hooker). It did get some getting use to, before it became his own thing.Corey Stoll's character Ben, a though Jew who becomes a night club owner, whole involvement in the film taste like Scorsese light, which only made it even that more interesting. It's a good Woody Allen comedy,but They are all good to me. If you like one you like them all (but I'm more partial to the ones he does not star in, like this one), and it's super impressive he does one of these on annual basis and he's able keep the quality constant.It'a funny film with laugh out loud moments, and very crafty narrative narrated by Allen himself. This movie is just another love letter with the city he loves (and a thoughtful P.S you're OK too California), and makes Woody feel like such a helpless romantic, but that's what makes the movie so good to watch.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=55</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1930's, Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) doesn't want to follow his dad into the not-so-lucrative jewelry biz. Instead, he opts to go to California, where his hotshot agent uncle, Phil (Steve Carrell) may give him a job. Well, its not much of a job, a glorified gopher, but, it has fringe benefits. Ah, that would be meeting Phil's secretary, Vonnie (Kristen Stewart), who has been asked to show Bobby around town. At once, Bobby is smitten. Alas, Vonnie confesses that she has a journalist boyfriend, so, even though Mr. Dorfman and Miss V meet quite often, she establishes boundaries. Bobby is still googly-eyed. One day, however, Vonnie tells Bob that her boyfriend has ended their relationship and Bobby is eager to pursue her. Happiness ensues until Vonnie's boyfriend comes back into the picture. Its Uncle Phil, you see, and he vows to get a divorce. Heartbroken, Bobby moves back to Brooklyn, where he begins to manage a posh café for his brother Ben, a gangster on the sly. The family doesn't know what Ben does, they are just happy Bobby has a job. In time, Bobby meets another beautiful lady, Veronica (Blake Lively) who helps his heart recover. Or is it fully healed? We'll see when Phil and Vonnie, now married, come waltzing into the café! This beautiful, funny and intelligent movie is that latest gift from the one and only Woody Allen. As such, the script is a masterpiece of witty lines and great concepts and the direction flawless. Naturally, Allen also draws outstanding performances from his cast, especially Stewart who shines as the confused Vonnie. The scenery and costumes are above reproach and the look of the film wonderfully lovely. In addition, while the film is funny, it is also bittersweet, so tears may fall. Nevertheless, leave the café pronto and head out to a theater nearest you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic and elegant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the latest Allen's movie is your basic love triangle, set in the 30s and with a small twist. Eisenberg and Stewart play the two young lovers, Bobby and Vonnie, who meet in Hollywood, where Bobby moved from New York.Bobby's uncle, Phil, is a big shot in the movie industry and Bobby is looking for a job. Vonnie is Phil's secretary and part of her job is to make Bobby feel at home. After a few months, Bobby realizes is not happy on the West Coast, but he is in love with Vonnie. Bobby proposes to Vonnie and asks her to move to New York with him. But she has a "secret" lover, who also proposes. Bobby moves back to New York alone, to work in his gangster's brother night club. The denouement of their love story is melancholic.I am not a fan of Stewart, but her part required some aloofness and mystery and she did a good job - whether because she is a good actress or because her range is limited to playing cold and detached I cannot say. Also, the movie offers some classic Allen's punchlines, about life, its meaning or lack thereof. The voice-over did not disturbed me a bit and, as usual, the soundtrack is fabulous. Since I start to feel Allen's nostalgia for the past, this movie fulfilled all my expectations.If you like Allen's movies, you will probably like this one, too. It is nostalgic but not sentimental and elegant in an old-fashioned way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review: Café Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At eighty years young, Woody Allen delivers his forty-sixth (yup, you read that right) feature film with Café Society; a bourbon basked narrative feature showcasing the wonderfully vibrant jazz era of the 1930's, where the magic of the movies is very much alive; nightclubs are bustling with life, traces of the gangster underworld are closer than ever and love is a feeling as whimsical as ever in a parallel tale spanning from Hollywood to New York City.After forty-six films, you would think, with a director and writer as aged as most of our grandparents, the dialogue and writer of such an iconic filmmaker would lose his touch, but Allen proves his newest feature is as fresh, fun and fantastic as could be. Self-aware and self-absorbed as ever, the auteur extraordinaire showcases some of his most subtle and subdued screenplay to date, focusing mostly on performance from his very young cast and indulging in the beauty of a lively era within the very social elite of Hollywood and New York City.Like any good Allen film, the story follows a very unsure and adventurous young man by the name of Bobby Dorfman, played perfectly by the nerdy and always lovable Jesse Eisenberg. Bobby, who has chosen for a change of scenery from his native New York City life, decides to chance life on a whim, and join his highly successful and famed uncle Phil Stern (Steve Carell), a Hollywood agent and grande opportunist for a lavish life in Hollywood. Reluctant to really give his nephew a chance, Uncle Phil caves and leaves Bobby in the hands of his angelic and innocently beautiful secretary and assistant Vonnie, played elegantly by Kristen Stewart. Taken by her beauty at first site, Bobby and Vonnie begin experiencing the city of angels through the eyes of glamour and glitz, essentially discrediting the city and its inhabitants as a whole, and wishing for a life that is half Hollywood, and half urban paradise.As the relationship between Vonnie and Bobby intensifies, despite Vonnie having a secretive relationship with another married man, the two share some of the most memorable meet-cute dates seen this year on screen.The heart of Café Society relies heavily on the relationship and chemistry between Eisenberg and Stewart, who, luckily for audiences, have played love interests twice before in Adventureland and American Ultra. By now, while watching Café Society, one of the most frustrating elements of the film is why the two stars haven't began dating outside of the narrative of the films they star in. Eisenberg's quirk matched with the mysteriousness and nonchalant attitude of Stewart, make the two and quintessential non-Hollywood/Hollywood couple.As life complicates itself, as all matters of the heart do, Bobby soon finds himself back in the big Apple, eventually succumbing to his big brother Ben (Corey Stoll) and managing a somewhat legitimate business in Le Tropical, a nightclub owned by Ben, among other very illegal and gangster business endeavours. Stoll, who dons a full head of hair as the fiery and ruthless gangster brother to Bobby, brings forth the charm and wit he did as Ernest Hemingway in Allen Midnight In Paris. An Allen alum, Stoll provides the film with some of its most expected comedy, yet is pitch-perfect as the tough guy older brother who knows no life other than the life of the streets.Allen, who uses many of the same actors over in his films, Stoll twice, Eisenberg twice, Posey, Sirico and company, relies on his actors to deliver some of his most entertaining, fun and light-hearted material to date. Café Society is a fun, summerlicious filled romantic comedy with perfect instances of quirky dialogue and narrative that uses the beautiful jazz music as a mosaic of forbidden love and second chances.While Café Society may not be the huge commercial success of other summer blockbuster films, the film is easily one of my favourite films of the year, delivering a true cinematically entrancing experience, much like Allen's Midnight In Paris. If there is one thing I would recommend this summer season, its to make sure to watch this film by any means necessary. Café Society proves again that, like many good comedies, most are written by sadistic comedy writers, and while Allen's newest is far from sadistic, the film is an examined portrayal of an era of the golden days of cinema that brings back the golden, and leaves the rust behind. Sure, Allen can be completely self-absorbed with his films, making sure his unique cinematic voice is heard and quirkiness felt wholeheartedly, but, regardless of all that, I absolutely fell in love with this film. And while love is not rational, you fall, and lose control, which is the exact same feeling I had when leaving the cinema for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Caliber Performance by Kristen Stewart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noteworthy intricate and layered performances by the actresses in this ensemble film. The charming Parker Posey, appeared to be the most at home in the '30s. Blake Lively was every bit as titillating as an early era Hollywood bombshell. Jeannie Berlin had arguably her best performance since her role in Margaret (2011). That being said, while Stewart wasn't present in the opening scenes, once she made her grand entrance in this film, no one, and I mean no one, could steal her thunder. The thing that fascinated me most about Stewart's performance in Cafe Society was this was unlike nearly all of her other feature film roles which usually involve a troubled teen/young woman in some sort of rebellious role. Her and Jesse's tender romance was without question the heart of this film. Some imply that she may have been miscast for the role because the way Vonnie dressed, so dainty, the way she spoke, so courteous, the way she conducted herself, so well mannered and the way she embraced Bobby, so delicate. In other words it was an ethereal performance by Stewart. So even if she's not recognized by the Academy for her performance in this, no one can rightfully accuse her of playing "herself", as unfounded as such a remark about her acting really is. There were several scenes where Stewart was stunning. Yet the one that was most breathtaking was the scene where Vonnie was wearing a red dress while conversing with Phil on a lunch date, contemplating whether or not he should leave his wife in order to be with Vonnie.Her role as Vonnie required some range, requiring her to exhibit a full spectrum of emotion, as she started off as innocent and down to earth, one who shunned Hollywood glam, especially evidenced by a flashback scene of when she was first hired to be the secretary of a powerhouse Hollywood talent agent. There was her soul baring expressing of heartache during the break up scenes and compassion during the makeup scenes with Phil and of course the passionate make-out scenes with Bobby, which I would have to say are some of the best romantically intimate scenes of her career.Later in the story, after Vonnie gets married to Phil, she becomes increasingly snobbish and highfalutin as she is seen brown-nosing with Hollywood's elite, living the life of a Hollywood wife/socialite--the life she once previously despised. Along the way Vonnie and Bobby begin to lose their innocence and idealism and became calloused as a result of the affluent, albeit shallow lives they choose to carve out for themselves.Just moments before the screen fades to black near the ending, Phil asks Vonnie why does she have that dreamy look on her face. While Vonnie does not verbally explain why, except for replying, "Dreams are dreams," we the audience who are privy to what she meant, know she's reminiscing about the good times she spent with Bobby. There were other scenes where the feelings Vonnie had for Phil or Bobby were unspoken--yet we knew the inner dialogue that was going on in that pretty little head of hers, without her having to speak a word by means of her facial expressions, namely her eyes which convey so much. If that's not the very definition of subtle and nuanced acting, than I don't know what is. Stewart looked great even in the unforgiving extreme closeup shots and a dreamboat in the soft-focus shots, courtesy of cinematographer extraordinaire Vittoria Storaro. My fave line of this film will have to be a line from Woody Allen's narrator voice over: "And in walked the past." I found it memorable as this was said at the outset of the scene where Stewart is shown entering Cafe Society for the first time during Act 3. Even though Bobby and Vonnie grew apart as they both ended up marrying other people, they were soul mates in the sense that not a day would past where Vonnie and Bobby wouldn't think about each other, as they would even continue to dream about each other. Oh how bittersweet an ending! Powerhouse performance by Kristen Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Late-Period Woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/writer Woody Allen's latest film can be seen as one of his most personal films to date. Dialed to the bright, nostalgic feel of Radio Days (1987), Cafe Society nevertheless reels from an undercurrent of existential authenticity a la Husbands and Wives (1992) poetically and often ruefully addressing the feeling of having lost the road not taken.Our protagonist is young up-and-comer Bobby Dorfman (Eisenberg), a New Yorker, whose dreams of making it in Hollywood rests uneasily over some very scrawny shoulders. At first he's aided by his Uncle Phil (Carell), an agent and powerhouse among the coastal elite. He sets him up as an assistant and script-reader. Bobby's family dutifully keeps tabs on him back in New York as he climbs the slippery ladder of Hollywood's well-to-do, finding friends in Steve (Schneider) and Rad Taylor (Posey) who have a hand in controlling the talent pipeline from coast to coast. His closest friend and eventual paramour however is Vonnie (Stewart) a comparatively down to earth secretary who would rather bask in the glow of the warm sun then in glitzy opulence. He idolizes her, pines for her despite her insistence that she has a boyfriend; an older man as we later find out.Woody Allen himself provides the narration for this gentle nostalgia tour through Golden Age Hollywood. Much like his voice, the film feels warm, familiar if sadly slow and blunted. Lacking the consistently snappy tone of earlier works, Cafe Society leans a little too heavily on the love triangle, which granted, captures some excellent drama but is singed from overcooking. When we are rewarded with the usual delights of Allen's repertoire, it all comes out banal, like a list of axioms repeated one too many times.Yet despite lacking the verbal excitement of Allen's prized filmography, Cafe Society more than delivers in gorgeous cinematography, characterization and themes which are glamorously brought to life by a talented cast. Steve Carell's natural amiability allows us to more easily welter in Phil's more unsavory character decisions which includes having his nephew wait in the waiting room of his office for weeks. He's an agent but he lacks the boorishness of Ari Gold. He believes in what he's selling, and given the way he name- drops by the poolside and the fondness industry insiders seem to have for him, you can tell he's good at what he does. Jesse Eisenberg brings the same frazzled nudnik buoyancy he previously brought to Allen's To Rome with Love (2012). It's easy to see why Eisenberg is a repeated player, the man brings all the trappings of Woody's old characters only with a slightly stronger edge.If there's one standout however it would have to be Kristen Stewart who resists being the flavorless object of affection. Goodness knows it could have been easy given the time period of the film (not to mention her previous role in the Twilight Series (2008-2012)), but her strident autonomy keeps us invested. She's a piece of Citrine amid fool's gold, a girl next door above the ostentatiousness of industry fugazi. A girl to bring home to mamma.Much of Bobby's character develops between the intoxicating glamour of Hollywood and the provocative corruptibility of New York City. The dichotomy has a night and day quality that is mirrored by the earthy Vonnie and the glittering Veronica (Lively) who appears later in the film. Large swaths of the movie take place in the Big Apple, much of which concentrates on the foibles of Bobby's sister (Lennick), brother-in-law (Kunken) and mobster brother (Stoll). Far from being unnecessary asides, these stories aptly meld into the film's large themes: love, respect and regret.With the denseness of a novel and the light touch of Allen's finest, a question the emerges; what is the director trying to tell us through this story? Bobby's balance between the two cities he calls home, mimics Woody Allen's long, illustrious trajectory as a member of the New York intelligentsia and a Hollywood staple. Perhaps he's trying to tell us our problems may seem significant to us and every choice we make means another choice has been deferred, yet in the grand scheme of things, life is ultimately a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Separated lovers live fuller lives but with regret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film ends on a shot of the back of hero Bobby's head, framed by a black proscenium arch, as he pauses in the New Year's Eve celebration at his Manhattan nightclub. The arch reminds us life is theatre. The shot evokes its antithesis at the end of Manhattan: Allen's Alvy Singer's open face as he contemplates his young lover's (Mariel Hemingway as Tracy) departure for study in London and its threat to their romantic future. Of course, the latter shot was itself a replication of/homage to Chaplin's close to City Lights. There the close-up on the tramp's face projects his roiling mix of pride that his beloved blind flower girl can now see and resignation that her vision has dispelled her romantic delusions about him. "Yes, I can see," she admits, dashed. The parallel suggests Cafe Society is an older artist's return to his imaginative past, especially to the romanticism and moral tensions of that 1979 classic. There are other echoes: the golden dusk skyline, the Manhattan-philiac score, the romantic carriage ride in Central Park. The December-June romance here is displaced onto Phil Stern's relationship with his secretary Vonnie, though the nebbish (Isaac there, Bobby here) still finds himself caught unawares in a romantic triangle. The new film is less judgmental: there is no betrayal in the Phil-Vonnie-Bobby triangle, just a collision of genuine loves. (Phil's wife shares the betrayal Yale committed upon his wife and friend Isaac).The back of the head is explicitly inexpressive. What can hair say in the dark? The climactic face shot may be played as inexpressive ? as Rouben Mamoulian instructed Garbo to play her Queen Christina ? but it trusts the audience to read into it the complex of emotions the context provides. The back does that as well. We read into our rear view of Bobby's head the elements we found in Vonnie's face in the preceding scene: a detachment from the hilarity around them, a loving memory of each other and both a regret and a resignation that their choices turned them so dramatically apart. Of course the characters and the bicoastal settings are bridged by the song on the soundtrack, "I'll Take Manhattan," which Bobby did and which Vonnie might now prefer to do. The soundtrack is studded with Rogers and Hart songs. The composers are cited here as having based their careers on the sadness of unrequited love. They "got it right." Here as in Annie Hall art provides a satisfaction and completeness that real life doesn't. The film itself seems a film about film. In the opening lines the Beverly Hills poolside life is described as a supersaturated Technicolor experience. Hence the burnished gold in which 1930's Hollywood is imaged and in the glorious aura of the Hollywood stars, who are constantly named in the dialogue ? without anyone appearing in the story (but some do on film). Their names transcend corporeality. Allen's third-person narration of the film confirms this detachment. We're watching a narrative of supposed life but it's packaged and presented as a story. Allen sounds like an 80- year-old man now, even as Jesse Eisenberg's speech rhythms recall the young Woody. It's an old man's story, an old man's retrospection, in which experience has softened the young man's moral absolutism, softening our judgment of the romantic mistakes and even of the gangsters' murderous criminality, whose victims may sometimes almost deserve their fate. As the erstwhile idealist Bobby points out, "In matters of the heart people do foolish things." And sometimes they prove right ? one way or another ? as the later careers and maturity of Vonnie and Bobby appear to prove. As Vonnie explains, she had good reasons for preferring Phil. Arguably all three found fuller lives as a result. "Alternatives exclude": We can't have everything. We make our choices as the heart and head determine and we live with the consequences. As the Stern matriarch advises, "Live every day as if it's the last and some day you'll be right."Here life doesn't allow for rigid purity. Bobby's early scene with the aspiring prostitute is a knot of impulses and conscientious restraints. The gangster murder scenes seem incongruous in a Woody Allen film but are absorbed into the period and genre contexts of the plot. In Allen's rewrite of Macbeth's "tale told by an idiot," life here is a comedy ? written by a sadistic scriptwriter. In this land of romantic fiction, the Ali Baba Motel is at the intersection of Grace and Yucca. The sacred ever collides with the profane in the land of Hollywood gods and goddesses. In the most pragmatic choice gangster brother Ben converts to Catholicism on the eve of his execution because Jews don't believe in an afterlife. Ben chooses to believe what the situation encourages him to believe. And if Aristotle contended that the unexamined life is not worth living, "the examined life is no bargain either." These are the ruminations of an older man. Essentially this film shows a master artist exulting in the practice of his art. It is masterfully made, rich in nuance and complexity. "The Lady is a Tramp" bridges Phil's dumping of Vonnie and her developing love for Bobby. Vonnie is validated by the song's respect for the irregularities and integrity of its heroine. When the two Exes meet in Bobby's club later, her glib Hollywood chatter and his club-running slick are equally signs of their new lives, new experiences, but only overlays on their essential innocence when they first met and their bond and attraction that survives. Veronica asks Bobby if he was ever unfaithful to her. His pragmatic answer is no. But it may also be true, because a kiss is just a kiss, a treasured lost love is just a treasured lost love, as time and life and art go by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An upbeat young man falls in love with a girl in 1930s Hollywood. 'Cafe society' triumphantly showcases Woody Allen once again at his utter best as he turns the prior statement into a complex study of human emotion filled to the brim with the same depressing realism in conjunction with the light hearted humour that Allen is renowned for. The film combines a perfect balance between cinematography and tone, and the acting brings to life the superb emotive dialogue that is the driving force for the narrative. The 1930s world built by Allen is fantastic as is the chemistry between the two leads Eisenberg and Stewart. Supporting characters are effectively used to develop the story as they contend with real world issues and the existential questions that keep us awake at night. Round of applause once again for Woody Allen who shows once more that he is truly one of the greats of cinema. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step back into the 1930's Cafe Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/Writer/Actor Woody Allen sticks to what he knows best with this nostalgic 1930's intertwining romance. Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and Steve Carell headline as the couples in question, each delivering superb subtle character deliveries that firmly establish the Bronx and old Hollywood atmosphere. Quality character actors themselves Ken Stott (The Hobbit) and Jeannie Berlin (Inherent Vice) are terrific as Eisenberg's (Bobby) quirky NY parents, Parker Posey and Corey Stoll (House of Cards) are almost unrecognizable in their respective outstanding supportive roles, and it's great to see Tony Sirico (The Sopranos) in his brief role. Allen narrates as the older Bobby, enabling Eisenberg to easily take over as the younger man. While the film lacks a quality ending, the Cinematography (Vittorio Storer), Set Decorations (Regina Graves and Nancy Haigh) and Costume (Suzy Benzinger) support the film throughout and should be recognized at Award time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here he goes again. The older man with the younger woman. Through in plenty of anti- Semitic jokes and shake. Out comes another Woody Allen movie. Even he knows he is too old to play the guy who gets the girl and you are reminded of that as he took the part of narrator.The movie looks great with outstanding set design and art direction. The costumes are superb. There is a good use of music.It's a tad long especially when the surprises don't surprise. The narrator introducing a slew of characters in the club toward the end was too much too late. The cast is a bit distracting. Jessie Eisenberg doesn't seem to make the necessary arc from nerd to sophisticated club schmoozer. Steve Carell is Steve Carell not his character.If your a fan you will like this movie. It won't make his ten best list but it is better then most of his more recent world tour movies. The movie is in limited release but plays well with a big audience and is worth seeking out. It will also play well in the comfort of your home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the new film written, directed, and narrated by Woody Allen, actor Jesse Eisenberg gets the Allen role and at times, early in the film, appears to be channeling his klutz persona. But the part requires something more, and Eisenberg delivers that as well. In the 1930s, Bronx-raised Bobby Dorfman (Eisenberg) travels to Hollywood to look for work with his big cheese uncle (Steve Carell). He keeps semi-busy, but mostly falls in love with his uncle's assistant Vonnie (Kristen Stewart). Alas, she says her heart is spoken for, though Bobby gives romancing her an energetic, hopeful shot. Missing New York, Bobby returns to Manhattan to work for his sleazy older brother's new nightclub, which he helps turn into The Place To Be. Bobby becomes a smooth and sophisticated operator in that world. You know he'll meet Vonnie again, though what will happen . . . Eisenberg and Stewart add real substance to these characters, and her performance has been widely, rightly praised. If you like Woody Allen's humor, the scenes with Bobby's parents (Jeannie Berlin and Ken Stott) are classic and hilarious. There's not much story to hold the whole schmear together, but perfect moments of Hollywood hype and Manhattan glitz make it fun to watch. Fantastic score of 1930s jazz, beautiful and atmospheric cinematography, and big dose of nostalgia for a pre-digital age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody's Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen cannot make a quality film every single year. He just can't. But even in his lesser efforts, the movie is always about something, whether it be a dramatic (or comedic) focus on damaged characters or maybe another of his many stabs at existentialism. In the case of "Café Society," I was confused about Woody's intent since the film is not funny, nor is it thought-provoking or really even entertaining.True, we have Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg), another one of Allen's coming-of-age protagonists from New York who brings &#x200e;his youthful na?veté to Hollywood of the 1930s. Bobby commands most of the screen time, but Allen did not infuse Bobby with any endearing or charismatic qualities.For scene after scene, I found the character to be so bland and pointless that I could not root for him. Instead, we just wait for the next moment of plot to come dropping on the character's head while the new-found glamour of Hollywood surrounds him.Further, Allen's scattershot script tries to include his oft-used device of a love triangle, and the one in this film is among his most muddled. We know that Bobby is the type who'll easily succumb to the charms/skirts of his Uncle Phil's secretary Vonnie (Kristen Stewart), and when we find out that Vonnie's boyfriend is really Uncle Phil himself (Steve Carell), we know someone's heart is going to broken by somebody in this trio.But when Allen's script has Phil shifting his love from his wife to Vonnie, then from Vonnie back to his wife, then back to Vonnie again, we ask the question of ... why? It's not made clear to me. Consequently, it's a triangle where no one cares who's paired with who before long. And Carell's portrayal of Phil cannot make him a character we care about, as he is just as yawn-inducing as Bobby.I also kept asking "why" when I saw the story abruptly changing focus to show us Bobby's brother Ben and his gangster ties in New York. In a curious plot deviation, we see Ben assisting with a murder plot of a mean-and-mad next-door neighbor to help two characters in the film, then later going to the electric chair for it. Again, the inclusion of this character feel so randomized, I kept wondering why we are supposed to care.If there's a redeeming quality to this whole mess, it's the film's visual appeal. The costuming, the sets and the cinematography are all Oscar-worthy in their authenticity. Allen clearly was trying to make a piece of nostalgia here, and the LOOK of the film is simply breath-taking.His other attempts to wax nostalgic just don't shine. Yes, we hear a parade of famous names, such as Joan Crawford, Paul Muni, Adolphe Menjou, and Barbara Stanwyck, but there's hardly anything substantive; as if sheer name-dropping by Allen would suffice to create a loving tribute to the 1930s.Allen, at his worst, still makes films that try to do ... something. In other words, Allen does not seek to get rich off his movies by selling the masses the commercialized movie brainlessness that makes billions in box office sales. He genuinely tries to portray ideas, comedics or characters that are worthy of our attention.That's why "Café Society" is completely baffling to me. I know Allen was trying to accomplish something. Very frequently, Woody is out to make a thought-provoking film, no doubt about it.But I don't think the bewilderment that's plaguing my mind are the thoughts he wanted to provoke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen - the 2016 edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few, very few things one can rely on happening every year, since the 1990s. First there is a Christmas ? and yes, also a Passover ? taking place each year. Then, there is the Woody Allen film which is usually released late spring, usually in time for the Cannes festival. The film will be loved by some, hated by other, opinions are always divided. What is as sure as Christmas or Passover happening each year is that the Woody Allen film will not get the Academy Award for the best film or for directing. This is true also in 2016.The yearly production of Woody Allen for 2016 is out. It is called 'Cafe Society' and the story happens in the LA and NYC of the 30s. Young New Yorker Bobby Dorfman lands in Hollywood where the brother of his very Jewish mother is a big film actors agent with even a bigger mouth and marriage of 25 years which he is on the verge of breaking up. The innocent kid soon meets the girl of his dreams who happens to be not available because ? I will stop here to avoid any spoiler, but I would just mention that the whole story is sweet and conventional, full of humor with more or less expected twists, with a nostalgic approach in describing the movie world of the West Coast and the night-clubs scene of New York in the 30s and the Jewish family gathering almost all the stereotypes one expects and loves: the Jewish mother and the unsuccessful father, the womanizing uncle, the Jewish mobster son, and the lefty intellectual son-in-law. Over all this a delicate love story about two people who meet and fall in love, give up to the social conventions and to the accepted criteria of happiness, but deep in their souls cannot be happy, because happiness is what we feel and not what society decides it is. All on superb, nostalgic jazz music in the background taking the front in a couple of key scenes.To some extend the Woody Allen who made this film resembles the heroes of this last film. It's a less daring endeavor than some of the other films that he made in his 70s, for example Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. This is his first film in his 80s, and is a little different, more in a minor tone, with characters, background and themes that do not surprise or even try to surprise. A new stage in his career? 'Cafe Society' seems rather straight forward, but it actually succeeds in creating genuine emotion. Many good actors dream to appear in Allen's movies, this time it's the turn of Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and Steve Carell to deliver fine performances. Woody's voice as a narrator is the only direct personal touch of a film maker that was accused by his detractors so many times to write and direct movies that are too much about himself. With Cafe Society he succeeded not only to make a film about other people's life stories but also to make us care about them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous settings contrast with minimalist, meaningful, age-old plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To get the easy bits out of the way first, "Cafe Society" is utterly stunning visually. While this latest offering from Woody Allen (who directed and wrote, though only appears as a narrator) does not quite shy away from the idea that many people in 1930s America still had Victorian furniture; it mostly recognises how those who could, did take up with the Art Deco style, and there is nothing quite like that. Buildings, telephones, furniture, cars, advertising signs, paintings, exteriors, interiors all celebrate what was, after all, a cohesive trend in art and design well worth celebrating. Add to that as background (and occasionally foreground) music more hummable (and toe-tapping) golden-oldie tunes than you can manage, and occasional allusions to movies of the era (as clips or posters), and one could easily go away with the idea that 1930s California (and even, if to a lesser extent New York) was a cornucopian paradise.Mostly this is so convincing that the paradoxical effect is for occasionally anachronistic elements of decor (and dialogue) to stand out painfully. Audience members find themselves saying "in the 30s, surely not?!" Obviously, Woody Allen is not that unsubtle, and we do at least hear in the dialogue that more people die of broken hearts in Hollywood than tuberculosis. Woody is well aware that this is unlikely to have been true, even there; and, yes indeed, the 30s were associated with TB, and with poverty, and the Depression, none of which are very visible in this film, though admittedly the gangster lifestyle is. However, like so many other films, "Cafe Society" encourages us to regard gangster activity as somehow funny, and indeed this is mostly the effect. Weird a bit, if you think about it, since we know we are laughing at something that is actually serious and ugly.The same goes for yet a further Allen film reference to prostitution, which appears at the start of the film, takes us nowhere much, but is at the same time funny and rather touching. Presumably real-life prostitution is not much like that, most of the time. There is also a rather relaxed reference to drug-taking.Is this film then corrupting or at least bewitching its audience by easy stages? As often, we tread here a narrow line between homage and send-up (to say nothing of criticism). Many of the (mostly rather unpleasant) background characters that narrator-Woody introduces to us represent plausible enough types in past and present worlds, though the very fact that his voice presents them immediately undermines their reality - and their scariness - a bit.Likewise Jewish uncle and nephew played by Steve Carrell and Jesse Eisenberg respectively don't look as if they are to be treated entirely seriously, though the acting of both is - as we would expect from these guys - proficient and persuasive.And this is a comedy, after all, if in fact only just, since it's a familiar-ish and ultimately (fairly) serious matter when the above pair turn out to be in love with the same girl (played with verve by a beautiful Kristen Stewart, whose character comes over as far more lively than the one played by Blake Lively - no, I couldn't quite resist that one...). Stewart and Lively both do a good job here, but the latter holds back (and is only present in a small chunk of the film), so we are conditioned by the makers to see Stewart's character Veronica as Bobby's true desire, as opposed to Lively's other Veronica (yes, it is the same name, and so Allen is again making it fairly easy for us to get a point from life about substitute choices that is well worth getting).Leaving some of the remaining plot (such as it is) under wraps, I will just say that the purpose of the film would seem to be to remind us that those who love more than once (and sometimes even at the same time) often end up living "if only" lives that can be sad and unfulfilling, but also complex and hurtful as an when and if they attempt to live the "if only" bits - for short periods at least - in real life.This is of course about the oldest story in the world, revisited, and - maybe unsurprisingly - Woody Allen has no magic wand on hand to make all the heartache in this film go away. The love entanglements leave nobody very happy, and no amount of superficial glitz and glamour can hide that. It's a strong contrast with 2 ordinary and non-glamorous Jewish couples from Bobby's family back in New York, who moan about their spouses all the time, but stick with them and seem to be content in some real way - with lives that are so much less complicated - and far more decent - than those lived in Hollywood.But, while some of those who got burnt had played with fire, the Jesse Eisenberg character of Bobby - extracted from the aforesaid Jewish families - is initially a total innocent caught up in cynical matters beyond his reach that force him ultimately to mature and become thicker-skinned and worldly-wise. So thick-skinned and wise in fact that he also becomes capable of hurting someone genuinely dear to him, but not quite "her"...Such is "Cafe Society" in all its glory and seriousness. One suspects that it is the latter aspect that most audience-members take home with them (in spite of all the many and varied distractions) - and doubtless that is just what Woody Allen intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, I saw Cafe Society this film was unique and clever and different in many ways the presentation of the film was original but also is an homage to great films of the past as well. filled with an old school 1930's film vibe that feels modern yet dated Cafe Society isn't woody Allen's best but is by no means a bad film. That being said Let's begin My review of Cafe Society, Cafe Society is Written and directed by Woody Allen, and stars Jessie Eisenberg as Bobby Dofferman, Kristen Stewert as Vonnie, Jeanie Berlin as Rose Dofferman, Ken Scott as Marty Dofferman , Stephen Kuken as Leonard, Sherri Lennick as Evelyn, Parker Posey as Rad Taylor, and Finally Steve Carrell as Phil stern. the story is about Bobby Dofferman, Set in the 1930's Woody Allen's bittersweet Romance Cafe society, follows the story of New Yorker bobby Dofferman as he moves to Hollywood and finds love only to find heartbreak. Bobby then moves back to New York to help his brother run his nightclub business but when Bobby moves on what happens when his former love walks back in. This film was filled with Romance, Drama, and comedy and is your typical Woody Allen film slightly dated and a very dry sense of humor, tons of twists and turns on a romantic dramatic but still a comedic journey. This film is the Woody Allen we know and love and it's good to see Woody back in the director's chair. I''m glad this film was good not since 2013's' blue jasmine have I liked a Woody Allen film and that's sad but Cafe Society brings back the Woody Allen of Yesteryear, and I'm glad that his newest film is better than 2014's magic in the moonlight and 2015's Irrational man. now I'm going to start by giving my pro's for this film and then my cons and I'm happy to say the pros do outweigh the cons. However they outweigh them slightly, Now One thing I liked about this film was the cinematography each visual is superbly shot each shot is stunning and the camera work done for this film really adds a special layer to this film. and makes it Another thing I liked about this film was the Acting performances especially the chemistry between Eisenberg and Stewart their chemistry really brings this story to life and their charming performances and unmatched natural chemistry will keep you interested invested and entertained in their love affair throughout. my final pro for this film was the choice of music each song reflect the scene and works perfectly and adds a special touch to what is already a well-done film. it gives the film a sort of old school and dated but cleverly original uniqueness. now for my cons for this film they are few but are critical errors in what could have made the film better had they not made these mistakes. The first problem I have with this film is its pacing is a sort of in-between film its fast in some parts but for the most part slow, and lets the plot develop over time. However, i felt the pacing caused a messy disjointed and lazy and rushed final third act. Another thing I didn't like about this film was its two other side plots focusing on the family, every other scene was the mother and father talking or the brother or the sister and her husband I understand establishing their characters but it isn't and wasn't necessary to give the side character's about the same amount of screen time as are main leads. if you're trying to keep us invested in the bond our main leads are trying to portray. the family element adds to the comedy but took away from the main plot of this film and that was the romance of our two main leads. I feel if the film focused more on our two main leads and showed less of the family, we could have established a deeper connection between the main leads and cared more in the end about their struggles and triumphs of their relationship more. Overall this film is good but never explores its true potential and waters down what ultimately could of have been more. for what we get it's still entertaining and enjoyable and is worth checking out in theaters. I'm giving Cafe Society 7 out of 10Review by Josh Evoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miss the Golden Age of Hollywood when things appeared to be an extended version of The Great Gatsby?Then go see Woody Allen's Cafe Society. Aside from the setting, the cinematography and cast are beautiful.However, if you are not keen on seeing a homage to the 1930's, you are just as well off reading scenes from The Great Gatsby or phoning a few of your older Manhattanite friends. The story will more or less be the same.Woody Allen can't help but be Woody Allen when he makes a film. For most devotees, this is a good thing, especially if you are fan of existential sub-texture and "Allen" alysis. It appears that the main character played by Jesse Eisenberg fits the Allen archetype perfectly, Holden Caufield-esque who makes up for his awkwardness with requisite charm. Eisenberg has become an Allen doppelganger. Kristen Stewart and Blake Lively provide both style and substance and Steve Carrel channels Robin Williams in his ability to combine depth and wit.With the rich cinematography, witty repartee and patented Allen subconsciousness, where Cafe Society lacks the tight story-line, it succeeds as a snapshot. Besides, Allen won over his flock long ago. He knows good laughs and great eye candy are enough to keep us coming back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the ending. OK, as an artwork this was not high art done by a great master whose work belongs in the most prestigious art museum; rather, this is more on the lines of an artistic, beautifully-done, hand-painted postcard to eternity. In the past, I found the lines spoken by all the characters in a Woody Allen film to all sound like Woody Allen speaking. This movie's protagonist did, indeed, sound exactly like Woody Allen but some of the other characters did not. They had characters outside Woody's specific mindset. But they weren't fully-developed characters, just two-dimensional characters as imagined by Woody. They had no lives, thoughts, or reactions of their own, and as such they were flat, near caricatures. But I was OK with this for the reason I expressed in the second sentence above. This movie is a self-contained Woody world. In fact, this reminds me of the 1998 Hirokazu Koreeda movie: "After Life." Instead of someone in purgatory creating a single filmed scene to represent their lives for eternity; while watching "Cafe Society" I was thinking that all Woody Allen movies serve a similar function: Filmed, self-contained, artistic episodes representing the life and thoughts of Woody Allen, and that could last through time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . for U.S. President in 2016, which is not very surprising given that New York Peacocks tend to flock together, especially those prone to marrying their daughters (or chicks their daughter's age). Corey Stoll's "Ben Dorfman" represents Trump in CAFE SOCIETY, while Sari Lennick's "Evelyn" stands in for Hillary. Ben takes the Trumpster's catch phrases "You're Fired!" and "Get 'Em Outta Here!" and runs, as he subjects at least seven agitators to "exreme vetting," after which they're embedded in the concrete foundations of New York City infrastructure projects. Writer/Director Woody is suggesting that it's now time for Real Life Americans to do things the Trumpenstein way, or hit the highway. Nasty people and concrete foundations fit perfectly together in Woody's World. Woody's Ben/Trump realizes that you cannot fix the bridges by just breaking a few legs. Though Evelyn as Hillary instigates some of Trumplestiltskin's hits, she lies and tries to weasel out of any consequences after the fact. Some CAFE SOCIETY viewers may see Woody as also forecasting an electric chair in Donald J.'s future, but such a shocking denouement would be consistent with the Fickle Nature of the American Public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great Woody here but not enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life is a comedy written by a sadistic comedy writer." Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg) No one has ever accused Woody Allen of being sadistic, but as he warms over themes and tropes from his other comedies for Café Society, he is beginning to be downright cynical about his work if not a bit so about humanity.It's Depression-era Woodman, jazz in the background, partly in LA and NYC, wardrobes and backgrounds bathed in a glow that replicates my nostalgic impression of an era past and some obscure references for those younger than I. After all, can you expect most millennials to know who Joan Crawford and Adolph Menjou are? The pop-cult actors of the period referenced throughout are just too many.Agreed, Uncle Phil (Steve Carell), a Hollywood mogul, must deal with stars all day, but for 96 min. references to them are to be expected. Phil and his nephew, Bobby, who as a greenhorn from NYC comes to work for uncle in Hollywood, are both in love with Vonnie (Kristen Stewart), Phil's secretary. She has more glamour than most of the stars appearing on Woody's screen (exception: Blake Lively as Bobby's wife is every bit a star).I love Allen's nostalgic pieces, most notably the wistfully romantic Midnight in Paris, whose imaginative conceit of visiting the '20's at Midnight is magical, as opposed to the expected glamour of the sets and costumes of Café Society. Even having Bobby in white tux managing a famous nightclub when his former love Vonnie comes in on the arm of her famous husband, Phil, doesn't provide any of the crisp dialogue and smoldering romance Casablanca had.Although it's not fair to compare any film with that classic, the comparison is instructive about what Café Society lacks.Hardly magical or imaginative is the basic plot of a triangle that includes the usually diffident Bobby, whose naiveté is understandable given his youthfulness. Yet no new ground is covered despite the comedic possibilities of uncle and nephew vying for the same young lady.At times Allen has witty lines like the one at the beginning of this essay and this exchange between Bobby's mom and dad: "I accept death, but under protest," Dad says. "Protest to who?" Mom retorts. However, those gems are too few, at least given the rich Allen films that precede this one. His nostalgic comedy makes me nostalgic for him in better films.</fullReview>

My curiosity was rewarded for about half of the film, whence the narrative flies across the country and lands back in....New York.Still, it's beguiling enough to see glimpses of L.A. in its "golden age" even in passing. (I recognized the Chinese theater and felt absurdly elated.) The photogenic California light has also been lovingly rendered, and used to impart the characters with the dreamy glow of being young and in love. Indeed, in love with two persons at the same time, as is the fate that befalls Vonnie once she meets the new L.A. émigré called Bobby who is the nephew of her boss.Kristen Stewart- Vonnie- has come a long way since the days when she was stuck playing a vampire or something in an earlier film. Strangely expressionless and distant there (I could watch a mere 10 minutes), here she is all life- from her hypnotic green eyes to her intriguingly raspy voice. Well done, Stewart, I must say. She offset the almost-annoying facial tics and rushed speech of her second admirer, the naive Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg who will forever remain Mark Zuckerberg in my head) to a good degree.So who is the other man Vonnie loves? He's married with children, much older, and is rich and influential in Hollywood. Ergo, complications abound. Due to which, Bobby runs back to New York. And this is where it struck me that the sense of place is central to these characters. Bobby loves New York. He can never be 'at home' anywhere but there, and thus is able to readily flee L.A. and heartbreak... even if going back home means he's had to grow up very quickly and transform himself into something altogether different from his L.A. self.Read the rest of the review at https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g? blogID=12118878&amp;pli=1#editor/target=post;postID=5895031821594559617; onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=0;src=postnam e</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so, so woody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if this had been done by anyone else, it would have been heralded as a masterpiece. sadly, it's by woody allen and thereby held up to higher standards. it's unfortunate, really, because it is not a bad film. it's mediocre. the ny crowd I saw it with laughed at all the old jokes and there was a smattering of applause at the end. the plot is about love lost and gangsters who get their due. a bad taste lingers where satisfaction should be. the actors, as always are at their best. jesse is a nice surprise as the lead, and corey stoll, as his brother, almost steals the show. Kristen stewart is perfect as the girl and parker posey (queen of the independents) is her usual excellent self. the set up can only lead to a downer end and that's what we get. even so, half mast woody is better than most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is classic and looks unoriginal at first sight. But don't worry this movie shines and proves itself worthy of your money and time. The acting is good, Kristen Stewart proves once again that she shouldn't be judged solely on the twilight movies. The image is mesmerizing! This movie is beautifully shot and incredibly directed and executed. Woody Allen didn't lose his touch yet. The rather simple plot make this movie easy to follow. On the other hand the writing is strong. All in all, this is a gorgeous movie, be sure to check it out. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can always count on Allen to give us a great time at the movies, a time with substance, humor, insight, and with his predilection for the 20's and 30's, he is able to put together living images, full of sounds and sights that might otherwise never see. It's one thing to look at a black and white photograph of the period, to listen to a famous song of the period, to read about the tales of a Hollywood that has since changed quite a bit. It's a great experience to see "Cafe Society" a movie made with true affection and talent about a very important part of our history and society.A young and naive man moves to Los Angeles, trying to forge a future with the help of his uncle, a famous and successful Hollywood producer. He is dazzled by the display of opulence and sophistication. Men and women wearing the most expensive and colorful designs of the era, showing us how that particular set lives. It's exotic, distant, foreign, and he knows it. He doesn't surrender to its charms. Instead, he falls for a secretary at the studio, and his life is now more complicated than ever.In typical Allen fashion, there are many clever remarks, ethnic references, great jokes, and some philosophical moments. He gets almost everything right with his young cast: Eisenberg and Stewart are perfect in their roles and have great chemistry. Carrell, Lively, and Stoll do great work.Allen has mixed gangster and love before. He takes a lighter road here and makes everything funnier. Still, the relationships are complicated, and the results a bit complex. It's another world, perfectly recreated, a great tribute by a great film maker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie quite enjoyable and just as good, if not better, than many of Woody Allen's recent offerings. The plot is fairly interesting. The sets, cars, locations and costumes are 1930's perfection, often filmed in a golden, nostalgic light. Kristin Stewart is very natural and believable as the girlfriend. Many of the other actors are interesting to watch and excellent in their roles. Jesse Eisenberg, while doing a competent job, is not terribly interesting to watch. His lines are those that Woody Allen would have had if he were starring in this movie, but he is not as amusing to look at as Allen. And his delivery just does not come off as very funny, even though the lines are funny in themselves. Allen should find a more humorous surrogate. But it is definitely worth watching on a big screen, especially for any Woody Allen fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a light-sadistic comedy, you could say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a given by this point but after how many dozens of Woody Allen films there is a relative tier system, the 'major' and 'minor' works by a man who has written/directed so many that some almost argue are too many in number. In this sliding scale, Cafe Society is... a very good minor work. It's not necessarily very 'major', or is it particularly underrated in the scope of the critics - it carries a 75% rating on RT which is significantly higher than last year's actually underrated Irrational Man - but within the sandbox that he works in, he does what he does and it's funny and light and even just a touch affecting. Not to 'Manhattan' levels surely, but close.It's a story of Hollywood and (in some smaller part) gangsters, glamour and romance, and the romance part is given the most attention as this is basically a light romantic comedy with some more thoughtful elements. Nothing is especially dark here in the story of Bobby Dorfman (Eisenberg, who seems like he was specially created from Woody Allen Chia-Pet seeds in a lab to be the Woody-esque lead in a Woody Allen movie), who comes to Hollywood in the 'Golden' age of the 30's to get work from his uncle Phil (Carrell), and meets his secretary Vonnie (Kristen Stewart, making it the third time this screen couple's together so their chemistry is perfect).It becomes kind of a love triangle of course - the perennial story of the "Friend Zone" done in Woody's approach as Vonnie is really with Phil and Bobby being in love with Vonnie and her being love with him AND Phil and when will uncle and nephew know what the other has (maybe with a touch of The Apartment too, for good measure, though I may just be reading into it that way) - and set in the backdrop of 30's period Hollywood and 30's period New York; in the sub-plot, as much as it is (which is kind of, well, light) Corey Stoll is Eisenberg's brother, a gangster who rises to power as a tough guy and gets one of those nightclubs that we always think of from the movies, especially in the 1930's and in other period settings. But this isn't so much a Midnight in Paris scenario where the famous figures appearing is part of the running gag (there are plenty of names dropped, more to set us in here and give raging movie geeks something to go 'yeah, ooh, ahh'), nor is it quite Bullets Over Broadway, where the gangster setting really added to the story.There are some things about Stoll's character that do come into play in the film, especially in the third act, but he's relegated to the "B" plot line which is a shame since Stoll is so wonderful in the role and does as much as he can with it (noticeable wig and all). The movie really belongs to Eisenberg and Stewart and Carrell (and later Blake Lively has a small role that works enough as it can), and it is what it is: a story of love being confused around all the sides, and then when a decision is made and third act kicks into gear the 'what if' of it all between Bobby and Vonnie becomes more of the focus. I liked that part of it, what is not said being shown with these two young people who do love each other and like each other's energy but, of course, the world as it is and what Hollywood and New York and respective other lovers have to offer gets in the way. Or the old "the heart wants what it wants" logic of other Allen movies coming back around.So it it terribly original? No. But I found myself laughing through chunks of it - not through all, but enough - and some of it through jokes about Judaism which I thought by now I would have had enough of through nearly 50 years of Woody flicks. He still has great lines and sharp wit, and by now, in his 80th year, there is a slightly more mature look at what relationships have to offer for people or what people settle for, and it's regardless of period or not. Adding to all of this is the technical side of Vittorio Storaro, the master Italian cinematographer behind many of Bertolucci's and Beatty's directed films and Apocalypse Now, who a) gets Woody to shoot digitally and... it works, especially for scenes meant for very low light by candle or other means, and b) gets the camera to move, often, and this is a nice change from some (not all) films by this director which can be static and with long takes. The movement's refreshing and aside from that all of the locations and the whole nightclub and different places in Hollywood are gorgeous... which is all part of the point, isn't it?It's a movie that could be comfortable back in the 30s, maybe with Lubitsch writing/directing (again, Wilder connection comes through), and Woody's got a top shelf cast to work with. If only there was more time for Stoll and his story, thrown in more-so as a slight, running gag and to have excuses for 'gangster' moments like throwing people into holes to cover up with cement and things like that, maybe it would be even more complete. So it's not any huge "Return to Form", though by this point what form would this filmmaker have to return to? He makes what he makes and we can either take em or leave em. I take this one mostly happily, with a few reservations, especially with the year as it's been it makes for some good, well-written escapism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Woody's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely loved this! I've always really liked Woody Allen's stuff, and call me crazy, I really think this is up there with Annie Hall. This is definitely one of his best movies for me.I wasn't expecting to love this film as much as I did, but it was just great. Jesse Eisenberg is kind of channeling Woody Allen in this (which I don't mind at all), but brings enough of himself to the character that it doesn't just feel like a "Woody Allen type". Him and Kristen Stewart have amazing chemistry, and he also has great chemistry with Blake Lively. The whole cast is just fantastic. If I had one problem with casting, it'd be Steve Carell. He just seems a bit miscast in the role, and this is coming from a big Steve Carell fan. That role needed someone like Alec Baldwin. I really think this has got to be Woody Allen's most beautifully shot film next to Manhattan. It's just stunning. Allen completely captures the glamour of 1930's Hollywood, from the nostalgic cinematography to the production design. It was really an experience.I think this is one of his best written films in a long time. There's a lot going on in the screenplay, and while some may find it a bit convoluted, I think there was just so much to enjoy. The main love triangle storyline was compelling, and I found the gangster subplot to be incredibly entertaining. I also seem to think this is one of Woody Allen's funniest films in a LONG time, which is surprising considering the fact that this film doesn't focus on the laughs. I'm honestly surprised this is considered lightweight Woody Allen, because this film honestly is one of his best. I loved it. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Society, Low Benefits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Not top-tier Allen, but worth seeing nevertheless.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: In 1930's Hollywood, a slightly neurotic boy falls in love with a pretty girl, but their romance hits a few bumps.JIM'S REVIEW: The prolific Woody Allen dips into his nostalgic bag of tricks once again as he creates his 52nd directed film, Café Society. He tells the story of Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg), a nice Jewish boy escaping his lower class roots and looking to meet the elite and further his less than stellar career. So he is off to Hollywood with hopes of fame and fortune. Under the tutelage of his rich and ruthless Uncle Phil (Steve Carrell), a top studio bigwig who has a secret or two, he falls head over heels in love with Phil's secretary, Vonnie (Kristen Stewart) with a secret or two also.That is the set-up, a predictable formula that Mr. Allen and other screenwriters have used and re-used time and time again. In this movie, the end results remain effective but keep the filmmaker in safe territory, while his script lacks genuine structure and narrative skill. Some characters are fully drawn while others are in need of development. Some scenes are spot-on, others are spotty and never build to any degree of importance. (A scene with Allen's standard heart of gold prostitute, well played by Anna Camp, adds nothing to the plot and makes no sense in this movie...maybe in Mighty Aphrodite or To Rome With Love....but not in this film. It's as if the director/ screenwriter gets confused with too many ideas in need of editing.)And speaking of Allen's other film works... Raiding his own film arsenal, to create this movie, he gingerly takes the format and era of his Radio Days and smears it with Broadway Danny Rose, with a generous helping of Crimes and Misdemeanors and a dollop of Bullets Over Broadway. Originality gives way to familiarity in Mr. Allen's latest offering.The acting is also unbalanced, with some actors well cast and others unable to find their characters. In the lead, Mr. Eisenberg becomes Allen's surrogate player and he is perfect for this role, although the actor plays up more of the dramatic aspects than the comedy. He is the heart of the film and the actor holds one's attention throughout the film. The opposite can be said of his leading lady. Kristen Stewart as his love interest and she fails to make her character convincing. The actress brings a modern sensibility and toughness that ill-fits her role. There is fine support from Corey Stoll as Ben, Bobby's gangster brother, Sari Lennick as his whining but loving sister, Steven Kunken as her moral spouse, and Blake Lively as Veronica, another woman in Bobby's life. Jeannie Berlin plays Rose, Bobby's's shrewish mother, and she is a delight, providing much of the comedy with Ken Stott a fine foil as her henpecked husband, Marty. Parker Posey doesn't have much to do with her minor role and Steve Carell is rather bland as the self-absorbed and never happy Hollywood agent.Perhaps the film's major strength is on a technical level. Café Society may be one of Mr. Allen's best looking films to date, with luscious photography by Vittorio Storaro whose rich vibrant hues and beautiful compositions enhance the film tremendously, lovely period costumes by Suzy Benzinger, and simply terrific set designs by Santo Loquasto. The film is awash in high society glitz. These details capture the 30's era with wit and style, more than the director offers with his episodic screenplay. It is his script that needs some careful rewriting. His premise still intrigues even if his dialog never sounds real. Mr. Allen seems to be more interested in finding a funny zinger or two than creating complex characters and conversations that advance his plot. (Still, Allen, the director creates some strong images and his film does has some memorable moments. One scene involving Seder is classic Allen and his ending has a nice bittersweet spin.)Café Society is diverting enough entertainment, but its rag-to-riches tale is slightly tattered around the glossy edges.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful looking delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful story of Jesse and Kristen's characters repeatedly crossing paths over the course of several years. He falls for her, and she appears to fall for him also, or is she just a social ladder climber? They part ways, only to cross paths again several years later, and they wonder if they've married the wrong partner, and if it's possible to simultaneously love two people. They both end up living different types of glamorous lives, which is better is a matter of ones opinion, but might have been happier together.There is not much resolution to the characters' stories, just showing us a couple of chapters of their life stories, still being written, and we unexpectedly, abruptly finish just past the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve- a new start, a new chapter in their lives? I was left wanting more, but that was doubtlessly the point.Beautiful wardrobe, sets, and cinematography, with occasionally dust, or a feather or something fluttering in front of the camera, giving it an ethereal, calming feeling.Jesse Eisenberg's character has a great arc: he shows complete awkwardness toward the call girl in the first scenes, but shows, after his experiences with Stewart, a bit more suave finesse when trying to seduce Blake Lively, during their first meeting.A delightful, beautiful film I look forward to watching again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same themes, different era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. 80 year old Woody Allen continues to amaze with his proclivity to crank out a movie every year. With such movie abundance comes the inevitable hit and miss conversations. Of course, there are those who have never had a taste for his work and another group who have sworn off his films due to the headlines from his personal life. Still, as a filmmaker, his work is usually good for some analysis and debate.This time out, Woody's story is set in the 1930's and it revolves around a young man from the Bronx who heads to Hollywood in hopes of making something of himself. Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg) is the typical on screen alter-ego for Mr. Allen and displays many of the physical and personality traits we have come to expect. It's a perfect fit for Eisenberg. Bobby's naivety takes a beating as he assumes a gofer job under his Uncle Phil (Steve Carell), a power broker agent to the stars. Things really get juicy when Phil directs his secretary Vonnie (Kristen Stewart) to show the local sites to Bobby. As the two youngsters grow closer, Vonnie must choose between the romantic idealism of Bobby, and the luxuries afforded by her older boyfriend (guess who??).Allen revisits many (if not all) of his familiar themes: religion and the afterlife, misfit relationships, Los Angeles vs New York, jazz, older man/younger woman, and one of his favorites ? "what's the point?" This time he also throws in a nostalgic look at Hollywood by name-dropping some famous stars of the era, but he's just as quick to flash his lack of respect for the movie industry and seems to compare it to the world of east coast gangsters (such as Bobby's brother played by Corey Stoll.This is Mr. Allen's first digital movie, and it's his first time to work with legendary cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (3 time Oscar winner for Apocalypse Now, Reds, The Last Emperor). The golden hue and low-level lighting provide a nostalgic feel and warmth to the scenes ? even when the characters themselves aren't so cuddly. Excellent set design and costumes add to the beautiful and classy look of the movie. As always, Allen is working with a deep cast ? this one includes Sheryl Lee, Anna Camp, Parker Posey, Paul Schneider, Blake Lively, Jeannine Berlin and Ken Stott."Life is a comedy ? written by a sadistic comedy writer." It's the perfect Woody Allen line and we get the feeling he actually believes it. Heard here as a somewhat emotionless narrator, Mr. Allen makes it clear that Bobby's character (with no apparent skills) is a fish out of water in L.A, but thrives in nightclub management once he returns to the beloved NYC. Bobby's adventure hardens the young man, while he maintains the mushy core of first love that Woody so adores. Toss in a love triangle and little respect for the women characters, and we end up with a movie that feels like a movie about Woody Allen movies.</fullReview>

But, and this pains me to say, this movie was terrible, just awful: way too long, insipid script, a story line that went nowhere except in circles, Jesse Eisenberg doing a very bad Allen imitation, and the "romance" between him and Kristen Stewart had about as much electricity as sitting in a ballpark during a rain deluge and watching the infield turn to mud. And worst of all, it was painfully, painfully BORING.But the sets were absolutely gorgeous.Sad to say it, but this has to be his last film.

		<shortDescription>Cafe Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Café Society is an incredibly shot period piece from Woody Allen, or Monsieur Woody, as the French lovingly refer to him. It's a period piece that is set in the 1930s, in the Bronx and Hollywood. It follows the story of Bobby Dorfman after he comes out to La La Land to try to work for his uncle, hot-shot agent to the stars, Phil Stern. Jesse Eisenberg acts the role of Bobby and Steve Carell plays Phil. Jeannie Berlin and Ken Stott (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey) play minor roles as Bobby's parents, Rose and Marty. Corey Stoll (House of Cards) and Sari Lennick round out the members of the Dorfman family, playing Bobby's brother and sister, Ben &amp; Evelyn. Cafe Society is certainly a period drama depicting the glamorous life of a Hollywood agent in the 30s, but it's also a family drama as well which portrays the life of Jewish family doing their damnedest to make it in the Bronx. Much can be said about the ensemble of talented actors that Woody assembled for this film, particularly that all of them were able to do very well with minimal material/screen time. Anna Camp, who plays a prostitute named Candy, comes to mind when she highlights a funny scene with Eisenberg. Parker Posey is convincing and amusing, in her role as Rad Taylor. Blake Lively supplies her Hollywood looks fittingly, as Veronica, who provides quite the catch-of-a-rebound for protagonist, Bobby. But, it's (surprisingly?) Kristen Stewart, as Vonnie, who has probably the most important role in the movie, as the juggled back and forth love interest of Bobby and his uncle, Phil. She delivers a rather stellar performance, portraying the vulnerabilities of a young secretary who's pursued by her much older boss, as well as sort of a delicate feline-like toying with naivete of new-to-Hollywood Bobby. She's really quite keen.Some criticism has been laid on Woody for not trying to venture out of his comfort zone on this latest effort, and there is some merit to that, but if you go into Cafe Society hoping to be entertained for 90 minutes by a film that is a flashback to a different time in New York City and Hollywood, with a healthy serving of humor and wonderful sets, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just don't expect to see the most realistic plot resolutions.http://reelpopcorn.blogspot.fr/2016/07/cafe-society.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen using his old formula again :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's my review of Woody Allen's latest film, #CafeSociety starring #KristenStewart and #JesseEisenberg and let me just put it this way, this is a very Woody Allen film. There really is nothing new here, if you've seen Woody's films in the past, you've pretty much seen CAFE SOCIETY and for some, that probably means good because you get what you're expecting to see, but to some, Woody's usual order of championing infidelity wrapped in a dish full of rom-com may seem a bit too exhausted.The story is set in 1930s, a young Bronx native named Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg) moves to Hollywood to work for his uncle, Phil Stern, who is a film mogul, an agent to the stars. Stern's secretary, Vonnie (Kristen Stewart) agrees to show Bobby around town, get him adjusted to the glamorous life as he starts networking with the who's who of tinseltown. It doesn't take long for Bobby to develop feelings for Vonnie who is actually already in a secretive and forbidden relationship. This leads to heartbreak which then leads to Bobby returning to New York where he finds life as a family man while running a high society nightclub he inherited from his gangster brother.Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy CAFE SOCIETY, I suppose I fall under the category of those who are kinda glad to be getting what we're expecting to see. And yes, big reason is because I'm a fan of Kristen Stewart who just looks so cute and luminous in this film, every time she steps in, she immediately lights up the room, no wonder Jesse Eisenberg's Bobby has that look on his face, like he wants to just eat her up. I don't know how, perhaps it's the costume or the makeup, but the film does a good job of making her glow. But back to the film itself, it has a jazzy tone, very fast paced, it's very situational as well. It's elegant and charming mostly because the focus on Hollywood's golden age is front and center. And the contrast between that place and New York is quite amusing. At times the film even feels like watching "Family Guy" in that it often cuts to moments that either try to explain the characters or try to give that one two seconds of hilarity in between. The actors aren't really given enough for them to further explore their characters but it's clear that that was never the film's intention. Can CAFE SOCIETY sit among Woody Allen's best works of all-time? Probably not. This is definitely not "Blue Jasmine." But I tell ya, again and again, from one film to the next, Woody just loves preaching the same sermon of.. if your spouse if fine but doesn't rock your world, it's OK to venture out, the grass may indeed be greener on the other side anyway. So the question is whether or not you're OK with that sermon.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Allen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had a difficult relationship with Woody Allen. His movies are low key, usually romantic stories and I like that. I like his style as well, it's laid back and colorful even though it's also full of conflict and weird situations. The last years of his career he has perfected his cinematography and sense of atmosphere. Just like all Woody Allen movies from the last 10 years, Café Society is loaded with atmosphere. That's the best thing about it. The cinematography and atmosphere alone makes this very watchable. And yet I either love or hate most of Allen's movies. This one I love and hate at the same time, so it's somewhere in between. The difference in this love/hate relationship for me is in the casting. When he succeeds in casting the right actors in the right roles and when the actors succeed in showing some chemistry on the screen his movies are some of the greatest ever made. But more often then not he fails because it's romantic and character based, that's the difference between an utter failure and a classic. I don't care what ages the characters have but I need to be able to believe that they are in love. Obviously. And yet Allen continuously chooses to cast actors that aren't very good to begin with. Actors that simply don't come off as natural. He used to act in his own movies and he is a terrible and annoying actor and an annoying character. Now Jesse Eisenberg has taken his place and he's not that much better. Eisenberg is simply not a very good actor. He always does the same nervous character in every movie, and I don't even believe his performance. He really should be doing something else. Kristen Stewart, I still believe she can be a decent actress when cast in the right role but she hasn't found it yet. Her eyes always look lazy/bored/annoyed with the world, I'm not sure. But in any case, she does not have any chemistry with either Eisenberg or Steve Carell. Steve Carrell is decent enough as he usually is but no chemistry. So in short this is a review of Café Society and Woody Allen as a whole: Atmosphere dripping from the screen and a decent story but terrible casting makes, or in this case breaks the experience.</fullReview>

Another critic; The main character Bobby who was acted by Jesse Eisenberg, is in speech impediment! Unlike the talkative characters in previous Woody Allen movies, Bobby is suffering from minimalist dialogues. His speech is limited with only necessary dialog to open the scenario. No humour, no philosophical messages, no wisdom. So its not realistic for him to act a charismatic club manager or a lover who steals women heart! Hand salutes of Bobby with club guests like a teenage sportsmen is not sufficient! I have a doubt that the depth of 'Blue Jasmine' is fading!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Acting and Sluggish Pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see a lot of reviews on here about how fantastic Stewart was in this movie. While I like that she is trying to diversify her acting portfolio, she is pretty atrocious in this film. It felt like watching a rebellious Gothic teen being forced to wear a pretty pink dress for her aunt's wedding. She had no idea how to play the role, whether that be her fault or Allen's poor direction. Some of the delivery was so awful I physically cringed at the screen.Eisenberg was fine doing his usual schtick, but nothing special. Carell wasn't fantastic either, but he showed that he seemed to be really comfortable in his role and his character was very believable, something I can't say for Stewart. All the other performances were minor roles, so there wasn't anything that stood out. I might describe Lively's performance as "very good" though.As for the movie itself, it wasn't engaging. Near the end, I found myself checking my watch. The story is relatively interesting but you never reach a climax. It kind of just tells about a series of some-what interesting events and then it ends. You don't care about any of the characters because of lack of development as well as because you never feel like something serious could happen to them. There are few real dilemmas, but those few don't really feel that important. You don't really care what happens. For a positive, I will say that some of the cinematography was very good. You will want to be in the New York and Hollywood portrayed in the film.In the end, I'd recommend skipping this and just rewatching one of Woody's greats like Midnight in Paris.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Usual rehash of Woody Allen Older man-Younger woman imbroglio still proves entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not easy to write one full-length screenplay so when Woody Allen churns out missives year after year, one cannot fail to be impressed. Although it's guaranteed that his stories feature the usual Woody Allen recycled themes (older man-younger woman imbroglio is always at the top of the list), there's usually enough variation to keep us interested, and Cafe Society, his latest "paean" to 1930s New York City and Hollywood high society, is no exception. Allen's protagonist is Bobby Dorfman, with Jesse Eisenberg adroitly filling in for Woody as the nebbishy nephew of a high-powered Hollywood talent agent, Phil, played by Steve Carrell in a non-comic role. At the behest of Rose, Bobby and Phil's nagging Jewish mother, Phil agrees to help Bobby find a job after he arrives in Hollywood, no longer enamored working in his father's jewelry business back in New York City.When Bobby first arrives in Hollywood, he has second thoughts engaging a first-time prostitute whom he's just hired to come over to his apartment. It establishes the character as a reluctant actor in the rapacious Hollywood universe but the joke of Bobby's indecision goes on for a little too long.Soon Phil hires Bobby as his gofer and he begins to learn the ins and outs of what the movie business is all about. Allen makes it quite clear at the outset (as he's always done) that Hollywood is a shallow place indeed. Phil is perhaps the epitome of all the superficiality with his constant name-dropping of legendary Holloywood luminaries. Unfortunately, with all that name-dropping, Allen spends little time developing Phil as a multi-dimensional character.Still, Allen serves up enough of an engaging plot at this point to keep us interested. First Bobby falls for Uncle Phil's secretary, Vonny, played by a miscast Kristen Stewart. She's forced to utter a mouthful of Allen's anachronistic lines and comes off as a sophisticated liberated woman of our own era rather than perhaps a 1930s ingenue. Nonetheless, there's a nice plot twist afoot when it's revealed that the married Uncle Phil has been having a torrid affair with Vonny for about a year. Allen neatly has Bobby uncover the affair by discovering a letter from Rudolph Valentino which Vonny gave to Phil as a gift. Vonny had told Bobby about the letter earlier but indicated she had given it to a made- up boyfriend, in an attempt to hide Phil's identity.Bobby's decision to return to NYC after Vonny's chooses Phil over him, marks the break into the second half of act two, after the midpoint. He ends up running a successful nightclub owned by his brother Ben, a confirmed gangster. Allen plays Ben's machinations for laughs. There are never any consequences for a long time as Ben disposes of various rivals by shooting them and then having his thugs dispose of them under newly minted slabs of concrete. It's also curious how the overly naive Bobby never notices what his brother is up to, and how Allen fails to delve into the nuances of Ben's sinister but appealing personality.Still, Ben's fate--and the family's reaction to it--proves to be far more interesting than the resolution of the Bobby-Vonny romance plot. First there's Allen's brilliant portrait of the security guard neighbor who upsets Bobby's sister Evelyn (he's a delicious hothead) who ends up as Ben's next victim after Evelyn fails to realize what Ben is capable of.There's also a slew of clever jokes between Evelyn and her pacifist husband over the morality of Ben's actions as well as the lack of God's presence in human affairs between Bobby's quarreling parents. Ben's decision to convert to Christianity as he faces the electric chair also proves to be the source of some mirth.Allen can't resist some additional name-dropping (this time entirely fictional) as he catalogs scions of upper crust NY society. Beyond that, Allen runs out of further requisite bon mots, when he wraps up the Café Society plot. Vonny's return to New York triggers nostalgia for old times between her and Bobby after they're both now married. Now attending New Year's Eve parties on separate coasts, they simply acknowledge, in their own minds, regrets for love's loss. It's hardly much of a slam bang ending and the lugubrious finale masks the real need for something a little more clever when it comes to the denouement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy Meets Girl/Glamour/Hollywood/NYC comedy????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen's latest film CAFE SOCIETY is another lightweight effort by the Director, who feels that he has to put out a new second-rate movie every year. I am sick of Allen's Jewish jokes; his quips walk a tightrope, often falling into the net of anti-semitism. Jesse Eisenberg might be a smart guy in "real life," but he made a bad decision to be involved with CAFE SOCIETY. The character he plays is whiningly predictable, and Eisenberg is unable to give heft to an undeveloped role. The often terrific actress - Kristen Stewart whose gorgeous expressive eyes can usually make me a captive audience, tried her best, but could not pull this one out of the pool of mediocrity.No one is given a chance to act because the screenplay is so love-at-first sight/older man falls for younger woman/infatuation with tawdry glamorous trappings - clichés that the characters who are paper thin can be upended by a whisper.And I only giggled once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a mystique surrounding Woody Allen movies which at times bestows undeserved acclaim on them. "Cafe Society" is a nice story that is heavy on the romance, light on the comedy. It has some signature Allen touches he has used in previous pictures. It is a period piece set in the mid 30's and centers around a nice Jewish boy from a typical New York Jewish family who goes to Hollywood and falls in love with a gentile girl. Several songs from the era play in the background, and, of course, everyone wears old-fashioned clothes and rides in old-fashioned cars.I had the feeling that if another name appeared as the director, this picture would have sunk without a trace. Nothing really wrong with it, it just lacks any real rooting interest to capture your undivided attention. Kristen Stewart never looked better and Jesse Eisenberg is, uh, a work in progress. And Blake Lively looked stunning. I just wish the story had more bite to it, for lack of a better word.There are lots of worse ways to spend 95 minutes so from that standpoint it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad Shadow of Better Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Cafe Society, Allen rips off earlier, finer films to create a Reader's Digest condensed version of an era he loves. But his heart doesn't seem to be in this one. Everything in the film has been done better, and by Allen himself. He narrates this piece in the vein of his "Radio Days," but it's a desultory performance - as if he's reading it off the page cold, with no preparation. Jesse Eisenberg as the Allen-surrogate does a great job with the look and sound of the character, but he rushes through his dialogue, tossing aside his quips with no timing or relish, so any laughs are lost. Kristen Stewart is completely lost in a period piece, looking like she wandered in from the 21st century, her lack of personality a black hole sucking in the film around it. By comparison, Blake Lively does a marvelous job of creating a woman of the era, but her role is little more than a cameo. Wasted in their roles are Corey Stoll, Parker Posey and Steve Carell - all of them reined in so tightly that they have little opportunity to shine (though Posey makes the most of her limited opportunities). The mob aspects pale next to those of "Bullets Over Broadway," the seder scene can't compare to the version he gave us in "Crimes and Misdemeanors," the New Year's Eve sequence doesn't come close to its predecessor in "Radio Days" - although Stephen Kunkel's turn as Leonard runs a close second to Max Von Sydow's similar character in "Hannah and Her Sisters." Allen has revisited past works before, but never successfully. His "Match Point" - lauded by many - is nevertheless a minimalist version of the much finer "Crimes and Misdemeanors." The man needs a new topic - he may not tire of this nebbish-gets-the-model fantasy, but we do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allen's poorer tendencies harm what could have been a very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty typical for current-period Woody Allen, Café Society feels rushed and incomplete. It also feels like it could have been one of his best had it went through a couple of revisions. Or not been a Woody Allen movie. Jesse Eisenberg might have been excellent in the lead had he not been saddled with the having to impersonate Allen thing. That, along with some very clunky dialogue, especially in the first half, harmed the movie irreparably for me. Too bad, because there's a lot of great stuff here. The story is very good, and it actually has some nice emotion behind it. Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart are wonderful together, and the romance is deeply felt. The basic story is a love triangle with Eisenberg and Steve Carell, his uncle, both falling in love with Stewart, Carell's secretary. The setting is 1930s Hollywood, at least in the first half. The Hollywood setting is a bit of a tease, though, since it leads to little but uninteresting name dropping (which is actually plot relevant, but gets annoying pretty quickly). The second half, which takes place in New York City, is much better, I think. Blake Lively may have given my favorite performance in the film. Stewart is in fine form, though. Really luminous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More stale whimsy from Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen continues to tread water and cannibalize (Radio Days, Bullets Over Broadway, Manhattan etc.) with his latest release, the incredibly trite Cafe Society. Once again it is star studded and has a fine polished look but the story line is limp, the leads dull, the denouement a slight variation on at least a half dozen other Allen films. In essence, nothing new to see here. Bronx born Bobby Doorman (Jesse Eisenberg) heads off to Hollywood to seek employment from his successful movie business uncle Phil Stern (Steve Carell). He hires him as a gopher and Bobby becomes involved with Stern's secretary, Vonnie (Kristin Stewart). The only problem is Stern is having an affair with her and wants to leave his wife but he cannot muster the courage. Bobby meanwhile falls in love with her but finding his position in Hollywood untenable moves back to New York to help run his mobster brother run a nightclub.With it's slim familiar story line and near lifeless performances out of Eisenberg and Stewart, Cafe Society depends heavily on its look to to give this film a pulse. Allen's hired the best in Vittorio Storaro to lens and it shows as he attempts to give Woody the same era feel he gave Bertolucci in The Conformist but unlike that masterpiece, Cafe Society lacks substance, drama and for a supposed sophisticated comedy any degree of depth. It's just Woody running his cast of stock characters reprising roles, from the past at us amid impeccable set design and it has gotten very old. Allen also narrates in a voice that only confirms the creakiness of this vehicle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but totally forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is typical Woody Allen: light and lighthearted, with just a touch of bitterness, a smile now and then.....that's all you get from the movie, enjoyable but totally forgettable; as many of Allen's movies, it leaves you with nothing. Café Society, with Storaro's help, looks very slick, every image is studied and polished with obsessive care, almost manneristic, and it falls often times into affectation. What keeps up the movie are the decent performances by the strong cast, and the as usually good dialogues. As a last remark: I found rather annoying having a narrator as voice over all along the movie, which by the way was rather unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey Mr Allen, did you just robbed me and all other viewers? Who hired these ''actors"??? I mean the three young ''stars'' that play in this awful film of yours... Stewart, Eisenberg and Lively... These people don't and can't act. Didn't u know? Never gonna watch any films of yours again. Cause it wasn't just the three stooges you hired- probably without even trying them first- it was also your movie's awful script. Please stop torturing philosophy and us innocent viewers. You just don't get it OK? And by the way, psychoanalysis can do no miracles, its not religion. So stop torturing us with your never ending story of self pity and sarcasm. We don't care. There is nothing interesting there, never has been and never will be. Do yourself a favor and only write about other people from now on. So then maybe, you can actually say something worthwhile. p.s. don't try to "educate" us anymore through endless and clueless dialogue and quotes of the wise. you're not doing documentary and you don't have that charisma. after all, cinema is all about feelings and emotions, so then try movi-e-ng us...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F. It is a complete failure. Hands down, the worst film he's ever made. Embarrassing. Pathetic. 713 cinematic clichés strung together almost at random, many of them ones he himself coined 40 years ago. Here are the same jokes perpetrating Jewish stereotypes, harping mothers, facial characteristics, Spinoza, waffling intellectuals, the same unattainable romantic ingenues falling unbelievably for a schlep (two in this case), the same pristine crowd-free dusky Manhattan skylines, now visible perhaps only in three locations if a filmmaking permit is granted, the same madcap scenes thrown in to distract from a weak, predictable story to keep you awake at Woody's arthritic nostalgia party, the same visually untranslatable but wholly textual old jokes. Here is Jesse Eisenberg looking almost - and sounding exactly - like a young Woody, a mannered performance, no doubt another of the director's self-worshipping tongue-in- cheek inside-seeking jokes. If that doesn't work, there's Woody himself opening the film and interrupting it every so often in a weary, zombie-like voice-over sounding oddly like Al Sharpton to explain to the viewer the point of what his writing and editing is incapable of realizing. Poor Woody has become a senile old man playing chopsticks on an out-of-tune piano, trapped in his own legend and incapable of a single new idea. If you remember Woody's great films, do yourself a big favor and don't see this: it'll be almost impossible to remember him well afterwards. It's sad to see great artists - and there are others - compulsively make fools of themselves late in life. Someone needs to rescue his dignity from his overpowering myopia, or he may crash into the mirror and cut himself badly. Allen's strong suit has never been self-awareness, only self- consciousness. Here is a film that surely almost everyone over 70 living within two blocks of East 70th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan can relate to. There must be dozens. Think Grandpa in Depends crashing your teenage daughter's pajama party.</fullReview>
