		<shortDescription>If you only see one film this century...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got a hold of the 'Sunrise' DVD, which is only available in English-speaking America (for free) by buying three titles of the excellent Fox Studio Classics line and sending in proofs of purchase. I urge everyone to get this DVD either by sending your three coupons to the promotion or by dealing with someone in the province of Québec since it appears to be the only place in North America where this contest is void and one can buy it directly off the shelf.I have heard about 'Sunrise' all my life but the closest I ever got to see a part of it was, as a quote, in Martin Scorsese's 2-DVD made-for-the-BBC lecture with illustrations 'A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies' (1995). Nobody told me the following:It is a pioneering, overwhelming piece of cinema that still manages to move me (ME!) after I thought I had seen everything. It is a profoundly human film which made me cry for 15 minutes solid in its first part (a reconciliation scene that has to be seen to be believed). This film has more special effects than Terminator 3, all in the service of a thoroughly poetic, bucolic, pastoral, personal, contemplative, idiosyncratic, lyrical, late romantic and expressionist vision of humanity. Its love story, poignant and comic elements have inspired, in no specific order, René Clair ('Le Million'), Jean Vigo ('L'Atalante', 'Zéro de conduite'), Charlie Chaplin (all his subsequent films), Fellini ('La Strada', 'Nights of Cabiria') and even James Cameron ('Titanic').The camera is extremely mobile (more so than in most of today's films, except maybe The Matrix) and the acting is superb. I finally understand why Janet Gaynor was such a big star and a big deal in her time. Her co-star George O'Brien would be hunk-o-rama of the month at the box office today if he was still around. Margaret Livingston (who she?) is also quite realistic as a believably enticing city girl vamp (of modest means) who tries to lure the hero away from his deserving wife.The DVD has more extras than a Criterion issue, including a tentative reconstruction of Murnau's missing American masterpiece 'The Four Devils' (a circus love story) and the entire shooting scripts of both 'Sunrise' and 'The Four Devils'.'Sunrise' is presented with two soundtracks: the original (mono) Movietone (i.e. optical track) anonymous composite soundtrack cobbled together from several sources (think Wagner's Siegfried Idyll) and a newly written and recorded (stereo) score with all-original themes, that closely follows the original in spirit but not in melody.Both soundtracks try to add an intimate, poetic dimension to the film, which is subtitled 'A Song of Two Humans'. The music is an integral part of the experience as the film is conceived as a tone poem and, as such (my theory) is a kind of transcription for the masses of Schoenberg's 1900 string ensemble tone poem 'Verklärte Nacht' (Transfigured Night), a late-Romantic/early expressionist attempt to describe musically the 'truly profound and authentic' relationship between a man and a woman who have problems (the music follows a poem of the era).Both soundtracks succeed admirably, my preference going to the new one, despite the original's polish, historical value and magnificent preservation. And that would be because, although in the silent era there was no stigma attached to accompanying silent movies with a score made up of public domain and rather recognizable pieces, as long as they fit the mood, times have changed ('2001, A Space Odyssey' notwithstanding) and this practice is more distracting than anything for a contemporary, moderately educated spectator.Murnau had very highbrow ambitions but his film is totally clear and populist and made to reach the widest popular audience thanks to the incredible sums of money and artistry that Fox poured in the project. 20th Century Fox basically imported a genius from Germany, gave him a ton of money and told him: 'Make us a movie that will be the most prestigious ever made in this town and that will win us the first Oscar'. And that's just what he did!Needless to say, that was a long time before Rupert Murdoch took over the Fox Corporation...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some film critics disagreed in the late fifties, giving the nod to Murnau's equally brilliant "Last Laugh," this in my view is the crowning achievement of the German genius. Many polls rank it as the greatest silent film ever made and many rank it very high on the all time list of great movies.The plot is melodramatic, the acting in places heavy handed, and the action seemingly non-existent, at least in the eyes of the "Terminator 3" generation,yet "Sunrise" is so captivating a film that it can be watched over and over again and deliver the same punch every time. In fact, like the other greats,including "Citizen Kane," you can probably get something new out of "Sunrise" every time you watch it, no matter how many times you watch.Murnau takes barren sets and dark, hallow rooms and turns them into treasure troves of lighting and nuance. He creates something as simple as a railway depot or a big traffic intersection and makes it a story all by itself."Sunrise" stands today as one of the most visually fascinating films ever made. Murnau's cinematographers, Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, got an Oscar for their work and surely deserved it. Janet Gaynor won the Best Actress award for her body of work that also included "Seventh Heaven" and also richly deserved the prize. Her face expresses her inner emotions so perfectly that some of her scenes are achingly beautiful.And the film itself received an academy award for "Most unique and artistic production," an award never given out again, maybe because no picture could live up to the standard set by "Sunrise."The new DVD version being marketed on the quiet by Fox is marvelous, with a wonderfully restored print that seems just as bright today as it must have in late 1927 when the film was released. The DVD includes an interesting commentary option by cinematographer John Baily and no film is better suited for this, since it tells its story brilliantly with pictures alone, so the commentary option is not a distraction.One of the great tragedies of the cinema in my view is that few people alive today have seen "Sunrise." They have no idea what they are missing. This one ranks among the five best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Of The Silent Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the silent era, especially the German expressionist films, and I would have to say that although there are many great silent films-- Metropolis, Pandora's Box, The Wind, etc.-- this film is my favorite. I feel that it is Murnau's greatest film. While it does not have the social implications of his films such as "Nosferatu" or "Faust," the cinematography, acting, and Murnau's unabashed belief in the power of love helps this film to rise above the rest.The acting is sterling, with a 21-year-old Janet Gaynor looking incredibly similar to Drew Barrymore, and delivering a layered performance that reveals her character's strong but tenuous emotional state. I suspect that George O'Brien wasn't exactly what Murnau wanted for his lead actor, due to the lengths that Murnau went to to extract O'Brien's performance, but credit is due the actor for a performance which was brave at times and never ego-centric. Murnau's use of symbolism and metaphor are suppressed compared to the standards of his other films. In this film their use is more to augment the story rather than actually being the story under the narrative. One example is the fish nets waving the wind as O'Brien returns home from his tryst with the dark seductress, a terrific metaphor for his entrapment and helplessness.The story itself is one that can appeal to many audiences, as it has its fair share of melodrama, comedy, sap, and suspense. I saw this film with my 17-year-old nephew, who is your typical disaffected digital generation teenager, and he was awful quiet during the dramatic sequences and awful loud during the comic portions. It is amazing how I my own emotions were manipulated by the film without Murnau ever being manipulative or obvious.The true star of this film, of course, is the cinematography. It is simply awesome. I have done a lot of work with old film cameras, and I have no clue how Strauss managed some of the shots he did. Murnau was one of the first directors, if not the first, to use camera motion during a film. This was no small feat in the days where the camera was not motorized and had to be hand-cranked. The camera movement is amazing. There is a shot where O'Brien moves through the swamp, with wet, muddy, and uneven ground, to meet the woman from the city, and the camera tracks along with him. It looks like a steadicam shot! No track could have performed this shot as it exists, and I have no explanation on how he did this other than that he must have suspended the camera from the ceiling of the studio. Shooting a swamp scene with fog and a full moon in a studio is a feat in itself. There are also other feats of cinematography. There are several shots where the city is the typical cardboard cutout, there are people milling around in the street, yet the trains and trolleys are obviously models. HOW????? If you are able to get the DVD with the cinematography commentary, it is well worth the investment.To the king of the silents... 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Artistic Masterpiece &amp; Also A Joy To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies that fully deserves all the raves that it gets. Some movies are artistic masterpieces more to be admired than enjoyed, leaving the viewer feeling a little distant; other movies can be enjoyable and satisfying to watch, but with obvious artistic defects. "Sunrise" is a nearly perfect movie that is impressive in every detail, and it is also a joy to watch, offering moments of suspense and tension and other moments of humor and humanity.The story provides a very thoughtful look at the importance and the fragile nature of human relationships. Janet Gaynor is wonderful as the wife - she is always believable, endearing, and completely sympathetic. George O'Brien is also good as the husband, and both of their performances are enhanced by director Murnau's use of their body language. There are also many minor touches in the settings and action that help guide the story and the mood, and it is all complemented by some fine camera work. The first time you watch the film, your attention is fixed on the leading couple, as you hope against hope that things will work out all right for them. Repeated viewings reveal many of the other fine details that make everything work so well.The movie also has plenty of variety and a masterful structure. The first part and the last part are tense and full of suspense, but they sandwich a very enjoyable series of lighter vignettes in the middle, which make a perfect complement both to the story and to the tone of the movie.It is very difficult these days to track down this movie, which is a real shame, and even when you do find it you generally have to make do with a rather fuzzy or defective print. But it is well worth the trouble, and "Sunrise" is highly recommended to any silent film fan or to anyone who can appreciate a movie made the way that movies ought to be made. It is not only one of the great masterpieces of the silent era, but is as good a film as any made since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of redemption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Murnau work comes from the end of the silent era,and the miracle is that it needs nothing:it has everything.There are hardly a dozen of subtitles for a ninety- minute movie,and that's enough.The rest is the actors'sublime performances and Murnau's flawless directing. George O' Brien and Janet Gaynor do not speak,and however,we can hear them,with all our heart ,with all our soul.Their faces reflect what they endure,suffer and enjoy.Because this is not only a drama.Sometimes it turns to a true comedy.For me the scene in the church climaxes the work:the husband,desperate to a fault,and his wife ,who saw her sincere love atrociously betrayed ,"get marry" again and the priest's words will drive you to tears.Unlike "Nosferatu",which took place in dark places ,and before "tabu" which would be an hymn to the nature -in every sense of the word,and probably the key to WF Murnau's entire canon"-,"Sunrise" is a diurnal movie,beginning with a meeting with the husband and his mistress at the break of dawn,and ending in the deep of the night,but the very last picture brings back sunrise,which epitomizes a new beginning, a new christening,a redemption.And the man ,crying and begging for pardon,it might be Murnau who thought his homosexuality was a crime -Nosferatu might be a metaphor as well,as the hero who abducts a priestess he's in love with in "tabu" -A true auteur opens up in his movies,if we can read between the lines.Murnau was,along with Fritz Lang,one of the two most influential forces of the expressionism .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bittersweet symphony of life and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the movie starts properly, Sunrise professes that life is sometimes bitter and sometimes sweet, and that is exactly what this film is; a bittersweet symphony of life and love. Flamboyant German director, F.W. Murnau directs this film with a great love and precision, his direction in the movie is flawless. Sunrise features very little story cards, and it almost totally told with just visuals and music. This is a testament to Murnau's talent for storytelling; to portray a story without dialogue is something that all silent films have to do, but to tell a story without many story cards either is something that many directors would struggle to do. The music in Sunrise is simply sublime; it fits what's going on in the film to a tee, and also succeeds in making the visuals' power more potent. Sunrise is a groundbreaking film, some of the techniques used by Murnau to tell his story are amazing, especially for the time. Techniques such as his use of flashback have had a major impact on cinema as a whole.And the film isn't just a technical marvel either; there is more than enough substance here. The plot isn't massively substantial, but it's the subtext that is important. It follows the story of a man who, tempted by a woman from the city, gets talked into murdering his wife. Him and his wife used to be madly in love, described by their maid as 'being like children', but the love has since stagnated and so the man is easily taken in by an offer from a beautiful to move to the city. However, when it comes to doing the act; he can't do, and so the film moves into following the two falling back into love. Like life itself, the film is never plain sailing and that seems to be it's central message, along with the fact that love is more powerful than anything that life can throw at you. And those are welcome messages in any film, especially one as brilliant as this.Overall, Sunrise is a masterpiece. It easily ranks as one of the best, and most important silent films ever made and it is as brilliantly technically as it is on the substance front. A must see for all fans of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime, beautiful silent romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put simply, not only the greatest silent film ever made, but one of the 10-15 perfect films. Sunrise, to me, is the definitive moment in silent cinema. Not only is sound unnecessary, but so are words -- indeed, there are remarkably few title cards. Instead, Murnau trusts in the ability of his images to convey his story; he doesn't need words. The story itself is simple, archetypal. It functions primarily as a frame onto which Murnau fastens scene after scene of breathtaking splendor. In particular, the first shots of the City are dizzyingly complex and layered. Additionally, it's impossible to come away unimpressed by the Storm which tosses the characters during their return journey. Murnau is one of the few filmmakers, and perhaps the first, to truly embrace the possibilities of film as its own medium, rather than as a novelty or, alternatively, a convenient way to preserve a stage play. Though he is better remembered for other films, most particularly Nosferatu, Sunrise is his crowning achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no words. This is cinema. This is not a story, this is not a plot. This is THE STORY, this is THE PLOT. Murnau can describe the human beings, the men, the women and the fast blind society. The woman of the city seems to be a post-modern nosferatu. She is a vampire, she moves like Dracula, she is like a witch around a tree. This film holds the tragedy and the comedy, the laughing and the crying. "Sunrise" doesn't belong to the past, but It belongs to the story, to the time. Sunrise, yes...the sunrise of the modern cinema waiting for "Citizen Kane".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie at the library the other day and I had to rent it after being aware for the longest time that it's the highest film on the Sight &amp; Sound list that I have not seen yet. After seeing it, can I say that it deserves its honor? ? I would say so, it's the polar opposite of modern film and that gets my interest since it reveals so much that cinema has gained and lost in 75 years. It tells a simple story while getting the most out of my reaction?as opposed to movies that utilize technology, over character and story development, even though this is a movie that has time to be showy and flashy with its beautiful city sequences. After seeing Abel Gance's Napoleon, a film from the same era, I would consider this movie on par for its technical angle, which I think is half the selling point for the critic's circles. It employs a magic realism that you will not find in any modern film today, a movie where you don't care if it takes them a minute to travel from the forest to the city?.</fullReview>

In the famous wedding scene, O'Brien breaks down in tears in front of his wife when he remembers back to the vow he took with his wife.Sunrise is one of the last great silent films that is filled with so many wonderful moments which helped it win the first and only Academy Award for Best Silent Film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of two humans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUNRISE is easily the greatest film made in the silent era. Murnau's story (or filmed poem, according to the credits) is about a troubled farmer (George O'Brien) and his secret girlfriend (Margaret Livingston) plotting to murder his wife (Janet Gaynor, possibly the sweetest, most likable adult character in film history!) The storyline, the dark, moody photography, the creepy sets (especially that swamp!) makes you think this will be a thriller with an unhappy ending, much like AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY. About half-way through the film, Murnau pulls such a daring 180 degree turn with his film, you'll shake your head, and will love it. I doubt film-makers today would try for such a daring move!It is shame that Murnau died middle aged in 1931. Had he of lived another 30 years, and made films up until the age of Cinemascope, looser censorship, 60's technology, what great films we would have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Universal Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In that first year of the Academy Awards when for the only time players were nominated for their whole body of work that came out in that period rather than for one particular performance, Janet Gaynor was so honored with the Best Actress Award. Besides Sunrise Gaynor was also acknowledged in the award for her work in Seventh Heaven and Street Angel.But in Sunrise has any lasting importance it is because it is the most honored work of German director F.W. Murnau who succumbed to the lure of Hollywood and created this film as his first American production. Murnau did only four more films and died in 1931 prematurely in a car crash. Being a gay man, I'm sure he would not have found the atmosphere of the Nazi controlled cinema that would come to his native country very shortly. Unlike Emil Jannings who returned to Germany because of his language problems here in America with the coming of sound and who liked the new Germany, Murnau would not have found a producer like Joseph Goebbels very congenial.There is no hint of the nationality of the leads George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor or the rest of the cast. It was deliberately so, I believe as Murnau was trying for a universal story about true love and virtue triumphing. Gaynor in both the silent and talking cinema nearly always played women of rural background as she is here. Her husband O'Brien is having a tough go on the farm and falls prey to a silent screen seductress played by Margaret Livingston. Her advice to just kill the wife and run off with her is met with horror. But it does prey on O'Brien's mind. Gaynor senses something wrong and becomes afraid of her husband for a time.The story is a simple one, but the cinematography is mesmerizing. In fact Sunrise won another Oscar, the first awarded for best cinematography. The images created by Murnau of the city, especially the fair where Gaynor and O'Brien rekindle their romance will stay with you. And Sunrise has good special effects, especially the flood sequence.George O'Brien was a popular leading man in the sound and early talking era. He first gained attention in John Ford's classic silent western, The Iron Horse. As the Thirties progressed he went down in popularity and was doing mostly B westerns. Ford always kept him in mind though, you might remember him as Captain Collingwood in Fort Apache and post commander Major Allshard in She Wore A Yellow Ribbon. He was also a foolhardy Colonel who gets killed by the renegade Cheyenne in Cheyenne Autumn which was his farewell film. I was interested in the fact that Murnau made very little use in this film of subtitles, fewer here than in most silents. He preferred to let his cinematography tell the story.And it's a beautifully told tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't care much for silent films, but this one impressed and touched me. There were a couple things that bugged me just a bit, like the husband's apparently dismissable propensity towards violence, but I won't go into detail about that because someone already mentioned it. The director was skillful and his sense of visual style was nice, especially in the shot from inside the barn where the husband opens the door, and beyond it, the fog is shown passing by some wooden wheels in the background outside, and also the scene where the woman describes the city as they lay in the grass, while above them, superimposed shots moving down streets are shown. The most powerful thing about this movie, however, was Janet Gaynor's performance. She was sweet, and touchingly innocent, but not in a gratuitous, annoying kind of way that tries to sloppily, unskillfully and patronizingly manipulate the emotions of the viewer. My heart ached for her as she joyfully prepared to go out boating for the day with her increasingly distant husband, not knowing what was really in store for her, and afterwards when she'd had her heart broken by the devastating realization that he had almost murdered her. The loving look on her face, slowly melting away as she began to sense something was very wrong during the scene in which her husband rows away from shore was a powerful one for me, and an example of the acting skill that won her the Best Actress Oscar.George O'Brian's performance was good as well, especially when he was overcome with guilt. But did anyone else besides me think he moved a lot like Frankenstein's monster in certain parts? Not to say that it was any detriment to his performance however, since the movies with those stereotypical Frankenstein portrayals came later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its influence is seemingly endless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunrise is a masterpiece, and its influence shines through in many later films. A couple come to mind very powerfully: Vigo's L'Atalante, another story about a couple who find each other, lose each other, and find each other again against the backdrop of a kaleidoscopic city; and Fleming's The Wizard of Oz, which has a similar conceptual framing - starting with monochromatic rural setting, moving to dazzling, dreamlike fantasy metropolis, and then back to a new dawn in the old rural setting. (I guess that means Janet Gaynor is Dorothy, George O'Brien is the Scarecrow, the city folk are the Munchkins, and the Woman from the City is the Wicked Witch of the West. But then, one can go too far with this kind of thing!) There are certainly more, and why not? Sunrise is a perfect example of what silent movies did so often and talkies seem to have to work like crazy to squeeze out: The illusion that one is entering a wonderful dream world. Escape, in other words, in the very best sense.O'Brien was a big star for Fox in the 1920s, and several of his other firms are worth looking up as well (there's one I forget the name of where he plays a boxer). Gaynor is beyond perfect for her part, and in 1927-28, when she won the Oscar, she really must have seemed like the most powerful screen presence in Hollywood. I recently saw her in Street Angel, which was made about the same time, and she's equally superb in a quite different role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of the silent era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as the silent era was drawing to a close, F.W.Murnau made his American debut with Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. Simple in plot, Sunrise speaks to all of us in a powerful way. Its deep and meaningful subject matter ponders the universal human emotions common to all mankind; the need for love, companionship and happiness. This gives Sunrise a timeless quality, as its message reflects a certain truth in every one of us, no matter how old or young. The dialogue in this film is scarce, but this makes the film all the more powerful, as its messages are delivered through images rather than words. Our deepest emotions are not ones we can voice or explain, they must be felt. Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien emulate this in a brilliant and believable way.Sunrise is also a visually stunning film. Without the story behind it, the photography stands alone as a wonderful display full of beautiful scenes and images. Many of the camera techniques used in the film were avant garde for the time and set a new foundation of film-making for future directors to build on. The tracking camera movements that appear in many of the films sequences created new found levels of depth and vastness, setting a precedent for the future.This film, probably the magnum opus of Murnau, underlines the great loss the world suffered when he died in a car crash when he was only 41. Like all the great minds who die young, there is no knowing what they would have gone on to achieve. However what we do know, is that this film will always be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. (Sunrise was voted the 7th best film of all time by The BFI in 2002)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man and woman live on a farm in the European countryside and live a happy life, until a woman from the city comes and destroys the paradise the married couple enjoy, which leads to financial stress for the farm and isolates the man and woman. During a romantic romp at night, the city woman suggests to the man that he sell his farm and come with her to the city. When he asks what would happen to his wife, the city woman suggests that she could die in an "unfortunate boating accident". The man has his doubts, but is so infatuated with the city woman, he reluctantly agrees. The next day, the man and woman go rowing across the lake to town, while the man plans the murder, but when it comes to the exact time to push her over the side, he loses his nerve, scaring the heck out of his wife, who runs as fast and far from the man she can when they anchor. When they reach the city, the man pleads with his wife to not be afraid of her, but breaks down and admits his stupidity while observing a wedding (symbolic for renewing their own vows). The couple enjoy the rest of the day in the city, ending it sailing back home. The couple however get caught in a terrible storm, and the couple becomes separated, leaving the man searching for his wife, hoping she's not lost at sea. Perhaps the city woman got her wish after all. There is not one excuse ever for someone not to watch this film, which contains some of the most brilliant directing and cinematography ever. O'Brien, Gaynor, and Livingston are so natural in their roles, you swear it wasn't acting. Murnau was an absolute genius creating a film which is touching, emotional, suspenseful, and humorous throughout, with such beautiful and memorable imagery. An absolute treat for every viewer. Rating, 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunrise is that rare thing, a film that is equally technically and emotionally astonishing, with neither of those elements detracting from one another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My pick for the greatest silent film ever made, SUNRISE is an unassailable film masterpiece. It is one of those rare, rare films that are valuable on both an artistic/technical level and an emotional level. Murnau's use of the camera here is astonishing- over 80 years later I still cannot think of a director (well, maybe Welles in CITIZEN KANE)that has used the camera with such inspiration.The film is brilliant in all aspects while framed around a deceptively simple, fable-like story. A married Country man (George O'Brien, never more handsome)is lured into an affair with a Hedonistic, black-bobbed, threatening City vamp (Margaret Livingston), who tempts him into killing his angelic, blonde, innocent Wife (Janet Gaynor, a deserving Academy-Award Best Actress winner for this role and two others in the same year). However, he has a change of mind at the crucial moment (attempting to drown his terrified wife in a small boat)and realises his true, undying love for the woman who he took his marriage vows with.It is a story told in so many films before and since...but Murnau's vision here is remarkable. He combines the lurid Expressionism of his years (see NOSFERATU) in Germany with the pastoral American style of D.W Griffith's old-fashioned melodramas to unique effect. I've never seen a film that is so beautifully shot and composed as this one-and the new DVD transfer renders it even more exquisite-looking.However, Murnau's exciting, innovative camera movements and placements do not jar the film's emotional power one bit. Gaynor and O'Brien's acting combines beautifully, and their reconciliation scenes in the City (where the couple re-discover their affection for each other) rank as some of the most powerfully, yet sensitively, emotional acting scenes on record. Yet everyone scene is amazing- and Livingston's femme fatale (her bob pre-dating Louise Brooks by one year!) is equally unforgettable as the ultimate dark temptress, a sort of female Dracula who threatens to drain O'Brien's soul.Scenes of potential tragedy (O'Brien's failed attempt at doing away with Gaynor) are brilliantly mixed with scenes of comedy. Murnau's aesthetic mix of European and American styles is replicated in his juxtaposition of scenes of dark erotica (the reedy marshes where O'Brien succumbs to the clutches of Livginston- minimal lighting and Expressionistic shadows) and innocent playfulness (the Man and Wife encounter a photographer in the City).A triumph on every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real gem of silent cinema -- its greatness encompassing talkies as well. Murnau's tale of real love threatened by lust and ambitions is epic and profoundly satisfying. All of the cast is remarkably eloquent. The piece is also a sumptous time-capsule of style as well...the black and white sunrise truly seems golden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the five best silent films ever produced.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people consider this the best silent movie ever made. One can not refute this praise, although I prefer to name it as one of the five best, considering it is genre film (drama/romance) and that others may be considered to be as outstanding and at the same time cover multiple genres. For the record my pick for the other four would be: GREED; THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE; INTOLERANCE; THE GOLD RUSH.Murnau made less than two dozen films, some of which are lost, but is certainly one of the most highly regarded of all silent directors with five classics to his credit (NOSFERATU; THE LAST LAUGH; SUNRISE; FAUST; TABU)and nine titles currently available on video. SUNRISE is simple in its storyline but very deeply "felt" by the performers and the fluidity of the cinematography and editing are oustanding and at the peak of silent cinema achievement. The lighting is particularly extraordinary throughout and the compositions, both quiet and constantly changing with the moving camera, are those of a master.This is a film you simply must seek out but be warned, there is a terrible fuzzy print once released by Critic's Choice Video - now out of print - that should be avoided. An excellent print is shown on the Fox Movie Channel (Cable) with a wonderful orchestral score and sound effects. It is available through a private collector on video and I may be contacted for that information. Leonard Maltin incorrectly lists its running time at 110 minutes, but it is 95 minutes.Winner of three Oscars (Unique and Artistic Production, Actress, Cinematography) and additionally nominated for Art Direction. This is a film that deserved seven awards: Film, Actress, Direction, Photoplay, Cinematography, Art Direction, Editing. Don't Miss It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching The circus in cinema class I chose to watch Sunrise: A song of Two humans because it had such great reviews and was said to be the greatest silent movie of that time and still is today, so I had to watch it. And I am very glad I did. I really enjoyed watching this movie, I thought it was very beautifully and it was a great story and told very brilliantly with it being a silent a film. It was very dramatic and sometimes kind of eerie. At times like when the husband is walking through the woods at night to meet his lover, and its all foggy, it kind of reminded me of a scene from the horror movie the Wolfman. I love that with silent movies the music always goes with the story to make the scene more eerie, or more happy and cheerful. I was kind of impressed with the cinematography of this film, There was a lot of different editing techniques used that I did not expect from a movie of this time. There are several times throughout the film where we see two different scene in one, we kind of see some flashbacks of thinking about killing his wife and he remembers his lover and kissing her and the scene kind of fades out to that then back to him. And we also see some flash forwards of him thinking about drowning his wife. I thought it was kind of funny the way they made it look like they are just all happy in love again and it seems like they are walking in a beautiful meadow but really they are just still walking in the street and cause a traffic jam. We do even hear a little bit of sound in this silent film besides just the music we hear some church bells. This movie had everything drama, a little bit of horror, a little bit of humor, a love story. This was a really great a film and I can see why its rated as one of the best silent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunrise- A Renewal of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person only used to watching films in colour and with sound it was quite a different challenge to sit and voluntarily watch a black and white silent movie. I am so glad that I did. I found this film to be one of my favourites of all time. The lack of colour faded away to the back of my mind and was forgotten about once I began watching. It was the lack of dialogue that was the biggest challenge but ultimately it was the lack of words that forced me to use my eyes and truly pay attention to the actors and the story line. The story of love and lust is timeless and the fact that the characters are nameless makes them more relate-able and you feel more accepting of them. I ended up feeling the emotions of the husband and wife. This is because they cannot use words and must rely on their body language and facial expressions to get their message across. They act with so much more passion than when they can simply use words and the tone of their voice. The other element that largely contributes to the success of the film is the music. The orchestra used adds to the drama and emotion in each scene and sets the mood. The music also builds anticipation and calms again when things seem to be going better. I truly could not look away until the film was over. Only afterward did it actually sink in that I watched a long black and white silent movie and I loved every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Apex of Silent film and The One to see before you die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now there's a lot of people who like to say that this or that film is the best ever made ? or more commonly the best that they've seen. I would like to politely disagree, you guys can't say either of those before you've seen Murnau's Sunrise.What we have here, is one the finest films ever made and propably one of the three or so best silents ever filmed. Murnau's other films are all masterpieces in their on right, but this is The One that hits you with the power of couple of megatons of awesomeness. It's almost impossible to describe it without talking exclusively in superlatives ? that's how sublime piece of filmmaking it is ? but I try to stay in my pants through this rant, that is also a sincerest kind of a love song to a film that a man can absolutely adore.When I first saw this late in the night I was kinda tired and not so sober, but once the film started rolling I must have looked like Malcom McDowell in Clockwork Orange's famous scene with his eyes forced open to visual images. That's exactly what happened to me, but the force came from the sheer poetry of the visual cavalcade that was thrown before my eyes. I'm actually surprised that from the few reviews I've read about this piece, none of them seem to notice that this film is basically three separate films also ? first part is extremely dark and tremendously powerful tragedy in nourish style, that also incorporates images from Murnaus's other films and maybe grim stories from his home country Germany. It's gripping, it's devastating and it forces you to suck every inch of it into your membrane. Second part is more lighter in the general mood but none the less powerful in any way. Third part is more of a synthesis of the previous two but a separate sequence on it's own.Talking about the imagery is hard because it is so provoking and sheer visual poetry in any way. Like some reviewer might have already said, the camera movement in the film propably haven't been surpassed until with the Matrix in 1999. That is little bit unfair thing to say, but actually not that far away from truth in cinematic sense.Light &amp; dark play their sensuous dance throughout the whole film, lighting being one of the central actors in the film in any way. Film also owes a great much to the whole industry of silent cinema and German and French expressionism in part. Story is universal and almost on the par with the great Greek tragedies and also at the same time profoundly intimate.This is a movie that gripped my heart and soul wholly, extremely personally and profoundly and with intention never to let go. I'm quite a aware that this so called review is more of an confession to a love of mine, but that's the way you can only talk about your loved ones - sincerely, poetically and with utmost appreciation. I will gladly carry this piece of art to my grave as the last images I will remember before succumbing to darkness.If you are going to die soon and have the time to see just one film - please see this one. You will die as a human with a soul fulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A supreme artistic triumph! Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is both a fantastic motion picture of the highest order and a true love story "as old as time".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always find it fascinating that I watch a movie that I absolutely had no knowledge of any kind whatsoever, and to be entertained and moved, as well as very surprised that it would turn out to be a very entertaining and great movie, because I believe that particular movie should be recognized and loved by everyone for I don't recall it really was mentioned a lot times by film critics, movie buffs, and film historians. The film I'm talking about is Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans, which is an emotional and terrific portrait at marriage, jealousy, adultery, and true love and happiness set in reality. A man, who doesn't have a name in the film and neither does anyone else, lived a poor, downdraught live in a village with the only pleasure he has is his beautiful mistress from the nearby big city. The mistress ordered him to kill his wife so he can sell his farm and go live with her in the city. He tried to do so twice, but it failed, and his wife ran away from him. Feeling so guilty and ashamed, he caught up with her on the train and tried repeatedly to apologize to her. When they reached the city, there were very little signs of forgiveness until when they attended a marriage ceremony which took place at a church and the man thought they could go to it. As the justice of the peace conducts the remainder of ceremony and respectively asks the bride and groom the "Do you??", the man had a very emotional moment that he had loved his wife a long time ago with all his body and soul and vowed to protect and cherish her at all time, and he had betrayed her. The couple walked out of the chapel, and they apologized each other for their troubles and spent the whole day in the city to get their relationship, marriage, and love work and alive again.F.W. Murnau, one of the most prominent filmmakers of the German Expressionist movement in his American filmmaking debut, has a brilliant eye for visual artistry and a strong passion for exquisite storytelling. Equally important, Murnau works with actors quite good and stays focused about story and character, rather than getting lost in the visual wonderment. One thing I really want to point out: the cinematography. Covering many different angles, various long shots, marvelous use of lighting for appropriate scenes, unexpectedly choice of close-up shots needed to match Murnau's filmmaking styles, Sunrise is perhaps the most significant breakthrough in motion picture filmmaking, in terms of cinematography, production design, editing, and costume design, since D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, at the time of its release. I could really see it that Murnau was the right man to do Sunrise, because of the silent films I've seen prior to this, there has not been a love story with its realistic adversities and an undeniably great chemistry between the lead couple told on film. I believe what he's telling us that marriage and true love is very hard and challenging, but it doesn't have to be that way when you and your mate love each other for what you're really are. If that were work, then you would be strong to stand against adulterous temptation of any kind, knowing that you have someone you know who is the missing part of your life. Sunrise is one of those romantic love stories that are told with great heart and understanding, and one that should teach Nicholas Sparks a lesson.I would've never expected the acting to be so phenomenal on high regard. John O'Brien portrays the male protagonist, the Man, with such fierce passion and tremendous dedication that would make you terrifically fear, antagonize, sympathize, and root for him. He doesn't just act the role; he lives it and embodies it, as though O'Brien had transformed himself to be his character in the film. He was very astonishing and magnificent in his tour-de-force performance in the film, and I'm shockingly disappointed that the Academy didn't nominate him for Best Actor at the very first Academy Awards ceremony; he would've won, hands down. Janet Gaynor, who the first Best Actress Oscar for the film, was so beautiful and very charming as the Farmer's wife; she nails the role with grace and magic that would make her character worthy to be the Farmer's wife and the chemistry between O'Brien and Gaynor is so magical and spellbindingly fantastic. I've never seen something like that in a movie in such a very long time. Now that I think about the film, I can see why the characters never had real names: it's meant to be universally conductive to symbolism to everyone on the earth. I had hard times believing that to begin with, but I thought about more and look back on the film, I can see why how the Man, the Wife, Woman from the City, the Maid, the Child, and every other character in the film speak out to different kinds of people without having special reserves for a particular group. There's a lot more to it. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is a great story on what true love is based upon and a bold experiment on the brilliant technological breakthroughs that inspired filmmakers to push the envelope further for the sake of the story and their direction. Winner of three Academy Awards, including Outstanding Unique and Artistic Production (at the time, it was as prestigious as Best Picture but they changed it for the next ceremony so it's just plain "Best Picture"), Sunrise is a terrifically wonderful story and brilliant film that should be seen by everyone who wants to catch a great flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was only after watching this film (subtitled A Song of Two Humans), listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, that I found out it was one of the few silent films to be nominated and win in the first ever Academy Awards ceremony in 1929, along with the films Wings, The Crowd and The Jazz Singer, and I was really happy with the result, from director F.W. Murnau (Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horrors). Basically a Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston) is vacationing in the country, and lingers around a lakeside town, and at night she goes a farmhouse, whistling to The Man (George O'Brien) who is spending time with his Wife (Oscar winning Janet Gaynor) and child, and reluctantly he walks towards the Woman, his Wife thinking memories of when their love was more deep. After kissing passionately, the Woman suggests to the Man coming with her to the city after selling the farm as it is not doing well recently, and that he should drown his wife to solve the problem, he initially strangles her in anger at the idea, but being let go she gathers a reed bundle to use as a floating device for when he turns the boat over after the drowning. The Man takes his Wife for a trip on the lake, she has no suspicions of anything, but she becomes worried from the way he is looking at her, and he approaches her looking like he is going to grab and throw her overboard, but he cannot bring himself to do it, so he rows quickly to shore, and when they get there she runs in panic. She boards a trolley which he follows, he begs her not to be frightened of him, and when she gets off and he stops her she cannot stop crying with disappointment and fear, so he tries to prove his love for her by giving her flowers and cakes, she takes the gifts but is still feeling upset. They enter a church and watch a couple get married, and listening to the procession the Man cries feeling terrible guilt and shame, and he asks his Wife to forgive him, and they tearfully reconcile as she begins to forgive his actions, in fact they fall much more in love than they probably ever did before. They start a small adventure in the town together, having seen some weddings photographs they decide to get a couple photograph together, starting with a trip to the barbers where the Man gets a shave and a Manicure Girl (Jane Winton) getting close for the Wife's liking, and an Obtrusive Gentleman (Arthur Housman) getting too close to the Wife for the Man's liking. They then go into the photographers shop and prepare for their photograph together, and they cannot help kissing together feeling so passionate for each other, unknowingly this is the photograph taken and developed, before leaving they accidentally break a small statue's head and replace it with rubber duck ball, which when spotted amuses The Photographer (J. Farrell MacDonald), and the couple love and are happy with their photograph. Night falls, and they spends the evening at a fun fair, where they play carnival games, catch a runaway piglet, dance in front of an adoring crowd, and have a quick drink at a table before the fireworks are exploding in the sky, and they get on the trolley to go home happy. When sailing back in the moonlight to the farm however a terrible storm rushes in, the Man and the Wife hold on for dear life as the crashing water and the wind rocks the boat, and feeling that something bad may happen he grabs the reeds collected and tied together and ties her to them so that she will float if she goes overboard, and sure enough she is thrown off the boat. The storm passes, and with the boat capsized the Man wakes up on the rocks, and he immediately goes to get help from many boats that go in search of her in the water, but following a trail of reeds he is lead to believe that she has drowned, so he returns home in a deep sadness. The Woman from the City comes over and calls to him, and he feels murderous rage having lost what he cares about, she runs but he catches her up and attempts to choke her, but the townspeople call him to tell him that they have found his Wife alive, and he runs to see her. The sun rises, the Woman sees no reason to stay and boards a cart to return to the City, and the Man sits by the bedside as his Wife wakes up, and she smiles radiantly as they hug and kiss, and they are overjoyed to be together in the sunrise. Also starring Bodil Rosing as The Maid, Ralph Sipperly as The Barber and Eddie Boland as The Obliging Gentleman. With no dialogue the performances are what count the most, O'Brien is a great sympathetic character who may have gone a bad route but is a kind man, Gaynor as the first woman to ever win an Academy Award is perfectly beautiful and endearing as the Wife who rekindles her love with her unstable but loyal husband, and with her moments on screen Livingston is suitable as the one who could have stolen the husband. The film has its dark moments, but overall it feels really charming, witty and sweet story at heart about the revival of a passionate marriage and love, it is a visually wonderful, sensational and must see silent romantic drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Picture, Unique and Artistic Production, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction. It was number 63 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For its time, SUNRISE was a masterpiece of silent film. The print shown on TCM included bits of street noise, musical background score and bells tolling from a tower or for a church wedding. Combined with the sights and sounds of a bygone era, the acting by JANET GAYNOR and GEORGE O'BRIEN doesn't seem as overly melodramatic as some silent screen acting is. And F.W. Murnau's excellent use of tracking shots and overlapping visuals to suggest what the actors are thinking, is done with stylish flair. The photography itself suggests German expressionism as the mood of the film.The story is deceptively simple--a husband goes astray after an affair with a seductive woman in the city. The woman convinces him to kill his wife and leave the countryside for a city life with her. The boating scene builds to a frenzied climax when the husband convincingly changes his mind just as he is about to hover menacingly over the frightened wife. How things turn after that point is what makes the story (and the film) so great.Gaynor and O'Brien both give priceless performances that will keep you wanting to see how all the strands of the story work out. Viewers will get drawn into the story from the start and be rewarded by watching the entire film unwind in its own dreamlike way. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise or sometimes known by its full title Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is a multi Oscar winning film from F. W. Murnau, one of the most famed Directors of the silent era. Mixing Murnau's traditional German Expressionism with Hollywood techniques the film stars George O'Brian as a rural farmer who begins an elicit affair with a glamorous and sophisticated Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston). The City Woman persuades the Farmer that he'd be better off with her in the city and suggests that he drowns his Wife (Janet Gaynor) and makes it look like an accident. Following a last minute change of heart The Man tries to gain his wife's forgiveness as she herself flees to the city with him in tow.I'd never heard of this film until a couple of weeks ago when I was searching for Silent Films that I could watch for Eternity of Dream's Speechless Blogathon. I searched the IMDb Top 250 and found that this was one of the few silent films I hadn't seen. And boy am I glad I found it. It is not surprising that Sunrise remains so highly regarded today as it is a truly magnificent film.The film is much stylised and features some advanced film making techniques. Unlike many films of the era there are few intertitle screens with possibly only ten or twelve during the entire 95 minutes. The images and acting do the talking and Murnau calls upon some interesting techniques to create a visually stunning film. He uses forced perspective on a number of occasions, sometimes in tandem with double exposure to create some quite surreal but beautiful images. The double exposure is something that is prevalent throughout and is often used to create the feeling of several emotions at once, such as when The Man is torn as to whether or not to kill his wife. The overlaying also creates a sense of hustle and bustle when the central characters first reach the city. In keeping with Murnau's German Expressionist past there are several scenes which have an almost fairytale like quality including one early on in which The Woman from the City enters a room to find a family eating breakfast. The table they're sat at appears to be at about 30 degrees off horizontal while furniture at the other end of the room is about 30 degrees off in the other direction. This creates a feeling of being sucked into the room and is also very beautiful.Something else of interest is the use of long tracking shots. The film actually features what was at the time the longest tracking shot in history at over four minutes and there are several protracted moving shots throughout. Another thing I didn't expect to see was the use of traveling matte (an early form of bluescreen). This was used during a scene in which the couple are walking through traffic and was added to with real cars and bicycles moving between the characters and camera. While it is obviously bluescreen it looked as good if not better than examples I've seen from the 1980s.The score, so important for a 'silent' movie, is absolutely superb, combining periods of thrilling, dramatic and romantic music as the mood changes. The music is a joy to listen to and at times incorporates music and sound effects from the characters surroundings such as the noise of a carnival and shouts from angry motorists. While technically a silent film, there are the odd moments of human speech but these are all in the form of stock effects like those mentioned above. The film was released just two weeks before the first 'talkie' The Jazz Singer and as a result was at the very end of the silent era.The plot can be easily dissected into three distinct acts. The opening act is heavy and sombre as The Man is racked with guilt and indecision. The middle third is quite light and frothy in comparison and even contains a scene in which The Man chases a drunken pig. It is sometimes funny and always frivolous and entertaining. The final act takes a sad turn and brings the plot round full circle. The story itself feels quite original and is gripping from start to finish. To me the plot could also been seen as a warning against Urbanisation, something that was creating problems for both town and country in the late 1920s. Symbolically the film could be viewed as a tempting city influence, coming to the countryside and upsetting the balance of things. While this could be the case, it may be that I'm reading too much into it.The acting is great. Once again I'm surprised just how great because as I've mentioned in previous reviews, although I watch a lot of silent film, I tend to stick to comedy for which acting is not a forte. Janet Gaynor won the first ever Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role in 1929 although at the time the award was given for cumulative work and included her performances in Seventh Heaven and Street Angel. Although I think that she was very good, for me the real standout performance was George O'Brian who felt incredibly natural in the role of The Man. As well as Gaynor's Oscar the film also won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Unique and Artistic Production (a category only used that one time and was the equivalent of Best Picture). Both awards are highly justified in my view.Overall Sunrise is a highly enjoyable and technically brilliant film which combines some of the best aspects of German Expressionism and early Golden Age Hollywood to form a thrilling and beautiful piece of work which is worth seeking out if ever you get the chance.www.attheback.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This being the first silent movie I've seen I didn't know what to expect. I'm so used to sound and dialogue so this would be a strange and possibly boring experience. However the lack of dialogue simplifies the film and let's you focus on the character's body language and the cinematography that is just as good as any cinematography done in recent films. You really feel what the characters feel because you have to involve yourself more with the plot because of the lack of dialogue. I thought it was wonderfully well paced and a great moral lesson beautifully rendered. It had just the right amount of bitterness and sweetness with some humour too (my faviourite bit being the strap incident). Overall I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it much more than some of the high budget trash Hollywood is churning out now. It is surprisingly ahead of its time to say it was done in the 20's (they use a green screen at one point which I didn't know was around THAT early). Highly recommend for anyone who can appreciate a really good film without the Hollywood extras :).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)My third Murnau film, and the silent film I've probably been recommended the most behind Metropolis and Nosferatu. My review: As I write this I'm still wiping my eyes and blowing my nose because of a movie that has touched me deeply. A week or so ago I posted a thread to hear about everyone's greatest tearjerker to see what really pangs their emotional chords, and I wrote I wish it could happen to me. Well, it's happened. Sunrise is everything I could have wanted in an emotionally ridden film. Murnau hits all the right buttons and conducts a more than masterful outlook on the relationship between a husband and wife; one that has seemed to be at it's end until a huge turn of events and feelings changes everything. Sunrise is poignant, beautiful, funny, charming, riveting, and subtly keeps you smiling. Even the word cards/word art have you wriggling in your seat when you see them melt on screen. I cannot recall a film since Matewan or The Hill that has touched me so deeply with some sort of emotion. I am only nineteen (inexperienced with serious relationships) yet feel for everything I saw happen between these two humans. The performances by George O'Brien and the incredibly charming and adorable Janet Gaynor are nothing but excellent. They are a great pair who convey the woes and laughs (ups and downs) of a relationship to near perfection. I have to say I was taken back a bit from all the hype this film was getting, but I have absolutely no regrets watching this and can understand where all the hype now comes from. All I can say is that I am in awe. Sunrise is a simply stunning film. 10/10 Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylistic Peak of the Silent Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this simple classic from the twilight of the silent movie. My main qualm with many speechless pictures, the title cards, are cautiously kept to a bare minimum - they're virtually non-existent in the third act - which results in a film that not only flows much more smoothly than most of its peers, but relies heavily on the performance of its cast. Fortunately, they deliver en masse. Janet Gaynor, who looks strikingly similar to Drew Barrymore, actually won the first-ever academy award for best actress for this film (along with the two others she appeared in that year), and deservedly so. Both she and her male counterpart, George O'Brien, are tirelessly emotive throughout, telling their story so well through expression it didn't need to be spelled out on the screen. It's also worth mentioning that, considering its age, I was blown away by the quality of the special effects in Sunrise, which were used ambitiously but realistically by its script. A bit over-the-top at times, it's more accessible than other films of its age and still deserves recognition as one of the best of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the zenith of silent filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before its de-evolution in the early sound era, visual storytelling had attained heights of refinement rarely equaled before or since, and this highly-stylized love story must certainly stand as a sort of apotheosis of the silent form. With a bare minimum of expository titles, it manages to compress into the space of a single feature (in a story unfolding over the course of a single day) the emotions and tensions of a lifetime of marriage, tracing a path through madness, contrition, doubt, loss, and finally salvation, after a man is goaded by his lover into attempting to murder his wife. But he's unable to carry out the deed, and the shock of discovery, for both husband and wife, leads to a gradual, painful reconciliation during the afternoon and early evening. The film is often (and with some justification) included on lists of the best ever made, offering a timeless reminder of the intimate dramatic power of movie-making, and of the lost eloquence of silent film expression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and yes, I have plot spoilers in this review, but you could read the plot of Sunrise from beginning to end and have taken away no more versus actually seeing it as you could substitute the reading of a menu with actually enjoying a fine meal. In other words, plot is not the point of this film at all.There is nothing special about the story behind this movie. A farmer (George O'Brien) is attracted by a vamp from the City (Margaret Livingston) who seduces him and has gradually had him selling his farm off piece by piece to provide presents for her. She finally suggests that he leave his failing farm altogether and return with her to the City. However, to complete the plan, he will need to drown his country wife(Janet Gaynor). A few days later, the farmer takes his wife for a trip to the city. As he rows his wife across the lake that is between their village and the trolley, he comes close to doing away with her. However, always a reluctant partner in this plan, he recoils in horror and rows the boat to the shore, his wife unharmed. The wife, having seen the murder in her husband's eyes, jumps onto the trolley to the city with her husband in hot pursuit. Once in the city, he reassures her that he would not harm her, and he begins to feel real remorse for his previous actions. They slip into a church and watch a wedding ceremony going on, and in doing so begin to reconnect to one another. By the end of the day, they've fallen in love again; the man remembering why it was he married his wife in the first place. However, when a storm breaks out on their way back across the lake, the wife falls out of the boat. The farmer goes for help and the entire village looks for her, hoping she has not been drowned in the storm. This rather simple story could easily have been transformed into a hackneyed melodrama. What makes Sunrise a great film, though, is the majesty and tenderness F.W. Murnau managed to give it without the benefit of audible conversation.Particularly intriguing is the set of the unnamed "City". If the traffic patterns shown in this movie are indicative of traffic laws in the 1920's it's a wonder anybody made it to or from work alive. Early autos, horse-drawn carriages, and people all chaotically race through the streets without rhyme or reason. Also wondrous are the night shots of the Coney Island-style amusement park where the farmer and his wife go for some fun before returning home as well as the view of the trolley ride and and the glide following the farmer through the moonlit marsh. A little known fact is that Sunrise was one of the first feature films to use sound-on-film techniques, in which Fox was a pioneer. There were fully synchronized sounds of automobiles, church bells, crowds, and other effects. Unfortunately, "The Jazz Singer" was released shortly after Sunrise, and Sunrise failed at the box office. Time, however, has had a different judgment. Sunrise is still appreciated today as a whole motion picture experience, not just a temporary technical triumph that has faded as other technical triumphs take its place.</fullReview>

Great powerful performances of leading pair ,beautiful cinematography and stunning set decoration makes this movie overall a wonderful movie.the starting of the movie was brilliant with great intensity and depth but then after first act movie became dull and just like any other rom-com, just mildly entertaining,in it's second act there was nothing striking in the movie,the twist in the movie at the end just saved the movie for me and the thrilling third act give brilliant ending to the movie.The thing that really amazed me was it's special effects and the set decoration that seemed ahead of it's time,melodious soundtrack also saved the movie in it's dull second act.The most wonderful scene of the movie was the scene of the boat, when the husband was going to drown her wife but at last he conquered his evil.The scene was very intense and powerful. Another scene was brilliantly shot(considering the time when movie was made)the morning scene when the husband sitting in the bed watching her wife feeding birds struggle between his evil desire to kill her wife and the love for her wife. the scene was shot with wonderful visual effects.It is a overall good movie and a must watch for every silent movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tears, tears of sadness and joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A German filmmaker Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau made several films in his home country, including Nosferatu, Faust and The Last Laugh. His films have been very influential and still after over 80 years, highly appreciated. Murnau is most famous of his narrative and expressionism. If you hear one talking about German expressionism, you can't miss his name. From his films (especially from Faust) people usually watch and think what German expressionism actually was. In the year 1927 Murnau went to the United States, because he thought the States could give him new possibilities to develop his artist attempts. In result of this came a film. The film that has been many times voted as the most beautiful film of all time. I couldn't agree more."This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place; you might hear it anywhere, at any time. Everywhere, where the sun rises and sets, in the city and in the country, life is much the same; sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet." This is the text of the first title card that appears on the screen. The beginning of Murnau's most poetic film. The words on the title card may make you understand that the plot isn't as important in Sunrise as the content is: "Everywhere... life is much the same." Murnau tells a story of two humans, it doesn't matter where they live, or how wealthy are they. Misery grows in mansions as it does under the bridges. This is what makes Sunrise universal and timeless. Now after 87 years I feel like no film has touched me as deeply.Sunrise is builds around a simple love triangle: a woman from the city seduces a married farmer. In hope of getting a better life he has to drown his wife, so he can live happily ever after with the woman from the city. After the situation has resolved, the rest is about appeasement, forgiveness, reconciliation and the rebirth of marriage.This poetic song of two humans is brilliantly done. It is a combination of studio work and the possibilities of filming in nature. When watching Sunrise you can see it is precisely designed to every single detail. The action of every take is in perfect relation to the filmed movement. The setting has been made very carefully with the understanding of cinematography, the viewer can sense the unusual deep impression, which refers to the themes of the story. The perspective, composition, action, the movement in the picture and the lighting had been precisely pre-designed.Sunrise is perfect in every way. I can't compare its beauty with anything, except Jean Vigo's L'Atalante. No one has reached the same poetic beauty as these two men did. So Sunrise's directed and filmed perfectly - technically perfect. But it's also narratively amazing, F.W. Murnau did understand that you can use camera as one of the characters, for instance in The Last Laugh. In Sunrise he also tells us through camera, of course that is what cinema is. But when you're watching a silent film, you pay attention to the pictures differently compared to a talkie. Sunrise is a triptych; different parts connect in night, day and night, which turns into a new day. This, of course is no coincidence. The triptych of the circulation of the sun, humane emotions and the symbolism that unites them. Murnau was the true master of cinema.F.W. Murnau's use of images is beautiful, inspiring. He made the best silent films, no doubt. Sunrise is perfect in every way, its way of showing humane emotions, relationships and love is beautiful. The rhythm between different scenes and the suspense between different themes show the true beauty of Murnau's aesthetics. Sunrise is a story that plays beautifully as a song. It's a story about two humans, whose life is sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet, tears and laughter, sin and forgiveness. Tears of sadness and joy are the emotions Sunrise manages to describe and bring up in the audience. One can't do anything but cry, cry tears of sadness and joy. What a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Silent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director F.W. Murnau (probably better known for "Nosferatu") really hit the nail on the head with this one. We have a great story of a man's lust for another woman and his love for his wife and how the two come to face each other. Does the heart triumph over the appetite? We also have some amazing camera tricks. Film is layered over film in such a way that I think was unheard of at the time. Today with digital editing this would be easy, but when film-making was an art, to layer it so flawlessly really shows a craftsman in his prime.I also enjoyed the train and roller coaster sequences. Murnau makes hem look futuristic, something that grabbed me from the very beginning and exaggerated the night and day world of the city and the country. (Night and day, incidentally, are important themes of this film... the name "Sunrise" may not be obvious at first, but by the end viewers will see how much this one word says.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is one of the first silent films I've ever seen. This particular movie made me fall in love with silent films! I felt that certain moments were far more beautiful without words. Spoken words would have taken some of the magic away. One scene that really stood out for me was when the man and woman were in a church watching a stranger's wedding. The man watched the vows being exchanged and suddenly felt this overwhelming sadness and guilt. He became so sincerely sorry to his wife and she forgave him for his faults. If the man would have said out loud to his wife "I'm sorry" it wouldn't have meant as much to the audience. No words were necessary, the viewer knew what was happening and that made it more beautiful. The characters in the movie were all nameless, creating an even more fiction and story-like feeling. The significance of the film was all about a story of forgiveness and second chances. In the end, the film turned into a love story with a happy ending of course!</fullReview>

The acting in this movie was very believable through their actions in the storyline that it kept me glued to the screen to see what was going to happen next.For a 1927 silent film, the movie was very easy to follow the storyline. The mood of the music during scenes of conflicting thoughts and actions were very dark and gloomy while scenes of love and happiness was very cheery and playful. Throughout this movie, it is the power of love for God and love for your loved ones is what conquers the evil sins of betrayal and mistrust in individual's marriages.Without these sins, people are able to lead a normal and happy life with their families.I would recommend watching this movie with your family and friends. This is one of the best 20th century films to watch at anytime!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the subject-matter in Sunrise was heart-wrenching. I found myself feeling bad for the cheating husband despite his wrongdoings. I was surprised by this because adultery is not as culturally acceptable anymore in America and most films that you see today make this very evident. I was pleasantly surprised by the camera-work as I thought it would be minimal. I have never watched a silent film before and I thought that I would be bored out of my mind, but I could not get enough. It was an awkward experience to watch a movie in which a woman knows that her husband is cheating and then he tries to kill her and then they go to the city and have a great night out. The whole time I felt like I was in a nightmare and I couldn't wake up. Magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For wherever the sun rises and sets? in the city's turmoil or under the open sky on the farm? life is much the same; sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet." Legendary German expressionist F.W. Murnau brought his incredible talents to America and perfected the art of silent cinema with his film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. This classic from the late silent era is a story of a farmer, his wife, and a temptress from the city. Murnau takes a simple plot line and creates a film with great depth and passion. The film itself is beautifully acted and emotionally charged, but it's Murnau's direction and his cinematographers, Karl Struss and Charles Rosher, that make this one of cinema's most acclaimed treasures. It's brilliant use of composition, lighting, tracking shots, overlapping exposures, and long takes are nothing short of astounding. This is indeed a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Great Silent Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said about F.W. Murnau's Sunrise and how William Fox gave him the keys to the kingdom so to speak in order to make it. There was no guarantee the film would be a success, and in fact, it was a box office failure. However, the film went on to celebrated artistic success, winning three academy awards for actress, cinematography, and artistic production. The film tells the deceptively simple story of a married couple. A city woman tempts a man into considering doing away with his wife. That's the simple premise of this film which obviously evokes Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy. The film's distinction lies in how the story unfolds.Using very few title cards, Murnau directs the actors in a way which does not require explanation from title cards. George O'Brien as the tempted, guilt-ridden man expresses his frustration over his lapses with facial expression, gesticulation, a pair of leaden shoes, and what Murnau referred to as dramatic angles with the camera. Janet Gaynor as the confused and frightened woman holds each emotion on her face as perfect portraits. Margaret Livingston as the city woman appears a bit exaggerated as the cigarette smoking temptress; she's like a biblical serpent hiding amongst the tree branches near the end. The ending is not as simple as some would believe. The sunrise at the end, while symbolizing hope for the future, also suggests the cycle of life (married life in this case) has its own path and will continue on its own regardless, echoing the opening title cards' description of life being sometimes bitter and sometimes sweet.Rarely has any silent film been directed so artfully with its combination of music, sound effects, and innovative cinematography. The music is breathtaking at times, and some of the camera shots were innovative for the time. Photographers had to hand crank cameras at the time, so it's amazing to see some of the scenes with as much camera movement as they have. The seduction scene under the moon is one. The film was released at an unfortunate time in film history when talking pictures began appearing. Public excitement for talking pictures was building, and as a result, the public overlooked Sunrise. It was Fox' first film released with its own soundtrack. Famed composer/pianist Fletcher Henderson appears briefly. **** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wondrous piece of film-making with a positive message snuggled in with its other many virtues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proof positive that those coming in last are not necessarily least, this stunning silent film was released into theatres just days before the advent of sound films and, though it wasn't a big money-maker at the time, still impresses viewers today. Resembling art more than most other films have, before or since, it's a fable-like tale of a country man, his wife and his temptation (a woman from the city.) O'Brien plays a strapping, handsome farmer who has become dejected by his humdrum existence with pert, but simple and plain, wife Gaynor and their infant daughter. When urban seductress Livingston comes to his village for a vacation, she manages to get her hooks into him, eventually coercing him into killing off Gaynor so that they can be together. Even though the idea pains him mightily, he proceeds to plot and plan the murder just as Gaynor has incorrectly imagined that he is coming out of his funk and wants to spend time with her again. To tell much more of the plot is to give away an odyssey of emotion, ups and downs, romance, ironies, warmth, humor and heartache as the couple is forced to reexamine their life together. All the while, startlingly crafted imagery and staging contribute to a truly remarkable viewing experience. The conventional blends with the unconventional. The mundane takes on new life as fantasy. It's a touching, amusing, charming blend of humanity and misunderstanding. O'Brien runs the gamut from fiercely driven, even scary, intimidation to tearful, stricken humility and remorse. Gaynor is a fragile, yet surprisingly resilient presence. The couple creates magic together on screen. Livingston doesn't have quite as much to do, but she's quite effective as well and arresting to look at. Not enough can be said about the wealth of detail and the creativity utilized throughout the film. This film should be shown, not only to classic film buffs, but to married couples in crisis as it, albeit fancifully, depicts the way that love can ebb and flow, sometimes turning on a dime. Couples in divorce court, loathing each other and lashing out any way they can, always seem to forget that at one point they loved each other enough to plan for a year a massive ceremony with every friend they know in attendance so that they could proclaim their love for one another and celebrate their intimate connection with one another. If only more couples could find their way back to that in the pendulum of life rather than allowing themselves to grow apart, there might be just that much less strife and angst in the world. This film can't be the cure for everyone, but if it could possibly reawaken even one pair's love for one another, it would be worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt and technically wonderful pinnacle of the silent age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1927 was big year for movies. It saw the premiere of Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the most expensive movie ever made at that point, Douglas Firbanks founding the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Abel Gance's Napoleon becoming the first film to experiment with widescreen processes, and FOX Films acquiring the first sound-on-film technology, which would lead to the release of The Jazz Singer; considered the first ever "talking picture".Out of FOX's deal and amongst this all also came F.W. Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) a fable-like story of The Man (George O'Brien) who intends to murder The Wife (Janet Gaynor) in order to follow The Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston) into the dazzling world of city life. In a lesser film, the use of simple nouns to name characters may come off as pretentious and generalising, yet Murnau's use of strong and stark imagery coupled with a story so simple a child could understand it, truly makes the film a story "of no place and every place", as the opening titles read. Sunrise comes to represent not just a conflict in a relationship, but all conflict in any relationship, with the instinctive character traits of man and woman both causing the disturbance and then healing it.When I first saw Sunrise around a year ago, I was disappointed. I was expecting something more in line with the excessively bizarre imagery of other films from German expressionists such as the aforementioned Metropolis (1927) or Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). Re-watching it, I realised how wrong I was. Instead of providing an overwhelming experience, Murnau's film, much like his earlier works Nosferatu (1922) and Faust (1926), uses the conventions of expressionism (stark lighting, disorienting sets) to a subtler degree, in order to serve and enhance the story instead of to merely act as spectacle. Take for example the ever so slight slanted walls of The Man and Wife's dwelling, reflecting the conflict in their relationship. Or the illusion of moonlight used in more ominous scenes. That's true expressionism.The film not only manages to smartly use previous conventions, but create new ones altogether. Collaborating with cinematographers Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, Murnau created almost weightless camera movement. Take for instance the crane shot seamlessly following the Man and Wife's boat across the stream, as though the viewer is flying above the couple viewing the action. Sunrise was also one of Hollywood's first movies to be presented with a pre-recorded soundtrack. However, unlike the awkwardly overdubbed talking lines of the movie's cousin, The Jazz Singer, the film's Movietone soundtrack is used more carefully. Timothy Brock and Hugo Riesenfeld's score, while partly composed of already existing tunes (one of which, rather humorously, would later become the theme song of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955-1962)) is masterfully constructed. Take for instance the happy melody offset by darker sweeping undertones as The Wife unknowingly prepares for her supposed doom. Sound effects are also used with care, adding life and ambiance to the city in the form of whooshing cars and honking horns, without distracting from the wordless drama between the two protagonists.Despite this subtlety, Murnau isn't afraid to let the film's technical innovations run wild when it's appropriate. The film opens with what can only be described as an explosion of sound and vision as we see a collage of trains, boats, skyscrapers and women in bathing suits to set the mood of the city and modern living before moving to The Man and Wife's more peaceful environment in the country side as it's invaded by the Satan-like Woman from the City. Other dazzling effects include an indoor carnival ground, where negative space is filled with spinning carousels, flashing lights and swinging jazz bands. It's almost as impressive now as it would have been then.Remarkably, Murnau is also able to use the limitations of the time to Sunrise's advantage. While the matte shots of The Man and Wife walking through traffic as the background fades to swampland may come off as clunky and unconvincing out of context, within the film's love story the shot portrays the strength of the couple's love and how it's unfazed by new and fast technology in an ethereal and dream-like way.That's not to say that some aspects of Sunrise aren't dated. Modern viewers may find Murnau's confidence in the power of institution (in this case, the church) a little archaic and over-simplistic from the perspective of today's more liberated and individualistic age. However, I found that this is well and truly made up for in the film's second half, as we witness the couple dancing, drinking, experiencing culture clash and even getting in and out of trouble together.Winner of "Unique and Artistic Production" at the first Academy Awards, alongside Wings (1927) which won the more revered "Outstanding Picture", it's quite telling of the awards show that it's Sunrise, and not Wings, that made it onto both the AFI's 100 Years? 100 Movies list in 2007 and Quintessence Editions' 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in 2003. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans remains today a technically impressive and heart-warming celebration of both the good and bad in life. A must see for any human being. Just don't expect any robotic clones or fortune- telling somnambulists.</fullReview>

Well after logging on, I discovered that there are now 11 pages of evaluation and all speak quite highly of "Sunrise." Of course, I have always held that concept and have 'pushed' this movie upon everyone and anyone whenever cinema topics arise. My personal 'connection' with the film is that while a teenager (16yrs old) I went to see it at MOMA in NYC. Unfortunately, they accidentally failed to bring the second half from their Archives in Fort Lee. NJ. Suddenly, the screen went blank, the lights went on, and there were apologies. The Museum offered the audience tickets for a future showing of it. Afterall, it cost this high schooler a whopping $2.00 to enter the Museum back in Spring of 1968. So, I returned and finally saw it in full that Fall. Then, years later, getting tired of the poorly copied tape I had purchased; I called and called FOX about when it was being prepared for DVD. Eventually, *they* must have gotten tired of listening to me and actually 'gave' me the FIRST disc! Of course, it isn't numbered, but that's what they told me, I guess in order to keep me quiet! :-D Meanwhile, my connection with Silents has continued, have lectured at MOMA (1993 Bobby Harron Centennial), done various film festival showings/lectures, and written articles on the Silent Era.However, anyone who knows me also knows what my favorite film is and I am very happy to read that others find "Sunrise" fine since the AFI does so as well in its ratings. Enough of my story-telling, since you are logged on because you want to either express your opinion or learn evaluations of the films posted by others and you definitely now know that my evaluation is A++, 100%, 10, and any other Highest Rating possible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Farmer Takes His Wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUNRISE (Fox, 1927), goes down in cinema history as one of the greatest movies ever made, in fact, one of the finest ever produced during the silent era, and the type of movie that could only be seen and appreciated only as a silent film. Although produced in Hollywood, it has all the ingredients and flavor of a European production mainly because it's directed by a German director making his American debut, F.W. Murnau. While other directors (D.W. Griffith or King Vidor for example) have attempted styles all their own, Murnau was not only unique, but very much different due to his artistic attempts no others in Hollywood have achieved until that time. There isn't much of a story, actually. In fact, while this can be categorized as a love story reborn or a tender drama perhaps, it can be best summed up as one about a farmer and his wife. There's much more to it than that, as told through the camera focusing on its visual darkness to simplistic visuals of another world, montage effects, inter-titles of spoken words that slowly slide downwards on the screen, and most important, its haunting musical score composed by Hugo Risenfeld setting the tone, mood and pattern to what's to be shown.The opening title reads as follows: "This is the story of the man and his wife, no place and every place; you might hear it anywhere at any time, for wherever the sun rises and sets in the city's turmoil or under the open sky on the farm, life is, much the same, sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet." In a setting that could be somewhere in Europe or the Florida everglades, the main focus is on a farmer (George O'Brien) with a trusting wife (Janet Gaynor) and a baby. Their happiness is interrupted by a visiting city girl (Margaret Livingston) who takes over the husband's life and soul with the attempt of having him give up his farm and going away with her to the big city. She even goes so far as suggesting on murdering his wife by drowning her. The following day, husband attempts to carry out her plan but guilt takes over. While the wife fears suspects his intentions, she leaves the rowboat and runs for her life. Husband catches up to her expressing his sorrow. As she gradually feels his sincerity. the couple gather together for a happy day in the suburbs. Upon their return home by row boat, a sudden windstorm arises throwing the wife overboard. Husband swims to shore, leading the vamp to believe he actually carried out her plot, unknown to the city girl that husband has other plans for her.George O'Brien, a rugged actor best known for his lead role in director John Ford's epic, THE IRON HORSE (1924), and other westerns, offers another memorable account captured on film that's overshadowed by the sensitive portrayal of the young and upcoming Janet Gaynor. Who could forget her fearful moment set in a restaurant as her husband tries to regain her confidence as she attempts to eat her cake and breaking into tears at the same time. It is her fine work that honored her to become the very first actress to win an Academy Award. In fact Gaynor became the only actress to be awarded for three separate movies, the others being SEVENTH HEAVEN (1927) and STREET ANGEL (1928). Gaynor had worked with O'Brien before, but this was to be their best known collaboration only because it's arguably their very best together. Supporting them in this venture are Bodil Rosing (The Maid); J. Farrell MacDonald (ThePhotographer); Jane Winton (The Manicurist); Arthur Housman (The Obtrusive Gentleman); and Ralph Sipperly (The Barber). Interestingly, none of the performers are given character names. They are only listed in the credits by their professions or what they are aside from whom they are.The story is not all melodramatic. The script had added some amusements such as the husband's chase after a drunken pig as one of its prime examples. Murnau's work could not have been possible without the assistance of cameramen, Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, as well as the lavish scale sets where the metropolis that gives indication of a futuristic outlook. This could very much had been a long dream sequence, but in reality, a story set in two worlds apart.An Academy Award winner in the category of "artistic quality of production," SUNRISE remains an perfect example of silent film study. My introduction to SUNRISE was at a revival theater in New York City dating back to 1982. In spite of its reputation, it didn't play to a full house as the Charlie Chaplin comedies did, yet those I've noticed in attendance sat there in amazement. Later that year, SUNRISE made its New York City premiere on public television's WNET, Channel 13. To date, this became it's one and only showing. Video cassette distribution from Critic's Choice Masterpiece Collection during the late 1990s had been limited. Could it be that SUNRISE isn't a great movie after all? Not quite. It might have limited appeal, but thanks to cable television revivals ranging from American Movie Classics (1997); Turner Classic Movies (1999 to present); Fox Movie Channel along with availability on DVD has SUNRISE earned the recognition it rightfully deserves. Maybe it needs to be seen more than once to absorb the director's true intention not as screen entertainment but artistic achievement. (****)&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such an incredible sweet love-story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many know F.W. Murnau perhaps only just as an early pioneer in horror movies but perhaps even better are his drama movies. It's always something powerful and real- and emotional feeling. You can always truly sense the character's emotions.It's such an incredible sweet love-story! The way the two lovers behave is very authentic and feels warm and sweet. They are a great couple who truly deeply love each other. This is really one of the sweetest and most warm movies you'll ever see! Also in this particular case I didn't mind that the movie had an happy ending. It of course also all works out thanks to the main actors of the movie; George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor. They are great and worked well together. There was some real electricity.F.W. Murnau really knew how to construct and build up a good sequence, with a good fast pace and also in this case with the help of some real fine cinematography. The cinematography in F.W. Murnau movies is always something special and innovative!Most dramatic sequences in the movie get stretched out for too long, especially in the middle of the movie, but it's needed for the story and of course also needed because this is a silent movie, that needs to tell its story purely with its images, instead of dialog.Perhaps the more dark and sinister aspect of the movie remain too underdeveloped, which in my opinion is a sort of a missed opportunity. It could had provided the movie with some more and interesting layers but perhaps it would had also made the movie over-complicated, with too many different plot-lines and characters.The sets are all grand and fantastic looking, though also fake, which for some reason only enhances the movie and its atmosphere. This also was the case with Murnau's previous movie "Faust". It's more artistic then just plain fake looking. The overall movie is put very artistically together, with a couple of great- and imaginative sequences in it.A definite must-see in my opinion!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Finer Film Sound or Silent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There never has been nor likely never will be another film quite like SUNRISE. I consider it a perfect film in every aspect. There is not a wasted frame, a poor shot, or frivolous tangent in the whole film. It's a director's movie and an actors movie. Cast and crew shine together in brilliance. The art direction, the photography, the almost non-existent titles blend into a symphonic poem of a man and a woman, their family, and the threatening storm of evil both in nature and human character. It's a film about choices - bad choices and good choices. It is a tale of repentance and hurt and forgiveness. It is filmed with types and parable, vivid, tender and powerful. SUNRISE is a simple experience so very complex in its ramifications to the viewer. It is an asset that it is silent as far as spoken dialog is concerned for more is spoken in the mind of the viewer than could ever be spoken by human tongue. It is not a film to entertain but succeeds in entertaining soaring and searching thoughts of the mind. SUNRISE is a veritable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece and then some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some film critics disagreed in the late fifties, giving the nod to Murnau's equally brilliant "Last Laugh," this in my view is the crowning achievement of the German genius. Many polls rank it as the greatest silent film ever made and many rank it very high on the all time list of great movies.The plot is melodramatic, the acting in places heavy handed, and the action seemingly non-existent, at least in the eyes of the "Terminator 3" generation,yet "Sunrise" is so captivating a film that it can be watched over and over again and deliver the same punch every time. In fact, like the other greats,including "Citizen Kane," you can probably get something new out of "Sunrise" every time you watch it, no matter how many times you watch.Murnau takes barren sets and dark, hallow rooms and turns them into treasure troves of lighting and nuance. He creates something as simple as a railway depot or a big traffic intersection and makes it a story all by itself."Sunrise" stands today as one of the most visually fascinating films ever made. Murnau's cinematographers, Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, got an Oscar for their work and surely deserved it. Janet Gaynor won the Best Actress award for her body of work that also included "Seventh Heaven" and also richly deserved the prize. Her face expresses her inner emotions so perfectly that some of her scenes are achingly beautiful.And the film itself received an academy award for "Most unique and artistic production," an award never given out again, maybe because no picture could live up to the standard set by "Sunrise." The new DVD version being marketed on the quiet by Fox is marvelous, with a wonderfully restored print that seems just as bright today as it must have in late 1927 when the film was released. The DVD includes an interesting commentary option by cinematographer John Baily and no film is better suited for this, since it tells its story brilliantly with pictures alone, so the commentary option is not a distraction.One of the great tragedies of the cinema in my view is that few people alive today have seen "Sunrise." They have no idea what they are missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)' is simply one of the most breathtaking motion pictures of the silent era, and certainly one of the most effective to have originated in Hollywood. However, the film's creative talent arrived from overseas, when William Fox, founder of the Fox Films Corporation, lured German director F.W. Murnau over to the United States with the promise of a greater budget and complete artistic freedom. Murnau, who had previously brought German Expressionism to its creative peak with 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)' and 'Faust - Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926),' spared no expense at his new American studio, and the result is quite possibly his most extraordinary storytelling achievement, blending reality and fantasy into a wonderfully-balanced melodramatic fable of love and redemption. Though inevitably overshadowed by the arrival of "talkies" with 'The Jazz Singer (1927),' the film was also the first to utilize the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system, which allowed the inclusion of roughly-synchronised music, sound effects and a few garbled voices.Just as he did in 'Der letzte Mann / The Last Laugh (1924),' Murnau makes sparing use of intertitles, and so the film relies very heavily on visuals in order to propel the story and invoke the desired mood. During his mercilessly short-lived career, the German director subscribed to two distinct film-making styles: German Expressionism, which deliberately exaggerated geometry and lighting for symbolic purposes, and the short-lived Kammerspiel ("chamber-drama") genre, most readily noticed in 'The Last Laugh,' which bordered on neo-realistic at times, but also pioneered the moving camera in order to capture the intimacy of a character's point-of-view. 'Sunrise' appears to have been influenced by both styles. The fable of The Man (George O'Brien) and The Wife (Janet Gaynor), its time and place purposefully vague, fittingly takes place in a plane of reality not quite aligned with our own, without straying too perceptibly into the realm of fantasy. Murnau also had mammoth sets created for the city sequences, fantastically stylised and exaggerated to re-enforce the picture's fairytale ambiance.The characters in 'Sunrise' are best viewed as archetypes, performing a very specific function in Murnau's moral parable. The story's primary themes are forgiveness and redemption. The Man, a misguided fool torn between two lovers, is driven to the brink of murder, but manages to stop himself at the final moment. The remainder of the film involves The Man's attempts at, not only understanding the gravity of what might have been, but also to recall his former love for his wife. I can't imagine what camera filters must have been used to transform Janet Gaynor into the supreme personification of innocence and vulnerability, but she is the most heartbreakingly-helpless figure since Lillian Gish in 'Broken Blossoms (1919).' Even so, for the bulk of the film, the power to reconcile their estranged marriage lies solely within the hands of The Wife, whose role in the story is to recognise the remorse of her husband, and, in accordance with their sacred wedding vows, to forgive him his shameful transgressions.The development of the moving camera was a crucial step towards the dynamic style of cinema that we now enjoy. Though the first notable use of the technique was in 'The Last Laugh,' and Murnau is said to have used it even earlier, some of the sequences in 'Sunrise' are simply beyond words in their gracefulness and beauty. In easily the most memorable long-take of the film, and perhaps even the decade, Karl Struss and Charles Rosher's camera sweeps behind The Man as he makes his way through the moon-lit scrub-land, before overtaking him, passing through a swathe of tree branches and arriving at The Women From the City (Margaret Livingston), who applies her make-up and waits for the married suitor whom she is about to convince to murder his wife. I first caught a split-second glimpse of this wonderful shot in Chuck Workman's montage short, 'Precious Images (1986),' and it's a telling sign that, of all the four hundred or so movies briefly exhibited in that film, it was this one that caught my eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films, EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunrise" was the featured film at the 12th annual Kansas Silent Film Festival, at Washburn University, Topeka, KS. Music was provided by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra (excellent!!).Before viewing, the festival discussion described this film as being an American studio's attempt to be taken seriously as producing quality works instead of being known as the producer of quantities. Germany, at that time, was known for making the most important, serious films and so a German director was brought in and given a blank check to make a statement film (its final total expenses pained the studio).But the result is a powerful, timeless film on themes of betrayal, seduction, adultery, murder, and reconciliation.For today's taste, the actors somewhat overly-dramatize their actions (as typical in the silent era) BUT, just as most of us adapt quickly to reading subtitles in a foreign film, most of us also adapt to this convention to convey the message between those intermittent written screens that give dialog or explanations.My understanding is that the very first year the Academy Awards were introduced, THIS film -- made a couple years earlier -- was the VERY FIRST chosen to be honored as "Best Picture" (together with "Wings"). While I've not seen the other silent films that were its competitors, this honor certainly seems fully deserving. The actors, photography, pace, unfolding, etc., are all superb. Some of the scenes will remain in my memory forever.What a rare treat to have seen it! I rate it as one of the all-time best movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunrise" is still a grossly underrated film. It is one of the most emotionally powerful silent films made, yet very few people even acknowledge it outside of the die-hard cinema buff circles. In my opinion, it is far better than anything by either Griffith or Demille. F.W. Murnau is one of the cinema's best poets, and is the greatest silent director who never made it to the sound era. "Sunrise" is a much better film than the best picture winner of 1927, "Wings", which has dated very poorly. "Sunrise" still manages to break hearts even today.The cinematography is what everyone praises about the film. It is admittedly, some of the best in silent cinema. F.W. Murnau always excels in this area. What many people don't mention is how powerful of a film it is. It manages to take a simplistic story and make it into one of the human films ever. The fact Murnau manages to make you sympathize with a man who cheats on his wife and even attempts to murder her is amazing. Both of the star performances are great also. Silent film were often plagued with ludicrous and campy acting, but that is not the case here. Anyone with any interest in cinema needs to see this immediately. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Sunrise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'll have to suspend a whole lot of disbelief in order to fully enjoy F.W. Murnau's classic silent, but that's the point. "Sunrise" takes place in a fairy tale world in which love always triumphs in the end. The film's subtitle, "A Song of Two Humans," is an apt description, as "Sunrise" feels more like a song or a poem -- where images and tone are more important than logic.The initial scenes of this film are reminiscent of Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" -- indeed, the style in which Murnau shoots these segments, using dissolve editing to superimpose one image over another to ghostly effect, made me wonder if George Stevens was perhaps influenced by this film when he made his own screen adaptation of Dreiser's novel, "A Place in the Sun." Poor farmer George O'Brien, bored with dowdy country wife Janet Gaynor, is lured into an ill-advised love affair with a siren from the big city. She suggests that O'Brien kill Gaynor by drowning her and making everything look like a boating accident. At the last minute, he can't do it, and the film changes directions drastically, as O'Brien and Gaynor, who overcomes the newly founded terror of her own husband, spend a day in the city, falling in love all over again.On paper, and even thinking about it in retrospect, "Sunrise" doesn't make a lot of sense. But there's something irresistible about this sweet domestic story, in which two people who thought they knew all there was to know about each other begin to make tentative gestures at rekindling a flame that to all appearances went out long ago. Seeing these two country folk, removed from their usual environment and plopped down in the middle of the big city, juxtaposed to urban life and the ways of urban people, reinforces to us just how right for each other they are, without making condescending assumptions or resorting to the reinforcement of rural stereotypes. This movie isn't about much more than the love of one man for one woman, how that love is tested, and ultimately how the strength of its bond wins out over the hardships and bitternesses of everyday life.Murnau has fashioned a nimble, visually versatile film. It is evidence to all those who still need convincing that the late silents were more sophisticated and artistically advanced than the early talkies.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is an incredibly close-to-life, touching, tender love story, where an attractive woman (Margaret Livingston) comes from the city and sets her eyes on a local farmer (George O'Brien), who, might I add, is married with a baby. The Woman from the City selfishly convinces him to drown his wife (Janet Gaynor) in a lake so they can be together in the City. The farmer tries, but cannot bring himself to do the horrible deed of murdering his wife. Oh boy, does it come back to haunt him.This movie is filled with beautiful imagery (in fact, some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. The craft behind this movie is simply magical) which just screams German Expressionism (the director, F.W. Murnau, was German). The way they set scenes out, the links between shots and the deep meaning in some scenes is incredibly clever and very touching. I really appreciate all the hard work they put into making this movie.The acting is (surprisingly) also very believable and still, till this day, extremely realistic. The expressions, the gestures, the actions all seem natural, realistic. It hasn't dated at all, and I don't think this has any 'silent acting' (which definitely does look dated). In other words, I thought the acting was amazing. The characters really drew them in and you could feel what they were feeling.If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you get the DVD and watch it! The DVD is fantastic (very crisp and clear colour), plus I found the commentary very, very useful and showed me things I didn't know or didn't realize. It is extremely informative and very useful, I definitely recommend listening to it.This is the third silent film I've seen, and this is possibly my favorite. A very dark film, but so wonderful and touching at the same time. The imagery itself is worth a look - the fine details are excellent and a joy to watch. A beautiful romance/melodrama fit for people of all ages (I'm 15 and I really, really enjoyed it). Absolutely breathtaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silent Symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary Pickford once commented that, if you didn't know it happened the other way around, you'd swear that talkies came first and silents afterward. What she meant, I think, was that silent movies, especially toward the mid-to-late '20s, achieved feats of camera-work, lighting, composition, and cinematic expressiveness that talkies spent decades learning to equal. Compare the grand sets and sweeping camera movements and fluid cinematography of, say, the Douglas Fairbanks "The Thief of Baghdad" with any talkie made before, say, 1935, and you'll see that the aural step forward was accompanied by a larger visual step backward. "Sunrise" is silent cinema at its peak. Many have commented on the dazzling camera movement; the amazing, expressionistic sets; the ease with which it tells a story in purely cinematic terms, with minimal titles and ingenious little camera tricks. What makes it really unusual for anything from that era is that the story still holds up. (Two others that achieve this: "The Wind" and "The General.") While some have been put off by its abrupt shifts from melodrama to comedy and back again, I think Murnau was consciously testing the limits of genre, creating a unique tone poem that resisted categorization. Add to that the natural, unhammy performances of handsome George O'Brien and demure Janet Gaynor (who, in Fox talkies, often over-peddled her sweetness) and you have a universal work that can catch modern audiences off-guard with its visual beauty and emotional power. It's so expressive that it really doesn't need a musical soundtrack, but the one accompanying the TCM print -- a little Wagneresque bombast here, a little "O Promise Me" there -- is appropriate and pleasing. A real wallop of late-silent-era magnificence, and one you can show to the uninitiated without fear they won't comprehend or be moved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic Parable Evolves Beautifully Into a Silent Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though there are heavily over-dramatic moments as well as trivial, excisable ones, this 1927 masterwork by German expressionistic filmmaker F.W. Murnau is still an impressive piece of silent cinema released just days before the arrival of the talkie, "The Jazz Singer". It does seem a shame that the sound revolution made films as expressive as "Sunrise" obsolete just as film auteurs like Murnau, Chaplin (1931's "City Lights") and Carl Theodor Dreyer (1928's "Le Passion de Jeanne d'Arc") were reaching their artistic peaks. "Sunrise" is essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand how emotionally resonant silent cinema can be when directed by a master of the form.Adapted by Carl Mayer from a German short story, the story is really a fable revolving around three characters ? a farmer, his wife and a woman from the city. Feeling stagnant in his marriage, the farmer embarks on an affair with the city woman who is on holiday in the country. The melodramatic elements of the story fall into place as the woman suggests the farmer kill his wife and sell his farm to move with her to the city. He nervously goes through the steps to take his wife out on a boat in order to drown her in what he will design as an accident. His true feelings for his wife intervene but not before his wife, realizing his intention, runs away into the city. He chases her and makes amends, and together, they have a spirited, romantic adventure in the city. With their marriage solidified, they encounter a storm when they take the boat back to the farm, and then fate takes its hand on the three characters.The most startling aspect of the movie is the visual element which carries through the same stylized exaggeration of Murnau's German classics, "Nosferatu" and "The Last Laugh". Far more than the simple storyline or even the acting, the shimmering cinematography by Karl Struss and Charles Rosher and the impressive art direction headed by Rochus Gliese are what resonate today, as they all serve to add emotional weight to what is essentially an anti-adultery parable. The most impressive sets are of the realistic-looking city captured with all its pervasive impatience and scarifying traffic, and in particular, the Luna Park amusement park abuzz with futuristic rides and hedonistic crowds. A couple of impressive scenes involve the farmer and his wife oblivious to the traffic as they rekindle their love amid honking horns and piling vehicles.Overall there is an impressive use of deep shadows and exaggerated set pieces to mirror the inner feelings of the characters. Even though it is a silent, the soundtrack on the DVD has the original orchestral score and effective sound effects to help bring another dimension to the story. Just twenty years old, Janet Gaynor uses her innocent manner and porcelain look to strong advantage as the wife, but it is the little-remembered George O'Brien who turns in the film's most powerful performance as the farmer, especially in his guilt-ridden plea for forgiveness outside the church where they witnessed a wedding. To her credit, Margaret Livingston plays the other woman with relative subtlety even though she is dolled up as a Louise Brooks-look-alike flapper.The 2003 DVD has a terrific set of extras starting with informative commentary by cinematographer John Bailey, a protégé of the film's main cinematographer Struss. He also contributes remarks to ten minutes worth of outtakes that have been miraculously saved in the studio vaults. There is a forty-minute partial reconstruction of Murnau's 1928 follow-up film with Gaynor, "Four Devils", made up completely of stills and drawings and a narrative track. Production stills and the original trailer for "Sunrise" complete the extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Sunrise' has gained many plaudits over the years, right from its special Oscar for artistic achievement shortly after release. It has been a long wait to see this movie but finally did and I have to say it is as good as people claim.Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien play a young couple whose lives are disrupted by the arrival of Margaret Livingston, a young streetwise flapper from the big city. O'Brien becomes enamoured with Livingston, who persuades him that his wife should be got out of the way to ensure they can build a new life, without interruption, in the city.There are numerous examples of Murnau's artistic flair within this movie, whether it be shots with many different things going on within them, close-ups, overlaid shots, and many more. My favourite was when man and wife walk through an idyllic landscape to find that in reality they are blocking the traffic!There are scenes of high tension and emotion - the scenes in the boat, both in the calm and in the storm, the meeting of man and city girl in the field, the tram ride - but also alongside there is a fair amount of humour - the peasant dance, with the girl spectator almost losing her frock, the broken statue, and the drunken pig which runs away from the fair. The balance between the two sides of the story is perfect.Incidentally the DVD transfer is excellent, with a choice of three soundtracks - the original Movietone one, with music and sound effects, a new orchestral one, and a commentary. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserves all its praises and more. I feel very privilidged that I got to see it in a 1920's film theatre at a film festival 4 yrs ago, with an iridescent print, as close to the original silver nitrate print as possible, with a live orchestra performing Carl Davis' new(ish) score. George O' Brien was a wonderfuly delicate silent actor, and Janet Gaynor is magnificent. Close to a religious experience, is how I would describe seeing it, but that sounds over the top, doesn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in the same week as 'The Jazz Singer', F.W. Murnau's masterpiece 'Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans' represents the pinnacle of silent film art. In outline, the story doesn't sound like anything special. A young man from the country has an affair with a voracious flapper from the city. She convinces him to kill his wife, a simple country girl. However, it's Murnau's presentation of this simple but powerful story that makes it unforgettable. He takes what we expect from silent films - the form of storytelling, the cliches, even the plot twists - and turns them on their head.To the modern viewer, silent film can sometimes seem difficult to watch, with leaden action and hackneyed situations. Murnau seems almost to comment upon this fact in this film - the camera is frenetic, especially in the scenes set in the city. Lights, movement, rushing people, automobiles madly crowding the roads - it's a gorgeous sight. The contrast between tranquil country and maurauding city, darkness and light, sunrise and sunset - even sound and silence - are all explored with expert subtlety.It's a shame that Murnau is best known for `Nosferatu', a much lesser and rather derivative horror story, rather than this, the Citizen Kane of silent cinema. Only a few years after `Sunrise's' release this form of art was dead, just as it had found its feet as a legitimate form of art.If you only ever see one silent film - see `Sunrise'. It may well change the way you think of silent film forever.</fullReview>

I have never seen silent movie acting as naturalistic as it is done here. And I have probably never cried more in any movie theater.

		<fullReview>I had never really been a great fan of silent films (still not, to be honest), but this trancends the barrier between the two film forms. Simply it is wonderful cinema!I watched this a few years back as part of my degree course and was simply overwhelmed by its inventiveness, humour, visual poetry and cinematography. When a film can draw you in completley and make you lose track of time then it has succeded. Sunrise does that and more.The effect it has had on contemporary film-makers is immense; Se7en, for example, was heavily influenced. An interesting interview with that film's d.p was published in Sight and Sound a few years back where he raved about Sunrise and how he used it for certain shots in Se7en.Any one who wants to wallow in unashameded romance could do a lot worse than watch Sunrise. Sometimes less is more (are you listening Hollywood?)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best and most powerful love story that I have ever seen. It is the story of a farmer who feels that his life is to simple and boring. He is seduced by a woman of the city who talks to him of living in the city and the excitement of the city. The film brilliantly shows a montage of city life and the excitement of the city while they are lying in a field. The farmer is convinced life would be better and more fun in the city. But, he has to kill his wife.On the way to the city he does indeed make an attempt to move toward her to kill her. But, he doesn't. I felt that inwardly he was torn. He still loved her (though those feelings were being repressed). From there he realizes he made a mistake and makes attempts to reconcile. It is not until they see a wedding that he realizes how much he loves her.Sunrise! Thus the title. Murnau's use of lighting to show mood is brilliant. The cinematography is inspired. It is hard to believe that there is only music. There are very few cue cards. But, they are not needed. There is never any question as to what emotions are being felt.The movie really draws you into it. There is the story and there are also many lessons that can be learned as well. This movie has many levels to it. This is a definite 10 and I intend to see this again. I think additional viewings will draw out even more. This is the best and greatest silent movie ever made.</fullReview>

In a day without scripts words and catch phrases,it really took some imagination and to put these splendorous images to lyrical form. The raw emotions displayed in this magical film capture the senses and I was entranced the entire time watching it. George O'Brien's husband character was truly a marvel to behold. His emotions sparked anger and passion from one moment to deep remorse and dark brooding pain the next. The repentant and contrite husband truly loved his wife and his scenes with Gaynor were very intense veiled in a genuinely poignant love for each other. What an expressive and gifted actor!Of course Janet Gaynor's wife character ultimately was his light of his life and she of course was the sunrise at the end of her husbands long dark night and of this wonderful film. It's a shame they don't make them like this anymore. A true work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen - and it's 80+ years old!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began watching this movie quite skeptically. I am not typically a big fan of the silent movie era. There are a few that break the mold and capture my fascination, and this is at the top of the list. And it's not because of the plot, or even the actors. It's solely because it is simply one of the most visually beautiful and artistic movies I have ever seen.The director, Marnau, and the Cinematogrophers were pure geniuses. They accomplish what no other film or camera had been able to before - and that is to make the bulky camera seem to become weightless and no longer tethered to its immobile base. It actually appears that the camera takes flight - especially during the marsh scene. Also, the use of superimposed images is quite stunning and adds to the dreamlike atmosphere of the movie.The plot is quite simple and one that has been done hundreds of times since then. But the plot is secondary compared to the visual art that seems to be the primary objective of their film. So many frames of this film could be frozen and become a framed painting, they are that beautiful and artistic. It's hard to believe that the city shots were on an elaborate set.In terms of the actors, they do an adequate job - but again that is not what draws me to this film. Janet Gaynor plays "the Wife" and is so delicate, young and innocent looking - like a porcelain child doll. She has such large, saucer-like eyes and even her hair is doll-like. Margaret Livingston, as "the Woman from the city" does quite well in making herself contemptible and trashy. She is quite brash and arrogant - all the things the sweet wife is not. It makes you dislike the mistress that much more.I was really surprised how much I liked this film and look forward to re-watching it again and again - as I believe the beauty captured here, and my appreciation for it, will grow with subsequent viewings!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful pieces of cinema I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released just eleven days before the premiere of the first ever talkie, The Jazz Singer, F.W. Murnau's masterpiece is both one of the last great silent pictures of the age and probably the zenith of early expressionist cinema.It's a simple tale, but in Murnau's masterful hands the film becomes a breathtaking and visually poetic fable of temptation and redemption. A simple and naive farmer, simply referred to in the film as The Man (George O'Brien) is seduced by a visiting Woman From The City (Margaret Livingstone), who convinces him to kill his loyal young Wife (an Oscar winning Janet Gaynor) by drowning her in the lake and making it look like an accident.He almost goes through with his plan, but breaks down at the last minute as he realises his own wickedness and they spend the rest of the day in the city themselves, rediscovering the love they once shared so freely. On their return home across the lake disaster strikes.The cinematography on this film is nothing short of sensational and is simply jaw dropping in its imagination. The film opens with a wonderful montage of people escaping from the city for the summer, whilst, later on, there is a beautiful shot of the two lovers walking through traffic that fades perfectly into a romantic countryside stroll and finally cuts back again. There's also an evocative dreamlike scene where The Man imagines himself drowning as water washes over him whilst lying on his bed. This camera trick is repeated a couple of scenes later as The Man becomes haunted, perhaps even possessed, by the figure of his lover as he struggles with his conscience.On top of these, there are two beautiful long tracking camera movements early on. The first follows darkly vampish Woman Of The City walking through the small town, whilst the second (and even more impressive) sweeps along with The Man across the marshland as he heads for a riverside rendezvous with his lover.My vocabulary isn't big enough to describe the beautiful brilliance of this film. As a piece of innovation, nothing came close to matching this until the arrival of Citizen Kane nearly fifteen years later. However, where this film really succeeds is in its soul. The scenes between O'Brien and Gaynor are both touching and heart-warming. It's a celebration good over bad, love over lust and ultimately of redemption in the wake of deceit.It's certainly a simple tale, but sheer verve, beauty and heart with which it is told elevates it to something so much more powerful, compelling special. A truly magnificent achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest achievements in the silent-film world; Janet Gaynor is in a perfect performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what I can say about Sunrise that hasn't been written already, but here's my take- this is a triumph of emotions. Simply put, the story by Carl Meyer is almost deceptively simple. F.W. Murnau, the legendary director of Nosferatu, helmed his first American film, and it's quite possibly his best. By utilizing a big budget, lavish sets, exceptional actors, cinematographers that bring forth effects and camera tricks as well as they do capturing faces, and an indispensable musical score, he created a masterpiece of tremendous proportions. While a small film, the style that is taken mixes fantasy and reality like few films in the era (and some films in the modern era) accomplished. On top of the fact that he was able to procure actors George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor (my favorite), and Margaret Livingston for the film, and to get sublime, terrifying, funny, cute, sad, tragic, and compassionate performances out of them, he doesn't compromise his vision. Worth to check out on the big screen if not on the little one, Sunrise will please even non-silent film fans; the Cashiers du Cinema hailed it as the best film ever made. It does stand up by itself as being, for lack of a better word, timeless. A++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The King of the Silent Era, FW Murnau, produces what I think is his greatest work...of those that I've seen anyways. His film is about the rebirth of a love and of a fresh start to an old life.Murnau does a masterful job, of course, in telling the story of the husband and wife rekindling their love after years of mental separation. He sees to it that his audience experiences every emotion that his characters are going through. He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry, and then he'll hit you over the head with a hockey stick, and then do it all over again ten minutes later.Being a silent films, Murnau has no choice but to employ the age old film technique of "show, don't tell," and Murnau is the master of it. One of the things I really liked about Sunrise is the almost complete lack of cue cards. When watching other silent films like Nosferatu and The Golem, you will notice the overuse of cue cards at completely unnecessary moments, while the above mentioned are still quite exquisite films in themselves. Sunrise admirably shys away from this. Sunrise is a truly touching story. Since love is an emotion that all deserve to feel, Sunrise is a very simple, no BS film. Anyone with any hint of intelligence can watch it and get a good time out of it.In the end, Murnau has pulled off a masterpiece. A Great of the silent era surpassed only by Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and only barely at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MODERATE SPOILERS Occasionally, you catch a silent film that makes you realise just what a marvellous art form they were, and just how different to talkies. This is one of them.Early on, you might shudder at the tired old set-up -- basically decent man seduced away from Virtuous Wife by Femme Fatale --while still admiring the photography and art direction etc.But once the husband and wife reach the city, and rediscover themselves, it becomes one of the most charming films you could ever see, talking, silent, colour, monochrome, whatever.Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien make an ideal screen couple, and their adventures together in the town are so funny and touching and tender, you will so want them to work out their differences and stay together.The last section of the film returns to the melodramatic -- almost bathetic tone -- that we tend to stigmatise silent films as wallowing in, but by this time, you identify so strongly with the characters, that you are completely caught up, and prepared to forgive the fact that dramatic tastes were different eighty years ago.And the film looks like one of the most beautifully lit gems the cinema has ever seen from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The key of Murnau's cinema lays in its simplicity. He must have been one of the most generous directors in film history. His ideas are clear and accessible, his symbolism is straightforward, and his construction of drama is basic. What marvels of Murnau is his inexhaustible inventiveness, the novel and original ways in which he builds up his films. One could think that he was a puritan, as it is evident where he stands in his usual good vs. evil dramas, but he allows us to take sides only through the emotional power of the image. Sunrise is not a battle between `the good countryside' against `the evil city', rather than one between night and day, or light and shadow. The city displays a number of possibilities for the country people (their reunification, the assumption of their identity), and it's an inevitable state they have to pass through in order to return home transformed. Murnau's direction orders an emotional chaos making the best use out of the rudiments of the craft, so a title card can be not only mere text but a dramatic element (the word `drowned' literally drowns), and the music score supply a voice for the characters (the desperate husband looking for her wife in the lake). Sunrise's greatness is also embodied by its modernism. The script joins smoothly a variety of genres, from thriller to slapstick to melodrama, keeping an unbeatable pace. The acting reaches a new standard for the silent era; grimaces are restrained to give place to a somehow naturalistic technique. The camera movements are highly sophisticated but nevertheless justified to the characters' actions. Murnau's touch and dramatic composition appears in every image, revealing him as the best organizer of film space ever. Take the vamp's irruption into the farmer's table. Her intrusive role in that universe is evident from the way Murnau arranges her presence in the frame. Or the geometric organization (in horizontal layers) of the general shots of the village. As the sublime master of tension that he was, Murnau takes his `Song of Two Humans' almost into abstraction. Tension that evolves from opposite forces cohabiting in the same space and misplaced forms altering an apparent order. Sooner or later, as in Dreyer's films, grace burst into scene and restores a lost harmony. In Dreyer's films one accepts this irruption in an intellectual level. In Murnau's, on the contrary, from a strictly emotional one. If cinema helps us discovering the bond between an image and the emotion that the image radiates, there were certainly no films in the silent era's autumn that got as far in that matter as Sunrise did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUNRISE is one of those films that carries both its art and heart on its sleeve...and pulls it off. The story of "simple people" from the country nearly being destroyed by the evils of civilization (symbolized non-too-subtly in The Man, His Wife and The Woman From The City) is, on the face of it, trite and rather condescending, not to mention cliched to the max. BUT...the glowing beauty of the images, the gliding camerawork, the realistically stylized settings, the almost naturalistic performances combined with a heartbreakingly honest emotional connection, and even the strong hint of Catholic spirituality combine to take this beyond mere story-telling. It becomes poetry in pure cinematic terms. To me, the best part of the picture is in the church, when the man and wife watch a young couple get married and silently remember their own vows. The acting of Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien (as well as the priest and the newlyweds) is so pure and restrained, so real, so simple, when he breaks down sobbing into her lap, it's like lightning striking your soul. Anyone not moved to tears by this moment is doomed to like nothing better than video games for all eternity. SUNRISE is a film that proves there is truth even in the "simple" ways of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silent masterpiece of a common story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best films take common, ordinary situations in people's lives and express them so coherently and truthfully that they are almost painful to watch on screen. You care about the characters at once, even when you see their foibles and flaws. You yearn to see a happy ending, and you are left wondering if there will be one. You are transfixed by what you see and don't dare to get up for even a drink of water and miss a moment. Sunrise is a film like that. It tells the story of a common country family almost destroyed by the lure of a trampy woman from the city. But what is special about a 1927 version of this story as compared to a more modern interpretation is the spirituality and love inherent in it. Back then the best directors were brave enough to add a spiritual, religious influence in their films. They were not afraid of jeering atheists who might pan their films for being sentimental and spiritual. The films produced today in comparison are utter garbage for the masses, removing any element of spirituality which affects normal people's daily lives. They ignore the fact that man is a tripartite being: body, soul, AND spirit. Murnau was clever enough as a director to understand this fact, and incorporates it into his film. Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien are perfectly cast and Janet's reactions in particular, after almost being murdered, and so profound it's unbelievable. She reacts exactly like I would react in the same situation. Sunrise is well worth seeing, and should be required viewing in any film class or retrospective festival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murnau seems to be gaining a new appreciation among cineastes. I had just finished watching a beautifully restored print of "White Mane", Lamorisse's masterpiece, and tuned in TCM's Silent Sunday feature, Murnau's "Sunrise".First, I must agree that his imagery is superb, a cinematic Atget.The downside was the plot. A muddled variant on Dreiser's "An American Tragedy". There seems to be a recent trend toward "drown your lover" films. The matter-of-fact aspect of the murder plot left me wondering about the seeming lack of humanity. Saying more would be revealing too much. Suffice to say, I was left to speculate about what constitutes a deal-breaker in a marriage.The more confusing aspect was the sense that middle Europe was a suburb of Los Angeles. We drifted between the Black Forest , 1920 Berlin and L.A. Villagers evoked scenes from "Frankenstein"--not horror, but peasant life.The most telling scene for me was the open trolley ride from forest to big city. It was a magical scene, moving through space and time. It recalled for me the similar ride in 1940's Philadelphia from Fairmount Park to Woodside Amusement Park.Given the time in which "Sunrise" was made, it certainly broke new ground in imagery. Unfortunately, the narrative was More banal melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau worked with this film for a several, or few years. Meanwhile the era of silent film ended, it was not as interesting as films with both picture and audio when finally finished.Though there was at the same time some argues about how the sound in further films would sabotage the works of art. Sound had nothing to do with film in general.As the viewer can see in this picture there aren't a lot of textual phrases between the silent clips - Murnau must have mostly relied on simple expressions and montage footage (as Sergei Eisenstein researched on a different continent at the same time). Also the director uses effects with pictures on pictures, what would be called special effects at the time.For instance when George O Brien (playing the man) sits on the bed wondering about if he really should kill his wife and the other women suddenly appears as a ghost, holding him from behind.Also animated texture makes this one of the last and remembered moving picture from the silent era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to say what is the best attribute of this amazing film. It captures perfectly "that intangible something" between a man and a woman when they become married and promise themselves to each other. It achieves and exemplifies in just 95 minutes the highs and lows of married life, the trust, particularly by a woman that her man will never hurt her as she is vulnerable, forgiveness, the deep love, the temptations of outside forces, the sticking together thru thick and thin, sometimes the stumbles each may make and that one thing which no one can ever take away, their history together! I think for me it is the casting,along of course with the performances by the two leads, which shines in this film. The Man is the most mannish man I have ever seen in silent film, the restraint with his makeup (unusual in silent films) along with his large frame compared to her tiny frame, simply demonstrates this, that at the end of the day, women like to be protected by their man and men like to do the protecting, that will never change, it has always been the case. Within a marriage, people often behave differently to their public persona, only each member of that couple sees the true other person. The barber shop scene was particularly lovely to watch the married couple's interaction, it shows when you are in love, the simplest of things make you happy, to see your soul mate happy, makes you happy. This film spoke to me very deeply. Perfection on screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", which means the new beginning: A catchy expression of two intimates, deals with country versus city and the unending triangle. The film was directed by M.W. Murau. There are three keys actors in the movie, which is the man (a farmer), the wife (the farmer's wife), and the city woman(an attention-getting woman). The man is a disloyal, vicious, and sinful male but he is in the low class. The man's wife is a reminiscent, loyal, and holy female but likewise falls in the lower class. The city woman is a sinister, convincing, and persuasive female but she is in the high class, higher than the farmer's wife. There are three scenes which focus heavily on the themes (loyalty, betrayal, and redemption within love) of the movie. The first scene is where the wife is being retentive about being deeply in love with her man because they were loyal. In this scene there were medium shots, long shots, and close- up shots. The editing's were jump cuts and dissolve. The camera movement was tracking. The camera angle was a low angle camera. The sound was a score but it felt mourning, melancholy, and thoughtful. The second scene is where the man and the city woman kiss passionately because it centers on betrayal. In this scene there were medium shots, and close-up shots. The editing's were jump cuts and dissolve. The camera movement was tracking. The camera angle was a low angle camera. The sound was a score but it felt romantic, carefree, and joyful.The third scene is where the man and his wife enter the church because it deals about redemption. In this scene there were long shots, medium shots, close-up shots, and subjective shots. The editing's were jump cuts. The camera angle was a high angle camera. The sound was a score but it felt intense, focal, evangelical, and touching. The first scene is where the wife is reminiscing. Firstly, there is bread which means life but there are brown and black colors, which mean home and unhappiness. Secondly, there is a gray color, which means sadness. Furthermore, there are red, yellow, and white colors, which mean all things intense, happiness, and marriage. The second scene is where the man and the city woman are kissing. Firstly, it is night which means unknown. The colors are red, brown, and black which mean power, outdoor, and evil. Secondly, there is a moon, which is the feminine symbol. Moreover, there are red, brown, and black colors which mean power, outdoor, and evil. The third scene is where the wife and the man enter the church- matrimony. Firstly, there is black and white colors, which mean power and purity. The priest means unity. Secondly, there is a Bible means who God is and what he wants yet expect from human souls. Additionally, there are flowers which mean strength but black and white which means power and marriage. If you really want to learn about feelings, I will recommend this film to you because it deals with morality difference and how the universal triangle creates conflict.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film to watch when you have some free time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Sunrise I can for the most part say that I have started to love movies from the early 20th century. I'm used to watching movies with over the top special effects and a big budget and going to something like this I can honestly say that I wasn't excited. The story for the most part is about a man who owns a farm and lives with his wife that is convinced by a city women to kill his wife and live with her. However, the farmer decides not to kill his wife. Which then leads to him trying to rekindle his relation with his wife. Which in all honesty, makes no sense. The fact that the wife would feel any emotions for him after he tried to kill her is just baffling. Although, one thing I did enjoy was how well the special effects were in 1927. It was almost like they were showing off what they could do. For the most part if you're wondering whether or not you should watch it, yeah. The movie was still enjoyable to watch even though I had some issues with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people of the city goes to the countryside on vacation. A Woman of the City lingers. She entices a farmer to starts spending money on her. She pushes him to sell his farm and even on a plan to drown his wife. He reluctantly sails out with his wife but can't bring himself to actually complete the deed. His wife is heartbroken at almost dying. They end up in the city where he wins her back. As they sail back home, a storm comes and capsize their boat.The style and special effects are striking. There is one particular scene that completely wins me over. The farmer is struggling at home about murdering his wife. Then the Woman of the City in a double exposure appears behind him caressing and encouraging him. It's not only seamless but is actually perfectly constructed as his interior struggle. The movie is a little extended after he wins back his wife but the drama picks up again with the storm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master of German expressionism Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau depicts the great urban versus rural divide in 'Sunrise'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The impact as well as influence of F.W.Murnau's 'Sunrise' on human society can never be undermined.It was one of the early films which tackled complex themes such as rural versus urban divide.Murnau's film focused on family values with a husband and a wife living happily with their child.The portrayal of the city woman as a wicked lady reinforced the belief that urban milieu is chaotic whereas its opposite rural milieu is epitome of goodness.There is no doubt that there are many silent film classics which have made their mark in the history of cinema.Sunrise is one such classic which continues to inspire viewers as well as filmmakers globally due to its simple story and revolutionary shooting techniques.However, Sunrise is more than a mere classic which everybody would love to watch.According to a legendary anecdote,Alfred Hitchcock of France, Monsieur Claude Chabrol used to state that he never talked about cinema with those who hadn't seen Sunrise.This can be termed as the apt advice to those viewers who fail to understand why a lot can be learned by watching silent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis for Sunrise (1927)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is a silent romance movie that revolves around two people. This stars George O'Brien (Man), Janet Gaynor (Wife), and Margaret Livingston (Woman from the City). It can be tragic at times, but things can work out really well at the end for the ending to be happy. This is another example about it. A love-hate relationship can be hard to overcome when it comes to some people who find it hard, but this is one relationship that we can remember for a long time.Here, the man was convinced by another woman to drown his wife. Does he do it? Almost! I never would have guessed that this love relationship between the man and the wife would be on-and-off. They often have fights with each other, but that doesn't stop them from loving each other. It reminded me of some other on-and-off love relationships, mostly from the 80's. At this point, I don't think I would want to have fights with other people. Fighting and arguing can get people in trouble sometimes, but if they do it too often, then they can really get in trouble. Some people react before they think, but sometimes, it's best to overcome difficulties by thinking about the situation and taking action in the best way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very pleased after viewing Sunrise.I did not have very high expectations for the film since I am not accustomed to silent films and prefer dialogue, but was surprised to find that the simple yet moving story was effective and emotional.Since the characters voices could not be heard, I felt that the viewing was in some ways similar to reading a book since my imagination often filled in for what was not there.I also enjoyed how the film starts into emotionally dark territory, and then transitions to bittersweet.Despite the lack of dialogue, I was still very satisfied with Sunrise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took a circuitous route in my journey to finally see this movie. I read the novel "Nosferatu", written by Jim Shepard, then rented the film "Murnau, Borzage &amp; Fox Documentary". I then decided to look at all of Murnau's films (most of which can be seen on Youtube). Sunrise was the first American film by Murnau that I have seen.Wow. Yeah, the story is melodramatic, but if I one just strips away the maudlin aspect of the film and seeks out a universal truth and allows oneself to marvel at the cinematography and camera shots...well, this was a beautiful to watch and experience, and Janet Gaynor was wonderful.Spoilers-I have to admit that I started laughing a little about the main male character's anger management issues. He throttles one woman twice and then plots to kill his wife. His hands at least are pretty murderous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise (F.W. Murnau, 1927) The only other time I've ever seen Sunrise, it was on a VHS rental that seemed to be a copy of a copy: the picture left much to be desired, and the tracking failed to fix it properly. Even then I knew I was in the presence of something great. Thankfully the better-quality DVD is on Netflix so I could even better appreciate its brilliance, its beauty. It would be a mistake to underestimate the film's slow pacing and occasional forays into melodrama: those are not its flaws, but its accomplishments. The DVD commentary pointed out many facets of individual scenes that I would not have noticed, camera placement and so on. This may be the closest to a perfect silent film that was ever created.There are several shots that I can safely say I love.1. The moon in the sky as the Farmer walks along the countryside to his rendezvous with the Woman from the City. 2. The City Woman's walk from her room down to the lake.3. The long shot of the Wife sitting in the boat while her husband is chasing the dog.4. The City Woman's crazy little dance by the water, just after the dreamlike shots of city life superimposed overhead.5. The Maid's joy toward the end of the film.6. The very last couple of shots.This film is sheer poetry, a must-see for lovers of cinema. A work of art if any motion picture ever was. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film of a man finding what is truly important to himself. He is enthralled in a world of controversy between two females while he is married. He also has a lot of battles within himself about what decision he should make. The actors do a great job of expressing themselves and are very theatrical throughout the film. Which helps because it is silent, even though it is silent it is still quite easy to follow the storyline. The sets in which they shoot the scenes are detailed for the time period and the music with the scenes flow together nicely. The music also helps you get the feel for the mood in each scene. The ending also has quite the twist. I'm not a big romance film person but I do think this film was done well and is worth watching.</fullReview>

I liked how the actors used their facial expressions and emotions to keep us following along. I cannot say I love watching romantic movies but this one wasn't too bad. The editing was done well and some of the digital graphics that were present fit in well especially for the time period. The plot dealt with issues that people today still have problems with.

		<shortDescription>Haunting, lyrical, poetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was casually viewing this film, and found myself delighted by one close up shot: that of an inebriated pig! Murnau's camera takes what might have been a mundane scene by any other director, and turns it into something sublime.A big part of what worked in this movie for me was the acting skills of Janet Gaynor. With a face that could look utterly sweet and genuine, she could just as easily look stupidly naive. This suits her role in 'Sunrise' perfectly, as the innocent country wife. It suited her well in what I consider the ONLY version of 'A Star is Born', in which she played star-struck country girl Esther Blodget to Fredric March's alcoholic and dissipated Norman Maine.As another reviewer stated, Murnau freely experimented with special effects. The country couple walk into a dreamy field of clover, only to be brought back to reality -- they are not in a field, they are on a crowded city street, holding up traffic with their passionate embrace as car horns honk and a policeman blows his whistle.George O'Brien's performance may echo the histrionics of the Silent Era, but I see none of this in Janet Gaynor's (nor Mary Livingston's) performance. And to be fair to O'Brien, he succeeds quite well in the scenes that matter (the reaffirmation of his wedding vows to his wife in the church, his jealousy of the city slicker who makes a pass at his wife).I watched the movie over again, and I was convinced that this is one of the great silent films. Murnau clearly understood the power of cinema. There is wonderful subtlety here. A shot of the rushes in the water, carrying some dead branches, resembles what could be the wife's dead clinging hand. O'Brien's prideful refusal to join in the 'Peasant Dance' with his wife is softened by the loving face of his wife, and he promptly joins her in the dance enthusiastically.Janet Gaynor left the motion picture industry for all practical purposes in the late thirties. Her persona may not have been 'glamorous' enough to suit the movie-going public, but her performances in both 'Sunrise' and 'A Star is Born' show her to be one of the finest actresses of early Hollywood cinema.Murnau is probably best known for his expressionistic 'Nosferatu' (one of the earliest vampire films). I have watched it several times, but the early horror film does not elicit the strong emotional response that I got from 'Sunrise'.'Sunrise' is visual, poetic and unforgettable, much like Cocteau's 'Beauty and the Beast'. Some images stay in your mind while others leave. Cocteau's and Murnau's images are etched forever in the viewer's imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly amazing, truly heartbreaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My overall impression of "Sunrise" is that it's an absolutely amazing movie. One of the best films I have seen by far, and the best silent film I have seen. In terms of both cinematography and storyline, the movie is just unbelievably groundbreaking. The camera is extremely mobile and it doesn't shake as much as I have seen in other early films. The editing is very good, and the film itself doesn't seem as jumpy as other silent movies I have seen.Moving on to story, I found myself enthralled from the very first moments of the film. The actors were amazing, though obviously some exaggeration comes with it since it is a silent film (I will say that it's far less than others I have seen, though). The film has quite a fast pace to it, which kept my interest piqued, though I probably would have watched it even if it had been moving tediously slow, because the story itself was simply amazing. Sunrise is just an incredibly accurate portrayal of domestic abuse at its most subtle. The kind of abuse that you might see in no place and every place; that you might hear anywhere, at any time. The man is never outright physically violent with his wife, and yet their relationship meets almost every requirement of an abusive relationship. The cycle of abuse (In which abuse occurs, then reconciliation comes with apologies, denial and gifts, a calm period in which the abuse is ignored as though it never happened and promises are made, and tension-building, in which the tension once again begins to rise and the abuser begins to get angry and jealous, leading to more abuse.) is very subtle, but not so much that it would not be recognizable to anyone who knew what to look for. It was honestly, completely heartbreaking to watch All in all, a perfect portrait of socially accepted abuse in the '20s As a parting note I would like to add that while it may not have been the intention of the filmmakers to portray an abusive relationship, that is nonetheless what they have created. If unintentional, Sunrise is stunningly accurate on the attitudes towards relationships and abuse at the time of the movie. The husband commits atrocious acts and becomes significantly more attractive almost immediately afterwards, and maintains this appearance for the rest of the film. The wife becomes beautiful only after she accepts her role as the victim of his abuse and is nearly killed 'by accident'. The movie accurately depicts virtually every one of the defining characteristics of an abusive relationship. The husband is a violent sociopath. Sunrise is still an amazing movie, in terms of plot, acting and cinematography. But if you think it's a love story, you need to go watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chock-full treasure-trove for film aficionados</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without question F.W. Murnau's "Sunrise" is a solid milestone in cinema history. Made in 1927 it is the epitome of technical and creative ingenuity, unsurpassed at its time and still mesmerizing when seen today. Coming from German expressionism ? la "Nosferatu" Murnau went several steps beyond his roots and thus brings silent film making to perfection. Silent film making? Well, here we already have an asset, which isn't even Murnau's merit: Hugo Riesenfeld's score is fully synchronized with the action on the silver screen thanks to the Movietone sound-on-film method, used for the very first time here. The score thus forms a wonderfully dynamic symphony that lasts the whole length of the movie and never lets up in its intensity. Breathtaking as the music is there's also additional effective sound, e.g. church bells tolling and the like, all in masterful combination with top-drawer imagery photographed mainly by Karl Struss.But let's dig deeper in the treasure chest - you might be surprised what a 1927 movie has to offer! For instance Murnau taught the camera to move freely and seemingly without effort, he uses multiple exposures and super impositions in his montages, optical effects which are all done in camera. There are forced perspective shots with miniatures, even with midgets to give the street scenes on the backlot more depth. How about deep focus and compositions inspired by the beauty of 18th century paintings, high angles to express confined space, dream sequences with effective fades and overlays - like the one where the protagonist literally drowns in guilt? Apropos drowning: Ever seen a title card drown or emerge with the sunrise? And as far as intertitles are concerned: They are intentionally kept at an absolute minimum in "Sunrise", even the characters remain unnamed. Murnau doesn't make just a story, but a universal one. Oh, I forgot the plot: Well, it's about a man, his wife and a seductress and dark clouds brewing over the horizon. Sounds conventional? Definitely not in the Murnau version. There's no better picture that could have earned the Academy's "best unique and artistic picture" award, which would never be awarded again. The silent era was over, and there was that one picture that rose and shone in all its silent glory. You now know its name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most famous silent film of all, and one of the best, equipped with an emotional tractor beam too often absent from Murnau's eye-wideningly inventive works. George O'Brien is a farmer driven to the point of murder by a devilish flapper (Margaret Livingston). He takes his wife (Janet Gaynor) on a boat ride with the intention of killing her, but relents in the face of her terror ? and, during a day in the city, falls in love with her anew. The film begins in matchlessly oppressive, moody fashion, morphs into a romantic comedy and then takes a hard left with the introduction of a great big storm. If you can accept a romantic drama with such wild shifts in tone, and in which boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy attempts to strangle girl and then boy relents and decides he really, truly and everlastingly loves girl ? and I really can, such is the majesty of Murnau's masterpiece ? then Sunrise is just about as good as movies get. To be honest, it's almost impossible to conceive how talkies ever got off the ground, novelty aside, when you compare something like Sunrise with almost any sound picture made before 1930. Silent cinema had reached a startling apex of visual creativity, particularly in these Fox films where visionary artists were given completely free rein, with restlessly mobile cameras, jawdropping trickery and as much atmosphere as one can conceivably cram into several cans of film. Early talkies consisted of someone nailing a camera to the door like some Ozu-obsessed DIY fanatic and then not being able to move it because it was too heavy.The central performances in Sunrise are unspeakably wonderful. Gaynor won the most well-deserved Oscar you could ever possibly imagine for her work here, and in Borzage's 7th Heaven and Street Angel, giving a more stylised performance than usual, while still exhibiting much of the breathtaking naturalism that was her forte. O'Brien, who had starred in John Ford's The Iron Horse and went on to be one of his famous stock company, had clearly been directed to give a more expressionistic turn, at least in the earlier scenes, moving like a prototype Frankenstein's Monster ? all high shoulders and odd, jerky movements, as if manipulated by some heinous flapper puppeteer ? before freeing himself from the chains of destructive, avaricious lust, and consequently loosening up a bit. He's bafflingly attractive in the middle third of the film ? considering what his character has just been up to ? and appealingly repentant and lost in the frantic climax. By way of contrast, you can watch someone start to say a word in an early talkie, go downstairs, make some toast, put the kettle on, have a cup of tea, nip out to the shops because you're out of milk, catch a bus to the park as it's a nice sunny day, come back home again, wash up, go back upstairs, and find that the person is still saying the same word. There are vowels in The Black Watch that last longer than a typical working day. Sorry, I forget where I was. Sunrise! Of course, Sunrise. It's the best film Murnau ever made, from its swampy opening, through the moral quagmire of premeditation, to the rediscovery of love and life, and the affirmation of everything dear in the world. There's also a bit with a runaway piglet. It really is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brevity is blasphemy when one talks about a good movie. So i shall type out all that comes to my mind.The movie is about a farmer who falls for a femme fatale. The movie begins with a portrait of a railway station and the picture dwindles into a real-life station; a chugging steam locomotive departs the station. A lavish woman visits a tourist town and lingers there for a farmer. She poisons his mind to drown his wife and make the people believe that the boat capsized. This is one scene i was totally awed- the woman utters "Couldn't she drown?" and the letters slowly dissolve in the water. The debauched farmer returns home, enters the house without making the faintest noise and the silence is interrupted by the whinnying of a horse and he is frightened. He decides to drown his matron wife and leave the town to live the life of an aristocrat in the city. He takes his wife for a ride on the boat, tries to cast her off the boat only to snap back to his right senses and apologize. They take a tram to the city and enjoy a fun-filled outing. They jaywalk from the church staring into each others' eyes lost in oblivion, only to be interrupted by the honking of the vehicles. The love that once existed between the two returns. They visit a salon for getting the man a shave; they get possessive when people of opposite sex ogle at their spouse. The movie does have fair amount of suspense and this is one such instance- The farmer threatens to slit the throat of a man who tries to lay hand on his wife, and what appeared to be a possible murder turned out to be removing a flower from the other man's coat.They visit an exhibition of sort and the wonderful shot of the spinning wheel with the camera zooming out exemplifies editing and cinematography. In their return journey, they are trapped in a storm that capsizes their boat. The farmer, who earlier thought of drowning his wife now fights desperately to save the life of the one he loves. He provides his wife with bushes that could keep her afloat. When he regains his consciousness he doesn't find his wife in the vicinity and hollers for her. With the help of his fellowmen, his wife is rescued. The first ever Academy award for the Best Picture couldn't have had a worthier recipient than Sunrise:A song of two humans. The movie is a landmark in every facet one could think of- cinematography, symphony and editing. Though it's a silent movie, F.W. Murnau has directed it so well that the facial expressions of the lead actors speak for their feelings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise is a great movie in the sense of it's significance, it won an academy award for Best Picture, where there were two different categories for best picture at that time, a Regular Best Picture category and a Unique and Artistic Best Picture Category. Whatever that means lol(Kind of like the two different leagues in boxing when Lennox Lewis was Champion in one, and Evander Holyfied was champion in the other). Sunrise is significant in that it was one of the first films to win the best picture category and also the first to win in a category that has been vanished for many eons now(Winning Best Picture in the Unique and Artistic Category). The acting is what it is for that time, it's understandable that everything is going to be outdated, each time period has it's own style, but it's a solid movie for the most part, perhaps a little too overboard in the sappy department even for that time, but nonetheless still a great movie. The theme it deals with is very sincere and universal, 'trying to find that love and feeling in your mate that you once had years ago before you fell out of love.' There is also a lot of other stuff going on in Sunrise too such as Temptation from new flings and the temptation to react in the moment instead of thinking things through. You also have to respect a movie where the main character almost chokes a woman to death, but not just any woman, the woman that 'made' him almost kill his wife, that lustful Satan temptress, it was all her fault, no responsibility for the husband, he was an innocent bystander lured in by her evil magic spells lol. That's kind of the myopic view this movie takes, but again, the movie viewer has to remember the time in which this movie was made, and also that scene is really to be looked at as a metaphor more than anything(Not really suppose to take that scene literally, it's just difficult not too ;)). You have to appreciate the certain things movies could get away with at those different times in history, you couldn't do scenes like that nowadays with all of the political correctness anymore, so it can be kind of amusing to see what could be gotten away with in the movies, at different times in history. Overall, a great movie, I wouldn't put it on the AFI Best Films list, but I do see why it is on the AFI Best Films List. Very much worth a watch for the rekindling love story and the different camera shots that were pretty great for this movie's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is most certainly an emotional roller-coaster, but it still manages to come off as a sincere and powerful testament to love. The beginning is a little bit slow and dreary to watch, but this dark, sad mood lends to the farmer's inner emotional conflict. He actually looks physically burdened by the weight of his guilt. The visuals in this film often set the mood of the scene. For instance, when the farmer is under the city girl's trance, the ambiance is bleak; the lighting is dark and it looks as though there's a significant amount of fog. Then, when the farmer and his wife begin to reconcile in the church, the lighting and the music all become lively and bright, and the mood of the film changes with it. Still, the transitions between these drastically different moods are well handled; I thought that the scene in the church was a particularly moving transition, and the sound and visuals really complemented one another. Overall, this movie maintains a great balance of most things that I absolutely love in movies; it manages to be dramatic, suspenseful, and occasionally, even hilarious. One such funny moment features a creepy man in the city who hits on the farmer's wife. He appears again a little later in the film, and ends up harassing another young woman, prompting her to give him the slap he so very much deserves. Moments like this, and the triumphant ending make this film a very satisfying watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dare you to find fault with Sunrise. I dare you. It is almost completely impossible. Unless your favorite movie is The Expendables, you can savor this film. Like a good dish, or a nice wine, Sunrise deserves to be honored and enjoyed.Indeed the story is simple, a man who loves a woman from the city, decides to kill his wife so he can be with the woman. He is in a rowboat, about to do it, when he realized he can't. Why can't he? Because he loves his wife. They go on an adventure in the city, that ends with tragedy when his true love is washed away by the sea.Made today, Sunrise would probably be clichéd and uninteresting. Littered with false sentiment and uninspired comedy. But made in 1927, directed by F.W. Murnau, and starring George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor, Sunrise is more than a masterpiece.It's something that once seen, can never be forgotten. The film is incredible. On the lists of the best silent movies of all time, this one ranks high. Really high. In fact it is probably the best silent movie I have ever seen.Sunrise is a great film, one worth watching and re-watching, for each time something new is discovered and cherished. If you like movies at all, watch this forgotten gem, and marvel at all it's aspects. I said it once, and I'll say it again. This is one good movie.</fullReview>

In silent movies the facial and bodily expressions somehow replace the speech in communicating sentiments and emotions to the spectator, assuming very expressive forms, sometimes dramatic or tragic sometimes funny. Therefore Expressionism always combined very well with silent cinema. This movie tells us a story that could happen to anyone on its beginning,a story of love and adultery: a small farmer, living with his wife and a little son, is seduced and charmed by a townswoman who ends by convincing him to drown his wife, sell his farm and go with her to town to live together. The man tries to do that during a sail that he planned with that purpose but he repents of that on the last moment. Then it begins a sequence of admirable scenes full of poetry and romanticism marking the rebirth of love between the spouses (the wife had became aware of the former intention of her husband and her first reaction is of fear and mistrust) and the husband's deeds in order to regain the wife's love which he ends up by achieving. The performers' acting namely of Janet Gaynor as the wife, attains sublimity. When happiness seems to have returned to the couple and they return home at night by boat after a day spent in vibrating displays of amusement and joy, a sudden storm makes their boat to capsize putting their lives in danger, the wife being even considered dead because not found. But on a spectacular turn she is found alive at last, for the joy and happiness of everyone except the townswoman who is seen leaving the place at the end while the sun rises upon the land and those tormented but finally happy souls. Of course this movie has very little to do aesthetically with nowadays movies as the story has very little to do with the current moral values (with no intention of mine to disdain them). But universal sentiments and feelings of all times still make us to appreciate it rather much. And the story is told in a moving way and with great technical mastery in terms of images and scenography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silent film-making at its apex...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunrise" released in 1927, stars a young and upcoming Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien. Oddly, we never know their character's names: just the man and the woman. The plot isn't overwhelming: married rural farm couple with a young son. The man is tempted by a big-city vixen (Margaret Livingston) into affair. The vixen tries to convince the man to kill his wife so the two of them can be together. The wife figures it out, he loses his nerve, and the rest of the film is a pure delight. He begs forgiveness, and she is emotionally crushed, but the two slowly build their love again by spending a wonderful day in the city, acting like a newlywed couple. I won't give away the bittersweet ending, but these two stars never have to say a word to one another (yes, it is a silent film). The emotion they convey towards one another in almost every scene is beautiful. Gaynor is a wonder, and I confess I had never heard of O'Brien. Why this guy never had a major career is a puzzler: with his good looks and great acting, who knows? Maybe the end of silent films ended his career. The scene in the church where he is sobbing while he and his wife are witnessing a wedding is something to behold. Janet Gaynor would win the first Best Actress Oscar for this film (and two others, when you could be nominated for more than one film). With stunning black and white cinematography and a wonderful score, this film is rightly a classic. This was silent movie-making at its apex. They had finally gotten it right, then along came sound, and it would change the game. But thank God for silent films, and thank God for the wonderful Turner Classic movies for bringing them to us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 20's were still an epoch when film was yet to be defined as an art, in its specificities, in its limits (which are constantly being challenged, to our days). I think you can see the evolution of any art (in fact the evolution of anything) in two fundamental ways. You can either consider that it Had to go the way it went; or you can consider that the fact that we stand where we stand to day is incidental, or the result of a number of aspects, but that it could have gone other ways. I stand for the second attitude. And so i really have fun considering the other options, how could it have gone? Making filmic archaeology helps a lot.In film, the "other way" might have been (and was for a while) not to center the medium on visual narrative, instead purely as a visual, not necessarily narrative art. Moving images in a visceral way painting would never be able to achieve. That's what attracted painters in the first place. So if you go to folks like Man Ray (once a painter, than a photographer, finally a filmmaker), you will see that he neglected the narrative potential of the medium, instead taking it as a new way to be in the world of visuals. That was done, to consider cinema as (another) plastic art. But we never saw what that might have given, because the talkies would bring the supremacy of the storytellers, and what today is called "videoart" and other parallel movements do not satisfy me, i think better things might be done.The years 10' were built by the pioneers. The 30's were already in the footsteps of modern cinema. But in the 20' we had painters and storytellers in the same boat, each building their own possibilities. The former vaudeville theatre artists took the lead in the business of stories (Chaplin, Keaton... around Hollywood). The so called German expressionists made it in the "art business".So we have this film, by an element of the art gang, contaminated, hired and influenced by the theatre guys. A balance between story telling and the pure pleasure of taking images. This film will always have to be celebrated for how Murnau makes the camera move, such a revolution!, as big as the discovery of the montage. As a "painting" it is as beautiful as you could get by a German artist with such influences working under industry guys. As a story it is what it represents: having to do with a number of oppositions and dualities: city-country; sun-moon; stillness-agitation; quietness-vice. Where do you stand? Where do you find yourself? in frantic otherworldliness agitation of the city or in the quiet contemplation of stillness, in its shadows and lightness, in its moonish thunders and its sunrises? That's the whole point from where i stand today.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Golden Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) has so many different layers and feelings throughout the film. F.W. Murnau is a pioneer in the world of movie making and direction. He creates such a beautiful setting and such beautiful characters with very primitive technology. Perhaps this is why the film is so amazing. Murnau, and the leading actors were so focused on creating characters and creating a story, to not be bogged down by speech or soundtrack, was surprisingly, a blessing in disguise. Although obviously no script was written, the screenplay was stunning. A powerful, dynamic and quite confusing story was depicted by pictures alone. It is amazing to see how Murnau created a song of two humans so eloquently without even the slightest sound. No wonder many consider the 20s the golden era of film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic turn of event movies. I wouldn't doubt this film for a second as it tells a magic realism story that you probably wont find in any modern film today. It is a silent movie where the man and the wife have issues in their marriage leaving them in a tough position. the man ends up cheating on his wife with this other woman wanting him to move to the city to start a new life. It is a film that takes them a minute to travel from the forest to the city. The man plays a good role leaving the audience wanting to watch more. Certainly it was and still is a great movie from its time period. If you like silent films, this would be on the top list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly, the 1927 Academy Award Winning American film, "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" was a decent movie, although it was silent. I enjoyed the the full circle of the couple's relationship throughout the film: -They were in love. -He had an affair -He was going to drown his wife. -He couldn't follow through with it. -He is sorry for his actions. -They rekindle their love for each other. This full circle reminds me of the connection between the earth and sun (hence the title). I also enjoyed the usage of sound in this film. This is one of the most influential films of all time. All in all,"Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" gets 4.5 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Although it lacked sound, it was a very loud performance. I am none too familiar with silent films, however, Sunrise was very entertaining. The contrast of nightfall and the sunrise was clever. It set precedent for story/film writing for the years to come. Sunrise was also very comical. I received a good chuckle during the scene where the lovers were chasing after a drunken pig. The tracking shots were impeccable, as well. The Academy Award win for Best Cinematography proved it. The "happy" ending was also unexpected, but a nicer, far-less depressing surprise. I read somewhere that this movie is considered the Citizen Kane of silent cinema. Having not seen Citizen Kane, I cannot agree but only nod in acceptance of the idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise was a visually fun and engaging film. Techniques such as sound, lighting and double exposures were used very often throughout the film. I felt that using these techniques was a very successful tool for portraying how the characters are thinking and feeling, which in return aids the viewer in obtaining a heightened emotional awareness for the characters and the film's over all plot. Although I have always adored and appreciated silent films, this movie did not strike me as a particularly memorable or moving one. I would never blame this on the artistry of the film but more on the absurdity of its series of events. The whole idea of this woman forgiving her husband, after he has been having an affair and after he attempted to murder her completely disturbed me. The bulk of the movie takes place in the city, after the wife's almost-murder, where there is a romantic portrayal of this husband and wife very happily and romantically reconnecting, so I suppose I could say that for the bulk of the movie I found myself rather annoyed and uncomfortable.However, despite my general discomfort with the storyline, I was able to enjoy and appreciate the movie partially due to my slight obsession with Margaret Livingston but mostly due to my deep admiration for F.W. Murnau's advanced cinematic artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am usually not a fan of silent films, I love older cinema and the first of the "talkies" but silent films have never really struck my fancy until I viewed Sunrise. I have seen several, but this movie really struck a chord with me, and I found myself completely intrigued. The story (about a man having an affair with a woman from the city and the woman enticing him to murder his wife and run away with her) is great, and it is something that still rings true today. There have been modern films based around the same concept, but Murnau truly shows it the best, and without talking. I actually liked the acting, cinematography, editing, and story so much that I watched it again just a day after I had seen it the first time, and that says something. This film is just wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie did not keep my full attention. There were parts that were captivating, but the mid-section of the movie, when the couple were in the city, failed to keeping my interest. There were funny scenes during this part, but I feel like it was too removed from the plot to have any purpose other that just killing time. Odd things I noticed in this movie is whenever a transaction happened, no money was shown; the actors just over-dramatized the action of placing coins on the table. I also noticed how even though the couple was married and had a child, they did not sleep in the same bed.Irony plays a part in the story of The Man and his wife. On their return from the city and they have all their problems worked out, a storm comes and she end up missing anyway. I did not expect this to happen. "Sunrise" could be interpreted as a battle of good v. evil. The Woman From the City is the evil character, who dresses in dark clothing and seduces The Man and tries to persuade him to drown his wife. The Wife is the good character and is dressed in lighter colors and is faithful and caring towards her husband, even though she knows of his disloyalty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first silent movie I have ever sat through and watched. To be honest, I really liked it. I didn't think it was long or drawn out at all either. Plus at the end when you thought the wife died, i thought it was a typical ironic movie. When I say that I mean, his goal was to kill her and she ended up dying after he realized what he had. Then she survived, so I liked that twist. I found it was a bit confusing in the beginning because I didn't understand what the women in bathing suits and a steamship had anything to do with the movie. I thought the over all imaging of the movie was amazing for the time period it was in. An example was when the husband was imagining the woman from the city and she was popping up all around him and even though she wasn't there he could feel her next to him.A few things I didn't like or understand was why didn't the husband have any concern of what would happen to his child once he moved to the city with the woman from the city? When the husband was about to drown the wife in the boat, he heard bells that made him stop. Where were the bells coming from? Why are people so scared of a little pig? Certain parts of the movie background looked very fake, like when they walked out of the church after seeing the people get married. Over all I liked the movie, and I thought the baby was the sweetest thing ever when she was cuddling the wife and wiping her tears away. It was worth the time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was great...cinema in the 1920's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Sunrise for the first time. I had heard of the film but never ventured to see it. F.W. Murnau created a fine film that made me re-think why I love film. The first thing I noticed was the cinematography and how beautiful it was...but wait...I have seen this cinematography before in more recent films. I could be wrong, but I see De Palma, Greenaway, Fellini and Hitchcock all wrapped up into one. The use of the camera and the use of setting up a scene, visually, all had elements of these directors and their films. Some of those camera pans show up in films such as De Palma's Body Double and Scarface. I don't need to keep referring to each of these directors films, but for anyone a fan of them, you should see their trademarks all over this one. The story was solid and very dark, something I did not expect from a '20s film. I am glad I got to see this one, and now have a little more of an open mind for early film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty amazing stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to comment on this film without considering when it was made. In the genre of silent films it is a standout and among the few silent films with a musical soundtrack it must be among the very best. I think this is one of those "good for what it is" movies; to appreciate it requires a mindset receptive to an art form long since vanished. The story begins in a manner that reminds you of Hitchcock--a farmer is taken with a temptress from the city who urges him to murder his plain wife and come with her to enjoy life in the metropolitan fast lane. When it comes to committing the act, the farmer recognizes his folly and comes to a renewed appreciation for his wife. But, quite understandably, the wife is a bit skittish after realizing that her husband was on the verge of murdering her. The middle part of the film details how the farmer and his wife reconnect.There are some outstanding images that even Bergman might be proud of, like many of the scenes in an amusement park. The use of light and shadow in the scene where the farmer and his wife enter a church to witness a wedding is particularly well done. That scene serves as a symbol for the couple's re-commitment to their marriage. The reestablishment of the relationship between the farmer and his wife is settled about half way through the movie and many of the scenes after that do not advance the plot. As impressive as it is, a lot of the material struck me as director Murnau just showing off. For example, the relevance of the extensive scenes with the pig escaped me.Some of the romantic scenes between the farmer and his paramour are surprisingly suggestive and probably would have been scaled back in years when the Hays Code was in effect.Janet Gaynor, as the wife, creates a believable and sympathetic character. Her ability to express emotion with facial expressions is well suited to the medium.One of the delights of the film is observing the backdrop of city life in the 1920s. Seeing all of those old cars whizzing around is fun. Casual dress for men seemed to require suits, ties, and fedoras.The DVD has an excellent commentary track by John Bailey.One wonders what Murnau might have achieved in a more modern era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cuts to the core of human emotion and desire, but executed delicately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the fairy-tale opening scenes to the contrasting anywhere-and-everywhere backdrops and abstract characters, it's clear from the beginning of "Sunrise", that no specific political or cultural frame is intended. If anything is, it's the general humanity of the story, involving themes of love, lust, desire, loneliness, fear, betrayal and forgiveness.Sophistication could be viewed as rigorous, social training undertaken to control emotion and manipulate feeling--sophistication being something the city woman of "Sunrise" embodied. In the advertisement-drenched city (plastered with marketing keenly attuned to people's desires) the act of manipulating emotion is raised to an art form and in it, an alluring dream-scape is established--one just as fascinating as the reedy, hazy lake under moonlight of the country world. Murnau paints urban life and country life as being connected by commonalities but distinctly different in how each perspective interprets and reacts to them. In a sense, Murnau pits two closely related subjects against one another; Philosophical theory vs. Intellectualism and Pragmatic application of it. Notice how each lifestyle is painted: In country life, the people are very practical about daily tasks but romantic about emotion; in city life, people are romantic about performing daily tasks (the impractical outfit the city woman wears in the country, the fussiness associated with cutting hair and nails) yet practical about emotion and feeling (wife in the way of opportunistic bliss? "Couldn't she be drowned?").It's clear which lifestyle Murnau deemed purer and more authentic to being human ("...A song of two humans").The impressionistic, pastoral scenes feel quiet, intimate and reflective; the idealistic philosophical world--a world of elusive elements and abstract theory, where one stands alone with their mind, occasionally visiting the ideas of others to compare perspective. The busy, flashy urban scenes are equally intimate; except, here, the mind is alone in a sea of people and ideas, constantly bouncing off surroundings and perspectives; pragmatic application of intellectualism, actively through art, technology and urbanization. However, in both the man-made world of flooded ideas, or isolated, rural land of abstract philosophy, people are alone with their thoughts and emotions, unconsciously communicating only pieces of their experience to the rest of the world, allowing for all kinds of confusion (notice the many times extreme actions are taken--actions that seem cut-and-dry in their meaning--and characters question how to interpret them). Murnau also seems to make another strong statement about the general incompatibility of pure philosophy and materialism; both cannot fully unite and "live together" but may occasionally visit either world. If you want to take it further, you might even say he's created commentary about science and technology vs. religion; are the two perspectives/life paths--spiritualistic and logical--destined to diverge? While many aim to connect the two and overlap ambiguous areas in an attempt to understand more of what it is to be human, Murnau offers a provocative position by separating both parties, having them remain where they're best suited, neither attempting to relate to one another's perspective again. Murnau may imply that in keeping these perspectives separate, we better know the wholeness of our humanity...and that people are destined for roles in either world---but not both. This isn't necessarily my own personal opinion, but themes I found within "Sunrise" and I've notice similar textures in other Murnau films. Anyhow, "Sunrise" is fantastic and every film enthusiast should see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunrise" (1927) from F.W.Murnau in such a hospitality as a movie that brings us a reconstruction of a European station train, with such a visual effect in its design and good taste, that also by his direction in this silent movie which is at the brink of the talkies. It still also inspiring maybe the present viewers for a kind of simulation of a drowning on a lake during a flooding and how reversing likewise such a dramatic situation. Even by no means till the last dark beam of black moon, just before sunrise and for the same open mind to reverse two times the same situation. The nightmare inspired the perfection of this movie by Murnau, who made something like a hate's story of how loving someone else, after the apparently loss of a finally beloved woman. Distinguished getaway as paradox of a German soul like him, as luxury of the wind by night, that swallows the lucidity of their characters before the revolt of natural elements. Was him, Murnau, in his own intention for making this movie, not in Europe in Tilsit, but in California maybe near Pasadena, to give us the opportunity in thinking as viewers astonishingly euphoric by the titles like swallow on the agitated water and dissolving in the lake as catharsis of the unquiet narrative - in short cuts, by description of the events quickly occurring in the last part of this adapted story - as his own dilemma ? As though from the awareness that held and took the main characters, in such a nocturne dramatic way, to bring life from the tragedy itself of such a lavish human beings putting also at stake - as option, in their hands - to survive or dying both ? The answer is of course in seeing in it, as though it was also a kind of realistic story of everyday, testing our deep feelings in communion with the sex partner, in an imprisoned marriage for ever, during the lifetime of both enraged characters. Finally, as if it was the reverse of an episode of the war of sexes, also with such an emigrant taste from another continent. Rather, far away of the reality, in turmoil before our eyes, as fake neighbors of the victims, in a path where declined jealousies are so strongly denied and notwithstanding reverting it, in its development too with the influence of the hazard. Unlucky, in either natures, savage human nature and unrest from the elements like the wind : a stormy quest for love each other, near the abyss of souls, fighting for help and care, in the middle of darkness and rain. With pictures of water and storm brighting the screen, as supplies of a given creativity, in a precise framework of the bottom unclear to the symbolic and expressive destiny of the sinners as characters. Because adultery with a foreigner, whose sex-appeal was the reason for the first impulse for the crime of drowning his own wife, by the masculine vector of the tragedy as a young countryman attracted by a town's girl. Now over the lake interacting above, with emotion for almost the impossible. The rhythm of its plasticity as value of the compositions with perspective, since the near foreground to the bottom of the stage, in which each shot is the main strength of Murnau direction, without any kind of impressionism nor spiritualism. Because the things there are what it seems to be for the dramatic density of a silent movie, which brings in it such an evidence of thoughts of any character in position before the camera : its amplification or reduction of the space as in an open square or a closed stage, for the linking with the meaning of every scene before, during and after the storm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bells of Sunrise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will show that the director Murnau uses the sounds of the bells, as key points to the main characters actions. Murnau took this symbol, the sound of the bells, and used it as a synecdoche. He made them have a purpose throughout the whole movie, metaphorically acting like a hypnotist that snaps a person into a trance in and out at anytime. As the movie started out, the setting was very dark and spooky in a way. In the shot when the man and mistress first met up. The mistress and the moon are the key factors in this shot metaphorically. The mistress acting like a hypnotist's vixen, and putting a trance on him to kill his wife. In addition, this glowing moon acting as a symbol that helps the dirty deed. Kind of like a watch that a hypnotist holds in front of his patients. It was not until he goes home the next day that this trance takes affect. While the man was dreaming or as he wakes up, he heard the first bell ring. As he woke up, I could instantly see the change in his attitude and body language. The bells ringing just snapped him into the killer that his mistress wants him to be. Now he is on his mission to kill his wife with no emotions at all, almost like a zombie even. Murnau even shows the mistress in his head over him like a demon almost, expressing how the man feels at this time of stage. He uses the use of the external world to show us this demonic plot. There was even a barking dog that had no effect on the man. He was deaf to any other sound in the world at this moment, but the bells. It was not until him and the wife finally got out into the lake, that the man shows signs of life. The man stood up very firm and slowly walked toward his wife, as if being controlled by something or someone. Murnau gave me the feeling that this was the murder scene as I saw the terror on her face, but I was wrong. The bell rings again, but this time the camera tilted up from the boat and water to show the church. By showing the church Murnau gives this bell ring significance, and certainly expresses something different. The man totally stopped his actions, instantly his body language changed, facial expressions and attitude in one shot. He raced to land. It's as this bell ring during the day, with sunlight opposite of the moonlight was heavenly instead of demonically.It's not long that passes when Murnau gives us this third bell ring. This bell ring came as they walked out of what seems like a public place. This bell ring had significance, Murnau wanted the viewer and the couples together to hear these bells and make a relation. The bells are now working for good and are acting like epiphanies in the man's life. Ever since that second bell each one he hears is like a striking understanding of his love for his wife. As the third bell rang, the man and woman saw a church and realized someone is getting married. This epiphany brought him in the church and into the hands of God, more close to his final realization in his commitment with his wife.In the church, I saw the real emotions of the man and woman. As both of them sat in the church, he was totally subjected to her. Almost like he was begging for forgiveness in the name of the Lord. As he sat in the church, is when I heard the most powerful bell ring of all. After he hears the priests words to remind him of his own vows, be breaks down to cry. The man with his head on his wife's lap as he asked for forgiveness one last time. Here is where we see both of them get an epiphany from the bells; as the wife also realizes at this time that this is her husband's true love being shown. This is the first time Murnau showed me the bells actually ringing. Which lead me to realize he used all three other bell rings to lead up to this one. As if an equation that needed to be figured out, the question was did all of the bell rings add up to be bad or good outcomes. Since two of the bell rings where like epiphanies, I believed the outcome that I reached in this bell shot I explained was good.The man and woman leave the church as if they are the only ones in the world. That last bell was like a symbol in their marriage. They leave the church as if they are celebrating their new lives together, acting like kids and attending a party. At this point in the movie, it's hard to vision any tragedy. With Murnau not including any symbols or sounds of the bells for a while, the movie flows on. It was not until the man finds out that his wife might be dead, that we get ready for another synecdoche. When his wife has been claimed dead, the man was furious and sad. The mistress who was oblivious to the man's change of heart that he had during the day, raced to his home. Keep in mind that we have not heard any bells ringing at nighttime yet. The mistress made her way to the man in the doorway, whose image was like silhouette. At this moment I heard the last bell ring, this one is demonic. His body language completely changed and anger rose, except this time it was directed to the mistress. His anger has been directed to the root of all this chaos. It as if her own hypnotism has reversed on her, and now she is the target marked for death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #020.1: Sunrise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>020.1: Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) - released 9/23/1927, viewed previously.DOUG: We watched this F.W. Murnau classic in Film Expression class. It is probably one of the best silent films ever made. One of the things that struck me was the number of special effects, like when The Man is sitting by himself and the ghostly image of The Woman from the City haunts him. The scene where The Woman seduces him in the field is amazingly intense, certainly for a 1927 film. The middle of the movie is essentially The Man and The Wife spending the day together renewing their love for each other, and it could get boring very easily but manages to stay very romantic. The end is very intense; I really wasn't sure if The Wife was going to survive (but she does, so it's all good). I was glad to hear that this film is available on DVD (it wasn't when we watched it), but unfortunately it only comes free when you by three other movies from the same set. If I had to pick five films to show to someone who wasn't familiar with silent films, one of them would definitely be Sunrise.Last film chronologically: College (1927). Next film chronologically: The Jazz Singer (1927).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunrise" is one of those films that is practically life changing. A film of such beauty, perfection, and true emotion that I could talk about it for hours and still never fully express its excellence. This review, itself, only scratches the surface of "Sunrise"'s greatness. It covers multiple genres, and does it to entertaining and lovely perfection.It's a much different kind of love story, or just plain story. It is unlike most other films that have been made (other than, maybe, Jean Vigo's "L'Atalante", another romantic film that is hardly comparable to anything else).This is a film that turns from a weary, dark, and nearly disturbing tragedy to a light, happy, and hilarious rom com, and then into an emotional melodrama. It is a film that made me feel many emotions, and each of the emotions I felt were felt strongly, and I mean STRONGLY!!!No matter what the tone is the camera-work is fantastic! Murnau was one of cinema's most fascinating filmmakers, and his greatness perfectly shines through this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I know there are many classic Hollywood maniacs out there who would probably just assume that I'm just another modern idiot with an attention span shorter than that of a goldfish; too short to appreciate such a film. I've met too many people who would accuse me of such. But I have seen my fair share of silent film, and Metropolis is one of my favorites(and I know few who can make it through that one).The cinematography of this film is truly outstanding when put next to other films from its time. But the story is incredibly basic and some of the things that the characters do don't even make sense. In terms of interest in the story, you can pretty much shut off the movie after the first hour. I can't imagine ever watching this again.If you want an example of outstanding cinematography and early VFX, check definitely check it out. But if you're looking for something along the lines of City Lights(a FAR better film), best skip it all together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Wife Yes, My Farm Maybe, My Dog Never.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Handsome, muscular George O'Brien used to be happily married to his winsome, devoted wife, Janet Gaynor. Yes, the farm was a blissful place. Then O'Brien met and was seduced by this filthy slut from the city. You know the kind. Always wears a cloche hat, dresses in black, lots of make up, short skirts, does the hootchy kootchy right in your face while you slaver into the turf? Well, George is in Schtupp Heaven. And when the tart from town suggests he murder his wife, dump the farm, and run away with her to the city, he guiltily accepts the idea. He invites his wife to let him take her for a ride out onto the lake, where he plans to drown her, overturn the boat, and save himself with a bunch of floating reeds. George waits for Janet in the rowboat while she pretties herself up and prances down to the wharf with a bouquet. Their dog apparently wants to be taken along. The dog breaks his leash, runs to the wharf, leaps into the water, swims after the boat, and is pulled aboard. It's all too much for O'Brien. Killing his wife is one thing. But -- the dog? The wife is not as stupid as she looks. She figures out something is up, probably when O'Brien stands up and approaches her as she sits in the stern, and he's goggle-eyed and his hands are outstretched as if just about to strangle her, which is in fact the case.He can't bring himself to do it and rows her back ashore. She dashes off to the city in a state of terrible distress. He follows, filled with chagrin, and catches up. They renew their marriage vows and wander happily through the city, which resembles Disneyland or rather some cheap rural amusement park. There are comic interludes that involve J. Farrell McDonald as an effeminate photographer and a fawning Italian barber and a drunken piglet on the loose. The beaming couple enter a ballroom and do what is called a "peasant dance," which looks mightily acrobatic to the non-Terpsichorean eye and -- if it's a peasant dance at all -- is more likely to be recognized as one by somebody from Westphalia than from Waxahatchie.A great storm catches the duo while sailing back to the farm. The boat is overturned and O'Brien gives Gaynor the bundle of reeds to save herself. He's washed ashore alone and the villagers conduct a fruitless search for Gaynor on the lake. The city babe, thinking that O'Brien has gone through with their plans for drowning the encumbering wife, rushes to the stricken husband. He tries to strangle HER but before he's done there comes the cry of the villagers -- wife found alive, thank God! What kind of a guy is this O'Brien anyway, ready to strangle at the drop of a hint.It's a well-made movie, given the conventions of the time, which include outrageous overacting. Terrific storm scene as the city is deluged and the boat swamped. It's considered a classic, I know, but I can't figure out what all the fuss is about. For one thing, speaking from a position of relative ignorance, I thought the director, F. W. Murnau, was known best for introducing the swooping high-angle shot. James Mason once wrote some doggerel about it: "They took away his crane and then/ I thought he'd never smile again." Nice montage but no swooping cranes. And the story didn't seem to hang together all that well. It's a romantic drama with the middle third consisting of pointless demonstrations that you can have fun getting your portrait taken by J. Farrell McDonald. Nobody should call this screenplay "taut." O'Brien and McDonald, by the way, had worked together on John Ford's big Western, "The Iron Horse", a few years before. McDonald was a reliable Irishman, usually with names like O'Shea and Reilly, and made four or five other films for Ford. O'Brien was a close friend of Ford's and accompanied him in the mid-30s on a trip to Southeast Asia. Ford tied one on and was too drunk to get out of his hotel bed for about a week. O'Brien, after repeated warnings, took off on his own. End of friendship, at least for almost twenty years. You can see George O'Brien, who aged pretty well, in Ford's "Fort Apache" and "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon."</fullReview>

At the critical moment the farmer relents and his wife escapes to the city. He follows and they reunite in a moving exchange of remorse and forgiveness. After a day of leisure fun, their journey home ends with harrowing and unforeseen results.Believing The Last Laugh (1924) was the greatest film ever made, William Fox imported its director F.W.

Adapted from Hermann Sudermann&#x2019;s A Trip to Tilsit by scenarist Carl Mayer, Sunrise represents the greatest achievement in visual narrative from the silent era.

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Cinematographic Achievement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film is a visual experience. The greatest films are those that are so well composed and shot cinematographically, one can only be amazed by the visual genius on display, frequently the result of the intense vision and collaboration between director / auteur and the cinematographer. This is one of those films.Impressed by F.W. Murnau's amazing 'The Last Laugh' (1924), William Fox did for him what RKO would later do for Orson Welles -- bring him to Hollywood and grant him carte blanche to make a movie. It was Fox's most expensive silent picture. And as Welles and Gregg Toland did in the forties with 'Citizen Kane,' Murnau, Charles Rosher and Karl Struss did in the twenties revolutionizing film making technique with 'Sunrise.' Both Rosher and Struss received the first Oscar the following year for Best Cinematography. It also won Best Picture and Best Actress. The movie really stands out as German Expressionist film made in Los Angeles. A lot of it looks like 19th Century European paintings, which had a large impact on Furnau.At first being caught up in the Hitchcockian melodrama of the story, I almost failed to notice how the amazing composition of shots, camera movements, editing, set design, in fact every aspect of the film were all so brilliantly combined. Repeated viewings only made the film more fascinating and spectacular. It's easy (and profitable) to watch this movie over and over.For a film to be called one of the best films of all time, you'd expect extravagant sets, and perhaps a long complicated story with lots of action. But instead we get practically bare backgrounds (for the most part) and a deceptively simple plot: an unfaithful husband, after failing to kill his wife, rebuilds his relationship with her. We keep learning the same lesson over and over from all the great film makers: it's the way that a story is told that makes a film great or not.And this is certainly one of the greats. I'll give it a 10.Note: While Murnau died unfortunately in a car accident in 1931, Rosher and Struss went on to long careers in Hollywood. Struss was cinematographer for countless films including 'Limelight' (1952), as well as science fiction favorites 'Rocketship X-M' (1950), 'The Fly' (1958), and the Jackie Coogan classic 'Mesa of Lost Women' (1950). In addition to 'The Yearling' (1946), Rosher did any number of musicals including 'Annie Get Your Gun' (1950), 'Showboat' (1951), and 'Kiss Me Kate' (1953).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Song of Songs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply one of the best movies ever made, Sunrise is both an invigorating and heart-warming, yet sometimes comic and intensely dramatic experience.It seems to me that it would be hard to go past George O'Brien for the year's Best Actor and F.W. Murnau for Best Director, yet both men were not even nominated. The scene in which O'Brien's besotted farmer tries to murder his wife must surely rank as the number one dramatic moment in the whole history of the cinema. It is absolutely terrifying, and yet the sheer horror of this moment is brilliantly modified and translated into the charmingly frenetic comedy that follows.Full marks also to Struss and Rosher for their incredible, superbly atmospheric photography. (Interestingly, Struss was the official cameraman for the Awards Ceremony at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on 16 May 1929, so he had the job of photographing himself). And it is no surprise to find the designer of the movie's absolutely breathtaking sets as a nominee.I certainly won't question Janet Gaynor's accolades either, but there is another player in the film who deserves a special recognition: Margaret Livingston. Her role is vital and she plays it with utter conviction.Yes, as other reviewers have already noted, the movie is heavily Germanic in style, mood and presentation. Murnau's camera is moody, oppressively fluid, realistic, scarifying and intrusive as it draws us inevitably and inexorably into his "Song of Two Humans."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peak of human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is true that not many movies have survived from the silent era. Some were destroyed in studios, some were lost, some were totally forgotten as disposable entertainments; however, SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS directed by a pioneer of early cinema, F.W. Murnau, was bound to remain so that in our modern times we can see what film making at its peak really is. This film, deservedly considered one of the very best movies not only among silents but among movies in general, has everything: charm, humor, action, stunning cinematography, great performances, beauty and, foremost, a truly universal story. At the same time, it remains unique and original, which is proved by failure in any comparison to other films.The story is accurately referred to as a song of no place and every place since in each spot on earth, people may experience attraction, desire, fear, madness, shock, reconciliation and joy of reborn love. The story in this movie is so timeless that now, in 2007 when SUNRISE sees its 80th birthday, we can undeniably claim that this is also a song of no time and every time. The couple are very appealing and the story of the Man (George O'Brien) and the Woman (Janet Gaynor) constitutes a wonderful insight into the psyches of the both. They used to be like children...always happy, carefree and laughing but one day a woman from the city's turmoil steps in and fills the male mind with carnal desire. How can a poor wife react to her husband's fading love? What can she do when she realizes that her husband attempts at getting her drowned? She experiences shock but in time the Man will regret to tears and the bells of reconciliation will seal the rebirth of their love...yet, love always has to be subjected to test... Not to say more about the whole story, I must admit one thing in this respect: seldom have I found such a profound content that leads to no clichés or oversimplifications but, maintaining uniqueness, constitutes a real interpretation of life and its contradictions.Except for the story and its universal profoundity as well as simplicity, SUNRISE can boast a gorgeous image of the 1920s. This aspect, of course, was not that powerful 80 years ago when the film was made, but it has become attractive as the years passed by. We can see the true 1920s: streets of the city, cafés, photographer, hairdresser, costumes, the traffic that was so different but funny from today's perspective. It's an important point to mention, particularly for the viewers who love that glimpse at the past.Besides, there are many memorable moments that either move to tears or lead to gales of laughter. You will never forget the visit at the hairdresser's when fidelity of the two is being tested. I also laughed out loud at the moment of a little piggy in the fun park. The photographer with his old (for today) camera looks also hilarious when the Man poses to the picture. As for touching moments, the reconciliation in church is sublime. It leaves an everlasting impact on every viewer no matter if that "Forgive me" appeals to you or not. That touches the very core of marital status and...consider how they leave the church and all those people looking at them. Are they a newly married couple? In a sense, they are...As far as the artistic features are concerned, the performances are very fine. Not only the main cast including sweet girlish beauty Janet Gaynor and strong handsome George O'Brien, but also the supporting cast do great jobs. Margaret Livingston portrays the woman from the city with vitality; J. Farrell MacDonald as the photographer proves a true power of expression; Bodil Rosing shows what care is as the Maid. As for the camera, it is not that innovative as in Murnau's another movie, LAST LAUGH (1924) but it is equally good. Similar moments include the double picture constituting an insight into the mind. For instance, while the Man is tempted to kill his wife, we see the woman from the city whispering that into his ears. Another brilliant technical job is when the couple walk through the streets kissing each other, we see them on a meadow for a while... The storm is also filmed in a marvelous way for that time and still thrills.F.W. Murnau made several very good films in his short lifetime most of which have stood a test of time. Yet, SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS is his best work because it reaches something many other movies attempted to but failed, the peak of human nature. That nature that is so often quaked by fear, desire, revenge, hopelessness, yet, finally cleaned by sincere regret and glorious sunrise. "I couldn't give up hope..." is the sentence we are supplied with at the end and I would also refer to this. Yes, I never give up hope that there are people who see this film and cry at the end... Don't be afraid of these tears. They are refreshing like this movie made so long ago but still so powerful and deeply touching. After these 80 years, it is a wonderful entertainment unless you come to a depressing conclusion: the cinema in the 1920s, despite limited techniques, was able to supply the viewers with much more than it does nowadays... 10/10</fullReview>

This B&amp;W film starring Janet Gaynor,(The Wife,(Indre),"A Star is Born",'37, played the sweet and adoring wife who had a wonderful smiling personality and her husband, George O'Brien,(The Man,(Anses),"Fort Apache",'48, had a pained expression on his face right from the very beginning of the film. Apparently, there was a woman taking a vacation in Anses home town and he managed to take a liking to her, she was from the Big City and was a lady of the world. This sexy woman was driving Anses out of his mind and his wife was beginning to notice his strange behavior. The Man and Wife decided to take a row boat ride into the city and that is went things get rather difficult and the story gets very mysterious. A very well worth while film to view which received many Awards in 1927.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest of All Silents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, F.W. Murnau's crowning-glory, is a sight-to-behold for all true lovers of cinema. So much has been said and written about this masterpiece, that only by watching it can one truly explore its depths. It is a testament to what cinema can--and should--be, as well as what film really should explore: the human-condition. Murnau, through a myriad of photographic-devices, shows us the internal and external-states of our two main-characters, a husband and a wife. In this sense, it is one of the few truly "expressionist" films made in the Hollywood of its day, 1927.It is fortunate that Murnau was given a chance to prove what cinema was capable-of (when directors are allowed to do their craft, relatively unfettered), and what it could accomplish as a narrative-medium. In many ways, we have yet to see any equal of a Murnau of a Lang in our time, and perhaps it would do us all good to take-note of their struggles to achieve their sublime visions on-screen. It has never been easy to make personal films, yet I feel strongly that we have only scratched-the-surface since the 1920s. The battle between art-and-commerce continues, and art has faired-badly for over 15-years. However, it appears some openings are evident--people always yearn for film that speaks of their lives, which is rarely seen in Hollywood-productions. This is gradually-changing.And so, we return to films like "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", which seem refreshing even today, and show us what film can be in the right-hands. Yes, there are double-exposures, in-camera effects, and astonishing tracking-shots that last a long-time for the era they were made in. One thing people miss: there is a possible "Futurist" influence in many of the city-scenarios, with the superimposition of thought-images, traffic, the flowing human-rivers, and the subjective-realities--all experienced at-once by the viewer. This is found in Futurist painting, and to their film (though they are usually only viewed by academics). It seems unlikely that Murnau was unaware of the Futurists and their aesthetics, and I am unaware of anyone noting this in film-studies literature. There is no current edition of this film in the USA on-DVD, however, it can be found used online for a decent price. The Fox edition is from a major-restoration, and is definitive, it was not done "on-the-cheap". The negative was destroyed in a 1937 vault-fire. It is no-longer extant, which is the sad-case for a large-percentage of Murnau's films. Many are simply gone forever, though occasional discoveries (like the 1922 "Phantom"--the negative has been found!) do occur. Watching "Sunrise" is like looking at a moving-painting, by a man who was trained to be a fine-arts painter. It is sublime, and modern.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt, one of the most impressive films I've ever seen! Nearly perfect in construction, wonderfully executed, flawlessly acted and worth every penny I paid to get it off Ebay.The film presents the story of a man on a farm who is involved in an illicit affair with a woman from the City. She eventually talks him into killing his wife so they can be together. The man goes to do the dirty deed and... well, you'll just have to see what happens to believe it. No description that I can provide can do it justice.If "Citizen Kane" is the culmination of all movie making techniques in the early "Talkie" era, then "Sunrise" is the culmination of all movie making techniques during the silent era. It is a real tragedy that Murnau didn't live long enough to make more movies. After seeing this film, you'll understand what a treasure the world lost when he died. Now let's get out there and find a copy of "Four Devils"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Evolution of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is attributed to Mary Pickford that the evolution of film is essentially backwards--it should have started with sound and evolved into silent. Lillian Gish in fan magazines in the 1920s used to state that the potential of silent film was that it produced an art form that was universal--no need for language and it's inevitable losses from translations.Sunrise, with Murnau's exquisite use of atmosphere, is a fine example of the universality of silent film as a separate and distinct art form. Early silents had fewer title cards--the story was carried by the faces. As film became more popular, more cards were needed to explain more "complex" stories. Here, we have a simple story--temptation and redemption, but without the need for title cards. Any one can watch this and understand it and appreciate it.As for Pickford...well, some of that may have been bitterness over the loss of her own career with the advent of sound, but to a certain extent her observation has always seemed to me to be apt. A useless controversy, of course, but the best of silent film can be held up today--and doesn't lose anything by lack of language. The beauty of the art is there for all to see. Silent film is not passive as some sound films are--it requires viewer participation and concentration--and it is through that active participation in the art by the viewer that it achieves it's highest level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, but one thing bothers me: The Man's character.It seems odd that in reviews The Man's inherent violent nature is passed over so easily. He really has no qualms about killing his wife at first, "threatens" a man with a switch blade, and would have killed his former lover if not for the call that his wife had been discovered. The Wife is putting herself in very volatile hands, I think. And yet the movie wants us to accept the reconciliation as permanent and trusting.Or maybe it doesn't. The scene in which the wife gets jealous (and vice versa) in the barber shop, along with other portrayals of men and women as lecherous and loose (the dance scene, etc) seem to undermine the notion that relationships can be as Edenic as the happy ending of the movie suggests.Any thoughts?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F.W. Murnau Finds a Place in the Sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunrise" is regarded as one of the best silent films ever produced, and is often in contention for the top position. Seeming to derive its subtitle "A Song of Two Humans" and character names from older films exemplified by director D.W. Griffith, the first title card provides all the synopsis you need: "This song of the Man and his Wife is of no place and every place; you might hear it anywhere at any time." There are only a few additional intertitles; in this story, neither they nor the spoken word is needed. Silence in golden. The unfolding lyrical beauty of the picture leaves you with the impression you are watching the stroke of art...Though director F.W. Murnau clearly has influences, he elevated the medium substantially with this uncommon work, becoming influential in his own right. Photographed expertly by Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, "Sunrise" is one of the best examples of the universal appeal of the silent film. In Hollywood, Europe and the world, silent movies could be understood almost immediately, by anyone. Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo had no language barrier, and 1927 produced an amazing group of silent classics. The three first "Academy Award" "Best Picture" winners didn't even cover them all. Still, every "Sunrise" is followed by a sunset... ********** Sunrise (9/23/27) F.W. Murnau ~ George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor, Margaret Livingston, Bodil Rosing</fullReview>

Dazzled by Murnau previous works, the American producer William Fox, invited the German director do produce an American movie with full freedom. A masterpiece was about to be created. The sound score helps you understand the intimacy of the couple , while the camera movements showed how bad or good the characters were. Perfect in every aspect (light, editing, acting, directing, sound, scenario and costume), "Sunshine" is definitely a must-see movie.

		<shortDescription>Great Silent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many, I had heard of this film and finally -- thanks TCM! -- got a chance to see it. The few title cards are a strength here. The only time they are heavily employed is during the wedding scene. Their previous scarcity gives them real power. This is one of the few instances of an "artistic" use of the title card in silent films. That is, they become part of the rhythm of the production in that the husband responds to the words of the minister. We "hear" the words through his reaction. What plot there is is melodramatic and sometimes strains credulity. But -- the pace insists that we share the experience -- not just what happens (plot) but what is happening (character). In this instance, Gaynor is wonderful. As noted by others, the camera is deeply implicated in how we respond. The blend of realism -- in the remarkably detailed set-- and surrealism -- as when the reunited couple kiss in the midst of an intersection -- is powerful. The storm scene at the end is superb. This film builds slowly toward a remarkably convincing demonstration of the work of art that a silent film could be. I was reminded in the early scenes on the river of George Stevens' great film "A Place in the Sun." I don't know whether the husband's doubts about drowning his wife influenced Stevens, but his film emerges from Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" (1925) based on an actual event on a lake in upper New York state, so the links between the two similar scenes are tenuous. That is, unless "Sunrise" owes a debt to Dreiser's powerful novel. Without giving anything away, the film's title predicts a happier ending than Drieser provides. The lightning on the river in the film is not quite the same as the electricity that claims Dreiser's Clyde Griffiths at Sing Sing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, touching masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is the only way to describe this wonderful film. I have waited so long to see it, and now I can honestly say that it was well worth the wait.This film is a treasure from beginning to end. Thanks to the master craftsmanship of Murnau. He was obviously a visionary, ahead of his time. And had he lived ( he died at 43 in a car accident), who knows what other glorious films he would have made. Thank God he was able to give us this gem.The Cinematography (by Charles Rosher and Karl Struss) is extraordinary, especially for 1927. High marks also go to Harold Schuster for his first rate editing.I won't give any of the story away (you probably know a lot of it anyway by now), just believe me when I tell you, if you love film and marvel at all it can do go see this movie. If you love a good story, with terrific acting, go see this movie. If you appreciate silent movies, and want to see one of the best, you must see this film. If you appreciate craft, and art, and do not want to see an over self-indulgent, ego-trip by a wanna-be director, go see this film. If you simply want to see one of the ten best movies ever made, you must see this film.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time seeing this film not too bad but was definitely not the ending I saw coming..but was a very good movie none the less I think one of my favorite scenes was the carnival it was pretty cool seeing the old time games and the amount of money they would have to pay for them I think This movie was more of a romance than a comedy but still there were many good comedy parts I think my favorite comedy was when he was getting his haircut and face shaved. The sound effect and certain props that were used also were pretty good some of the noises you could make out what things could have been used to make that sound back in that time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise with director F.W. Murnau is a fun and exciting film that has so many elements of thrilling drama. The Cinematography is fantastic and can not go without appreciation. Such an original story line and it intrigues the audience in a way that allows people to call this film a beautiful Master piece. The story portrays corruption as well as redemption and the message it gives to the audience is simply magnificent. I rated this film an 8 out of 10 because if fell that such an old movie still pulled off great effects and great energy. Janet Gaynor and George O'Brian are brilliant in this film!. I would most definitely recommend this film to anyone and buying this classic would only add to a great collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is beautifully shot. The camera work is absolutely its strongest point. The cinematography is brilliantly done, the lighting and the camera placement were breathtaking. I enjoyed watching this film, and I believe it is done very well for the time it was made, yet a few things fell short. The acting was very corny at times, maybe intentionally so, but it took away from the story. The story itself was all together too predictable, and it did not leave me with much to ponder. This is a solid film to watch if you are interested in early film cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Far-Fetched of a Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunrise is a well-filmed silent movie with a story line that is very outlandish in my opinion. The film starts out on a farm, occupied by a husband and wife with a very young child, in a very rural area that is not identified for the viewer. It's late at the start of the movie when the husband is visited by a mysterious woman that turns out to be his mistress. The two sneak away to a dark and swampy area where they can be alone, while the man's wife is left at home an emotional wreck with only her young child there to comfort her. During this rendezvous, the mistress convinces the, at first, reluctant man to drown his wife. The following day he takes his wife out on a boat with the intent to drown her, but ends up changing his mind and immediately decides that they need spend the day together, so he takes her to the city to try to make it up to her. Although he changed his mind, his wife was still extremely frightened of him from the whole situation, so he spends the whole time on the way to the city screaming, "You don't have to be afraid of me!" Once they get there the couple sees a wedding going on and decides to attend it by sitting in the back of the church. During the ceremony, the husband begins to get very emotional at the sight of these newlyweds, very much in love, making him think back to when he still loved his wife. The sight becomes too much for the man and he breaks down and cries into the lap of his wife, while apologizing for all that had happened. The wife immediately forgives him and completely forgets about the attempted murder, her husbands on going adultery with his mistress, and the two fall back in love. The rest of the movie just shows them spending the rest of the day inseparable. This was the big problem that I had with the movie because it didn't at all feel realistic to me. For the husband to fall back in love so passionately and quickly to me did not make sense or feel real, neither did the wife falling back into his arms after all that he put her through. Overall, I believe there were many good formal qualities used in the movie, but I just couldn't get into the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*CONTAINS SPOILERS*This film tells the story, not only marriage between a farmer and his wife, but the mistress who tries to seduce the man in her attempts to get him to sell his farm and move to the city with her. During the mans affair, the mistress tries to convinces the man to drown his wife so that they could be together. Upon his attend to kill his wife, the farmer fails and tries instead tries to win back the affection of his wife. After witnessing a wedding the two are reminded of how they fell in love bringing them closer together than before.Returning home, the couple faces a storm. The storm represents the obstacle that they must over come together in order to "survive".The over all "effects" and over lapping of images was extremely impressive for its time. Although not a very realistic story line, the symbols and foreshadowing contrasted well with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgive the Man and Blame the Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A farmer falls in love with a woman from the big city. She encourages him to murder his wife, after which he can sell the farm and live in the city with her. She figures out how he can do it, by faking a boating accident in which the wife drowns. He takes his wife out into the middle of the lake, starts to kill her, but finds he cannot do it. However, his wife saw the murderous intent in his eyes and flees from him as soon as they reach the other side of the lake. He keeps catching up with her, and she keeps trying to get away. Little by little, they reconcile, and she forgives him.Now, we all know that in a lot of old movies, a woman is expected to forgive her husband's indiscretions, and if she does not, she is regarded as foolish and wrongheaded, such as in "The Women" (1939) or "The Philadelphia Story" (1940). But it is one thing for a wife to forgive adultery, and it is quite another thing for her to forgive his almost carrying out a plan to murder her. And yet this movie would not only have us believe that a wife could forgive such a husband, which is preposterous, but it also would have us regard her forgiving him as an expression of the purity of her heart, which is outrageous. No woman should forgive that, and any who did is a fool.The man and his wife essentially renew their vows by watching another couple's wedding, and then carry on like a couple of newlyweds on their honeymoon. Finally, it is time to go home, and they get back on their little boat and head across the lake. A storm suddenly appears, capsizes the boat, and he believes that she has drowned. So, in a manner reminiscent of "An American Tragedy," the accident that he was planning to fake actually happens.When the woman from the big city comes looking for him, thinking that he pulled it off, he becomes furious and starts strangling her. The idea is that she is the villain of the piece. In other words, it was really her fault that he almost murdered his wife. So while his wife forgave him, he does not forgive this woman. And just as the movie would have us approve of the wife's forgiving the husband, it would also approve of the woman's being strangled, giving her what she deserved.At the last minute, it turns out his wife has been rescued. He stops strangling the woman and returns home to be with his wife and child. The sun rises, presumably symbolic of the couple's fresh start in having a happy marriage.The patriarchal attitude of this movie, that a woman should forgive her husband of his sins because it is some other woman who is really to blame, is all the more stunning in that the men who produced this movie and held these views apparently did so without the slightest sense of just how self-serving those views really are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1927 - A revolutionary year in cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year 1927 was historic and monumental not only for silent cinema but for cinema as an entity. Metropolis and Sunshine were released that year and it changed the way movies were made. Both had German directors. Sunrise is not only a revolutionary movie but it is also an emotional ride of love, lust, jealousy and redemption.The technical advancements in this movie are huge. For example, the scene where the woman from the city shows the village man dreams about the city. The super-imposed shot of the city over the village river was unique. Another example is the ghostly image of the city girl over the man's body to show that she has the influence on him was also pretty breath-taking. Another good thing about the movie was that the actors refrained from too much melodrama and over the top reactions which was the norm of the day. They were pretty normal and reacted as a normal person would react. That was another thing which makes this movie unique.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When all else fails, kill!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you solve all your problems by threatening to kill just about everyone you meet? Then, by gar, you might just click with "The Man" in Sunrise! First he's ready to off his wife so he can run off with a floozy from the big city, then The Man lets that hair-trigger temper loose at the slightest hint of controversy. He even tries to kill the floozy! He would have made a great opponent for Mike Tyson. They might have hosted a horrible reality show together.But this movie isn't famous for its near-violence. It's highly regarded for the style, the in-camera effects, the visual storytelling and the remarkable cinematography (by Charles Rosher and Karl Struss). German director F.W. Murnau (who also helmed Nosferatu) came to Hollywood and made what many have called the greatest silent film ever made. From an artistic standpoint, they (good ol' "they") have a point. The story, however, is too simplistic and the over-the-top acting might make you laugh.Nevertheless, the American Film Institute added it to their 2nd Top 100 list in 2007 after ignoring it in 1998. Did 10 years make it better? Well, no. A better print on DVD than anyone had previously seen on videotape didn't hurt. Your eyes will obviously enjoy looking at this picture. Your brain might not feel as stimulated as your orbs will. If you don't think that's true, it's probably best that you just take me out a la The Man in Sunrise. Violence solves everything! It might even get your woman to come back to you.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 27-minute Sunrise 'cast?and many others.

		<fullReview>I remember saying that people a few generations in the past were something like more wholesome, or innocent. I'm not all that upset to say that this movie definitely made an attempt to change my mind about that.Inherent in any modern movie's appeal is it's shock value. (How many Saw's? 6...Really?) The Germna import, F.W. Murnau's film was certainly just as shocking as any romantic film you'll ever see...Sorry Notebook. Themes such as attempted murder, and extra marital affairs drive this otherwise non-superficially interesting movie.However, it's the average movie-goer who doesn't see beneath the surface, the class has shown me to evaluate other things such as soundtrack and camera tricks. I noticed the revolutionary Sunrise Soundtrack was just as vital a player in the plot line as any one of the three main characters. The camera work is also certainly cutting edge compared to contemporaries. All in all, Sunrise is a story told with no spoken words but excellent acting and superb directing, backed up by a revolutionary soundtrack negate the need for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a silent film, Which I have never since. this was amazing I actually stayed late to watch the ending which did surprise me I won't give away the ending. It was strange to watch movie with no words or talking but it still told a story. I thought it was even better in black in white yet a little on the darker side I think that because most of it took place in the night time but over all I thought it was put together very well the scenes would kind of dim-into the next which I liked. Very good movie especially for my first silent film. I like how it had you kind of sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what the man was going to do.In the end it was nothing I expect but what you hope for. Meg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important rule of storytelling is: SHOW, DON'T TELL. (see Robert McKee's Story for a detailed analysis)This film is the best example of this principle in practice. The film contains no dialogue and no inter-titles. The film is made entirely of images. Film is a visual medium as we all know and because this film has nothing to distract from the visuals it draws one in. Added to this it is an incredibly well told story. I have never been so moved by a film that is so distant from my life.I think every director out there now should see this film as an example of how films should be. Writers and directors these days rely too heavily on dialogue, and its ruined film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a silent film enthusiast and I can honestly say that sunrise was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have never been so enraptured and caught up in a film as this. It was a tear jerker from every angle and really tugged at my heart. It is a grand love story and though I have never been much for romances, this story just is the cream of the crop. Janet Gaynor is one of my favorite film stars and she just shines as the sweet, affectionate wife. I have always liked the sweet women in movies who are often hoodwinked to a larger and realer situation--Much like Melanie (Olivia De Havilland in "Gone With the Wind") This is just classic, good old fashioned films and I truly wish that Hollywood would make films like that again. And even though I am 20, I am not jaded by the film industry these days, a movie has to be very well executed to gain my praises. And "Sunrise" was one of those few films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has got to be one of the great silent films. There are few films that can be so simplistic and yet so powerful. This movie is one of them. The plot is simple and easy to follow but the story has probably the best moral of them all, love truly does conquer all. Any fan of cinema has to at least watch this with other silent classics such as "The Crowd" "Greed" and Murnau's other film "The Last Laugh" and "Nosferatu." The story follows the exploits of the husband, the wife, and the woman from the city. The man and the city woman begin an adulterous affair. Meanwhile, the wife is very unhappy. The city woman proposes that the husband kill his wife and come to the city with her. What will will the husband choose to do? This film is a must watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the beautiful human world of Murnau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1927 f.w. Murnau's Sunrise: a song of two humans was released. Now, almost 80 years later it came to my eyes and make them cry because of the beautiful, sublime, simple, sweet, charming, terrifying, fine and human masterpiece from the best example of German expressionism of all-time cinema.Murnau delivers an impressionist combination of acting, cinematography, ambient, technical features, background and powerful love story. This story is simple; focused on human emotions, on the triumph of love: the rebirth of marriage over the devil transformed in temptations: infidelity, sex and money; and on the lessons given by a superior being.Due to this movie was filmed by the time of cinema's childhood, technically this movie is not limited by anything: nature being wonderfully shot in many forms: the fury of the storm, animals reacting as they are, are good examples.It might spoil the review but I got to say it won 3 academy awards including best actress, best cinematography and best movie.unchris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you start getting an interest in silent movies there are a few films that are classed as essential viewing and this is one of them. From the opening sequence showing people going on their vacation to the closing moment this movie holds your attention as it is essentially a simple story, but, it's telling elevates it to the sublime. Couple, man disenchanted with his marriage, wife oblivious to this, vamp from city offering man excitement missing in marriage, they plot wife's demise, but, from then on, well, do yourself a favour and see it yourself. The two leads give exceptional performances, although I've noticed that George O'Brien tends to be overlooked in most reviews who heap justified praise on Janet Gaynor, when you consider what other work he did in movies, mainly cowboy movies in the 1930's, he gives an excellent performance. Despite what others have said in previous reviews, this did not go down well with all critics, there is a fantastic review of the time in Photoplay magazine that slates it as "art" and not to meant in the nice way. Oddly enough another masterpiece, Buster Keaton's "The General" is another movie that received harsh criticism at it's release, perhaps two movies that were years ahead of their time. To finish, all I will say is that personally I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie, It will change the views of people who hate Silent and B&amp;W films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I learned about this film more than 25 years ago. I remember reading about it and how it frequently showed up in the top ten list of so many respected film experts and enthusiasts. After just one viewing, I have to say I agree. It is a truly great film, one that deserves to be rediscovered by every new generations of film lovers.The story is quite simple, a farmer (George O'Brien) is bewitched by a woman from the city played by Margaret Livingston and is planning to kill his wife (Janet Gaynor) and sell the farm. On a boat trip where the farmer plans to kill his wife, he hesitates and soon the two are in the city where they end up falling in love again. It's a very simple melodrama but the story is not what makes the movie special it's the telling of the story and the visuals.The camera work on this 1927 movie rivals that of any current movie, witness how the camera tracks down the Woman as she walks down the street. Also how the camera follows the actors through the marshes. Quite an achievement in 1927 before they had lightweight cameras and boom cranes that can zoom in and out of difficult spots. There is a shot where the camera seems to hover over the people as it follows them into a fair. It might not be special nowadays but in that era it was quite a feat.The set decorations is quite impressive. Although it's probably true that it might even look better in Technicolor what we see even in Black and White is a wonder to behold. Many of which are of course just painted back drops, but done so well and so beautiful to see. The far view of the city is quite different from any real city of that era. The city has more in common with the look of city from of "Metropolis" and Emerald City from "The Wizard of Oz". One of the thing that I really like was how the tram winds through the forest and ends up in the city. I wonder where it was, was it even real or was it just built by the studio.The acting on silent films never lacked subtlety and it is true in this film. George O'Brien comes a cross as a Stephen Rea type with a little bit of Javier Bardem thrown in. He's slump over as he's wrought with guilt over what he is about to do and then he begins to straighten up as he choose to do the right thing. Janet Gaynor conveys purity and innocence, but then just abject terror when she realize what her husband is about to do. Margaret Livingston's character is a classic 1920's vamp. Short dark hair, pale skin and dark eyes, as oppose to the blonde purity of Miss Gaynor's character. It is interesting how in modern times it's the blonde who's evil.All in all, it is an excellent movie that is a must see for any film buff. It is a case of style over substance pure and simple, yet an incredible achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest masterpiece of all cinema. If you don't believe it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You must see it then. Is quite impossible don't fall in love of this piece of art. F.W Murnau gives us, the most wonderful, beautiful and tender experience that any movie can give. The same Cahiers du Cinema named as "The best movie ever made"... you know, even that honor is too small for a movie like this. Of course that there is a lot - i have my selection - of other excellent masterworks... and is that, after all, is just a movie. But "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" is the cinema that people should see.Mr. Murnau going to be for much of us a mystery that gives to the cinema, real masterpieces and a great legacy to all who wants to know his work. He direct like 20 films or so... but only few - less than 10 - are known: "Nosferatu: Le symphonie des grauens", "Tabu", "Faust", "The Last Laugh", "Tartuffe", "Phantom" and "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" . A shame that a work of a great filmmaker is almost entire lost. Who knows all the wonders that this master makes for us, but we have never seen? Its touch, its vision has been incomparable. "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" is the evidence of what I'm saying."Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" told us the story of a farmer and his wife (Performed grandiose by Janet Gaynor and George O'Brien), who lives a quiet and honest life in a simple town. They are simple. In a vacation time, arrives from the city, a woman who is accustomed to parties and all the movement of the noising city. One night, the woman calls the attention of the farmer. He, goes and encounters. Then, he is unfaithful to his wife. His lover, gives him and idea: Both go to the city, and live a noise life, with parties every night, a life full of unnecessary things. He decides to keep the plan then, but he stop to think about when his lovers tell him the future of his wife: She going to be drowned... by him. What he going to do, now he is prepared, is a nice day, and the boat is ready, his wife is very happy. The birds begin to fly and disappear, then begins the silence... whats going to happen now? The atmosphere is terribly incredible, this project of Murnau, was the first and -thougt- unique film that appear from FOX vaults. Here, as Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane", F.W Murnau receives from the studio, absolute liberty. But, after this marvelous project, FOX don't keep giving to him the same liberty. As maybe you know, its next - too lost - film, "4 Devils" was from FOX too. After "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", with the death of the silent film, FOX don't want another lost like that. Throug the years, this is the masterpiece of Murnau, and, as i say, the most important film of all time. I recommend for a best view, that you see the EUREKA edition of this film in DVD - i know that this film is very hard of get, believe me!- but with the special 2 disc edition, you can get a beautiful 2 soundtracks. The film have an excellent video quality, with the original 1927 title cards and score! Besides of great extras that include a good view of Murnau next film "4 Devils".This movie is more than great, and is absolutely perfect in every cinematic word. This film going to makes you tremble, going to makes laugh, going to makes cry. Because there is not any film that bring us a message so clear of a story like life, sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter: The most important anything that you going to have, is the real love that you have. Take it like you want it, if is going to be from a Onmipotent been or a person. No matter you beliefs. You must know that simplicity, takes it all.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.This film really broke the boundaries on its initial release, Murnau's fusion of German expressionism and Hollywood production created a genuinely unique piece of cinema that exists as a film apart from any other. The sound techniques employed by Murnau haven't received the attention that they are due as a result of the Jazz Singer released later in the same year, but where the Jazz Singer can be seen as the initial exercise in sound cinema, Sunrise is without a doubt the perfection of the silent era.The acting is awesome, surpassing anything I have ever seen in any other silent movie and the camera techniques are genuinely awe-inspiring and will not fail to impress viewers 80 years after they were created.In short Sunrise is one of those special films that capture your heart and appreciation from the very beginning and generate a cinematic performance to rival anything created either before or since, a genuine must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best films I've seen period...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a timeless, beautifully told story presented in a fairly new medium in its time. To me, for that period, it seems harsh to make comparisons based on relatively rapid evolving technology. It would be like comparing products made using a Timex-Sinclair computer to a Commodor 64 to a Mac to a PC. All of those evolved within 3 years of each other. It's about who has the deepest pockets with the better toys and when - within a short span of time.This film held my attention throughout. The story had wonderful drama and surprising twists. I was delighted by the comedic scenes that came so unexpectedly and translated from the film so deftly. The actors all performed with talent and finesse. A great drama makes you laugh and cry as does this story.I was rather impressed by the special effects. They were ambitious without exposing the "man behind the curtain" in the process.You know what to expect going into watching older films. It's not so much about peeking under the hood as it is enjoying the ride.What I enjoyed most in this film is that it drew me in easily. I immediately fell in love with the characters and I never got the feeling the whole thing was going to collapse like a cheap tent. I was too far into the story. The laughs came completely unexpectedly while adding another delicious layer to the play.I recommend this film if you ever get the opportunity to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FW Mernau's "sunrise" Is the kind of movie that stays with you long after it is over. Janet Gaynor and George Obrien give superb performances, the German expressionistic sets, great cinematography by Karl Struss and Charles Rosher. Notice How Mernau used locals and villagers as extras, which saved him money, but also gave his films a real authenticity. This is an emotionally charged film, very passionate. This is the kind of film that reaffirms the power of movies. When one watches it, it is moving. and even though the film is almost 80 years old, and the actual actors are long dead, and the story has been already told and retold, and the ending is predetermined; we are moved and we feel for the characters. such an effective film that immerses us totally and brings us inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performed at a pop festival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Sunrise at a pop festival in 1997, where it was accompanied live by the Belgian band Zita Swoon. It was the last time they would perform it (even though they're considering to do some more shows in the future), after a long tour through Belgian theatres. I was amazed, both by the music and the movie. I think it quite a ... to keep a sixteen year old occupied for over two hours with watching a silent movie. After the festival I bought the album (too bad there isn't a movie and music video available)and even though I had only been focusing on the movie, and not on the band, I could exactly recall which episode belonged with which part of the album. The story is romantic,tragic and still topical, the music is romantic and tragic as well, with the singer switching from a crackled Tom Waits voice, to opera, to an almost silent whisper (Where's my love). That Murnau was a German impressionist, and what a document Sunrise was, I learned only later but I will never forget that show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An emotionally unstable country man struggles with the choice between his mistress from the city and his innocent country family.The main problem I had with this film is that it's unintentionally funny when it's trying not to be and unintentionally disturbing when it's trying to be cute or funny. I can actually imagine people acting the way the characters in this film do, but that doesn't mean it's worth putting into a movie. This is a bit of a spoiler, but having a character who almost murdered his wife chase her up a hill yelling "Don't be afraid of me!" is more ironically funny than it is pathos invoking. The early use of a semi-synch soundtrack is interesting and the lantern scene near the end is pretty, but it's not worth the suffering you'll endure if you dislike poorly written/directed films. In short, this movie set the precedent for Oscar winners being the worst movies made each year.I'd recommended this for people who like Citizen Kane for its heavy handed writing and self- indulgent directing/mise-en-scene.Content Notes: It's super cheesy, but the male lead is pretty violent and loony (e.g., his propensity for trying to kill women) so use your own judgment when it comes to young viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The silent films of the late 1920s are more timeless, not more ancient, than the films of the 1930s. "Sunrise" was made in 1927, but could just as easily have been made in 1957 - or, indeed, at any time in between, had it not been for the temporary disturbances of the sound revolution.Everyone describes the film as "beautiful", because it is, and because that's the most apt description. It's beautiful. It's the kind of movie you drink in with your eyes. It's a simple fable, but it's not just Aesop stretched out to 95 minutes; since it's a journey as well as a fable, every minute is justified.I like the role the City plays. At first it looks as though it will be a place of evil, but it isn't; rather, it's a place of possibilities - a place where you can more easily find, or become, either good OR evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Love Story and Also Another Great Movie of Murnau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A married farmer (George O'Brien) is seduced by a beautiful city girl, who is spending vacation in the country. She convinces him to kill his wife (Janet Gaynor), sinking his boat while going to the city, pretending an accident. When they are in the boat, the farmer gives up the idea, chases his frightened wife until the city and spends the day with her in a 1927 modern and bright city. There, they fall in love for each other again. When rowing back home, strong winds sink the boat in a real accident. In order to avoid a spoiler, no further comments can be written about the plot. This is the first American movie of the fantastic F. W. Murnau. Along this week, I have watched `Nosferatu', Faust' and `The Last Laugh'. The last one available in my collection is `Tartüff' ( I do not have `Tabu'). `Sunrise' is a beautiful love story and also a great movie. The technique certainly was very innovative in 1927 and even in 2003 is not totally aged. Janet Gaynor (most known from `A Star is Born') was 21 years old and plays the role of the young, fragile and sweet wife and has an outstanding performance (she was the first actress to win the Oscar of Best Actress based in her performance in `Seventh Heaven', `Sunrise' and `Street Angel' ? the unique time an actress won an Oscar for multiple roles). I only regret the terrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by `Continental Home Video': it is a shame! The copy is completely damaged and deteriorated (the viewer can hardly see the landscapes, and this film won the Oscar of cinematography). Therefore you can imagine how much we Brazilian are missing with such a copy. I really would like to know how this film was released in the rest of the world. Was it restored? My vote is nine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A song of no place and every place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those that don't know the story of how this film came to be made, it is the first Hollywood film of pioneering German director F. W. Murnau. One of the founders of the expressionist movement, Murnau had already wowed audiences around the world and impressed US producers with pictures such as Der Letzte Mann and Faust (both 1926). In 1927 he was snapped up by Fox studios, given a blank cheque, and told he could make any film he wanted without studio interference. The result was Sunrise.Murnau here employs every trick up his sleeve as if to create the ultimate expressionist picture. High angles, low angles, tracking, dollying, superimpositions (lots of them), light and shadow ? the full works. Sometimes this works brilliantly ? one of my favourite bits is in a scene which begins with a shot of a kaleidoscope, which dissolves into a shot of the outside of a fairground, and then begins dollying in, taking us inside. Other times however it looks a bit too showy and unnecessary, for example, on a title card, the word "drowned" appearing to be washed away. All this abstract trickery is perfect for, say, a fantasy film like Faust, but here it is a bit heavy-handed for an intimate drama. In a way I'd rather Murnau had just let the actors tell the story, and not the technical crew.There is an incredible smoothness to the entire picture. I'm not just talking about how well it is made, but the style in which it is constructed. There are long, winding tracking shots which must have taken an immense about of planning. There are long takes which dissolve into one another as opposed to straight cutting. Even the movements of the actors are very deliberate and graceful.Janet Gaynor won the first even Best Actress Oscar for her role as the wife, and while both she and George O'Brien are very good, I think the best performance belongs to Margaret Livingstone as the city woman. Her acting is much more understated and realistic, yet she still manages to convey emotion and character.---- SPOILER IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH ---- Sunrise has a very engaging story, with elements of both sweet romance and grim drama. However apparently in the source novel the wife does actually drown, leaving the husband racked with guilt. To me this would have been a much stronger ending, but Murnau was too much of a sentimentalist and plumped for the happy ending. I'm not too sure either about the occasional comic relief moments. They're OK, but some of them are so separate from the plot they seem tacked on.---- NO MORE SPOILERS ---- I'll add a quick word about the score. The Eureka DVD contains both the original movietone score and a much more recently composed one by Timothy Brock. Brock has received a lot of his praise for his re-scoring of silent films, but in the case of Sunrise I say the original score is better, even if it is a little clichéd. While Brock mostly underscores the action, the original track is more geared to underscoring the emotion, which for my money is much valuable. It is also a very listenable score, which is unusual for that period, when the music was generally designed to be as unobtrusive as possible.Sunrise may be a landmark of silent cinema, but for me it is that more so because of the circumstances in which it came about than because of its content. Don't get me wrong ? it is very good, but it is just not phenomenal. Neither would I call it an improvement on Faust. Still, it is an enjoyable romantic drama, and yet another demonstration of the possibilities of the visual elements of cinema from the master of German expressionism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The impure city has probably been contrasted with the purer countryside since the walls of Jericho went up. And the contrast between the safe certainties of a settled relationship and the illicit temptations of a reckless but exciting fling must surely be older still. FW Murnau's Sunrise makes no secret of the universality of its themes. Indeed, for the first twenty minutes it is not even clear which century or which continent it is set in ? I'm not going to give even that much away about a film which everyone with any real interest in cinema ought to see. It's a beautiful film, which uses the full range of techniques open to a movie-maker of the nineteen-twenties to project a moving and convincing narrative. Yes, it is linear, in the same way as a tram ride is linear ? it takes you from your starting-point to your destination but with some surprising turns on its way. The performances are superb, powerful with never a trace of hamming, dramatic but not melodramatic, with touches of pathos and humour which never strike a false note. It is a marvel that so much could be achieved with such limited technical resources. My only very minor quibble is that the late-romantic score, which I think was not part of the original picture, eventually starts to grate. But that is not the fault of the film, which I give a full ten out of ten.</fullReview>

The music and sound effects were so rich that conversation wasn't needed.The story is that of a man, his wife, and a woman from the city. No names were given for the characters, and that on purpose. For the story was of the 'It could happen to anyone,in any town' variety. Janet Gaynor was amazing and deservedly won the Oscar for her role of the wife. All of the actors were superb in their roles, not overacting in the way that most people associate with silent films.'Sunrise' is what silent cinema should be seen as, it is a credit to the times in which it was made. This movie along with 'The Unholy Three' (1925) should be on the shelves of any film buff.</fullReview>

Simple story (man plots to kill life for other woman) but unbelievably beautiful shots, great performances (it's a shame Gaynor and, especially, O'Brien are forgotten today--they were wonderful actors) and beautiful music score more than compensate. Visually, this movie is incredible. They (obviously) spend millions building big, beautiful sets and it comes through. The sequence at the carnival is an eye popper. However the most incredible is near the beginning where the husband is seduced by the evil other woman in a swamp with a big beautiful moon overhead. Hard to believe this was a box office failure.

		<shortDescription>The self-indulgent sentimental equivalent of Wings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Contains Spoilers*************************************************** Okay, maybe that was a little too harsh. But like how Wings would help define The Oscars from a technical standpoint, this film helps define the Academy Awards for overindulgent sentimental mush. Nothing happens in this film that comes close to a speck of a rational thought.For example, the Man and the Woman are a happily married couple living on a farm with a kid and a dog. One day, a city woman comes and essentially wrecks havoc on this family. At first, the Man is seduced by the City Woman to the extent that he is willing to kill his Wife just to be with this Woman, but is quick to take back such a thought and try to rekindle the already troubled relationship.Now, I take issues with this movie for 2 reasons. First of all, if our two stars were such a happy couple, why is their relationship so fickle like this. It's one thing if The Wife was concerned over her husband's strange behavior, but she is in despair within the span of one day. One day! And on top of that, and this transitions into my second reason, she is quick to lose all hope for her husband after a non-incident boating trip, and the simple sound of church bells within the same day (notice a pattern here?) is all it takes for them to fall in love all over again. The rest of the film is just them having fun with a last-minute perilous situation.Now the second reason I take issue with this story is that if our two leads are such a happily married couple, why would the husband ever contemplate killer her wife? It'd be one thing if his happiness was just a rouse to prevent his family from feeling uncomfortable, but no. There is no depth in any of these characters (they're not even 3-dimensional enough to have names, though this may have been a Silent film kind of thing), let alone enough depth that would justify why killing his Wife would be such a temptation.But what is great about the film? The Art Direction and the Cinematography (nominated for the former; won the latter). The artistic presentation of the film is just stunning. I can seriously see filmmakers like Walt Disney, Ridley Scott, and Terrence Mallick taking a lot of visual influence from this picture. The titular Sunrise at the end of this film looks holy, as if God blessed this relationship as divine love. And to be fair, this is more of a sentimental journey--what we want to happen in real life--rather than a reality check, and while it has flaws with that, it still does its job well.Overall though, this film was just a well-shot piece of brainless sentiment. Only recommend to the most die-hard of romance enthusiasts and film buffs. Otherwise, it's not worth repeat viewings. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew people away back in the day. I can see why. It contains sound effects which were combined with the background music to enhance realism. It is a useful tool for the day that makes any silent movie better. I didn't say always good, I said always better. It also had decent acting for the time when silent films often had overacting to get certain points across. This combined with the movies impressive story telling make it worth seeing for any film buff who wants to learn more about the silent film era. I got a lot of enjoyment out of it, but only because I can appreciate a silent film. Even so, there were noticeable flaws that can only be called flaws from an outside perspective. A good amount of the movie was filled in with typical silent film banter scenes used for long doses of comic relief. It somehow works, but it gets old after 10 minutes especially when the first half hour is so incredibly interesting. Once the story changes after that, the attention given to the movie feels like a waste because the entire plot shifts moves faster than a plane. It's one of those cases where the story itself isn't necessarily that great, but the way it is told makes it come off well enough to make it a must see. I recommend it to any fans of silent movies, but no one else. They would probably rather watch Die Hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the time I'm in synch with the professional critics and amateur reviewers who offer their opinions here at IMDb. However, even considering the limitations of film going back eighty plus years, I didn't find this picture to be as compelling as it's reputation suggests. I guess my biggest problem with the story is how unlikely it would be for real people to react to the same situations the principal characters find themselves in here as part of the narrative. For example, there's nothing subtle at all about 'The Woman from the City' (Margaret Livingston) when she first suggests "Couldn't she be drowned"? There was no build up to that, no discussion between the lovers relative to what they might do concerning 'The Wife' (Janet Gaynor). Then, because of the straightforward suggestion that he kill his wife, 'The Man' (George O'Brien) literally goes berserk and begins to strangle 'The Woman'. I just didn't get that.Then there was the boating excursion to set up the viewer for the potential murder. There was no question in my mind that O'Brien and Gaynor were embarking on a lake adjacent to their home town, but occasional shots away from the principals seemed to suggest an ocean setting, complete with gulls on the tides. When 'The Man' eventually cowers from his original intent, 'The Wife' expectedly reacts with horror over the idea that she might have been killed, but unconvincingly allows the matter to rest once they arrive in the city. Why that sudden change in mood? To my mind there's no rational way I look at another person the same way again, especially a significant other, if they at one time had the desire to murder me.And forgive me if you think I'm being nit-picky here, but when did you ever (forget about 1927) see a trolley that rode a path through the woods? I'll give the film and director Murnau credit for the creative cityscapes and the scenes of the amusement park, they appear artfully done. I was particularly impressed with the way a number of scenes were created with overlapping, double exposure images. At a time when sound was still a couple of years away for the most part, these creative touches are to be admired and complimented.I also liked the interjection of humor in the picture, more so with subtle touches like the falling shoulder strap which The Obliging Gentleman attended to, rather enjoyably I might add. The drunk pig was a little more over the top to my taste, and seemed a bit out of place given the overall subject matter.Coming some two and a half decades later, one can easily see the influence this picture might have had on 1951's "A Place in the Sun", involving a very similar plot. The protagonist in that picture, portrayed by Montgomery Clift, didn't fare as well as O'Brien's character, being found guilty of murder in the 'accidental' drowning of his wife. Relative to these two pictures, I find it interesting that the later picture was dropped from the American Film Institute's 1997 list of all time Top One Hundred Movies, to be replaced by "Sunrise" in the 2007 revision, separated by ten places (92 vs 82 for "Sunrise").As for director Murnau, I'll credit him here for a skillful film technically, but have trouble with the story elements as I've described. A Murnau film I enjoyed more (if enjoy is the proper term), is his 1922 horror film "Nosferatu". For me, Murnau created a more 'believable' film in this tale of dread and foreboding dealing with a vampire, than he did here with real people. Regarding the theme of love and lost opportunity, there's probably none better in the silent genre than Chaplin's "City Lights" from 1931.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunrise is the filmic equivalent of entering a sauna and getting splashed in the face with a bucket of ice water... then enjoying the sauna before getting splashed in the face with another bucket of ice water.It starts out very German Expressionist and horrific, with a city woman dressed in black convincing a farmer to kill his wife so that he can run away to the city to be with her. For a while, it stays on this roller coaster as he finds himself unable to do it and, following his wife as she flees to the city, tries to pull together his fractured emotions and stop her from demonizing him.Yet at that point it becomes a tender love story with a lot of light comedy. The expressionistic elements are still there, but everything is clean and happy and easily resolved. Even the carnival they go to has nothing weirder than a drunk pig. But it's not like it can stay that way, because there's death and lust and insanity hanging over them, so eventually it kind of has to head back to getting really crazy again.It doesn't really work for me. I can't speak for anybody else in this case, but this film jostles and sends my emotions trying to keep up from one extreme to the other so quickly that it eventually just leaves me uncomfortable with the film itself. This is unfortunate because for one thing, the imagery and craft behind this film is absolutely amazing, and for another thing, it's so good at being insane during the insane parts, tender during the tender parts, and absurd during the absurd parts. It's just that nothing seems to tie everything down enough for my tastes, as if I had watched three different shorts and accidentally thought they were the same disjunctive movie... only they are the same movie.I'm guessing I probably didn't get it. I am, after all, writing this after my first viewing.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

But in the later he gave up the plan. His wife forgave him and they had a happy day in the town. But on their way to home, they met the rainstorm. Their boat was overturned. Luckily they both survived.The interaction between the man and his wife was the most interesting part. From hostile to close, everything was reflected clearly through their lively action and expression. Sometimes I worried about them. Sometimes I felt happy for them. As the story unfolded step by step, I was attracted deeply into it.No doubt it was George O'brien and Janet Gaynor made the film so successful and unforgettable. The roles they played will be unfading. It is the first silence movie I watched. It seems like that I should watch more of them.A silence movie classic. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not find this film to be that entertaining, per se, but the great visual depictions were unarguably influential and beautiful. There is a definite reason why the two cinematographers won the very first Academy Award in cinematography. What truly interests me about the film is not necessarily the melodramatic story behind this, but rather the fact that this is so interesting as a study of views that many people had in the 1920s; a concept that agrarian life is naturally virtuous, and that city life is often very corrupt and contributes to decadence and immorality. The country-city dialectic is something that people do not think about so much, nor do they think about it in more recent times as anything but the 'backwards nature of the country people' when this film shows that at one point, people thought nothing more of this dialectic as demonstrating the backwards ways of the city people.It is very interesting to see such a passionate portrayal of the sins of the city, and the virtues of the country. This very one-sided study of the country-city dialectic makes this film very interesting, in addition to the cinematography. The symbolism is very interesting. Overall, an interesting watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Form Over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hallmark greeting-card ode to marriage, overdone, simplistic, strained. This film has received deserving attention and admiration for form and style. Meticulous technique in the form of expressionistic sets and costumes, superimposed multiple exposures, editing, and cinematography, however, can't make up, however, for a dated preachy tale. "Sunrise" is an exquisite relic of film history, not living art.The film begins in midstream. A simple farmer, (George O'Brien), possessed, as by a succubus, by a city vamp (Margaret Livingston), is enticed into planning the murder of his Madonna-like wife (Janet Gaynor). His temptation and downfall don't last long, as the couple reaffirm their marriage vows, ironically, in the city. A climactic storm threatens to wipe all away. All that's missing is Dudley Do-Right galloping in for the rescue on trusty mare, Nell.The film as it was first exhibited no longer exists. Instead, various restorations circulate. The one seen here is the product of the combined efforts of the British Film Institute, National Film and Television Archive, its owner, Twentieth Century Fox. It was released with a mostly musical soundtrack at a time when some, not all, theaters were equipped to reproduce sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong drama from Murnau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stark photography, fairly solid acting, but a somewhat overboiled thriller/redemption story. Murnau tells his story through visuals very nicely; you would hardly need title cards for this one. A peasant is convinced to murder his wife by a lover from the city (where the film's most striking visuals occur) but he repents and she has to decide whether to forgive him (here's the heavy melodrama spoken of above; it seems to take her the whole movie to decide).Somewhat simplistic in plot but framed with a timeless fairy-tale style perfectly suited to the medium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>okay story, unbelievable cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not bowled over by the plot of SUNRISE. It seemed like a pretty simple but watchable morality tale about a man who has an affair and his new lady tries to get the man to murder his wife. And, while Janet Gaynor received the first Best Actress award for her COMBINED work on this and two other films (the only time the committee did this), her performance didn't seem out of the ordinary. However, I still recommend the movie because of the director and cinematographer--it simply is one of the most beautifully made silent films I have ever seen. Again and again, the images on the screen are like works of art. The way the leads are framed, the vivid and realistic storm at sea and the amazing camera angles and movement are well ahead of most silent pictures of the day.By the way, in many ways the plot from later films such as THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME and A PLACE IN THE SUN appear inspired by the plot of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ehh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't very impressed by Sunshine but there were some aspects that I did like. I liked the use of technology such as overlapping pictures which was used several times throughout it; I didn't know they could do stuff like that back then. The part I liked most was about the first half with the very gloomy music and the dark setting. Everything leading up to the moment on the boat when he's about to kill her was great and suspenseful. I didn't know what he was going to do, which was good. But the rest of the movie I didn't really enjoy; it was way too happy. I didn't like the sudden shift at all. I also thought some scenes were unnecessary (unless I'm just missing their point) or too long, such as the dancing scene or the whole pig escape in the fair. I did like how he kind of threatens the guy when he messes with his wife in the barber shop because it was ironic. Lastly, I think she should've died at the end because it would've made great irony, but the title Sunrise gives it away that she lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but not the best silent film ever (updated with a 'gotcha')</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard so much about "Sunrise" that my expectations were very high, perhaps too high. It has some very good parts to it, but I can also see why it wasn't a financial success at the time of its release.Good points: 1. George O'Brien: I had accidentally rented "The Iron Horse" with this movie and so got a double dose of an actor who I hadn't heard much about until now. He's very good in "Iron Horse," but his complex performance in "Sunrise," with both the very good and very bad mixed in this one man, is a masterpiece.2. The chemistry between O'Brien and Gaynor, especially during that key and very long and painful scene where she is broken hearted and he is trying to get her trust back again, but throughout the movie, really. Looking back on it now, it seems strange to remember it was a silent: could have sworn I heard them talking...actually, I watched them talking. Very powerful performances from both.3. The plot is mature and quite complex compared to other silent films that I've seen from the 20s, and the darkness of much of the film, both visually and in the plot, balances the rare saccharine moments well, keeping them from becoming sappy.The not-so-good: 1. Lose.The.Drunken.Pig. Nuff said.2. All the arty shots seemed more to clutter up the screen than anything else. They would work better for complex, urbane characters than the Man and the Woman.3. All the rural characters seemed vaguely European, but the city was quite American. I realize from the initial title cards that this was intended to be a universal story, but the two cultures depicted didn't seem to belong together.The awesome: 1. That tram ride into town, looking over the driver's shoulder.2. The church scene. Murnau was walking about as close to the edge of maudlin as you can get without falling into it, but it was fresh and very moving. I cried a little bit. Maybe it worked that well because he moved straight into it from the whole delightful photographer's office scene, which was earthy and very funny.3. O'Brien's alternating dark and light moods, and his guilt phase. The man could act. I can't describe it -- watch the movie.EDIT: This movie kept coming back to me after I wrote the above review for some reason. Then...I saw that the drunken pig was the key to the whole thing. Its presence was jarring, but that is exactly what Murnau wanted. To go into detail on that would lead to some *major* spoilers, so I will just drop some hints and then finish by briefly explaining why this realization of what Murnau may well have been up to made me take 3 stars off my vote:1. What if you trust your true reactions instead of the story line, right from the point at the very start where you realize that the woman's reactions to her husband's walking out in the middle of dinner to go hook up with the floozie in the swamp are not what you expected?2. That pig would fit in perfectly on the farm, no? The really strange part wasn't the pig: it was how the city woman, a/k/a floozie, insisted on having her shoes polished before she went out to walk through the mud on the village street.3. Didn't it kind of ruin the bride's special day, and a bunch of other stuff, when another couple came walking out of the church instead of her and the groom?4. What exactly is the song, mentioned in the subtitle, that presumably this couple is singing and why did Murnau run the risk of breaking the viewer's suspension of disbelief by training his camera on his actors posing for a camera? And why is the sunrise at the end so dark?5. Thinking about it a bit, doesn't that tram ride into the city seem a little like the swelling orchestra background in the Beatles' "A Day In The Life" at about 1:45?Well, tried to keep that short. This is a review, not a discussion. However, "Sunrise" is an unusual movie and rather difficult to describe otherwise. It's not what it seems, and that may well be why a lot of people think it is so wonderful. Seen from the perspective opened up after realizing the purpose of the pig, it really is an incredibly insightful look into a very common type of human pathology that is still around today.However, I go to movies to escape and so was disappointed by the major-league mind games going on in "Sunrise." I also didn't particularly like being tricked by the director. That's why my vote dropped down to a 5. It would have been lower, but the acting is really incredibly good, and so is the production.I don't think Murnau ever really understood America's innate sense of hope and possibility very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunrise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't care for this movie. I found myself wishing that the murderous husband would throw himself overboard! He was clearly unhinged. However, the movie's effects were wonderful and there was constant movement throughout. There were also several instances of foreboding-the wife telling the nanny that she won't be back for a while and when the dog breaks free and swims to the boat as if to save the wife. I found the scenes in the city to be spectacular and fun, but here the plot failed me. I didn't feel much towards the characters and didn't see how there interaction made him fall back in love with her. It appeared she loved him all along but he betrayed her trust and apparently won her trust back, that did not seem credible. The cinematography and the presentation were amazing as was the set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of emotion, but otherwise.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's try to set aside the high emotional content for a few moments. A rational review might reveal the following perspectives:The lead actor and actress are perfectly cast and very watchable. Harrowing rowboat scene, then an engrossing trolley car ride that is one of the best old movie sequences ever filmed. The photography is good throughout.A bad girl persuades the man to try to kill his nice wife, but he doesn't. The trolley deposits them in town, then much crying. There is a weird sequence of walking in a busy street with a countryside scene double-exposed into it, followed by shouting and car honking and also horses and bicycles. He gets a haircut, then appears ready to kill someone else with a knife, but again doesn't. Gigantic spinning disk appears on screen, then a place with elephants. By this time I was beginning to get lost.Some of the above strange scenario is apparently intended to help us experience the strangeness found by country people who come into a big city. There is also an apparent sub-theme (which can be interpreted from some enigmatic words near film's opening) that the common man lives on the verge of anything, including presumably murder. That is odd, because most folks have never encountered this "everyman" murderer idea in the real world. I could be all wrong about my themes, but you are free to read anything you want into this movie due to its rather vague overall concepts. I said vague concepts- not vague techniques, at which the director was skilled.The pseudo-Tchaikovsky violin score on the version I saw was not very good, although there was fine orchestrated organ music added to the church scenes.Its probably just lack of comprehension on my part, but I was not impressed by this film, except for its heavy efforts to drag emotion from the actors and from the viewing audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh, If I had lived in 1927, it would be the beez neez (sp?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, Im not trying to be an asshole or anything, Im sure it was a great undertaking for the time. But to be honest, I have seen this movie about a hundred times already, in other movies. Simple plot line, very long run time. its kind of going back to that theory that there are only two types of stories, comedies and tragedies and that every story now has already been told. Gloria Gaynor looks like she is wearing a terribly made hairpiece throughout the whole movie. Oh lets talk about things I did like about it... I did like how they did the matte shots.I liked the drunken piglet scene, and the sets they had up for the carnival were pretty cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As you can see, sadly, the Nazi machine is still in force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murnau was not a good director. This is a silent movie that does only one thing. It is part of the basis for Hitler's Nazi machine.It goes beyond sick. The hero is a good "German Ideal" male, dark haired like Hitler, and the heroine is the blonde. This goes with the Nazi genocide program, as the movie bends over backward to justify the hero attempting to kill the dark haired woman. Yes, it is dumbfounding. Yes, no rational person could call this anything but a pile of crap, yet we see numerous neo Nazis praising this hate filled high Nazi propaganda in these reviews.It is what it is. There is no subtle hiding of it. These sick movies helped the Hitler genocide program, and in fact were the cause. There is nothing original in this. Nothing of value. It is truly sickening, and only a raving Nazi lunatic could endorse this garbage.</fullReview>
