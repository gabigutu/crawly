		<fullReview>There cannot be one verdict on "Fantasia". There must be eight: one for each of the seven segments, and an eighth for the film as a whole - for, varied though the seven segments are, they undeniably belong together. And, alas, space does not permit me to lay out all eight verdicts. I shall have to confine myself to details representative of the whole. At any rate, I shall try.We learn the modus operandi of "Fantasia", the linking theme, in the second segment - an abridged version of Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker" suite. (Missing are the overture and the march.) Tchaikovsky's ballet involves anthropomorphising inanimate things, plus the odd tiny animal. So does Disney's "Nutcracker". But Disney has thrown out the particular details. The Chinese Dance is danced by mushrooms (who look, but are not, Chinese); the Arabian Dance by "Arabian" goldfish; the Russian dance by "Russian" thistles and orchids. Sometimes it goes further: "Waltz of the Flowers" shows two entire changes of seasons, with leaves, fairies, seed pods, seeds, snowflakes - everything but flowers. But in ignoring the letter of the instructions Disney is perfectly true to the spirit. Indeed he is more true to the spirit than the original ballet - for, let's face it: stage ballet is a degenerate and over-formalised art, which makes some of the world's most exciting music dull as wallpaper. Disney's amazing images express Tchaikovsky's sense of motion more than earthbound dancers ever could. This, one feels, is the kind of thing ballet music was TRULY designed for. The same goes to a lesser extent for the other two pieces of ballet music on the program.This basic device - ignoring explicit instructions, but remaining true to the spirit - is carried through into every segment. (Some segments are better than others, but none can be called a failure.) Dukas's "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" has been turned into a Mickey Mouse cartoon - but it's the best Mickey Mouse cartoon ever made; and we realise that the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice is really the archetype that all of the best Mickey Mouse cartoons had been reaching towards, all along. The Pastoral Symphony adheres to Beethoven's program but moves everything from the woods of Central Europe to a dreamland from classical mythology. (The second movement - the section with the courting centaurs - is a failure. For once the spirit as well as the letter of Beethoven is ignored. Unfortunately some critics cannot see beyond this movement to the superb interpretations that flank it on either side.)I doubt that so much genuine creative work has gone into a film, before or since - even if you don't count the contributions made by the composers. What's my favourite film? I really don't know. But if you tell me that I must sit in a large dark cinema for two hours; and ask me what I would like to occupy my eyes and ears over those two hours, I would answer, without hesitation, Fantasia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Unique Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the truly rare, one of a kind movie going experiences, kind of in the same league as watching 2001: A Space Odyssey. I like to watch this film repeatedly; often times I'll just close my eyes and daydream, letting my own imagination go in place of whats on the screen. My favorite part is the opening sequence, with its dramatic music and free flowing imagery foreshadowing the state of the world in 1940. The end of Ave Maria is the perfect bookend to this masterpiece; death has withdrawn and peace has finally arrived. It would, but not for another five years and millions of lives. I can never watch this movie without seeing it in this context; for me its a work of art, both a part and ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Animated Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This without a doubt the greatest animated film in history. While highly acclaimed and well-known today, it was not terribly popular when it was first released. The idea of "Fantasia" is to take great pieces of music and draw animated sequences that match them. In doing so, it reverses the purpose of a movie's score; the movie serves and matches the music, not the other way around. This set up also means that there is no typical formula plot that is present in the vast majority of movies. In the first piece, the animation is vague and abstract, but in later ones it is of definite actions, objects, and stories. The two most famous(and my favorite) parts are probably "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" and "Rite of Spring". "Fantasia" is not only the best animated film ever made, but one of the greatest films period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's "Fantasia" is a pure classic.  What we are shown are a few animated musicals, filled with grand splendor and vivid colors. "Fantasia" is one of those films that everyone knows by heart, and has watched since being a child. My personal favorite was always the Mickey Mouse short - one of the darkest Mickey cartoons I've ever seen. If you haven't seen "Fantasia" yet, then you must be from another planet. It is one of the best Disney musicals ever, which some push aside and forget too easily.  5/5 stars-John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual &amp; Very Creative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unusual and very creative classic of animation combines a very interesting idea with quite a bit of imagination, plus visual effects that still hold up quite well. All but a couple of the sequences are quite enjoyable, and some especially so. Even the segments that don't work as well are usually at least interesting, since you can at least appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.You don't really have to be all that familiar with the specific pieces of music for it to be worthwhile, since in several cases they chose to match the music with material that is rather different in nature from any original context that it may have had. And in any case, the animated sequences are intended to provide the context, in terms of the movie.No doubt, everyone will have his or her own favorite segments, based on the music itself and on the choice of accompanying visual material. The "Sorcerer's Apprentice" sequence, with Mickey Mouse, is certainly one of the most memorable. The adaptation of "The Rite of Spring" is quite imaginative in using an entirely different setting for the music. "Night on Bald Mountain" has striking and sometimes bizarre visuals.Many of the classic Disney features still hold up well as family entertainment, but "Fantasia" is unique for its combination of imaginative concept and visual creativity. Not every minute of it works, but that's the price of being willing to experiment. It's an enjoyable and satisfying feature that well deserves to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mousetro's greatest achievement. Fantasia WILL amaze ya. (Possible SPOILERS.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is the most amazing animated movie I have ever seen. It may not have the humor of Finding Nemo, nor the simple message of Dumbo. It's so different from anything else the House of Mouse ever created. But it may well be the best. It's a collection of short subjects with little or no plot, but what makes the compilation unique is that it's all matched to classical music, beautifully conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and bridged by live-action footage of the silhouettes of an orchestra, narrated by Deems Taylor. Besides these sequences, there isn't a word of dialog.Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: This is nothing but an abstract piece of animation. You see the strings of the cello, the violin, and lots of stripes and shapes that leave trails of color in their wake. Magnificently matched to the music. There's not really that much to explain, just images.The Nutcracker Suite: An ode to nature based on Tchaikowsky's six dances. Each dance is performed by the most unlikely dancers. Fairies, goldfish, thistles and many more perform the dances, but best of all is Art Babbit's Chinese Dance sequence, with mushrooms. The highlight of the sequence is Hob Low, a little mushroom who seems to lag behind the rest of the impeccable act. Brilliantly animated by Babbit, one of the best sequences in the movie. The Sorcerer's Apprentice: An old story starring Mickey Mouse and the intimidating wizard Yen Sid (guess what that spells backwards!), matched to Dukas' symphony. This is without a doubt MM's greatest performance. The animation, especially Ugo O'Dorsi's brilliant effects, is impeccable. Funny and dramatic at the same time, everyone who's ever heard of Mickey Mouse should see The Sorcerer's Apprentice.The Rite of Spring: Igor Stravinsky's Le Sacre was originally meant to signify prehistory, but Disney has taken it much further than a series of old tribal dances. The Rite of Spring starts out at the dawn of the planet, zooming in on our tormented home, spewing lava and rocks. Powerful scenes of the elements that ran amok, without utilizing computers at all (well, they hadn't been invented yet). Then, we skip to the beginnings of life, from the life and death struggle of big bacterium vs. little bacterium. Skip to the dinosaurs, and the constant tyranny of the tyrannosaurus. Many powerful dramatic scenes, beautifully set to the music, until desertification, starvation, a tidal wave and an earthquake wipes out the dinosaurs. Marvelous. One of the best shorts in animation history.The Pastoral Symphony: Ludwig Van Beethoven's masterpiece, instead of portraying the countryside, takes place in a mythological setting. From Pegasus' family, and the adventures of the little black Baby Pegasus. Next movement revolves around the attempts of a bunch of butt-naked baby cupids trying to bring together single centaurs and centaurettes. Next, the exploits of the amorous and extremely drunk Bacchus and Jacchus, who join in the centaurs' wine-making. But all is interrupted by Zeus, who chucks lightning bolts at the lot till he's bored. Next movement, and order is restored, the sun sets, and Diana fires a comet into the sky. Wonderfully animated, and perfectly matched to great music.The Dance of the Hours: Ostriches, elephants, hippos and alligators dance to Ponchielli's ballet, in a nobleman's castle, revolving around the leader of the gators, Ben Ali Gator's crush on Hyacinth Hippo. Beautifully animated, wonderful comic relief amidst a storm of serious art. It would've been just as successful as a short cartoon. Hilarious!A Night On Bald Mountain and Ave Maria: One word: Chernabog. You have to see it to believe it. IS Bald Mountain REALLY a mountain? No, it's the crouching figure of Chernabog, a demon who calls all manner of grotesque, undead, and demonic things to himself, and tortures them in a hellish manner, disposing of them at will. Absolutely terrifying cacodemonic animation coupled with Moussorgsky's dramatic, intimidating score. But as dawn approaches, torch-bearing pilgrims, and Schubert's Ave Maria in the background, subdue Chernabog and the demons, and they return to the Underworld as a masterpiece ends. Vladimir Tytla is the only man who could possible have pulled off this dramatic, spell bindingly horrific sequence. The best piece of animation ever. Fantasia is something special. Music, comedy, and unadulterated evil. That's a strange mixture. But two hours of these elements come together to make what may be the best movie ever. Fantasia will amaze ya.10/10</fullReview>

Night on Bald Mountain and Nutcracker are beautifully made. The way the music enhances the movie to near perfection is absolutely astounding. GOOD STUFF HERE!ANIMATION The best. Not a bunch of computers like "Tarzan" and "Hercules." Artwork that is very detailed. Pictures that are unforgettable. Each animation frame belongs in a museum.CHARACTERS Their silent yet better developed than the ones that speak. Why? No annoying voices. No patheticly corny speech.

		<fullReview>This is one of the most fantastic animated features of all time in My opinion! Being a huge fan of movie music scores and classical music this is such an extraordinary movie to watch and enjoy. My favorite pieces in the film is the Nutcracker Suite, Rite of Spring, and Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria. These are three of the greatest pieces of music ever written in My opinion! The animation is crisp, clean, and clear! In fact, this animation is arguably better then today and there hasn't been any animation like the Night on Bald Mountain since in my opinion! Disney did a fabulous achievement here! So if you love Disney, the new fantasia 2000 animated feature, animated films in general, movie scores, and classical music then I strongly recommend that you head over to Amazon.com today and purchase this great animated movie today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Combination of Classical Music and Animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1940, Walt Disney released "Fantasia", the third feature of his studio and maybe his most ambitious project, with a beautiful combination of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski and animation. The result is a movie that has been worshiped by every generation. Yesterday I saw "Fantasia" again, now on the Special 60th Anniversary Edition DVD, restored and remastered with audio in THX inclusive with intermission. The program, for those that have eventually never seen or want to recall, is composed by the following: (1) Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach.(2) Nutcracker Suite by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.(3) The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas.(4) Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky.(5) Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack.(6) The Pastoral Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven.(7) Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli.(8) Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky.(9) Ave Maria by Franz Schubert.My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Fantasia"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've recently bought the Silly Symphonies DVD. My daughter Sarah and I have watched one cartoon every day, culminating in Fantasia. We didn't watch it all at once, but spread it over the course of a week (I tend to agree with other comments - it's too much for kids in one viewing). She sat on my lap and loved every minute of it, even 'Night on Bald Mountain'. I must admit I hadn't watched it for years and forgot about this section, but she wasn't scared by it. This is surprising when you consider the spider in 'Mother Goose Melodies' frightened her!In my opinion Fantasia is the ultimate Silly Symphony. It's obvious all the groundwork for the film came from them, which is why it's so good - the artists had ten years to hone and perfect their skills while Walt Disney had the vision to realise it. I wonder if he had thought of it a decade earlier and waited until the right moment to create it...? It's a real shame he never lived to see its success because he deserved to.It's hard to find the right words to surmise this film; I suppose I could break each section down and give my opinion as others have done, but as a whole - well, it's got good bits and bad bits; happy and sad bits, it's scary and funny and gloomy and sunny. It's spirited, colourful, sparkling, animated... but let's not get carried away here. It's only a film and some bits of it are quite boring.If you randomly wound through it you could find yourself watching any one of the above, and this to me sums it up - it's unique. What other film can you say that about?Fantasia is a light that will shine for generations to come. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Back Then!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is this film so incredible? If for no other reason, consider it is the year 1940!! Things like: Special effects, synthesized sound which interacted with animated motion, and color enhanced collage authentications, are things that just sort of roll off the end of our tongues today, but, back then, these techniques were very new to us!! Walt Disney is avant garde in so many uses of cartoon perfection!! In 1931, he came out with the first color cartoon. In 1937, the film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was a landmark in animated entertainment..."Fantasia" is absolutely one the best films ever made!! The color, the music, and the correlation between reality and illusionary depictions, culminated a brilliant montage of spectacular amusement for the movie audience!! My favorite segments were: Nutcracker Suite / The Russian Dance, Pastoral Symphony / Beethoven, and last but not least, Sorcerer's Apprentice / With Mickey Mouse. My mother said that I laughed hysterically for three hours in the movie theater at that scene with the multiplying brooms in the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment!! This film is synonymous with Christmas, as synonymous with Christmas as "It's a Wonderful Life" The movie "Fantasia" is considered one of the greatest films ever made, I wholeheartedly agree, in my book, it ranks 12th best movie ever!! "Fantasia" is usually in AFI's list of top 100 films ever made!! Imagery and the succinct use of color graphics are second nature with technical film artists today, back then, however, it was a revolutionary concept which dazzled the moviegoer!!! Walt Disney films are not just "cartoons" they are computerized digital artistry which evoke a rare art form of paramount escapism on the silver screen!! The "Fantasia 2000" movie was excellent too, but merely a rendition of the classic, while the segments were different, there just was not as much originality to them!! As a result, it lost a little panache in the process!! As a Chicagoan, I should like the "Fantasia 2000" more in one area: The music was performed by the Chicago Symphony!! In the original, the music was done by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra!! "Fantasia" is a rare treat that every movie aficionado should witness.. I definitely recommend seeing this movie, preferably around Christmas!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's best feature combines animation and classical music. Most of the sequences work. "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" has some interesting abstract images to fit the music. "The Nutcracker Suite" is superb--simply masterful animation perfectly matching the beautiful music. "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is a cute Mickey Mouse cartoon--probably your only chance to see Mickey wielding an axe! "Rites of Spring" is dull--seeing creation from the very beginning to the dinosaurs--VERY slow and boring. "The Pastrol Symphony" is lots of fun--it uses Greek mythology very well and has great animation--also topless females! "Dance of the Hours" is hilarious--ostriches, hippos, alligators and elephants dancing! "Night on Bald Mountain" is (even by today's standards) strong stuff. Very scary and frightening. "Ave Maria" is lousy--slow slow SLOW!!! Looks good though. Also the needless narration (explaining every single sequence in detail) is not needed. Still, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fantasia" is truly a film ahead of its time and it needs to be seen in able for one to understand its importance in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing Walt Disney knew about better than anyone else, it was that the combination of music and animation is one of the most important combinations since bread and butter. This can best explain why most of Disney's animated features are musicals. It's because Walt Disney strongly believed that music and sound were essential keys towards great animated features and shorts. One could make a good argument that his 3rd full-length animated feature, "Fantasia" (1940), was created as further proof regarding why he believed music was so essential to the world of animation. "Fantasia" is a unique animated feature in terms of its narrative. It starts out with an orchestra taking their places as if they were preparing for a concert. Then, the main narrator of this picture Deems Taylor emerges and introduces us to a new form of entertainment called "Fantasia". We are told that during this new form of entertainment, we will see the images that classical music had inspired in the minds of Walt Disney's massive staff of artists. In short, we're seeing pieces of famous classical music being brought to life visually based on what Disney's artists think these pieces are about. We are also told that there are three types of musical pieces in this program: music that tells a definite story, music that paints a series of pictures, and "absolute music" that exists simply for its own sake. This animated feature consists of eight separate segments which all are devoted to one of the three types of music. Sometimes, one could make an argument that some segments have more than one, since some segments are more clearly cut in the type of music they're going for than other segments. For instance, the first segment "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" is clearly an example of absolute music that exists simply for its own sake. All this segment composes of are visuals that one might think of whenever this classical music is being played. But then there are segments like "The Rite of Spring" which could easily count as music that paints a series of pictures as well as music that tells a definite story. The reason I believe this segment could apply to both is because while it tells us the history of the dinosaurs, you aren't exactly sure what to make of the overall vision Disney was going for with this segment. This is precisely why "Fantasia" is such a fascinating piece of filmmaking, because what it shows its audience is so unconventional and diverse that it's hard not to admire the fact that it's so original with its story structure. After seeing this picture a couple times, I have a better understanding of why "Fantasia" was immensely influential in the film industry, particularly with music videos. If you think about it, this film is just a series of silent animated short films perfectly synchronized to famous pieces of classical music. "Fantasia" would easily qualify as one of the films I would be most interested in learning more about the making behind. I would be more than eager to learn what Walt Disney's animators thought when he wanted to pursue executing this specific project so soon after the ambitious production of "Snow White". I would also be interested in learning the process behind the animation for these segments and how the animators synchronized the animation and music as well as they did, since I know the animation process was probably painstaking to say the least. Is this a film that will please everyone's tastes? I don't think so, since it's an acquired taste for some. After all, "Fantasia" is considered a big step for Disney fans to take since it's so different from anything Disney ever did that it could throw them for a loop. Are there some slow moments? I'd say that it gets off to a slow start, but by the time the film's most famous segment "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" with Mickey Mouse comes around, it only gets better. Was the intermission involving the soundtrack corny and unnecessary? While I certainly can say it is by modern standards, I'll be fair by stating that this came out at a time when some audiences had trouble getting used to the then-new Technicolor process and their eyes had to take a break from the bright colors on screen. "Fantasia" is truly a film that was way ahead of its time in almost every aspect imaginable. From outstanding segments like "The Rite of Spring" and "Night on Bald Mountain", to the excellent orchestration of the classical music by Leopold Stokowski and his orchestra, to the tremendous craft of the animation. It's one of those rare films in which the only way you can understand its importance in the history of cinema is to see for yourself. So what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this as a middle schooler in a drive-in theater. It still was impressive.Spoilers among what follows.Fantasia was released with a "multichannel" technique called "Fantasound," where one was the orchestral track, and the other was a control track that switched activation between speaker groups.The "Rite of Spring" episode was very colorful, but in its dinosaur sequence, even when it was made, the "dinosaurs" were mixed together anachronistically. Not that I don't like the visuals, but it's a bit like watching a World War I film with aerial battles with various ragwings, and suddenly a P-51 shows up.Beethoven's Pastorale was probably the prettiest segment, with everything very classical. The centaurettes looked like Malibu Beach girls (well, at least from the waist up) and the males like football jocks. Zeus was very playful, and the thunderstorm sequence was, to me, the highpoint of the episode.The "Sorcerer's Apprentice" was okay, but it was the only sequence to have a recognizable cartoon character in it. I think it would have been better with another, anonymous, character as the Apprentice."Night On Bald Mountain" was very impressive. However, I learned that the Tchernobog image was rotoscoped, and the person who did the original images was none other than Bela Lugosi. The use of color was especially effective. IMHO, that was the segment that should have been retained for Fantasia 2000.I've seen this dozens of times, and plan to see it many times more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an example of a cinematic milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first remember hearing about this movie when I was very little, and ever since I first watched it on VHS, it has always been one of the many examples of my favorite movies of all time. This is so unique, because unlike a typical Disney movie, in this movie we do not hear any dialog from the characters, and all of the music is instrumental (except for "Ave Maria" at the end). The film is divided into eight sequences, each of them being introduced by a guy named Deems Taylor, who was a very well-known music critique.The eight segments are as follows:1.) "Tocatta &amp; Fugue in D-minor" composed by Johanne Sebastian Bach. This segment consists of shots of the Philadelphia Orchestra and their conductor Leopold Stokowski with a lot of cool shadow and color effects during the first three minutes, then we see a lot of shapes and random objects that Taylor would suggest to us might pop into our brains when listening to the music.2.) "The Nutcracker Suite" composed by Tchaikovsky. In this part of the movie, we listen to excerpts of the famous ballet suite, and we see various fairies, flowers, fish and other nature-related creatures.3.) Everyone's favorite "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" starring Sorcerer Mickey and Yen Sid (the sorcerer whose name is "Disney" spelled backwards). This is also the only segment to be seen again in this film's sequel, "Fantasia/2000" 60 years later, and in it the apprentice brings to life a magical broomstick to try to fill a cauldron with water, and the spell goes wrong so the apprentice gets reprimanded. This is then followed by Mickey greeting conductor Stokowski.4.) "Rite of Spring" composed by Igor Stravinsky. This segment takes place billions and billions of years ago with the coming of the dinosaurs, where we see the creation of Earth in the beginning of time, and are later introduced to all of the different dinosaurs we later see in the imaginative "The Land Before Time" including the tyrannosaurus rex, which become extinct in the end of the segment.5.) "Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack". At this point in the film, Deems Taylor introduces this string thingamajigger called the "Soundtrack" that he asks to make a lot of sounds resembling various instrument sounds.6.) "Pastoral Symphony No. 6" composed by Beethoven. This segment is about a day in the countryside, and in it we see a lot of Greek mythology creatures like unicorns, satyrs, centaurs and centaurettes, cupids, Bacchus, Zeus, Iris, Apollo and Diana.7.) "Dance of the Hours". This is where we see dancing ostriches, alligators, elephants and hippos. Each part of the piece suggests different hours of the day, and it all ends with a triumphant finale where the dancing hippo takes center stage.8.) A combination of two pieces that are utterly different in mood and tone. They are "Night on Bald Mountain" in which a bat villain named Chernabog has Satan's evil spirits dance furiously until the coming of the sacred dawn, and then Franz Schubert's "Ave Maria" which is the one and only part of the whole film in which we hear lyrics sung, and then the movie ends.I simply must say that not only is this film one of my all time favorite animated masterpieces, but it is also an example of a big highlight of the 1940's in cinematic history, all because of the ways it is so unique and special. In addition to this masterpiece, I also think "The Wizard of Oz", "Gone with the Wind", "Citizen Kane", "Casablanca" and "Bambi" are main icons of cinematic successes. I definitely think this should have been the first animated movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award instead of "Beauty and the Beast".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watching Disney's classical music mind blower 'Fantasia', i always feel like i'm watching a ontological depict of existence in metamorphosis. as the real world outside the movie changes, rather than become irrelevant or dated, 'Fantasia' just becomes weirder and weirder and more of an enigma.not to say that a lot of it can't be understood. in fact, 'Fantasia' is today, more of what Walt Disney had always wanted it to be. high art. the label of true "art" and sophistication has always somewhat eluded this masterpiece because many serious critics were reticent to release a lot of the snobbishness they had toward the film and Disney. critics have always admired 'Fantasia' technically but have always kinda skewered it conceptually. they've always laid claim to the fact that Disney knew very little about classical music and the different segments had little or nothing to do with the different composer's music.that's pretty much true, but viewing the film today, it seems like a true opus or masterpiece in filmmaking. the viewer not only gets a chance to hear the legendary Leopold Stokowski conduct the Philadelphia philharmonic, but is also treated to the now culturally revered animation of Disney's amazing artist. not to mention the superlative intellect of the ever incredible Deems Taylor who is unequaled as narrator and host.any flaws that have been sited by critics in the past about 'Fantasia' hardly seem to matter anymore. the animation is so much an example of the top of it's craft, it's seems perfect and flawless. sure the 'Pastoral Symphony' gets a little babyish and looks a little like classic mythology meets the 'Care Bears', but why quibble? most people should expect Disney films to be cute, and Disney's 'Fantasia' has much more to offer the viewer than just "cute".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so close... if it had been 10 minutes shorter it would have been a 10!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is so educational, and I was gob smacked by how well the animation mixed with the classical music. Can I also say that Leopold Stokowski is one of the best conductor of the 20th century, right on a parallel with Herbert Von Karajan? I was listening to Sibelius's 5th symphony a few years back, and he conducted it the year before he died, and he was in his 90s. Not only that, but that was the best version of that symphony I had ever heard. Back to Fantasia then. Each piece was expertly introduced by Deems Taylor, and unlike its sequel didn't take too long.(Even the soundtrack vignette was interesting) In the sequel, almost half of the film felt like too much introduction and not enough music. Fantasia rectified that problem brilliantly: 1. Bach's Toccata- Brilliant silhouettes of the orchestra, and then masterful abstract images. The orchestra played the piece to a phenomenal standard, and I hate to say this, but I actually prefer the piece orchestrated. It was originally written for organ, you see. The best thing about Stokowski is that you see him conducting without a baton, which is exceedingly clever.2. Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker- I recommend you see the ballet, because it is a knockout. This is coming from a classical music lover. The animation was superb in this vignette. The most impressive thing though was the fact that the finishes immediately went into the next scene, without it being hackneyed. The waltz, or Dance of the Snow Fairies, was the highlight of this vignette, reminding me so strongly of Christmas.3. Dukas's Scorceror's Apprentice- The most famous vignette, is the only vignette to feature in the sequel. YenSid(Disney backwards) has a magic hat, which he leaves lying around, and Mickey Mouse picks it up, and encounters various problems. the animation is very good here, and while I'm not a huge fan of the piece, I still found it enjoyable.4. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring- This is the only reason why the movie isn't a 10. This vignette is far too long It's longer than the Beethoven. It is an interesting subject, dinosaurs, but the ballet wasn't simplified enough. This was boring, and was better left out. It was only here to give some historical context. However, there was beautiful animation and some lovely instrumental solos. Stravinsky hated what the film did to his work, but anyway I don't like Stravinsky much. I had no problem with the animation or the way it was performed, it was just too long. 5. Beethoven's pastoral Symphony- This is a fantastic piece of music. I am a huge fan of Beethoven, and I have all his 9 symphonies on my IPod. My favourites are this, the Choral and the Eroica. I loved the fact that they chose a Greek mythological setting, because it looked gorgeous. My dad who is a conductor wasn't keen on the centaurs, but I loved the winged horses, Bacchus and Zeus (who competes with Chernabog as the most frightening character of the movie). This vignette was so relaxing to watch; think it as like reciting a poem.6. Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours-This was the funniest vignette of the film, and one of the many gems of Disney. It was a bit unrealistic of course, but it was fun. At first, I was worried that the most famous scene from the opera La Giaconda, would be ruined by the animation. But it wasn't. It was perfect. Even the elephants and hippos, considering their size, danced so elegantly, I was shocked. This vignette is a must-see if you want some comedy.7. Mussorgsky's Night on Bare Mountain- Now this was my personal favourite, as when I first watched it when I was 10, and I was terrified of Chernabog. The music is also very hard to play, as the mood is very hard to capture, but this is undoubtedly the finest recording of this music. Chernabog was genuinely frightening, and a masterful creation. And the animation, while dark, matched the music, which is enough to give you nightmares, flawlessly. It was very like a Witch's Sabbath, which was what the composer originally intended. Do you know, that for his underrated fantasy movie Legend, Ridley Scott based Tim Curry's Darkness on Chernabog? Children may find it a bit too frightening, and adults may find it inappropriate, as there is a tiny glimpse of nudity. But it was still an effective vignette, and one of my favourite Disney moments actually. 8. Schubert's Ave Maria- This is a beautiful song, and Stokowski did it justice. The harmonies and animation were perfectly captured. how could you say this was boring? The animation couldn't have been happy looking, it would have completely ruined the mood of the song. It was beautifully sung by Juillietta Novis, who was so quiet that you had to turn the volume up, but that was the intention. The thing that impressed me most, was the complete contrast of this from the Mussorgsky, so the key of Ave Maria was so well chosen. (It is sung in many different keys.) In conclusion, the most underrated of the earlier Disney efforts, is well worth watching and a true animated classic! Also I was offended by the review that said that it was the worst movie ever made, and that the people who love this movie need new taste, that is plain insulting to anyone who grew up with this film. 9/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that I really wish I could make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been almost 70 years since "Fantasia" made its premiere on November 13, 1940. It's Walt at his peak, forget "Snow White". If you've never heard of this one, it's basically "The Twilight Zone" on acid set to classical music.It's also the movie that I really wish I could make. I think the timing's right, but other people might not. The reason is not even worth explaining.An amazing thing about Disney is they have changed a lot since then, and they're not the same anymore. "Fantasia" is a damn good movie, and they'll never do anything as good as this again. They ain't even the same Disney that I grew up with and I was born in the early '90s. These days Hollywood just loves to know how much milk they're gonna get out of the cows each and every year. It's so sad to say that most of the time the motion picture is just another way to make money instead of an art form.Art and business shouldn't be two different things. Children should never be patronized or used as a monetary target."Fantasia" is one movie that I wouldn't mind seeing in a theater, especially one that has a huge screen. The timing was anything but right when Walt completed it. I don't think the American moviegoer was mature enough to understand it. That's probably why it almost made Walt bankrupt.What I would have done is I would have shown it in IMAX with its big surround sound system. I would have done it as a mixed-media art film: hand-drawn backgrounds, digital artwork, hand-drawn animation, different kinds of special effects, stop-motion animation on live sets, etc. I'm one of those people that doesn't accept the status quo when it comes to movies. But Hollywood still manages to get it right... when they want to, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ravishing and unlike anything else around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fantasia' is an odd movie experience for being so unusual. However that's exactly what makes it so distinguish, original and unique. It's a very imaginative and creative Disney classic. For good and for bad, one thing is for sure: Disney never made anything like this before or after. That is, of course, with the exception of 'Fantasia 2000' but seriously there is no comparison. The original 'Fantasia' is a much superior work of art than the flawed 'Fantasia 2000', which fails miserably to repeat the magic and charm of the original.But, back to the original (which is the one that really matters to comment in this space), never before had the music and the magic of cinema made such a spectacular combination. It's interesting and wonderful how the music wins life and (just a force of expression) the images transform themselves in music. This "know-how" was also used in the famous Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey".'Fantasia' cannot be considered a masterpiece for me, but it can be considered almost a masterpiece. It has 8 distinguish segments. Save the live-action introductions with Leopold Stokowski as the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the voice of Deems Taylor to narrate the introductions, the whole thing is animated and without dialogs. Classical music replaces dialogs and speaks for what you see.Artwork is variable according to the segments, but always excellent and colorful. As for the segments, 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' and 'The Nutcracker Suite' are all about art, imagination and creativity. 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' is perhaps the most popular Mickey Mouse cartoon ever, it's clever and fun. 'The Rite of Spring' is okay but slow and my least favorite here (besides, it requires patience). 'The Pastoral Symphony' is immensely charming and sweet. 'Dance of the Hours' is very humorous, with ostriches, hippos, crocodiles and elephants as ballet dancers - these animals, particularly the hippos, are a comic relief. The polemic 'Night on Bald Mountain' is cool but a nightmarish experience - it's strong, disturbing and scary. 'Ave Maria' is good, even if slow and unexciting.Title in Portugal: 'Fantasia'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how old I was when I first watched this, but I may very well have been too young to comprehend how long ago it was made... much less how old some of the score is. I still recognize some of it from watching it more than a decade ago, and probably further back still. Putting images to classical music is a great way to get those of us(yup, guilty as charged) who just wouldn't sit down to listen to something like that under normal circumstances to experience it. Cartoons have aged remarkably well(not just this, in general)... what needs to, and/or is meant to, look imposing still does(I won't blow what they are, for anyone who hasn't seen this... and those who have may very well know exactly what I'm referring to), and the whole thing still works, almost 70 years after it was originally released. Little sound is added... the visuals are scored almost entirely with the performances of the orchestral classics, the way the animation brings the well-known composed pieces to life. Drawing styles vary, and some segments are naturalistic, others almost psychedelic. Colors are vivid, and sometimes underplayed. Segments are briefly introduced by a speaker. There is story progression in at least some of the bits. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't object to two hours of animated visuals to go with some of the greatest score ever composed. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people say that this is an overrated film. I would say that is actually the opposite, a completely underrated and misunderstood film, which even today is criticized and considered as a self- indulgent mess, when the reality is that this is one of the most beautiful films ever made. I love the classic animations from the Walt Disney Company: All had a incredible animation, very fluid and full of details and lovely colors. Every single sequence of this film is just like a dream, and even the darkest part (Night on Bald Mountain) is one of the most fascinating and memorable animations of all the history. I love this movie. I don't mind very much if other people find it to be boring and self indulgent, I will always consider "Fantasia" as a masterpiece. I would give this film eleven stars if I could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's musical masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fantasia" is an animated movie from 1940, produced by Walt Disney and directed by multiple directors. It is the third Disney animated feature having been made, the first two was "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) and "Pinocchio" (1940).Basic plot: In this film, eight segments are set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, while music critic and composer Deems Taylor makes an introduction to each of the segments.Just to point out some of the segments: In "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", Mickey Mouse attempts to try out some of sorcerer Yen Sid's magic tricks. "Rite of Spring" deals with the evolution of life on Earth, from volcano eruptions to dinosaurs. In "Dance of the Hours", animals like hippos and alligators perform a comic ballet in four sections. In "Night on Bald Mountain", a devil summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain, so they can dance and fly through the air...Not only has "Fantasia" been a great part of my childhood, but I'll confirm this to be a great favorite within the world of Disney animated movies. Here, the classical music and the animated segments fit perfectly with each other. The animation is just wonderful for something made in 1940. And besides from Deems Taylor introducing the segments, this film proves the fact not all movies need to always have dialogue in order to make a good story. It is also amazing on how "Fantasia" still holds the record for being the longest Disney animated movie, with the running time of at least two hours.Favorite segment: In my opinion, "Rite of Spring" wins.Most funny segment: Here, "Dance of the Hours" takes the cake.Most scary segment: "Night on Bald Mountain", clearly.This is how I grew up with "Fantasia": My family used to have this film on a British VHS originally released 1991. Together with several other animated features like Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" and Toei's "Panda no Daibouken", I could watch "Fantasia" many times without getting bored. "Night on Bald Mountain" was the only segment I couldn't manage to sit through. And I thought "Rite of Spring" was kinda creepy as well, thinking about how the Earth (which looked like a giant fireball) came closer and closer to the screen. The rest was no problem, as I watched it with pure pleasure. Prior to my big sister getting the same film on DVD several years ago, my family decided to get rid of the VHS.In my opinion, when it comes to musical animated features, as well as Disney movies, then nothing beats "Fantasia". This film can be watched by everybody, both children and adults. If you still haven't watched this film, then I highly recommend you to watch this one at least once. My overall rating: A well deserved 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Fantasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1940 saw a new form of entertainment created by Walt Disney, called Fantasia. Renowned musical compositions were played to a group of Disney's best artists, who were instructed to draw their responses to the emotion, expression and narrative that they heard in the music. The result was, in this reviewer's opinion, one of the most iconic moments in film ? these artists redefined creativity and breathed a new lease of life into popular (and perhaps overplayed) scores, forcing us to reconsider what it means to be artistic. A review of six parts would be appropriate in order to celebrate each of the six short films for their own success, however I also feel it is important to consider the effect of the film as a whole.Fantasia grounds itself upon a strong justification for its cause, ensuring throughout that the viewer (whether musically educated or not) understands the purpose of the exercise. The narrator disclaims from the word go that the animations are not absolute stories that will match with the composer's introductions, but instead, are developments from them. Here is where Disney promotes the refreshing method of creativity, which I previously mentioned: the suggestion that interpretation is limitless in possibility, and that each opinion should be celebrated and explored.I feel that Disney's choice of music exemplifies this philosophy to the most obvious and dramatic level. By using scores that are so famous and concrete in their accompanying stories, such as "The Nutcracker Suite", he shows how even the most popular music may have a different story to tell. The orchestra are silhouetted to represent the idea that music has become anonymous, and Disney gives a face to the compositions once again: literally re-animating the classics. We are taken on a journey to rediscover the beauty of compositions that we perhaps take for granted. The colourful animations take a flowing, almost hypnotising form within stories that draw upon hidden beats and instruments within textures of the score that make us rethink what we know about the music: we learn to listen rather than to hear. Disney celebrates the intricacies of composition as they were meant to be celebrated, and the creations of the artists approach each movement in every short with appropriate beauty and delicacy. (I would talk about my favourite short here ? Beethoven's "Pastoral" ? but once I start I will not be able to stop)!For me, Fantasia represents a redefinition of film in its time as well as a redefinition of what it means to be imaginative across all of the arts. An exercise that had never been tried before, and hasn't since by anybody except Disney, that proves the infinite limits of storytelling. The choices of iconic composition laced together with heart-warming and intelligent animation makes classical music accessible to all ages, and truly shows what it means to be creative: encouraging us to continue rethinking the past and to have our own opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first, the best, the unrivaled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia was to be the crowning achievement of Walt Disney Studios, their magnum opus, a work of art that finally convinced the people that animated films could be more than "mere" children's entertainment. Unfortunately, it was too much too soon. People went in expecting children's entertainment - after all, that's what Disney was known for - and instead were treated to high art. Nothing wrong with that, but you need to expect it first. And thus, Fantasia flopped financially, and what was meant to be a continuing series of films, remained just one until the turn of the century.But oh what a film it is. Music by the best classical composers ever lived, performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, hosted by Deems Taylor, featuring some the finest animated segments Disney had ever done. It's a stone cold classic, was from the very first moment, and it's a shame it didn't do so well. Luckily it has gone down in history as one of Disney's finest and will be watched and appreciated for centuries to come.As for the individual segments, they're not of equal quality, though they are all very good in their own ways.The opening segment, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, is not one of my personal favourites, but it works as a good opening intro to the idea behind Fantasia and is pretty to look at in its own way. It hasn't aged as well as some of the other segments, but it does its job more than adequately.Nutcracker Suite, on the other hand, is fantastic. Beautiful images, perfectly accompanied by one of the most recognizable pieces of music there is. After seeing this segment once, it's hard not to see fairies and seasons dancing around whenever you hear the piece.And then there's The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Everyone knows this one and has most probably seen it, even if they haven't seen the whole film. It's the segment with the most story and is one of the strongest Mickey Mouse shorts ever made. Grandeur, funny and even a bit threatening, it's probably the film's strongest moment.Rite of Spring is another one with a story, this time about the history of our small blue orb floating in the space. It's intriguing to watch, but once again the animation shows a bit of its age and it's perhaps even a little bit too ambitious for its running length. Not the strongest segment, but once again very good nonetheless.The Pastoral Symphony and Dance of the Hours, the next two segment, are to me very similar and while they're both fine, I cannot admit to liking them all that much. They're mostly just general gallivanting and while that's fine and fits the music, it can become a bit boring. The Pastoral Symphony is also the segments that has aged the least gracefully with some really rough character designs.Luckily we have Night on Bald Mountain and Awe Maria to close the film. And they are awe-inspiring. The devil on his lone mountain top is one of the scariest images Disney has ever produced and the rest of the segment is equally haunting, eerie and threatening. Which is why the following tranquility and quietness of Awe Maria works so well and allows you to drift over the finish line with a smile on your face and peace in your heart.Fantasia is not a perfect film, but it's still one of the finest pieces of art I've ever seen and a perfect introduction to animated films meant for adults. As a child I found it slightly boring. As an adult I'm in awe.</fullReview>

In this feature length we follow the Sorcerers apprentice otherwise known as Mickey Mouse through his journeys as a magician. The film plays off of a score played by the Philidelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopoldo Stokowski.Personally this film hots home for me due to the memories I have of watching it as a kid and being mesmerized by the sights and sounds of the film.

		<fullReview>Fantasia directed by many different directors is classic movie that everyone loves. Walt Disney produced it and it is probably one of their biggest achievements ever. I have never watched it until now and it was a really good movie. Many people view this film as one of the best animated films ever and I can agree with that after watching it. This film is so advanced for being made in 1940. It was amazing how they did it all. The music in this film is also well known by many and was a really big part to the movie. The Philadelphia Orchestra was in charge of the music. There was very little dialogue and that's why the music was huge because it basically took over for the little dialogue. The music really goes with the movie. The colors in the movie were also amazing. This time period was the beginning for colors to be introduced and they did a great job with it. I also think it is one of the top musical films ever too along with Singing in the Rain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. Incredibly revolutionary, especially for its time (1940). Even if it was made today for the first time it would be original.I can only begin to imagine the creative processes that went into making this movie. Just the idea of taking classical music and added surreal scenes to them would have required a large amount of imagination. Then choosing the music and creating scenes around it would have been an incredible task. Stumping up the funding for such a bold project would have taken a huge amount of daring too...But, thankfully, the movie was made and the end result is wonderful. A beautiful, often sweet and humorous, sensory ride. (This coming from someone who doesn't know much about classical music, though doesn't mind it).A work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasia's ambition earns its place in animation history. It was only the 3rd feature film Disney made, but it strayed away from the formula, telling stories in new ways, recording sound with experimental technology, focusing on art as well as entertainment. Walt Disney even planned Fantasia as a living artwork, evolving with new sections as the years passed. Its the only animated film I can name until the 70s that is "mature" (Not to insult the rest of Disney's filmography).And despite its 75th anniversary right around the corner, Fantasia has aged like fine wine. Its unique, magical, with a universal style. Each segment offers a new setting, the beautiful animation set to the greatest in classical music, each piece matching the tone perfectly. Some vignettes show us personifications of nature float through life's course. Others have cartoon animals and their mishaps. There's variety, consistently fresh without a single weak link or out-of-place short.If you're looking for plot or character, Fantasia isn't for you. Outside of the intermissions, its practically silent. The stories are quite simple. If its not your taste, or if you're in the wrong mindset, you might become weary. Its 2 hours long, slow, and style-over-subsistence set to a pretty calm genre of music. But its still a wonderful movie, and I wouldn't call it boring. Its something every fan of animation should see once in their life. And if you've never seen the "Night on Bald Mountain" segment...you need to watch Fantasia ASAP. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambition and creativity at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fantasia' was created around a beautiful idea. The music inspires the emotions. The emotions inspire the images. And the images go with the music to create a beautiful piece of filmmaking. It not only showed the potential and beauty that could be achieved not just through animation, but through filmmaking as an art form. Each short carries with it a distinct style in animation, with a different director working on each segment. Through this we witness great variations in the style of each short. The likes of 'The Pastoral Symphony' tells the simple story of different mythological creatures going to a party. Then some such as 'The Rite of Spring' segment created a narrative stretching millenia telling the story of the birth of earth to the death of the dinosaurs, earths first dominant species. It captures everything from the majesty of the birth of life to the rage of the T-Rex hunting their prey to create a wide spanning realistic story about the beliefs of the creation of life. Others such as 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' carry no narrative whatsoever. Instead they use only colours and patterns to match the rhythms and emotions of the music. With so many different styles each short is original, creating fantasies unlike anything we'd ever dreamt before. Even the tones of the different pieces differ greatly. Pieces such as 'Dance of the Hours' pack in the laughs with chaotic dancing Hippos and Elephants carrying as majestically as a ballerina. Whilst other sketches such as 'Rite of Spring' focuses on the beauty of the world, with different characters dancing through the seasons of the year. The film embraces many different worlds of magic and beauty, probably the most famous of which being 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. It showed the kinds of feats that could be achieved through animation, with the likes of a whirlpool and tidal waves being created in vivid and beautiful detail. It's an old story of an apprentice who dreams of power but is unable to control it, put to animation beautifully. But to me Fantasia's strongest feat is its finale, 'Night on Bald Mountain'. Whilst originally removed from some releases due to its controversy in scaring children, the short is one of the most powerful representations of pure evil put to screen. As the devil rises himself and an army of the dead to gain pleasure in watching them suffer. As it goes on we see the chaos reign as the flames engulf all the souls there. Whilst this chaos goes on the devil just sits there maliciously grinning as the suffering goes on. We then get 'Ave Maria' and the daylight scaring the daemon in to retreating back into the mountain. It reminds us of the constant conflict between good and evil, with good winning in the end but evil always being there. Lurking in the darkness and waiting for the next night. It's surprising that one of cinemas most child friendly film makers like Walt Disney helped create such a hellish vision on screen. But just like anything else he has helped make it is a defining film that has inspired film making for many years.And when it comes down to it that's exactly what Fantasia is. Walt Disney bringing animators ambitions and unique styles to the screen. He ensured that we were given a cinematic experience unlike any we'd seen before, bringing many creative worlds to life through the power of the orchestra. It's originality and ambition makes it a cinematic landmark that stands as well today as any other classic Disney and a real testament to the beauty of the golden age of Disney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1940 animated classic masterpiece Fantasia was a groundbreaking revolutionary film and has since not been duplicated in this reviewers opinion. In the years since the genre has been littered with many animated features that are musicals, Fantasia was the first last and only animated feature that featured no words and only music. The score that sets the backdrop of the stories in Fantasia is European classical music. The score was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, and was conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The film depicts several different stories as told through music and video. Mickey Mouse Donald Duck, and Daisy Duck are the only famous animated character in the movie, Leopold Stokowski, and Deems Taylor are the only people to appear in the film and they play themselves. Within Fantasia there are several stories, the first of which is "The sorcerer's apprentice" this short features Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's apprentice, the story was an adaptation from Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's poem of the same name. In the Disney version the sorcerers name is "Yen Sid" (which is Disney spelled in reverse) is angry at Mickey when he saves him. The next short is "The Rite of Spring" is a story about evolution. It starts off in space in the Milky Way and zooms in to Earth, which has just been formed. We then zoom into a pool of water where we see the first cells form, and then become eye witness to mitosis followed by the first animals crawling form the sea onto land. Then we are taken to the time of the dinosaurs, we witness a battle between among a tyrannosaurus, and a stegosaurus with the tyrannosaurus eventually winning the battle. The end of the score brings about the extinction of the dinosaurs. The third segment in Fantasia is the "Dance of Hours". This segment features animals dancing the ballet, including a hippo in a tutu. The animals dance around gracefully at first but as the music reaches its climax the ballet starts coming apart at the seams. The alligators are chasing the hippo, and the hippo is running from the unwanted advances. On the final drum beat the entire place collapses in on its self. The final segments are tied together; the "Night on Bald Mountain" the demon Chernabog is seen summoning form the grave enslaved souls. Chernabog is seen with other demons and ghosts skeletons and others preparing for an invasion of a kind. Then with the sounding of the Angelus bell Chernabog along with the rest of the daemons are sent back into hiding. As the music Ave Maria is played we follow a line of robed figures through a forest to a cathedral.This film was spectacular for its time, and is still a classic to this day. Nothing like Fantasia had ever been done, the mixing of some of the world's most fantastic classical musical master pieces with such imaginative and amazing animation from some of the times most talented animators makes for a visual and aural delight and one of the best animated movies of all time. The many themes both challenge the audience and delight them. From the whimsical dancing animals to the greater ideals of both evolution, and what some interpret as Armageddon the film makers bring the stories to life in their own unique way. Boggs, J.

		<shortDescription>Never imagine (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Fantasia was just another Disney movie, but after watching the film my opinion changed; in a positive way. I was impressed with the creativity and the quality of the element combinations between the orchestra music and the animations. Also, there was a smooth transition feeling between the various segments of the movie; making each segment more enjoyable. The colors in this magical musical animation were amazing. All the scenes were pretty much full of colors and made me feel as I was a child again. The colors were bright and dark at times, but they were brought to live with the music allowing the audience to relax and enjoy the visual elements. The lighting plays an important part of the film. In parts of the film, like in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, the lights and shadow gave a more realistic look at the animation. For example, Mickey Mouse salutes Mr. Taylor (the narrator) at the end of the segment, providing a unique interaction between real and fictional characters. Lastly, during the orchestra intermissions, the audience can appreciate the human and musical instrument's shadows as they are living to take a break; this effect lets the audience feel as you are sitting down in a theater, watching the orchestra perform live. Fantasia is educational and provided a lot of elements for the audience to use their imagination. A good example is the prehistoric segment as it educates about different dinosaurs and their food sources; and how the world changed to a new era. Also, there are other segments in which people can relate to their belief and dreams. Overall the movie is great to explore imagination and enjoy classical music with art, but I would recommend not watching it if you are tired or you could relax too much and fall asleep. To fully enjoy the movie, make sure you are rested and transport to a colorful world.I must add that Fantasia is not for all audiences unless you enjoy classical music and animations; and if you are watching the film with children, please be prepared to explain some scenes as the general audience standards for rating movies and TV shows have changed. Thus, parents should watch the film before their kids to be ready to answer questions such as the naked angels, dark and mean Gods, Mickey Mouse using an ax to chop up a broom, fighting horses acting like ducks, and so on. This is a beautiful movie, but as times have changed and what was acceptable before, it is not anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasia is the Greatest Films of Music and Art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is one of the best Disney animated films that I watch this movie a lot in my childhood. It became the cinematic masterpiece of great music and great art for putting a lot creativity. It begins with the blue background with lots of musicians came here to play their musical instruments and here we meet Deems Taylor, an special guest for the movie, is telling about Fantasia, a musical program of showing some music and art that they made good ideas from Disney Animated Studios for the audience. Then, it begins the music where every variety that comes from tune of nature and it starts 8 sketches of animation with silent music. It has "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" with Mickey Mouse playing his magic with the sorcerer's hat, "Rite of Spring" where the prehistoric history of nature dinosaurs, "The Pastoral Symphony" with the fantastic Beethoven tune in Greek mythology, and my favorite is the "Night of Bald Mountain" where Chernabog appears from the dark mountains and create his evil creatures of evil. This movie is pure nature of great music and the work of art. I love this movie so much that I've seen as a child, but now as an adult, I can hear my thoughts about music and fantastic visionary of animation. This was one of my favorite movies of all time and definitely will see it in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, unique and utterly bewitching - 90%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, whenever I think of Disney films then I tend to associate them with endless adaptations of fairy tales and lazy, direct-to-video sequels to films to do become hits like "Aladdin" and "The Lion King". Of course, back in the day, they were innovators in the same way that fellow animation studio Pixar are these days and this is arguably their most experimental offering. Ditching all but their biggest and most recognisable character as well anything like a cohesive story, this long musical journey feels like a twisted dream fuelled with colour, humour and noise. It is also utterly bewitching and almost unique but what I find most amazing is how brave it is, given its age and how challenging it remained until the first half of "WALLE" 68 years later."Fantasia" is actually made up of eight short films, each one set to music. The idea, as described by the narrator Deems Taylor, is to portray the thoughts and inspirations of the composer in each piece - whether it's a mythical landscape populated with cherubs and centaurs, dancing toadstools or Mickey Mouse working as a sorcerer's apprentice. The musical pieces vary from Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite and the epic Night On Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky. All music is played on screen by the Philadelphia Orchestra and is conducted by Leopold Stokowski.It would be tempting to suggest that "Fantasia" is like a love letter to two art-forms perceived to be dying: classical music and hand-drawn animation. Certainly, it is a reminder of just how pretty and intricate old-style animation could be as the film is stunningly beautiful at times. There are also some classic pieces of film included here from Mickey's classic image as the Sorcerer's Apprentice to a truly terrifying demon atop of Bald Mountain summoning the dead to do his dark bidding. But in truth, "Fantasia" is still as fantastic and relevant as it's always been. Classical music is enjoying something of a resurgence while hand-drawn animation remains in use today (take Disney's own 2009 film "The Princess And The Frog"). It does last too long and younger viewers will be bored stiff as I was when I was a nipper watching this for the first time many years ago. But for adults and fans of films that are a bit different, this is a real treat. It might not be for everyone but for me, it is a beguiling way of passing the time. A shame the music isn't more relaxing at times but "Fantasia" is a rare film, one that lives up to its name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legendary Visual Realization of a Series of Classical Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies affect viewers in different ways. Sometimes they can be enjoyed for their plots, characters, settings or other aspects of the mise-en- scene; but they can also be appreciated subliminally, appealing to our imagination, whether conscious or unconscious. FANTASIA is one of the best - if not THE best - example of this process at work. The film's visual beauty is stunning - a testament to the labors of the thousands of animators who worked on the project. The variety of visual styles is equally breathtaking, from the story of evolution recounted to the accompaniment of Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring," to the comic ballet performed by ostriches, hippopotamuses, elephants and alligators (Ponchielii's "Dance of the Hours"), and the devilish revel abruptly interrupted by the coming of a new day (Mussorgsky's "Night on a Bare Mountain" and Schubert's "Ave Maria"). Yet Disney was no high-flown idealist; he wanted his work to be accessible to mass audiences. Hence these elemental sequences are juxtaposed alongside simpler stories, such as "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" in which Mickey Mouse learns the error of his ways. The action doesn't take itself too seriously: while Dennis Taylor's narrative introductions are both concise and informative, he is shot against the background of members of the Philadelphia Orchestra taking a break from their labors. While they have an important task - to ensure the music carries the narrative - they also need respite. FANTASIA is the kind of work that befits repeated viewings in order to encompass is range of visual as well as technical wizardry. Every viewer will interpret the sequences differently, which is precisely the point in any work like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's most ambitious feature to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like DW Griffith's silent epic Intolerance (1916), Disney's most ambitious work Fantasia (1940) is a film more respected than loved. It is an experimental work, lacking the warmth of the most popular Disney films but beating out nearly all of them in terms of artistry and animation (its only rival being Pinocchio (1940)). Indeed, this might be the one Disney film created for an adult audience alone, even though more thoughtful children will be able to enjoy it.The Disney studio would never do something so bold as this ever again. Oh sure, they made Fantasia 2000 (1999) during the final years of the Disney Renaissance, but let's face it, that was made with toddlers in mind. It doesn't run nearly as long, insults the audience's intelligence with those dreadful celebrity introductions, and the new segments never measure up to the maturity and sublime artistry of the original. The Disney name is too closely linked with "children's entertainment" for them to boldly experiment at this point. That Fantasia was made at all is a miracle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mix classic music, lots of creativity, visual experimentation, tons of fun, and you get Fantasia - a fantastic movie full of fantasy and magic.Barely a word is spoken, but the movie is easily understood by everybody. It has a lot of those classic mute movies of the 1920s. Music is a subject of experimentation, the mojo that inspires the stories, and the soul of the movie - what gives the movie consistency and harmony.This movie was released in the 1940s and is still enjoyable and contemporary, and it is one of the reasons why Disney and the Disney Factory are respected nowadays.If you have kids and want to introduce them to classic music, this is the perfect film to do that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I've got to be honest about this - this was the fourth time I tried to watch "Fantasia". I never got beyond The Sorceror's Apprentice before, so I made myself get through the whole film yesterday. Still, I needed to take advantage of that intermission, because I just got too antsy. Hard to say why, but it just didn't hold an interest for me. As conductor Leopold Stokowski mentioned, one could as easily close one's eyes and imagine a set of images to go with the music just as well. I think I would actually have preferred that.The thing is, I realize that this was an important film for both the history of cinema and for Walt Disney. Considering the era, it was nothing short of a phenomenal accomplishment. For 1940, the dinosaur sequence was visually way ahead of it's time; today, it just doesn't hold up. And that's not meant to take anything away from the many artists who would have contributed to this project. Sometimes the magic works and sometimes it don't - for me, this was one time that it didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mesmerizing! The abstract segments are the best by quite a long margin (aka "Toccata And Fugue In D Minor" and "The Nutcracker Suite"), but "The Rite Of Spring" - which is quite brutal for Disney's standards, let alone for 1940 - and the most psychological segment of all, the brooding "Night On Bold Mountain/ Ave Maria", are pure visual and aural delight. 70 years later, this still stands as a bold experiment and one of the best films of all time. Ironically, the much celebrated "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is the lesser segment here. It's just a bit too linear when compared to the rest of them. Of the last two segments, "The Pastoral Symphony" is a good compromise between a linear storyline and an impressionistic "narration" of the music piece, while "Dance Of The Hours" is probably closer to the traditional Disney spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now there are three kinds of music on this program ? Fantasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our screening of the original uncut 1940 Roadshow, 35mm Disney Studio Archive Print, (yes, it came from the "vault"), of Fantasia was introduced by Disney historian and author John Culhane. He relayed a story about when he spoke with Walt in 1951 and mentioned how great he thought this mix of sound and images was. Walt responded by saying, "but it hasn't made any money yet". And that was ten years after its release. He did say that Disney still held strong to his convictions that it was what he needed to make at that time. In 1940, he believed that showing a visceral experience like Fantasia was just what the medium called for; it was the natural evolution of animation in his mind. You have to respect that, no matter how much money he lost after its four-year creation process, employing thousands of animators, it was all about the craft. When you look at the state of the genre today, with about ten films a year from multiple studios, many of them drivel, it is definitely a treat to go back seventy years and see what actual hands drew for the world to see. Frame by frame, note by note, you really can't deny the brilliance of this film, even if you probably will fall asleep at least once each viewing.I remember the first time I had seen Fantasia, I was young and it was one of the few Disney films I had yet to experience. I hated it. It was the most boring thing I'd ever seen. Even when Mickey Mouse finally showed face, with that wizard hat I had seen in so many pictures, I could care less. Truthfully, I might not even have finished it, (when intermission came halfway through, I told my friend that I couldn't even remember what else there was, all my memories had played in Act 1). But I kept thinking about the film each year later. As I grew older and started pursuing a career in the arts, it nagged at me that I didn't appreciate the feat. Then Fantasia 2000 came out and I began to see what I missed in the original so many years before. So, when it was announced that Fantasia was coming to Buffalo's premier theatre Shea's, it was an invite that was tough to pass up.Admittedly, I almost nodded off a few times during the two-hour duration. But that is not meant to detract from the wonder this film instills, not at all. From the narration amongst the Philadelphia Orchestra by Deems Taylor, in partial silhouette, complete with a prologue to each song, (whether they be the kind of music that tells a definite story, the kind that has no specific plot, or that which exists simply for its own sake), to the image of conductor Leopold Stokowski standing alone on his platform, to the animation on screen, working from the music, telling its story, you will be transported to a different world. It is not for everyone?especially little children this day and age with no attention spans, (many parents left with their offspring early on)?but if you're willing to let it wash over you, and enjoy the works of Bach, Tchaikovsky, etc., you won't be disappointed. It's a concert film above all else; you're just watching animation rather than the musicians and their instruments.And you cannot deny the artistry of it all, oftentimes hearkening to future films Disney would be making. You can see the precursors to Tinkerbell in the naked fairies flying around as well as the donkey used that same year in Pinocchio. The abstract illustrations are intriguing, but my favorites are definitely the ones steeped in some biomorphic form. I absolutely love the "Nutcracker Suite" vignette, find the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" to be wonderful, and really get blown away by some of the finale, the combo of "Night On Bald Mountain" and "Ave Maria". In that final sequence you get to see some amazing artwork in the devilish, winged creature as well as the architectural forms during the "light" moments at the end. At times you see frames with immense amounts of gradation and depth, moments where the stark flat colors usually seen, meld into still frames gorgeously painted as though works of art, not something to be seen for a fraction of a second. I'm not sure exactly what causes this, but those freeze-frames are my favorite part of the film.So, is Fantasia a great film? I don't really know how to answer that question. I can appreciate it for what it set out to do, and deem it a complete success in that regard, but would I rather watch it then the likes of Disney classics like Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast, or Robin Hood? No. That said, though, I would recommend it to anyone out there with an open mind and ability to see past the commonplace and mainstream. Some may say you can only truly enjoy your experience if you are on drugs, that the creators themselves were at the time, but that is a disservice. Fantasia is a world that needs to envelop you and become your sole visual focal point for two hours. If you are willing to put in the time, Disney's epic will not lead you astray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasia is a FANTASTIC film! The Fantasia Anthology is unmissable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW! I've seen this movie lots and lots of times and I STILL am breathless by its powerful spell! "Fantasia" is definitely Walt Disney's greatest masterpiece, cartoon-films just don't come better - not even these days, I don't think because these days animated films are just getting worse leaving us with less good films than we deserve to see and it's totally unacceptable. But this kind of feature just never fails to amaze me every time I see it, it has absolutely EVERYTHING you would want to see in a fantastic film, e.g Walt Disney has chosen a very good selection of classical music pieces, the animation is just stunning with rich colours, the sound powerfully attracts your attention being so loud and bold and clear (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor the beginning piece) and at the very end of that segment you see Leopold Stokowski, "Fantasia"'s conductor, conducting the Philadepia Orchestra with so much power and emotion and he is stood on his platform doing this while a dramatic sunset shining with glorious rays of light just attracts the eye and. Toccata and Fugue has been visualized in abstraction and the abstract images that Walt Disney has created, from what I've seen, aren't quite as attractive and as unusual as Oskar Fishinger's interpretations but you can kind of accept it. The upcoming pieces tell a proper story and, except for "A Night on Bald Mountain" (because it's so frightening), I think they are great stories and ANOTHER reason I think "Fantasia" is such a special, incredible film is that it magically gets people to just wake up, get out of things like Eminem and Pink and The Black-Eyed Peas and the ever cocky Robbie Williams and just appreciate the beauty and the emotion of classical music whether it's contemporary and recent or extremely old. My father gave myself, Natalie (my sister) and William (my half-brother) ?100 each to spend during the summer. I intended to spend it on "The Fantasia Anthology" which is a 3-DVD box set on "Fantasia", "Fantasia 2000" and "The Fantasia Legacy" (a special bonus disc). The old box-set I had for this powerful film was called "The Fantasia DVD Collection" which was so poor and incredibly dull compared to the "Anthology" which cost exactly ?100. But "The Fantasia Anthology" only plays in Region 1 and that's not where we are in England, sorry to say! However Richard, my step-dad, did manage to track down one from China that plays in any region. Sadly, as much as I adored it and preferred it by a long way to the old one which was rubbish, it was poor and now we've got to wait for a replacement! However, after finding out that there were LOTS of delays between here and China, I wanted my ?100 back again and this time we've managed to track down one from our very own homeland - ENGLAND! It does still play only on Region 1 but we did buy an all-region DVD player for my room and, so I believe, chucked out the plain Region 2 player. We believe it'll arrive here by mid-next-week at the very latest! I CAN HARDLY WAIT! I urge you! If you want to literally feel invigourating power from a 3-Disc DVD Box set then you've got to save up your money whether it's pounds, dollars, francs (in the case of France) and get it... FAST! It will be so exciting to see the original film uncut and the scenes probably not a soul from this generation has seen. There are so appealing and amazing, however, I suffered great disappointment when I discovered that the soft, sticky voice of Deems Taylor was dubbed by the irritating voice of Corey Burton. I just don't get it! Why would Disney productions want to get rid of the real thing, the original voice? They kept the original soundtrack! So why bin the original narrative-descriptions? For crying out LOUD! Are they totally mad? How VERY silly?! Walt Disney said so himself that he intended for all his films to be as original as possible and I think it's absolutely shameful for this modern generation of film-makers to just go against his wishes! Deems Taylor's voice is like butterscotch angel-delight and Corey Burton's voice is like a box of kitchen-knives. When I heard THAT voice and not the original one I thought, "oh, NO! Nearly 2 hours of that horrid voice and what's more we don't have the opportunity to hear the original narrator talk to us himself in the deleted scenes!" Corey Burton really, really drives me up the wall and makes me sad to have to overdub that lovely, original voice! When I hear him speak, with him thinking he is better than EVER at the fun job of narrating "Fantasia", I can tell he's just so full of himself, and, yeah OK, narrating a film as stunning as this must be a lot of fun but this role is Deems Taylor's and NOT Corey Burton's! I hear him talk I kind of say "oh just shut your mouth and go away, you impostor, we want Deems Taylor back (the real one)!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"'Fantasia" will Amaze 'ya," said the marketing push behind Disney's 1940 grand experiment.I'd say "amaze" is an under-estimation. How about stun? Enthrall? Thrill? Amuse? Terrify? How about all these things in the same movie???"Fantasia" is one prime example of a movie that benefits from repetition. Its charms, its imaginative brilliance, its gentle humor, its artistic genius are drawn out the more it is viewed.The "Toccata and Fugue" is an abstract dream. I love the way it subtly moves from visual literalness (colored strings and horns) to inventive fantasy.The "Nutcracker" is both beautiful and whimsical. I can't hear the Chinese Dance without seeing that cocksure mushroom trying desperately to catch up on the dance steps of his brethren.Beethoven's "Pastorale" has many highlights, including the Pegasus who learns to fly. I wish, wish, wish, though, that Disney's PC patrol hadn't clipped any of the centaurs (I'm against racial bias, but c'mon--how innocent can you get?)."The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is a terrific centerpiece. I love watching Mickey wet his finger--in the middle of a maelstrom--to try to turn the page. The way the artists play with light and color make this segment truly nightmarish."The Rite of Spring" is amazing, especially when you consider that the artists of 1940 had to use their imagination regarding *exactly* what dinosaurs looked like (paleontology at the time being what it was)."Dance of the Hours" is a wonderful parody of ballet that brims with laugh-out-loud moments: Ben Ali Gator riding the hippo like a merry-go-round and, later, being flattened by her tonnage."Night on Bald Mountain" is terrifyingly weird. The dancing harpies and ghouls are truly disturbing, and the sight of Chernobog at his most wrathful is enough to make anyone squish down in his or her theater seat just a little."Ave Maria" is simply gorgeous, a fitting end.I can't help but be amazed at this film upon every viewing. It was years ahead of its time (a testament to the geniuses behind it), which explains the paltry box-office receipts. The MTV moguls should, on bended knee, thank Walt Disney and Leopold Stokowski nightly. Without their genius at marrying visuals to music, the era of vee-jays may never have come at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's finest; a true masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most unusual films ever produced. It is also one of the most beautiful. Walt Disney took a risk producing this film (it was his third), coming hot on the heals of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, and it was a risk that paid off (albeit several years after the initial release). Made up of several short animated films set to classical music, FANTASIA has many highlights too numerous to mention within the confines of a review. There's Mickey Mouse in "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," sure, but there are many more memorable moments: abstract imagery set to Bach's "Toccata and Fugue"; the nature ballet set to "The Nutcracker Suite" (my personal favorite); "The Rite of Spring" depicting the origins of life on Earth; the depiction of good vs. evil in "Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria", among others, this film offers something for everyone. FANTASIA is also a showcase for special effects (there are some stunning images in the film), color (the Technicolor is just exquisite, considering this was so early in the days of color film), and sound recording (this was the first film produced in what is known today as stereophonic sound). Although the film failed when it was first released in 1940, FANTASIA is rightfully acclaimed as a classic. I don't think this can be called a movie- it is an experience. One of my theater professors from college once told me of when he was taken to see a reissue by his father when he was young. My professor remembered seeing his father crying, then leaning down to him and whispering: "This is what we can do with imagination." I can't think of a better testament to the sheer beauty of this film than that story. Once you see it, you will never forget it. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just Walt Disney's masterpiece, but one of the greatest animated films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After over seventy years, Walt Disney's Fantasia remains one of most shining examples of animation and music ever committed to film. A labor of love for the man behind Mickey Mouse, the movie is split into eight different segments with a noted piece of Western classical music (conducted by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra) serving as the backdrop for the story in each one.Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor opens the film with abstract, expressionistic images that coincide with the music. There is no real story here; it's probably the most dream-like segment of the entire film.Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite is given a new look in the movie; eschewing its traditional story for a ballet of nature as set to the tones of the Chinese Dance, Waltz of the Flowers, and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy among others.The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas is by far the most recognizable and popular segment of the entire film. A showcase Mickey Mouse who plays the titular character that uses magic to bring a broomstick to life carry out his chores, with disastrous results.Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is visualized as the gradual transformation of Earth from an uninhabitable world of roiling seas and volcanoes to the age of the dinosaurs. An impressive showcase for special animated effects as well as the realistic appearance of the dinosaurs.The Pastoral Symphony (Ludwig van Beethoven's 6th) is set against the backdrop of Mount Olympus and Ancient Greek mythology is utilized to tell the story. Centaurs, unicorns, Pegasus, Zeus, and other gods and creatures appear in the most fanciful and elegant segment of the film.Coming from Amilcare Ponchielli's opera "La Gioconda", The Dance of the Hours is a ballet that progresses from day to night with ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators performing the act. The result is one of the best segments of the film.The finale is the combination of Modeste Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria into one major segment showcasing the clash between good and evil. The talents of animator Vladimir (Bill) Tytla and famed illustrator Kay Nielsen take center stage.Fantasia was, and still is, unlike any film ever made when it was first released, for the film was the first to utilize a stereophonic soundtrack to replicate to concert hall experience in theaters. Though time has dated it, Fantasia remains a captivating work where seeing it just once is not enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Animated Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney was never a great part of my childhood. I watched a couple of its classics, but I don't have that many fond memories of them. They mostly leave me indifferent nowadays. So I never imagined I'd be watching Fantasia. But a friend recommended me an animated musical called Allegro Non Troppo, which is a bit of a parody of Fantasia, and suggested I watch the Disney movie first to appreciate it better.So I watched it, and I wasn't ready for it. Fantasia may just be one of the finest musicals and animated movies ever made. It's certainly the best thing I've ever seen from Disney. The premise is to create animation that matches classical compositions by Beethoven, Ponchielli, Stravinsky, etc. And it's a beautiful mix of visuals and music.Nearly all animated sequences are great, but some stand out, like the "Night on Bald Mountain", when the devil summons out demons and the spirits of the dead; "The Sorceror's Apprentice", which even someone who hasn't seen this movie knows since it's the famous cartoon of Mickey Mouse as a magician animating a broom to do his bidding; "The Nutcracker Suite", which shows a dazzling dance of nature and fairies; and "Pastoral Symphony", set in a beautiful mythological Greek setting.Even by today's Pixar standards, the animation is breathtaking, and I do believe some of the colors achieved in this movie can't even be reproduced by the hard-working makers of Wall-E and The Incredibles. Some of the color sequences are so good they stand up to Kubrick's psychedelic light show in 2001: A Space Odissey.This movie was awarded two Oscars for its contribution to the art of cinema. I don't think it'd have been too much to give it an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. At least it deserved an Oscar for best screenplay, even if no words are heard in this musical. But I imagine creating animated sequences that match existing musical pieces was no easy task.All in all, Fantasia is a great movie. Save for a slow beginning and a few dull segments, it's always entertaining and magical. And now remains to see if Allegro Non Troppo can live up to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing,even on an outdated VHS tape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time just days ago,and not on DVD as you might guess,but on a now obsolete VHS video tape that I checked out from a local library.I was mesmerized,even though I realize it would have been even more impressive on disc,because once upon a time it took a lot of hard work to make animated films,especially feature films.It had to take even harder work to illustrate every note of it's classical music soundtrack with the animation.There is some dark imagery here that young children would be disturbed by,which I found surprising,but then I realize that early animation projects weren't always geared toward solely children.This is a true animated classic that can easily stand toe to toe with any great live action film of its time or any other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasiastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of classical music- its such a universal form of music. This movie is one of my earliest memories, and I believe it is due mainly to the enduring tunes that are ingrained alongside each image. Since it is composed of individual sketches, I'll review each one separately.Toccata and Fugue- It is a marvelous way to start out the program- first showing the instruments as if we are watching a regular concert and gradually drifting off to the heights of animated imagination. The abstract imagery beautifully compliments the bold and whimsical music.The Nutcracker Suite- Probably the most famous ballet of all time and the music leaves no reason to wonder why. Each little vignette is a treasure, from the cute Asian mushrooms to the exuberant Russian flowers to the seductive Arabian goldfish. The falling snowflakes in the stirring Waltz of the Flowers are the icing on the very decadent finale. The rich colors in this sequence hold the visuals up to par with the spectacular music.The Sorcerer's Apprentice- Somehow I never liked this one as much- perhaps I didn't care for the intrusion of an obvious cartoon character in my special fantasy film. The harshness of Mickey Mouse killing the broomstick and the world turning deathly pale also gave me a terror from which I never really recovered. I do realize that Fantasia was built entirely around this segment to boost the flagging appeal of Disney's original hero and I can appreciate this segment as such, for it truly worked. The redesign that went into this short has carried the mouse into the hearts of every generation since.The Rite of Spring- This has got to be my least favorite of all the pieces. The music is very harsh and savage- which is what the composer intended- it's just not the style I like to listen to. That does not help matters as there is also an exceedingly long section of darkness, planets and a very uninhabited earth. The grand scope of this is ingenious, panning through galaxies to our planet, but it takes a long time and coupled with a few minutes of molten lava, it tends to get monotonous and boring. Since the music is not particularly inspiring, there is nothing for a good while that holds my interest and I usually end up skipping to the dinosaurs. Once it actually gets to living creatures, things pick up. The Tyrannosaurus scene is quite entertaining, if not very true to facts. I love the blaring "DUN DUN DUN"s! as the Rex triumphs over his prey. The story and music match perfectly.The Pastoral Symphony- Definitely my favorite section. I am a huge fan of Beethoven and mythology- could it get better? The music is divinely beautiful and the animation is loaded with colorful, glittering eye-goodies. My mouth actually waters when I watch this because things look enticing enough to eat. Elegant Pegasus and mischievous cupids prance around a rainbow countryside as centaurs pair off in a sort of blind-date-beauty-pageant. The main gods of Greek and Roman Mythology make an appearance here, from the drunken Bacchus to the angelic Diana. It's mostly a lot of fairytale fluff, but for someone who likes to spot the nuances of mythological lore, or just enjoys a bit of beautiful animation, it's a more than enjoyable waste of time.Dance of the Hours- Admittedly, I can't watch it now without trying to sing the hello mudda song, but this is a really funny bit in its own right. Taking such awkward animals as the gangly ostrich or the lumbering hippo and turning them into ballet dancers is a stroke of comedic genius. The seductive crocodile is my favorite character- what an odd charmer! The music somehow lends itself to hilarity, making this one of the most mixed up ballets I've ever seen! Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria- Deliciously dark and radiantly pure, the juxtaposition of these two pieces could not have been more perfect. The burning passions of the night run rampant across the screen and speakers as Chernabog summons the powers of hell to his mountaintop. At the height of his theme, a single sound and glimmer of light shatters the chaos. The moment is quite beautiful as the lone voice in the terror, so low it is barely heard, breaks the spell and dispels the darkness of evil. Slowly, the voice grows and is accompanied by many lights and voices until it breaks out into the full theme of Ave Maria and we come from the cave into a brilliant, hopeful dawn. Quite an inspiring ending to any film.The movie is also filled with an introduction to each segment as well as a short on "the soundtrack." Each piece was made with a care that you will be hard-pressed to match in this era. Fantasia 2000 showed a desire to learn from such times. I hope the spark continues to grow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fantasia" is pure magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3rd animated Disney classic is a unique movie experience. It is a rare and completely different movie than what people are used to."Fantasia" actually consists in 8 segments, being each one totally different. Aside the introductions by Deems Taylor before the segments, there are no dialogs. Art is above everything else, combining animation with classical music. The music is performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and conducted by Leopold Stokowski.Most everyone seems to love "Fantasia" nowadays. It has many fans, including me. It is considered a classic now. But when it came out in 1940 it was a commercial failure."Fantasia" is a masterpiece, a pure work of art and magical. Artwork is excellent and special effects either, proving that even back then they already worried about attention to detail.About the 8 pieces, let me give a small opinion about each one of them:1. Toccata and Fugue in D MinorI don't mind how difficult it is to understand what is this about. It's a festival of art and magic. Simply beautiful, very creative, imaginative and original.2. The Nutcracker SuiteAnother brilliant segment. It takes on a famous ballet piece of music to show us flowers, fairies, dancing mushrooms and seasons of the year. Very good.3. The Sorcerer's ApprenticePerhaps the most popular piece from "Fantasia", it is another one of my favorites. Pretty good but also hilarious because Mickey Mouse attempts to use some of his master's magical powers before learning how to control them. Things go out of control, as expected. My favorite part is Mickey's dream: he dreams that he is controlling the mighty seas and starry skies - truly a marvelous and magical sequence.4. The Rite of SpringInteresting, but not one of my favorites. This one starts very well, by showing what science considers to be the formation of our planet and life. It shows images and special effects that look amazingly real, such as the infinitive space, volcanoes in action and boiling lava and earthquakes. It also shows us the time when dinosaurs ruled the world and humans didn't exist yet.5. The Pastoral SymphonyExcellent! I absolutely love this one. This is a sweet story inspired on Greek mythology. It has lots of cute and adorable creatures such as flying horses, unicorns, cupids and angels, as well as original creatures like centaurs and gods. The music is beautiful and the artwork is wonderful. The flying horses and unicorns look the same but with different fur color (that is so cute), while cupids and angels look the same except with different hair color (very cute).6. Dance of the HoursAnother one of the best segments from "Fantasia". It takes place in the garden of a palace in Italy. What we see here is the most amusing ballet ever with ostriches, hippos, elephants and crocodiles dancing ballet. I guess all these animals are here for comical effect, especially the hippos (I love hippos).7. Night on Bald MountainThe only piece I really don't like from "Fantasia". This features strong stuff and is extremely dark, uncomfortable to watch and disturbing, as well as very creepy. Chernabog is a horrifying character.8. Ave MariaThis sequence is a great ending for "Fantasia" and is included in "Night on Bald Mountain". Although slow, it has the same general greatness from "Fantasia". The short itself is religious but artistic.This should definitely be on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why this movie is so popular. The animation is great, and it was monumental for the time it came out. But, it is just not the type of movie I am interested in. At times, it is utterly unwatchable.The only reason I was able to watch it was because I enjoyed the synchronicity to the music at times. The animation was very well done, and the scenes with mickey actually interacting with other things were interesting at times. I can recommend this movie as something that one could play in the background with a group of friends. I could also see it being entertaining to small children, but if I recall correctly it frightened me as a child.</fullReview>

Definitely a feature which demands the attention of its audience, it is a hypnotic cinematic experience that many consider to be the "Citizen Kane" of animated features. A great film that sometimes gets over-looked, but definitely one of the finest movies ever produced. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(WARNING?This is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple ? and forgettable ? direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on each?all with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that?)Damn. I finally saw it. All the way through. Awake, albeit damaged.Unsuccessfully, I've fallen asleep in THREE attempts to watch Fantasia. All three times, I've made it to either Mickey's story or just into the Dino scene following.Let me set the record straight: This has more potency than 6 sleeping pills. I'm fully aware Disney simply loved his subliminal messages?but this one was the easiest to catch: sleep, sleep, SLEEP!I gotta be honest here: this movie appeared to me as an amateurish attempt and was definitely boring as sh*t. I'll give it kudos for being the visualization of Winamp of its time and I'm sure it was "amazing" during its long release schedule between 1940-1, but it was far too early (Disney Feature Length Movie Number Three) for Walt to be experimental with this adult cartoon. And here goes?He went from somewhat adult with Snow White, to the rightfully kiddie Pinocchio and now MOSTLY adult Fantasia. This even featured animated nudity and sexuality!Oh, and I like the fact that my car runs smoothly, or my home A/C or heater works fine. I don't need to actually see them in motion, like what they tried here ? an orchestra coming to life.When I was a kid and was slowly, but surely being exposed to the "Disney (so-called) Masterpieces" all I was interested in were the Mickey and dino scenes. I was duped into believing the rest of the movie had the same interest for a kid. I was wrong. Oh, and speaking of the word "Masterpiece"?I'm beginning to realize, and only after re-watching (or for the first time all the way through) the first three Disney cartoons, that they throw around the word "masterpiece" very loosely.On a positive note, the Mickey scene was masterful ? making sure not a word of dialogue explained his plight, rise and fall. But that's the only segment that held my attention. The rest of it was a chore to get through and no movie should ever be that way. It didn't help that most, if not all the characters yawned a lot and/or were asleep at a certain point. Oh, how I wanted to join them in such graceful slumber!I am thankful I finally did make it from beginning to end ? albeit, I did pop some caffeine pills?NO JOKE. Now, I will never, ever have to see this again.Now?onto Dumbo?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasia is an animated masterpiece. Though this film is most popularly attributed to providing us with the inception of the beloved character that is Mickey Mouse, there is much more here to appreciate. The animation of the film is executed with grace, and really catches and holds the eye for the duration. The coloring in the film is done beautifully an does not go unnoticed. The music adds to the excitement and is a masterpiece in itself when you really get down to it. Fantasia is a magically journey through the head of Walt Disney. I really enjoyed this piece of cinematic history and hope that everyone gets the chance to enjoy it as well at some point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally love this movie. Its really cute to start off, and the colors are really pretty because it's not just a bunch of solid colors, there are a lot of different shades that all blend in together. The soundtrack was probably my favorite part of the movie(s). It fit the scenes perfectly and didn't drag on with one melody throughout, it had several different melodies and never overlapped with the characters talking. It was like a silent musical. The camera got some pretty good shots in, as well. There was a lot of vertical and horizontal shots especially with some leading lines. It really added to the creativity in each scene. I felt like the meanings of this film all came together at the end, knowing that in the end everything will be okay even if things are bad at first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that comes to mind when I think of this movie is the vivid colors. This movie is a timeless classic that is unlike any of the other Disney movies. The music that is used in this film adds to the effect of it. Although it is a cartoon, the choreography of the cartoons is wonderful. The way that the writers fit certain cartoons with certain types of music is great. This movie has been redone many times even by Walt Disney studios, but nothing compares to the original. This movie was one of the first that used Technicolor is such a way, and it is hard to follow with its vividness. This movie makes it impossible to hear any song from the score and not immediately picture Mickey Mouse and his magic broom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually One of the Most Impressive Animated Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia (1940) **** (out of 4) Disney's masterpiece certainly has its flaws but for the most part it's an interesting experiment that contains perhaps the greatest animation ever created. This film is basically Walt Disney giving free reign to his animators to take some of the world's most famous classic music and put animation to it. This includes the work of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Mussorgsky and Ponchielli among many others.It's funny but if you want to start a fight in a Disney crowd you've usually just got to mention this title and you're going to get a wide range of responses. Some people think this film is a masterpiece while others find it to be a complete bore with very little redeeming qualities. Some people love the film but think it's not for children. I personally hated this movie the first time I saw it as a kid but I revisited it for the first time in probably twenty-five years and I was shocked to see how much I enjoyed it. In fact, on a technical level the film is among the greatest animation I've ever seen but there's no doubt that there's one major and critical flaw, which is its running time.As far as the animation goes, my God is it something beautiful to look at. I say this because the colors in this movie just leap off the screen unlike anything I've seen before. Right from the very start you just can't help but be drawn into the movie thanks to the visuals and they really shine in stuff like Rite of Spring, Night on Bare Mountain and Beethoven's Symphony. There are so many different stories and styles here that you can get stuff that is extremely dark and moody while at the same time the next film might be bright neons. I really can't express how terrific the visuals are here and it's hard to believe this was made in 1940.The music is of course beautiful in its own right and The Philadelphia Orchestra and Leopold Stokowski did all of them justice. I'd say the only thing that really hampers this movie is the fact that it clocks in at 125-minutes. I would argue that when the intermission comes it might be best to walk away from the film for more than the 15 minutes just so it doesn't become too much. After all, you're basically seeing a bunch of shorts put together through music so I don't think it would hurt the film. Still, FANTASIA is a masterpiece of visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into "Fantasia" with high respect. Everyone on the internet is calling this the greatest movie ever made and...I thought it was okay. Am I saying it was awful? No. It's just with my attention span, I got bored very quickly. Especially the segments with no real story. I mean, I understand what they were trying to do, but some of the segments just dragged on and on! However, I did love the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" segment. It was the segment I was looking forward to. However, it's the third segment out of eight. I did enjoy "Dance of the Hours" and "Night on Bald Mountain", but the other segments bored me. It's not the movie's fault, it's mine because I have a short attention span. I'm sure if I watch it a few more times, I'll grow to like the other segments more. But as it stands now, I understand what the film is trying to do, and it does deserve the praise, but it's just not for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Handcrafted and Sublimely Sonorous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia took a leap that no animated (or live action for that matter) movie had ever dared to venture and expect to succeed. The idea of bringing a whole new meaning to sound both technologically (First movie in Surround Sound) and artistically was a brilliant venture. To say this Feature is not visually appealing is straight up a crime; it still holds up today with such elegant designs and vivid tones. Fantasia knows its audience. The movie really feels as if you are watching a full orchestra play in front of you and the MC treats the audience as such. There's no crude humor or blatant need to keep the viewer interested other than admiring the very fabric of what music is and how it can look, sound, and feel. Every visual is captivating and strikes well with the music. Whether it be abstract, themed, or a narrative, Fantasia takes the artistic views from so many perceptions that it's just as pleasurable to watch as it is to listen to.It's a very lengthy movie, especially for the time, and if you are not the kind of person who is very interested in music or animation, then this movie will most likely have you asleep by the Rite of Spring. I will admit, that one sometimes gets a yawn or two out of me in the beginning, but it only emphasizes how much the animation compliments the tone. When the music is soft then the animation is tame, but when the music is accented or loud, then the animation is alive and powerful. The tones can go from happy and carefree such as The Pastoral Symphony or Dance of the Hours, to vague and mysterious like The Nutcracker or Toccata and Fugue in D minor, or brash and powerful like The Rite of Spring or Night on Bald Mountain. It has a little bit for everyone.Music lover or not, this movie has a way of grabbing the attention of an audience of any age and can even spark the interest in music for anyone. It's a great film and will definitely be one to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The epitome of my childhood, right here, in 2 hours. A brilliant piece of cinema that I have enjoyed again and again as a child as well as an adult. I never get over its wonder, its beauty, and its presentation. Even if Fantasia 2000 is just as good, this one holds a special place.This was when Disney had it made. This was when Disney made quality films that would not reach this kind of quality until the 90's. I didn't even re-watch this film to give this review, because I know it by heart and it is just stunning all on its own. Growing up on Disney films in general doesn't hinder my love for this film as well as many others.As a child, and an adult, I adore the Rite of Spring scene, the Pastoral Symphony, as well as the Night on Bald Mountain with the devil on the mountain. I don't remember being afraid of any of it, and I loved its color, form, and transition. I never get over it. I was--am--an animal lover and those scenes made my life as a little girl obsessed with horses, dragons, dinosaurs, fantastical creatures, and everything art. Fantasia is a fire to the imagination and a major inspiration for me as an artist.One thing though that has bothered me for a while was The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Even as a kid, I never liked it as much as I had everything else. I was never into Mickey Mouse as a character anyway (I preferred Donald and Goofy); I liked the old cartoons, but nowadays Mickey has been sugar coated beyond recognition, and he seems more like a children's cash cow more than a beloved character. He used to be so very charming, like he was in this short, but even now I can't really enjoy it as much as the other ones. It felt kind of out of place for me, simply because we have this lovely bounty of beautifully drawn Pegasus horses and devils and realistic-looking dinosaurs that are anatomically incorrect juxtaposed to modern science; and yet, even though it is their company's namesake, they add Mickey Mouse to an otherwise serious yet lighthearted picture? It is in the Disney style, sure, but I wouldn't be missing it. That sounds harsh, but it's just my personal taste. On its own, though, I like it. It's a nice story and I love the work that the company went into it. I understand why so many people loved it as a short.10 out of 10 is rarely a given, but this is something that holds an importance to me and for film in general. It was a masterpiece of its time, and it continues to be. I loved Fantasia 2000 for bringing what Fantasia did before, and all the love and attention was put into both pieces. A well-deserved rating, at least for me.</fullReview>

After watching it years later it is a testament to the immortality of Walt Disney and his creativity. Although the animations aren't as fluid as dictated by standards today, the film still runs surprisingly smoothly. The film was still able to capture my imagination by storm as it did nearly fourteen years ago during my first viewing when I was four. Although I am not particularly into animated movies, Fantasia was a pleasant experience, and allowed me to peak into the imagination I once had as a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, but I love Fantasia. I loved the movie so much that I had the original soundtrack for the movie. Fantasia is a wonderful musical combination of seven segments. It also features an appearance by Leopold Stokowsky and Dean Taylor.Segment 1: Tocatta and Fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach: My favorite segment. In the beginning, we see shadows of the orchestra play their instruments. Later in the segment, we get to see violin bows fly across the sky, rolling purple and red hills, giant mountains resembling pipe organs, and concludes with Leopold finishing off the music.Segment 2: The Nutcracker Suite by Pytor Tchaikovsky. Sorry, folks, no nutcracker in this suite. But, on the lighter side, we do see flowers, mushrooms, fairies, and water lilies dance like performers at a theater.Segment 3: The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas. Starring none other than Mickey Mouse as Yen Sid's apprentice. Try and try as he can, poor Mickey hasn't learned how to do magic spells.Segment 4: The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky. Instead of a stage play with tribal dances, we get to see how life began on Earth. First, there were exploding volcanoes and giant floods. Second, the creation of life. Third, the dinosaurs. Fourth, the dinosaurs' extinction followed by earthquakes and more floods. Finally, the present.Segment 5: Pastoral Symphony by Ludwig Von Beethoven. We see fauns, cupids, and centaurs. During the celebration with Bacchus, the god of wine, Zeus comes in and sees fun by creating a thunderstorm.Segment 6: The Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli. Another favorite segment. This stars Madame Upanova and her ostriches in the morning; Hyacinth Hippo and her hippo servants and the afternoon; Elephanchine and her group who loves blowing bubbles in the evening; and Ben Ali Gator and his alligator gang at night. Wow, these guys really know how to bring down the house(Literally!).Segment 7: Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Franz Schubert. The first half is definitely the scariest part I've ever seen. Chernabog lives on Bald Mountain and summons his army of ghouls and ghosts to cause trouble on a town down below. That is until we hear a bell and it sends all the ghosts and Chernabog cowering back to where they came from. It all ends with a beautiful view of rolling hills and a gorgeous sunset.Whew! And there you have it. Every segment has contained beautiful artwork, wonderful music, and no sound effects or people blabbing their mouthes off during the segments. Long live Fantasia!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dim memory of a viewing as a child, articles in both film and non-film journals then it turns up in a Charity Shop at a giveaway price. Result: what amounts to a first real viewing some seventy years after it hit the screens. Allowing for all the factors involved, different worlds, different societies, modern sophisticated filming that make 1940 filming seem primitive this remains one hell of an achievement. For one thing it was filmed in real three-stripe Technicolor and we are aware from the first frame of how rich color used to be, burnished oils as opposed to modern wishy-washy water-color and if ever a movie cried out for three- stripe Technicolor it is Fantasia. If only as a painless introduction to 'classical' music the film deserves our applause and yet it is entirely possible that viewers previously unexposed to classical music will not feel compelled to seek it out in non-visual forms, content merely to enjoy the constantly inventive melding of sound and picture. Just as there are eight notes in a scale so there are eight segments and whether deliberate or unintentional it makes for a pleasing symmetry. Everyone will have a favorite segment but in this case the whole is greater than the parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walt Disney creates a new kind of entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is what I call truly unique because it captivates 2 target audiences - one being people who like classical music. The other are people who like animation. I am not a fan of animated movies (aside from stuff like 9, Marvel Animated &amp; Vampire Hunter D, my taste in other animated movies should be VERY clear). I do have some enjoyment in classical music (I have a wide taste in music - I could probably listen to this stuff then afterward listen to metal - stereotypical metal or real metal it doesn't matter).The basic plot is that an orchestra plays classical music and animations are presented over it - sounds simplistic but this is one of those movies where the overall execution works well. This is just an opinion but I wouldn't mind seeing one Fantasia movie where they do Sibelius' Finlandia, it just seems interesting what they'd come up with.This film is one of these movies where it is a first of it's kind and possibly the only one of it's kind, aside from it's sequel. I think if you love it or hate it there will be nothing to compare it to movie wise because there is nothing like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch a lot of films - and, as someone approaching 60 who has loved movies all my life, I have seen a LOT of films - you begin to notice that things recur. Even in the best of films there are elements which one has seen countless times in other films. Of course, there is always one film which blazes the trail.In the history of film, Fantasia stands alone.It must have seemed an act of lunacy at the time, and it is still sufficiently edgy that it has seldom been emulated - Aleggro Non Troppo is in the same territory, Disney themselves revisited the animated classical concert with Fantasia 2000, and Heavy Metal tried the same idea with risqu visuals and rock music.Nothing came close to this. The selection of popular classics is perfect, and the visual realisations which go with them is no less perfect.There is no other film quite like Fantasia. It blazed its own trail, very others have joined it on that trail, and none of them are in the same class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FANTASIA, the feature that Walt believed in so much, He almost lost his shirt over it! Thank God for re-releasing, not to mention today's VHS &amp; DVD's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The development of the animated motion picture is one of such swiftness as to only be rivaled by Aviation's rapid evolution from the Wright Brohers, 1903 through 2 World Wars. The Animated Feature evolved from the Cartoon Short Subject. It was a period of about 30 years or so from the most primitive works like 1906's HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS(1937). The animation as an art &amp; science really made the strides, and when it was added to all of the technical achievements in film, like color, sound, etc.,we wound up with a seemingly different thing altogether.The overwhelming success of SNOW WHITE, was achieved in spite of a lot of folks in the Hollywood Establishment and The Press saying it wouldn't work and would not be a favourite at the Box Office. Insteasd of his critics getting to say, "I told you so!", it was old Walt who got to do his best Nelson (from THE SIMPSONS) impersonation by giving a loud and clear,"Ha Ha!" It has been that Mr. Disney had no musical training*, yet possessed a great sense what was "good", and what would be the best type or particular pre-existing songs to use in his animated cartoon shorts. Not to rely on his own layman's 'horse sense' kind of judgment, Walt sought counsel in film collaborators, the Host of Many of the Classical Music Radio Broadcasts of Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Deems Taylor. His other chief consultant in these musical matters was, no doubt, was one Mr. Leopold Stokowski who is the on and screen Conductor of his own Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra and, if I may be so bold, was quite a 'Ham' in front of the movie camera.Now the Walt Disney Studio had probably the best equipped, trained and talented group of Artists, Animators and Script Writers in the World. It was a veritable 'Animation Army' and no other company, except maybe Max &amp; Dave Fleischer's, could even compare.So, there would be no problem with doing the stories. Once the number of segments and their lengths were determined, Walt had the horses to deliver the visuals. The animation or moving of the drawn image had already hit its peak several years earlier and the artists &amp; animators would have benefit of such processes as Disney's Exclusive Multi-Plane camera.After the selection of the Classical Pieces to be used and adapted to each of the segments, and story lines developed and assigned to various Disney Animation Teams, it would seem that the job was just about done. Well, it just wasn't true. This greatest of Disney's projects was just getting started.The fundamental problem of 'The Concert Feature' (its working title)was one that really did not plague earlier animated films, at least not to this extent. FANTASIA was being billed as "a completely new form of entertainment!" It was beginning to live up to that claim.In making this Classical Music and Animated Film feature film, the Disney staff was working with two absolutes. On the one hand the fine application of the stop action photography. The other was the magnificent combination of the fine sounds of the Symphony Orchestra, which combine to give a single, beautiful feast to our auditory nerves, our hearing. This was clearly an exercise in bringing the two widely disparate sensual stimuli.So combining he two should present no new problem. After all the world has had sound movies or "Talkies" for some time now. There seemed to be no trouble in synchronizing the voice with the lip movement. Any problems in that area had surely been worked out long ago. Talking Pictures were nothing new, and this FANTASIA was surely no different. After all, we had already seen SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS and PINOCCHIO (1940) and they proved to be highly successful and handy at the old Box Office, to boot!But their is no great amount of 'spoken' word by the animated characters. Other than our M.C., Mr. Taylor and a brief sojourn by Mickey Mouse into the "Real World", there is none. The synchronization would be that of proper mood and correct movement to be coordinated with the rising and falling of the melodious sound track.Okay, let us concede that it wasn't easy, but the Disney crew did it! They brought about the on screen marriage of the sound and the imagery. But there's one problem left.The object of FANTASIA, as was so explicitly stated by Deems Taylor at the very beginning, was to present the audience with images and stories that were conjured up by the Disney Artists. The story segments would be, in many cases, far different from those of the Composers' original intents. Well, we concede that they succeeded.But there remains one major problem. In the process of making this 'Concert Feature', the production staff was essentially blending opposites in the Symphonic Score with the Bright and Beautiful Moving Images. They succeeded in combining Fire and Water, representing the two elements.But what about the other element, one that these various musicians and scribblers had no control over. And this element is at least as strong as the Images and Music. It is the Power of Imagination, not that of the Creative Team, but that of the Movie Audience. That would be the only obstacle they could not control. And it begs the question, why would anyone want to 'interpret' these musical segments when it will be done by the imagination, anyone's imagination.Please,don't think I disapprove of FANTASIA. To the contrary, I love it (and I've never needed to "turn on" to view it.) If nothing else, our Uncle Walt brought truly beautiful, "Long Hair" music to the mass audience of movie-goers. Thanks Walt! * Numbered among them were Messers. Walt Disney,Charles Chaplin Jackie Gleason and Your's Truly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>works better as time goes on, and with a little more classical music appreciation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Fantasia it was when it was re-released in theaters some fifteen or so years ago. I remember also it was one of the only times my family and I decided to walk out due to feeling increasing boredom &amp;/or restlessness. I can't remember entirely why it happened, but maybe too many half-hour cartoon shows and other elements had my family and I yawning or not taking what was going on in the film with much enthusiasm. Plus, I was definitely not a fan of classical music. As times have changed, however, I come across Fantasia for the second time and it feels so new, looks so remarkable, and sounds incredible to the point of this being one of those classical-music mandatory experiences. Over time composers like Stravinsky, Beethoven, Shubert and Bach are now my favorites and the selections given for the segments in the film fit wonderfully. And after having gone through many years of animation and seeing its transformations from hand-drawn into computer (which can be great and sometimes can be just crap, just as in the hand-drawn style), some scenes and moments, either in part or in whole, stand as staggering individual works where storytelling is key even as dialog is nil.The Sorcerer's Apprentice was one I saw multiple times by itself on TV and in the 2000 sequel film, and is still pretty sweet and kind of timeless in its own respect. And even as the segment with the ballerina hippos is not entirely successful, there are some movements that do work to no avail. But the masterpieces of the film are, for me, the Stravinsky segment with the creation of Earth and the dinosaur evolution/destruction, which on its own would work well as a short but strung together with the rest of the segments is like the best piece of the puzzle. Unlike what is usually considered the norm in Disney animation, this is dark, bombastic, and unsettling in how it depicts the million-years gone circle of life, and it's probably the most mature piece of animation ever to come out of the studio. The segment that goes hand-in-hand with this one is also equally subversive with the Night on Bald Mountain segment. These are contrasted then with the lighter, fluffier, and genuinely cute segments with the Nutcracker suite and Unicorns and such.So, coming from my past experiences with the film, I'm conflicted as to whether I can recommend the film as much to kids as to adults; those into the simpler told and non-abstracted animation meant for the younger crowd (and those not too fond of the centuries gone composers in a very contemporary age) or those who don't even watch Disney but love art films. It's an experience to see to believe, and whether you can sit through it or not is neither triumph or shame. As it's unlike any other work- even the 2000 sequel is a little different and not as completely successful- its meant to be a one-of-a-kind experience, for better or worse depending on the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top flight, but DVD soundtrack differs from VHS and LD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not favored at the time of its release, Fantasia has found a place among the best animated features, and deservedly so. It's uneven in places, but it's a towering achievement in animation, especially considering the time in which it was made, and that it was all done completely by hand. It is simply incredible.Be aware, however, that the soundtrack for the DVD release is not quite the same as it was for the 50th anniversary release in 1990, and the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the next year. The 50th anniversary soundtrack was a faithful and painstaking reproduction of Fantasound using original documents from the Disney archives for the cues, and those who saw it in 1990 at a surround-sound theater will recall the music swirling and jumping around the room at times, making it almost as mind-boggling as what appeared on screen. This is what was encoded on the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the 50th anniversary release, and those with equipment capable of decoding Dolby 2.0 ("Pro-Logic") will hear it with either of those video releases. It was lauded in 1990 as the first time that Fantasound had been heard since 1940, and it is something to behold.The DVD release, however, has an entirely different mix of the musical elements in both Dolby 2.0 and Dolby 5.0. The sound is cleaner than on the 1990 release, but it concentrates everything up front and carries only concert-hall reverb in the rear channels. I've kept my laserdisc copy, and that's the one I watch for the best effect. (The IMDb "trivia" page for this film has been updated to note this change.)Speaking of the interstitials: While I admire Disney's efforts to recreate the original roadshow presentation on the DVD, I think they could have found a better voice match for Deems Taylor. I mean no disrespect to Corey Burton, but while he did an excellent job syncing to the film, his voice has a completely different timbre than Taylor's, and I can't help thinking that someone else could have come closer.BTW, the reason they dubbed Deems Taylor's voice for the DVD is that the interstitials for the original "roadshow" presentation were trimmed for subsequent releases, including the 50th anniversary release. They found the missing film elements of Taylor's monologues, but their audio elements were lost, and rather than try to dub just those small bits, they re-dubbed the monologues in their entirety. I think it was a wise idea, but again, I think they could have found a better voice match.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a more comprehensive review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote two reviews for fantasia 2000,so I thought that I should do the same for the original(and better) Fantasia.I'll talk about each segment and give my opinion1. J.S. Bach's "Toccata And Fugue in D minor"perhaps one of the most famous peices of music ever written, this tune gets a complete overhaul for Fantasia. Arranged by Leopold Stokowski himself, this segment lets me see the piece in a whole new light, and the imaged the artists conjoured up were brilliant: big shafts of light and big exploasions of color during the closing Toccata, and a beautiful variety of images throughout the fugue.2. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker suite"opening with the "suger plum fairy", we get exactly that: suger plum fairies making everything brighter and more shiny, and ending with the "waltz of the flowers" where it is exactly the opposite. Winter is brought in by the fairies who then skate on a frozen lake.3. Paul Dukas' "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"The most famous Fantasia segment, while not my personal favorate, is still pretty entertaining and unforgettable. a regular Disney character weilding an ax? how often do you see that?4. Igor Stravinsky's "rite of spring"the most boring fantasia segment ever. I always fast forward past it when I watch it. it's not really fantasy anyway, just an educational presentation about life on earth.5. Ludwig Van Beetoven's "pastoral symphony"Beautiful Animation, clever use of Greek Mythology, and colorful. the second movement with the cupids courting the centaurs is just.....weird. the music there seems slowed and sped up repetitiously just to fit the story (Fantasia 2000 did this in practically every segment.)6. Amilcare Ponchielli's "Dance of the Hours"the next famous Fantasia segmant after the sorcerer's apprentice,is one of my favorates. Hilarious, beautifly animated,(I just love how they did the sunset and night sequences)classic Disney.7. Modest Mussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain"powerful stuff here. tale about a hellish demonfest that goes on all night: ghosts rising from the graves, the gargoyal casting beings into the fire, just amazing.8. Franz Schubert's "Ave Maria"the piece begins at the end of "Night on Bald Mountain" as church bells drive the gargoyal back into hybernation. We then see a long line of people with candles proceeding through the forest at dawn. Julietta Novis' magnificant solo is heard as they emerge from the forest into an open valley as the sun rises from behind the mountains.Overall, I like this movie better than Fantasia 2000 because so much more effort was put into this one. Every segment was hand drawn, all the music was more complete and the segmants were fun to watch. The last segment was definatly my favorate, because it expresses the constant battle between good and evil, and good's ultimate victory. Julietta Novis' solo makes the Fantasia version of "Ave Maria" the best one I've ever heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fantasia" is an interesting experiment that doesn't work for me. Apparently Walt Disney wanted to use the talents of his animators to "interpret" some pieces of classical music -- to make the experience a feast for the eyes as well as the ears. So we get alligators dancing and hippos hopping and fairies swirling and demons glaring and dinosaurs roaming and what does any of this have to do with enjoying good music? OK, I confess I like Mickey as the Sorcer's Apprentice. That episode is a delight. But the rest? It's a misguided attempt to turn wonderful Disney animation into high art. Only once have I not been bored while this film was playing. It was the time I turned off the TV and listened to the audio output through my stereo. Very nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even after almost 75 years, this is still the best feature-length animated films of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should need no introduction. There will be mild spoilers ahead, though I can't imagine there are too many people likely to be reading this who haven't seen Fantasia:The conceit here is a pairing of classical music with animated segments done with the music in mind. It was developed when it became clear that production costs on "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", initially intended as a Silly Symphony, became so great that they could never be recouped by a short subject. So Walt Disney came up with the idea of a "concert film", or different animated segments featuring varied pieces of classical music.Music critic Deems Taylor was selected to be the on-screen host introducing the segments and Leopold Stowkowski conducted the orchestra, after having conducted the scoring of the short which started it all.There were eight segments, with the last two being a thematic pairing of A Night on Bald Mountain by Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Schubert. These are basically one animated piece with two separate musical accompaniments. The others are individual and self-contained works. The segments are, in order:Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach, which is simply very abstract animation in time to the music.Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky, which is various mushrooms, flowers and other fanciful objects dancing to various segments from the ballet.The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas, with Mickey as the titular character getting into trouble when he takes his master's magical talisman (his hat) only to unleash something he didn't expect and can't control. The most well-known individual segment and the third best, after the last two.Rite of Spring by Stravinsky, which inspired no less than the formation of the planet, the beginnings of life on through to the extinction of the dinosaurs.The Pastoral by Beethoven, where male and female centaurs frolic, flirt and court in an idyllic setting. This segment has occasioned controversy and censorship since the film's first release.Dance of the Hours by Amilcari Ponchielli, which whimsically features four separate ballets corresponding to Morning (ostriches), Afternoon (hippos) Evening (elephants) and Night (alligators). The four converge in the end piece, with comical results.The final pairing is also probably the most majestic and moving section of the film. In A Night on Bald Mountain, Chernobog, a devil, orchestrates a dance by spirits, demons and assorted things on and around Bald Mountain. Just when things reach a feverish and climactic pitch, a bell tolls and dark night gives way to the dawn, forcing all to flee, including Cherobog. Ave Maria rises as light banishes dark and monks march into a ruined cathedral. The contrasts are magnificent.This is, in my opinion, Walt Disney's masterpiece. I've seen Fantasia on the big screen in one of its re-releases, had this film on VHS, I have it on DVD and on Blu-Ray. It looks good on VHS, very good on DVD and extraordinary on Blu-Ray. Most highly recommended, particularly on Blu-Ray, if you have a player!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fantasia' is my favorite of the early Disney animated films. Part of this is because it doesn't look like any other animated film that Walt Disney ever made. I liked some of the adaptations like 'Pinocchio' and 'Bambi', but 'Fantasia' seems to have been made as an endeavor for something new. Its one thing to use animation to get the characters around a cute story but it takes a giant leap of faith to create something this bold. Cynics don't like because it doesn't have a plot. My defense is that sometimes I like watching a movie without a blueprint.What stays with most people are the cute sections. Most everyone remembers Mickey Mouse in 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'The Dance of the Hours'. But I watch this film for it's darker more serious sections. My favorite is the last one, 'A Night on Bald Mountain' in which Chernobog, a satanic creature letting loose evil spirits upon the night. I also liked 'Rite of Spring' a chilling epic about dinosaurs stalking the earth.I also remember tiny moments, little throw-away details. I loved the introduction of the soundtrack, a shy little line that is introduced and then moves bashfully in from the side of the screen.I saw 'Fantasia' before and after it's restoration. The pre-restoration print was almost unbearable. Many of the scenes were faded and the soundtrack had scratches and pops. I nearly walked out but I was ultimately glad I stayed because I could later make a comparison. The restoration is clean and crisp, the colors are striking and the soundtrack is flawless. What I also appreciated is that the restoration chose not to stretch the film to widescreen. Careful preparation went into every single aspect of 'Fantasia' and the whole movie was constructed to fit a certain aspect ratio. Stretching it means that you lose a percentage of the top and bottom of the screen.'Fantasia' was chosen by The American Film Institute as the second best animated film of all time (second only to 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'). I think that this decision was made because 'Snow White' came first. I think 'Fantasia' is a far superior film in every way. 'Snow White' was a drop in the bucket to what animated features to could. 'Fantasia' was a tidal wave.</fullReview>

But this is one of the few movies that is still great with out it. The idea of this movie is merely to take famous songs and apply animated visuals to create a type of poetry you could say. My favorites are probably The Scorcere's Apprentice (The one with Mickey Mouse), The Rite of Spring, and Night on Bold Mountain/Ava Maria. As many people have said the music mixed with the visuals really does put you in a dream like sequence. This is a movie I recommend to just about any movie fan out there.

		<shortDescription>Classic Animated Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fifty-six years on and Disney's classic animated feature is still one of the most innovative pieces of cinema ever to grace the screen.Basically visual interpretations of musical compositions, "Fantasia" opens with an abstract translation of Bach's "Toccatta", then follows with a very creative piece based upon Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker Suite". The real high light comes with director Ben Sharpenstein's lively treatment of Paul Dukas' "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". Mickey Mouse stars as the magician's underling who runs amok with his master's wand, with rather damp results.Other classical pieces don't get such a wonderful treatment. In fact with the exception of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring", which receives a reasonable review, all the other segments lack interest, creativity and style. A real shame considering the positives in this unique Disney picture. While the early pieces show great promise and have much entertainment value, the other slower, more dreary segments weigh the whole show down, making it long winded and tiresome. Still, for innovation alone, it's worth your time.Other classics featured are Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony No. 6", Amilcare Ponchielli's "Dance of the Hours", Modeste Moussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain" and the traditional "Ave Maria" sung by Julietta Novis.Friday, March 1, 1996 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest cartoons ever created where only music is the key. Walt Disney Pictures has created a masterpiece where pictures and stories fit with loads of classic and original music. Deems Taylor explains this new masterpiece at the beginning, and Honorary Oscar winning Leopold Stokowski conducts all the music throughout the film. The film starts with imaginary ideas we might get if we were at a musical. Then it moves to short stories with fairies, live flowers and mushrooms. Then we the famous Mickey Mouse plays the Sorceror's Apprentice, and it goes on from there, with unicorns, ostriches, hippos, elephants, crocodiles and a devil. Stokovski deserved the Oscar for this film, he has done of splendid job of creating brilliant music to go with the animation. Walt Disney and two associates also won the Honorary Oscar for advancement of sound. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That's Not Really for Anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to think of "Fantasia" as The Movie That Wasn't Really for Anyone: Not really for children, as anyone who's watched this film with a theater full of bored kids can attest, and not really for adults, who may not be that interested in prancing centaurs or roaring dinosaurs. It's not really for classical music lovers, who are bound to be offended by the way the works are treated, and it's certainly not for people who can't stand classical music. Generally speaking, It's too low for the highbrows and too high for the lowbrows. So who is "Fantasia" for, really? Aside from one obvious, 1960s-inspired answer - recreational drug users - I would say it's for animation buffs willing to overlook the pretentious silliness of some scenes and admire instead the striking images of the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence or the abstract designs accompanying Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" or the humor of "Dance of the Hours" with its dancing hippopotamuses and alligators, or the segment that started the whole project, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice."("Fantasia" was spoofed in the Warner Bros. cartoon "A Corny Concerto," hosted by a bespectacled Elmer Fudd. Once you see it, you may have trouble watching "Fantasia's" narrator, Deems Taylor, with a straight face.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time in my life yesterday. After seeing the old trailer for it I thought it looked interesting. The movie was...OK. Some of it good. Some of it boring. Others were just too long. I will try to remember them all. The first number (I don't even know what it's called): EXTREMELY BORING. Nutcracker suite: Too long! Rite of Spring: The only good part was the one dinosaur beating up the other dinosaur. Beethoven's 6th: Best one in my opinion. Socceror's apprentice: A classic. Night on bald mountain: I love that demon. (Wow. That was weird.) Ave Maria: pretty. Hard to hear. I thought there would be singing in that one. As you can see I rated this movie a '5.' I really couldn't make heads or tails of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does anybody really like this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody pays lip service to "Fantasia" as one of the greatest films of all time, but does anyone really like it? Most of the people I've talked to admit to being bored and depressed by it. It's safe to say that "Fantasia" did for music appreciation what "Song of the South" did for race relations. The one part of the film almost everybody likes is "The Sorceror's Apprentice," which ironically was the last really good film Disney made featuring Mickey Mouse before the Great White Gloved One was put out to pasture as a commercial spokesman for the Disney entertainment empire. Balletomanes have probably never forgiven the dancing hippos in Ponchielli's "Dance of the Hours"; the last time I watched it I became dizzy and threw up. Even "The Blair Witch Project" didn't effect me that way. "Fantasia" was wickedly parodied by Chuck Jones in "What's Opera, Doc?" which is a far more entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I recommend watching this as an adult more than a child. The biggest reason is because I think you can then enjoy the film from both the animation perspective as well as the music. I might not be the biggest fan of classical music, but classical music mixed with Disney animation is amazing. Think of the movie as one big music video, like "Pink Floyd's The Wall". At a little over 2 hours long, it's a pretty lengthy sit, but I think the animation and music combined make up for that. Would I show it to my kids? No, mostly due to it being pretty bombastic at times. Maybe show it to your kids if you want to show them the importance of both music and animation. Beings there's no real story, there's not really a lesson or moral, it's mostly just for enjoyment. There are also some pretty dark moments. "A Night on Bald Mountain" is infamous for that, although I didn't find it all that bad. The dinosaur sequence was the darkest moment for me. It might not have the themes or tone as "Pinocchio" which was released the same year, but it's more of an experience than a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings about most recent viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen and enjoyed "Fantasia" several times, the first during its 1990 50th Anniversary theatrical re-release. Yet when I watched it last night I grew restless during some segments, particularly "The Pastoral Symphony" and "Dance of the Hours," both of which feel too long. The dull, flat live action introductions, featuring a stuffy and overly dry Deems Taylor, stop the film cold. I found myself wishing Walt Disney had simply used title cards with a brief summary, which would have made it shorter and sweeter. Having said that, "Fantasia" is certainly one of Disney's most stunning, ambitious, and, for its time, daring achievements. The dual closing segment, "Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria" is the strongest and darkest one, with "Rite of Spring," and "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" a close second and third, respectively. Oddly enough, I've enjoyed "Fantasia 2000," though less ambitious and more commercial, more on repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to see that this was on the film list for cinema class because I love Disney movies, and Fantasia was a really great one that I have not seen in a really long time, so I was glad I got the excuse to watch it again. The one scene I have never forgotten was the scene with all the broom sticks dancing.This was such a great a Disney movie and a lot different from the other Disney movies, which is one really great thing about it. They brought in an orchestra for the music in this film and all of the music was so beautiful and it really brought the movie to life. And the imagery in this movie was amazing always so much to see and so much going on, it was so beautifully done. For an animated film that had Mickey Mouse in it, it was kind of a dark film at time. Its crazy how old this film from the early 1940s and parents are still showing it to their children today, which just goes to show how timeless and how great this animated movie is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I would have found myself watching this film. The animation piece had me a bit skeptical of the validity and amount of enjoyment I would have watching this film. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this film to be entertaining. I can't say that this film is the best that I have ever seen but it certainly wasn't the worst. It is difficult to analyze cinematic elements for this film because it is animated but I would have to say that the sound is one of the strongest elements because that is where most of the interaction with the audience comes and if you don't enjoy the music then you most likely won't enjoy the film. Although children may enjoy it more, if someone older were to keep an open mind, I think that adults could gain an appreciation for it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Walt Disney's greatest masterpieces was fantasia from the 1940's. Directed by Samuel Armstrong and a manifold of other directors, this film shows beautiful flying images with the beautiful philharmonic to listen to throughout the entire film. The cast of characters are animated and throughout each composition. I personally loved this film and i was more then happy to watch it again and again. I wasn't the only one who loved it as this film made over 76,400,000 dollars in the box office.This film garnered a 96% on rotten tomatoes and to quote Bo C 'At the risk of being utterly obvious and just a bit stodgy, perhaps, let us begin by noting that motion-picture history was made at the Broadway Theatre last night with the spectacular world premi?re of Walt Disney's long-awaited "Fantasia.""(Crowther). This film was widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of the new age of Hollywood but not only that but animation as well. The animated shorts in the film were aesthetically pleasing and I could see tiny glimpse into the animation they used int the future in their Disney films. I see glimpses of Hercules and many other films that were to come. Overall this film should be revered as one of the best films Walt Disney ever put together. Roger ebert was once quoted in saying that "Throughout Fantasia, Disney pushes the edges of the envelope" and they really did, they made something that was not seen in any point in that time. They made something that truly changed the way films were made back then. It also changed how animation and sound were used as this was part of the period where sound was fully introduced into films and cinema. This was one of the first animated films to be fully introduced with sound and it is also one of Walt Disney's masterpieces. This is one that will go down in the annals of time as one of the best made animated films of the golden era of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fantastic images, and the use of a vast array of color create a spectacle that can take even the most depressed individual emotionally affected by the second world war, in my opinion, away from all of the negative factors and provide a temporary escape. The many directors each helping to deliver something visually stunning, which when brought together, creates the fantastic feature length film deserving of it's name, Fantasia. The film, debuting a year after the start of the war, but a year prior to the US involvement, still proved to be a very effective film in my opinion. As the war was a worldwide affair, it was very prevalent and the US citizens were probably fearing with baited breath that they would too soon be brought into it's crossfire. I believe that movies like Fantasia aided in brining much needed relief, and acted as a powerful distraction without being too "in your face" that it was a distraction. It's cinematography as a whole is captivating and the on-screen world full of magic and good triumphing over evil, was exactly what people needed to see at the time. People craved a reality that was similar, so despite the cartoonish and magically mesmerizing atmosphere, the values are still the same. Producer Walt Disney, brining joy when and wherever necessary from the beginning.</fullReview>

Even though there are some darker aspects in Fantasia that help to keep the movie well rounded. The music complemented the scenes that were matched with it.

		<fullReview>Fantasia is a play between visual art and music. The film regards the effects each has on the other depending on the order of creation; music that results from art or a story, and a story or piece of art that is a product of music. The film is packed with entertaining visuals and brilliant orchestral pieces. It is rather abstract, and can be a lot to take in at once. The animation coupled with the score really threw a lot at you. It's rather heavy on the senses when the animation and music reach a peak at the same time. However, each segment of the film brings something new and refreshing, so there was always something new to pay attention to. This animation is a true classic, and is something that all lovers of the genre should experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Fantasia I was taken aback by the overall scope and profoundness that was this movie. This is literally a piece of art and a milestone in in not only animation but for movies in general. Never has their been a movie so captivating without any real dialogue or narrative. Each segment of the movie is different from one another and that's okay. Each segment of the film whether it's The Sorcerer's Apprentice or the Rite of Spring or the Night on Bald Mountain each is a piece of animation gold and should be seen as separate films. I would compare this movie to that of an art museum or gallery each segment has it's own message and appeals to different emotions. The animation along with the beautiful score steal the show. The vivid details and motions were way ahead of its time. It was clear to see that this movie took a lot of thought and ingenuity to create something so beautiful to the senses while also being extremely thought provoking. This rare combination creates a cinema experience that is completely unique and beautiful.</fullReview>

Unlike the Disney norm, Fantasia had a much darker side. incorporating ominous musical pieces, such as "A Night on Bald Mountain" by Leopold Stokowski, while also including imagery of scary monsters, a young dinosaur losing its mother, and the rapid and gruesome extinction of the jurassic age. I was also able to appreciate how much that movie had unknowingly taught me.

		<shortDescription>Fantasia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "Fantasia" a couple of weeks ago, and it's been on my mind a bit since. This isn't a film with a flowing narrative; it consists of a series of animations set to popular classical music. There are segments which have a little story to tell, but none flow into each other. It seems like the animators were just told to animate what they feel (if I recall, that is exactly what the host, played by Deems Taylor, says), and that is what this film seems like to me ? the animator's emotions and experiences whilst listening to timeless music. Some of the segments left little to no impact on me. That is not to say that the animation in such segments wasn't stunning, as it is throughout. All were beautiful and the music is fantastic. Instead of focusing on all of the segments, I'm going to focus on those I remember most, the ones I enjoyed the most. "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," based on the piece of the same name by Paul Dukas, shows Mickey Mouse (voiced by Uncle Walt himself) as the apprentice of a powerful sorcerer. The sorcerer has Mickey do chores like mop the floor and so on, while Mickey idolises his mentor to the highest degree. However, one evening when the sorcerer goes to bed, Mickey doesn't feel like filling the well with water, so he dons his mentor's hat and brings a broomstick to life, making him do all the work. However, this leads to hundreds of brooms flooding the place, and Mickey having to figure out how to stop them. The animation is beautiful, as is most done by Disney, and the timing is magnificent. It's just a fun little cartoon. It's easy to see why sorcerer Mickey is one of Disney's biggest trademarks, heck I even have a pair of the furry years ant hat from Disneyland! My favourite segments would have to be "Rite of Spring" and "Dance of the Hours." The former is just so poignant and breathtaking, and the music just seems to match the tone the segment is trying to set. The animation, especially on the lava and water and during the t-rex attack, is just phenomenal. I have no idea how they paced this thing, but by God they did it will. It's also heartbreaking! These poor animals just drop dead! I liked these creatures; they had so much character even though they spoke nary a word! It ends on such an ambiguous note, with such subtlety and intrigue. It's just lovely. "Dance on the Hours" is a rather baffling affair, but my God it looks beautiful. The lighting, the colours, the designs on the animals. How did they make a hippo so graceful? I have no idea, but then again that seems to be the magic of Disney. They can make the impossible possible. The little romance between the hippo and alligator is just adorable; sometimes things can be said without uttering a word. People are going to smite me for this, but I didn't see what was so special about "The Night on Bald Mountain." It's beautiful and thought provoking, the music was nice ... and that's it. The only thing massive about the last segment to me was Chernabog himself; I mean, he is the devil. The devil is one scary guy. Other than that, after all I'd heard about Bald Mountain, it just seemed underwhelming. In my opinion, "Rite of Spring" would've been a better finale. It's much more evocative to me.Overall, "Fantasia" is pretty damn good. I don't find it as amazing as other Disney fans do, but it is gorgeous to look at, and groundbreaking to boot. There is this sort of charm about it, this air of grandeur. It is worth checking out.8/10.</fullReview>

I also liked how the story that involved Mickey and the broom was created first, and the music was created after the fact. I personally love Disney movies so this was a very fun film to watch. I've seen it before, a very long time ago and it was nice to re watch it and cool remembering some of the scenes and just taking in how beautifully done the music was, especially attached to each segment. They brought about different themes and feelings, and always kept you on your toes. Even with no dialogue, you still got a sense of what was going on, thanks to the music. At times it did get a little repetitive, but overall it was a great film and interesting to see that animation films started so early in the film making industry.</fullReview>

Several musical segments present a variety of themes, notably The Sorcerer's Apprentice with Mickey Mouse involved in something he does not fully understand. Themes of creation present fairies aimlessly spreading fairy dust. This is to symbolize life and beauty. Then a triumphant sequence where dinosaurs engage in battle before being wiped out by the ongoing reality of time. The film's one drawback is its target audience as the sexuality presented should be discussed before children view it. Another area of discernment regards the heavy handed dark adult themes throughout that children may not comprehend. Asides from The Sorcerer's Apprentice other segments are called Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, Nutcracker Suite, The Rite of Spring, The Pastoral Symphony, Dance of the Hours, and Night on Bald Mountain. Stunning animation with life breathed into every image through its music. It is unforgettable art that should provoke a response within the society we live. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasia was the first Walt Disney movie I saw that did not feature damsels in distress as the main theme, so of course it had an impact. I love it not for that, but for its sweeping animations and captivating visuals, which leave your mouth hanging open when paired with the musical sound tracks. It doesn't matter how many times I see that move, it still takes by breath away. And for those with a classical music background, it has an even greater impact. Classical music was been called old and boring. But Disney gave it new life, and a way for the younger audiences to appreciate it. You can bet after I say Fantasia I went and downloaded those songs, and when I listen to them I get these epic imaginary wondering and images in my head. All in all a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was any Disney film that you haven't seen yet then I highly recommend this instant classic. This is Disney at it's best and there's no doubt that a lot of money had went into producing this film. Now I am sure that most of you have seen some parts of this movie without even knowing where it came from. And that is the infamous Sorcerers Apprentice where Mickey is in the red gown and blue hat. What is also great about this film is how well the music plays into each scene. You can see the amount of creativity that the animators had when they were making the film. The only thing that was disappointing about the film was knowing that there wouldn't be a sequel that would come out. Disney didn't make enough money that they had put into the film so they thought that it wasn't worth taking the risk by making another one. There have been updated version from what I know but they don't hold that certain charm that is in the original. If you have the time go check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when i was a young'n and I really had no idea what was going on. Im not too big into cartoons either. I recently watched this movie again now that I'm older and i get why some people like it, but it still didn't do it for me. I don't know what it is but i can't get into those Disney cartoons. But thats just my opinion, there's still some cool things in the movie, I'm sure others would like it. Fantasia was created in 1940 and it had more than one director but only Norman Ferguson was credited it looks. The movie to me seemed really long. Its 2 hours and 5 minutes long but to me it felt so much longer. Its very colorful and i did like some of the art in the movie but it just doesn't cut it for me. It was way too long for a cartoon. I never really was to big on Disney movies growing up and I'm still not into them. But like i said the art in this movie is still kind of cool, just wasn't really a fan of the movie overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say other than excellent, I've been watching fantasia movies since i was little and the gorgeous music was only heightened by the wonderful (hand drawn) animation that accompanied it. Since the animation was drawn for the music it fit so incredibly well together that it was mesmerizing, to any child or adult. I can still sit and watch, it, they've made new ones, but the first is such beautiful classic that you want to watch them all, not just the newest one. Whoever had the idea for putting music behind great classic Disney animations was a genius for creating a really wonderful classic that people will continue to watch and admire into the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This to me in my opinion is one of the best film that has ever been made. Considering most of the movie has to do with music and not dialogue that's saying something. Even if you are not a fan of Back, or Beethoven you should still be able to enjoy this film. I consider this film Disneys greatest film. The film doesn't shy away from shocking visuals it gets especially dark at the very end of the film. It completely shows off the talent of the Disney animators a the visuals completely compliment the music presented in the film. I will say this is one film that completely succeeds in making you feel emotions whatever they are they make you feel them. I wish this movie would get the respect it deserves if anything was Oscar worthy this film was a deserving candidate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most creative, visually and tonally, and one of the most interesting and exciting films I have ever seen. Each individual story is very creative in itself and all keep perfectly in sync with the music from the different composers. It was a really cool idea just to try and put images and stories to these musical masterpieces or match what people may be thinking when they hear it. With all of the amazing artwork of the many animators and the excellent performances of the conductor (Leopold Stokowski), the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the narrator (Deems Taylor), the film felt like a cross between a live theater performance and a psychedelic animated art show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Experience Like No Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is an animated film from 1940 directed by too many people to name and written by too many people to name. The only person who speaks in this other than Mickey voiced by Walt Disney (Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmatians) is the narrator Deems Taylor.Fantasia is a series of vignettes told completely by music and animation. The animation was actually made to go along with the music which was already written. This was a big risk in 1940 and the only person clever enough to accomplish it was Walt Disney. He and a few others came up with the idea of an animated film all told through music. If it weren't for him, I don't think we'd have probably the purest animated film.Leopold Stokowski (The Great Beauty, Fantasia/2000, DOA: Dead or Alive) was the conductor who put this all together and he does a great job of making us feel the music and add so much emotion that the animation even brings it to a further level.Fantasia is a fun film for the whole family and is in my opinion the purest animated movie since there is no words, only animation (and a bit of real life...) but you should still check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of The Best Animated Films Ever Made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's kind of hard for me to figure out how to explain why this movie is such a great animated film, but I'll try my best. I will say that Fantasia is my favourite Disney film and one of my all-time favourite movies in general.The concept of Fantasia was very unique for the time and still kind of is: combining classical music with animation to tell narrative or non-narrative stories. No dialog is needed. The only dialog you get is from the host, Deems Taylor, who introduces the segments and gives us some details on what each segment will be about. You also get some very brief dialog from Mickey Mouse and the conductor, Leopold Stokowski.The music was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and they did absolutely fantastic. The music and animation are matched up flawlessly. The animation is also fantastic. No complaints about either of those things whatsoever.Another thing that really stands out about this film is that it doesn't really feel like a kiddy picture. It mostly seems more intended for adults even though it's totally fine for kids to watch. It just doesn't have anything that would immediately draw kids to it, other than maybe the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment with Mickey Mouse.I really can't put into words what else makes this film one of the best animated movies ever made. You really just have to see it for yourself. I think it's a flawless picture that should be seen by fans of Disney films or just animation in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a brilliant movie after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The strange thing about Fantasia is that it's both Disney's greatest film to date, and yet it's also one of his least known films. And it's understandable why. Not only does it defy what Disney films have become famous for, it defies what films in general have done. And yet, that's what makes it so amazing.Fantasia is not a single story spread across 2 hours, instead, it's several short stories told through a combination of music and Disney animation. Well, most of them are. Some of them just abandon story and focus on just animation. But others (particularly the world famous Night on Bald Mountain sequence) do have a clear story to them.Honestly, it's my absolute favorite Disney film. The animation is still stop notch despite being made in the 40's, the music is incredible, and the Disney magic we know is more than present here. It's just taken on a new light.Granted, I can understand if people don't like it because it is basically a bunch of music videos, but believe me, if you have even the slightest interest, check it out. It will be worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a double bill of FANTASIA and FANTASIA/2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Double bill time, FANTASIA is an experimental and groundbreaking high-brow entertainment from Disney, seamlessly harmonises two disparate art forms: animation shorts with iconic classical pieces, most of them flout the family-friendly narratives, thus instantly elevate the demography from its common wheelhouse, and creates an unorthodox experience, a combination of cinema and concert, but obviously not such an attraction for kids. The original 1940 version is an ambitious brainchild of Walt Disney honed by sterling expertise from the virtuoso conductor Leopold Stokowski (shot in silhouette behind with lofty glamour and a baton in hand). But it was a fiasco in its original theatre release, widely considered too avant-garde for family audience then, only later revival from re-runs rescues its reputation and gives justice to the talents involved, each piece differs in its visual technique, in retrospective, they are rudimentary 2D prototypes, but in the core, it is their unbridled imagination that stuns us,The seven programs (in total eight pieces whereas Mussorgsky's NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and Schubert's AVE MARIA are fused into one), visually run the full gamut from the abstract patterns (Bach's TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D MINOR); follows by a seasonal alteration with ballet dances based on Tchaikovsky's NUTCRACKER SUITE; then a mesmerising lesson learnt by Mickey Mouse in Paul Dukas' THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE; next one is the awe-inspiring chronicle from Earth's beginnings to the extinction of dinosaurs (Stravinsky's RITE OF SPRING), which includes a battle sequence of a T-Rex slaughtering a stegosaur, quite candid with brutality in the animal world, which is my personal pick in the miscellany; after the intermission, in Beethoven's THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, we are ushering to explore the mythological world of centaurs, fauns, cupids and Gods like Bacchus and Zeus himself; next in line is an upbeat ballet (Ponchielli's DANCE OF THE HOURS), four groups of animals, ostriches, hippos, elephants and alligators represent four different time of a day, eventually gyrate together in ludicrous jolliness; the final chapter is the said NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and AVE MARIA combination, the darkest, scariest one, with Chernabog summoning evil spirits from graves to a night of revelry, only retreated by the church bell in the dusk when a congregation of monks march towards a ruined cathedral, wraps up a two-hour optic and aural feast in solemn peace and tranquility.A belated sequel comes almost 60 years later, which self-betrays the concerns of its commercial prospect from the executive level, the 1999 version runs in a succinct 75 minutes (against the original's 120 running length), comprised of eight segments (seven new pieces plus the original THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE), where each is presented by well- known celebrities, unfortunately it bombed in the box-office too, so clearly the running length is not the crux, what one might find lacking is the innovation, since Disney has reached its creative height in the 1990s after BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991), ALADDIN (1992), THE LION KING (1994), etc., the updated FANTASIA is enchanting for sure, my favourite is George Gershwin's RHAPSODE IN BLUE, where a caricature of different characters in NYC in the 1930s is given simplistic beauty and ingenuity, but paralleled with the 1940 version, the leap-of -progress of six decades is not so perceivable, as THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE can comfortably hide its age with the new additions, the traditional way of technique prevails, as excellent as each episode is, exuding their different vibrancy in coherence with the orchestration, it simply cannot overshadow its aged predecessor's glory, although both Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are heading a piece in this picture, and narratives are strong in this version (at least 4 out 8 depicts a story with suspense).Will there ever be a third venture into this unique format? I do hope so, it has its unrivalled advantage to instil an early education of classic music for children, despite the innate shortcoming as a compilation, it can allow more visionary experiments based on the ocean of music notes, both in storyline and its methodology. So, 15 years has passed, hope we don't have to wait for another 45 years for a sequel, also to those who have the knowledge, are these two pictures breaking the record of the longest time between an original and its successor? 59 years seems difficult to beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>fantasia is a classic Disney movie that has been seen generation by generation. Director Norman Ferguson helped create this masterpiece is 1940. Mickey Mouse makes his appearance in this movie and helps to create a very musical, colorful, and wild movie. This film has different types of movie genres, as well as characters which I think to be enjoyable for many ages. Younger generations will appreciate the sounds and characters leaping across the screen while adults may appreciate the musical aspects of the story line. The main focus of this movie is just the music and dancing, the story line is rather irrelevant while you watch this film. The use of the song "Ave Maria" has great importance. It shows light and dark clashing together in a great battle. The ending comes calmly and settles everything back into place. You could think all day of reasons behind this selection. All in all this film is enjoyable for different generations and for years to come. From 1940 to 2015 fantasia is a classic Disney film that is still in many households.</fullReview>

Much like a silent film the music speaks for the film, aiding to tell the story. Each individual piece of music has its own story to tell.

For really any time period the film is absolutely amazing, the animation in this movie was absolutely flawless and it went so perfectly with orchestra in the background. I absolutely loved the fluidity of the animation and the fact that they made these characters come alive so well with little exaggerations of the character's actions. I also loved the palette used throughout the film and how vibrant it was; I believe it went really well with the feel of the film. Out of the whole film, without much surprise, my favorite part had to be the scene of the sorcerer's apprentice. I loved this scene so much and found that so much was conveyed without any use of dialogue. Honestly, I just wish this scene was longer because it was really simple and enjoyable narrative.</fullReview>

The compositional pieces accompanied by brilliantly colored, animated, abstract scenery just increases my admiration for this film.

		<shortDescription>Magnificent orchestral score and animation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Walt Disney's third full-length animated feature film and it differs from most of Disney's animated classics."Fantasia" does not really have a story or plot, rather, it is made of different segments with no dialog and set through behind-the-scenes music performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and conducted by Leopold Stokowski. Each segment has its own orchestral piece or suite, composed from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic and Contemporary Periods, including pieces from composers such as Bach, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Stravinsky and Mussorgsky. The music is rich and dynamic and the animation sequences are bright, colorful and scenic. At times, you could see the silhouettes of Stokowski and the orchestra, letting viewers see the people behind the musical magic.My favorite sequences are the Nutcracker Suite and the Night on Bald Mountain. You could see dancing flowers and mushrooms and falling leaves and snowflakes during the Nutcracker sequence, looking very carefree and innocent. And, you could see a demon and spirits performing in some sort of sabbath in the Bald Mountain sequence - very powerful and eerie.One of Mickey Mouse's most familiar public trademarks has him in a robe wearing a sorcerer's hat (with stars and moon images on it). This first came from the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence, where this trademark was introduced.If you are looking for a Disney fairytale with a story to follow, you would not find it in this movie. However, if you enjoy classical music, anthologies and Disney animation in general, this film is for you.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of the animated musical genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when this film was made there were two broad schools of thought on animated films. One school believed that the animated action was the main point of an animated film and that the music should fit the animation. Sadly, this is how almost all animation is done today. The other school believed that the music should be the main focus and that the animation should enhance the music by providing an artistic visual representation. This is the school that "Fantasia" represents.I love this film and have watched it (or at least listened to it) countless times. The musical selections are among the best that classical music has to offer, and the animation and styling of the characters are classical Disney at its best. The scenes depicted vary from the hilarious to the terrifying to the awe-inspiring. Most satisfying are those that take your breath away and hold you in fascination with their beauty and elegance.My only complaint about the film is Disney's choice of Leopold Stokowski as conductor. Stokowski arrogantly took it upon himself to "improve" Mussorgsky's "Night on Bare Mountain," and effectively ruined the best parts of the score. Compare Stokowski's version with the original and you'll see what I mean. But with the exception of Stokowski's occasional interference, "Fantasia" is the best animated musical film ever produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fantasia" is a wonderful blend of live action and animation, but not like the latter Disney films of "Mary Poppins" and "Petes Dragon." The live action sequences are that of Deems Taylor narrating the film as well as setting up the stories. Leopold Stowkowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra give us the music to fit to the beautiful pictures.The film was originally intended to be released each year (as a roadshow film) thereafter with different scenes intact as well as some old ones. This was not the case when WWII broke out and the US got involved. Walt Disney's vision would not be complete until "Fantasia 2000" was released in 1999.Probably the most important and proclaimed piece of "Fantasia" would be The Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse. In fact, this sequence was reused in the sequel film in 1999 to achieve the roadshow feel that Disney wanted. It was also this sequence in the film that spawned another film in 2010 starring Nicolas Cage, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice." A wonderful film and one that will delve into your imagination and take you places you thought you may never see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Adult Fantasy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a person who consider Art, or rich Art, being able to elevate our minds and from which we are able to draw huge amount of information. Fantasia is not only a unique film, its also the only film which with musical pieces illustrates evolution at work and prehistoric scenes pretty scary and violent with the last groups of dinosaurs parading towards doom. Development and Extermination. Also, here you have sceneries of the Hellenian mythological world portraying the mating ritual and the Bacchus celebration, "sex, drugs and party!", and the battle between the light and the shadow world - the world of death and decay and that of light and peace. We get the living Nature in its transgressions through the different seasons, comical portraits of animals and veggies impersonating humans, and a moral tale of a young who forgot that he is not the tutor yet, etc. The basic thread of the movie is the music of course! To begin the film with J S Bach's Toccata and Fuge in d minor, is not only supercool, but is the perfect upwarming piece. As the music itself is pretty impossible to create a simple visual story with characters from, the visuals we see are closer to abstract and expressionism in form, with natural elements to illustrate Bach's famous cosmic flow of his fugues! Walt Disney was so serious with this project, that a psychological consult with experience of peyote, was hired to give guide lines to the different segments, not to mention all the ideas which came from the big crowd of artists that was working with the pictures and the translation of the music into pictures. Just like other Disney films of the period, like Three Caballeros 1946 and certain scenes in Dumbo and others, could easily be placed side by side with Yellow Submarine and experimental underground shorts in the late 60's, in a period when LSD, Psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis was the inspiration, for both young hippies and soul searching intellectuals. Disney was really psychedelic! The imagination at work in this film is so rich, that one can view it over and over again, to find details as well as new interpretations to the different segments. When viewing this multi artwork from beginning to end, through the music to the visuals and its themes, it seems to encompass the human and natural world on Earth,in a trancendental way, so it seems to be the perfect movie to send with a probe out into outer space, hoping to encounter an alien species, who might be able to watch it! They would not only consider it a colorful gem, but would find the film be a treasure for understanding Humans from the planet Earth. Of course, I am exaggerating, but still, if NASA could pack a satellite with chosen music, which I know they had, why not a movie? Anyways, this is a way for me to say, that Fantasia, as the film looks, could not have been made today, as the most powerful film companies would not bet a huge some of money on a project like this. Also, a feature film, all drawn and painted by hand, gives a decidedly more impressive look than one that is made in a computer. The fact is, that around 1939 - 1940, in the midst of Second World War, some of the most popular, hailed by critics and audience alike, greatest films were made. If the time consuming, painstaking efforts behind Pinoccio, Wizard of Oz, The Thief of Bagdad and Fantasia all are made to be true fantasy films, they seem to tell us that during war time it better works to make "timeless" films. In other words, films which not occupy themselves with the ever changing societies of Humanity and the issues of the times in which they were made. Instead, and this is what make them work as true art, they seem to speak to us, in matter of symbols, archetypes and themes which have been with us through the history of time. It could be seen as a work of a great shaman, who wants to remind us about the most important and utterly most sublimely beautiful things we have on this Earth. The Greatest Movie Achievement Ever In History!I only give full points (10/10) to films that are more than a film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Music Video Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, it can get better titles than that. But at least that's one thing we can all agree on about 'Fantasia.' 'Fantasia' was Disney's second or third movie, and thus stems from the time it churned out actual quality, not just cheap genre-spoofs like it does today. At the time, Disney was not just the *best* animation studio, it was the *only* one. Even then, Fantasia is the most ambitious Disney project from that era - rather than just translate old Mother Goose and Grimm works, the limitless imaginations of the Disney animators were going to translate famous pieces of music.So what this boils down to is a head-on of two art forms: the movie and the music. And who wins? The movie, by far. It's far more entertaining to watch Fantasia than to actually go to the symphony.Why? Well, it's simple: 'Fantasia' is a trip to the symphony, but when you go on the trip, you borrow the mind of a true music fan with boundless, colorful imagination. This is way better than anything your head could cook up for these songs.That's not the only reason, either: The songs are performed perfectly, and the announcer/composer is the perfect guide through this strange and fantastical world. And the animation is arguably the best of any movie. Literally, any frame from this movie is worthy of being hung up in an art museum. It is that quality.That's basically what 'Fantasia' is: a two-hour night at the symphony, with illustrations. It has no plot, no recognizable characters, no dialog, none of the conventions of a regular movie, and yet it overcomes all of this. I mean, there is just a handful of movies out there as original as 'Fantasia.' This is really something special.The best segments, in my opinion (everybody has their own favorites), are 'Toccotta and Fugue,' 'The Rite of Spring,' and 'Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walt Disney's Magnum Opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is not the kind of movie that has a coherent plot or features a battle of good versus evil. It's an experience movie. It's a movie that reacts to classical music and changes it's tone to fit it. The film is basically The Philadelphia Orchestra performing various classical pieces(The Rite of Spring, The Pastoral Symphony etc.). But the pieces are set to animation from the Walt Disney Company. The animation is some of the best Disney has ever done. There are some pieces like Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor and The Nutcracker Suite that are just random events happening one after the other. While others like The Rite of Spring or Dance of the Hours have a sort of plot. There never is a main character or real plot in any of the stories. Except one.Possibly the most famous bit of the film is The Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse. He takes his master's hat and starts enchanting the brooms to do his work for him. This... doesn't end well. This is the only original music composed for the film and it is by far one of the best appearances of Mickey Mouse.But by far my favorite scene is the end. Night on Bald Mountain depicts a demon on top of a mountain summoning the dead and damned to dance and party around him atop his mountain. He casts a few into the pit, transforms them into beasts and demons and does it only for laughs. But he is eventually driven back into slumber by the church bells and the film closes on a procession of priests through a forest. All mixed with Ave Maria. This ending is one of the strongest endings to a film I've ever seen, animated or otherwise. Fantasia isn't just a film, it's an art. The visuals are magnificent, the score is beautiful and it is really one of the best animated films to ever be conceived. If you haven't seen this amazing movie I definitely recommend it. While you may not come out of it with the same feelings I have, it is a must see for any fan of Disney or animation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic blend of orchestration, animation and great sensations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I didn't love Fantasia as much as everyone and their uncle seemed to. So it wasn't one of my favourite ever Disney movies. I think a few of the sections go on a bit too long and become quite tedious. Yet I still recognise it as an amazing work of art and have to wonder quite what audiences would have thought of it back in 1940 when they were shown it for the very first time. Re-released on a number of occasions, and lovingly remastered, the movie is an audio-visual feast that overcomes moments of dullness and accusations of racism by carrying viewers through a two hour odyssey of fantastically orchestrated (literally) animated sequences.Aside from the musicians shown, the only non-animated figures on display are Deems Taylor, who introduces and explains each section, and Leopold Stokowski, the conductor. They are as much a part of the whole experience as the animators and the classical musicians who composed each piece but, let's make no mistake, the main focus here is the celebration of music and the worlds it can conjure up.We begin with a live introduction as the orchestra gets ready and Deems Taylor introduces us to the whole concept, before moving on to "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" - a section that shows various abstract imagery. The next segment features a selection of music from "The Nutcracker" accompanied by images of dancing fairies, fish, flowers and more (including, my favourite, some cute mushrooms). "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is next, starring Mickey Mouse in probably his most famous on screen appearance ever. "The Rite Of Spring" slows things down a bit as we see the history of early life developing on Earth.And then it's time for an intermission, some cool jamming and a chance to meet the soundtrack itself.We get back into full classical mode with "The Pastoral Symphony", the segment that nowadays has some racially dubious, to put it politely, material removed from it but that remains a strange and surreal piece involving mythological figures from Greece, cherubs and wine. "Dance of the Hours" is a fantastic, comic take on the famous work. And the whole thing ends with the spooky and powerful "Night on Bald Mountain" that segues into "Ave Maria".The above passages describe Fantasia but they go no way towards describing Fantasia. It is, like few other movies, a complete experience that you simply have to submit yourself to. And you'll be glad that you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic for years to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia remains one of the most influential films ever made, plus one of the best Disney films ever. Fantasia is one of the 5 films in the Golden Age (the others being Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, &amp; Bambi) and one of Mr. Disney's most personal films. Like many of his features, Walt had put so much heart to it, plus Walt himself as one of the best storytellers in the world, this film is an absolute film that most will never forget. Almost each of the segments were brilliant, but only 3 stood out for me. First off, who could ever forget "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", easily the best performance by the one and only Mickey Mouse. Secondly, "The Dance of the Hours", Lolz. Thirdly, the chilling "Night on Bald Mountain", with some of the best animation of the entire film. Like I said, Fantasia is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What started out odd turns out to be quite entertaining! The bands played music, the first one being interesting. It showed an artist's impression on what they think of when they hear the music being played, vs making music match a scene in a movie. I liked it because of the way my mind is with stuff like that, I was easily able to relate to it.The mickey mouse story with the magic and the broom was funny XD I skimmed through a few others because of the length, however from what I did watch, it was quite interesting. The world being created was interesting, despite being very long. However I liked how it progressed with the music, from what I did listen to. All in all it was very interesting.I rate this 8/10 for the uniqueness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasia is one of Walt Disney's major masterpieces from 1940. Fantasia is an animated film that stands out on it's own by being a musical set with art.All of the segments in Fantasia are great. My favorites are the ones with the Centaurs and also the one with the Pegasus babies.The last segment; Night on Bald Mountain is the creepiest of the movie and might scare young viewers and older alike. Still wonderfully animated and worth it.Fantasia has great animation and the classical music goes along well with the art.Fantasia suffered at the Box Office but the film gets much more praise in this day and age. Classic Disney film will stun you with it's magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant film that mashes classical music with the visual artistry of Walt Disney's stable of artists. The dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy is my favorite scene. Mickey getting in trouble, as the Sorcerer's Apprentice, is a true laugh out loud moment when Mickey is endlessly foiled by his attempts to cover up his misuse of magic.Each frame is individually drawn and hand colored by Disney's artists. While today's computer animation is impressive, I find the hands on approach incredible and the results beautiful. As a side note, Disney revisited hand drawn animation in their 2009 film, The Princess and The Frog.I recommend Fantasia for a family night, since it's safe and fun for children. It is also good for a date night, since it will demonstrate your sophistication, especially if you can recognize the various classical movements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groundbreaking on several counts, not the least of which was an innovative use of animation and stereophonic sound, this ambitious Disney feature has lost nothing to time since its release in 1940. Classical music was interpreted by Disney animators, resulting in surreal fantasy and playful escapism. Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra provided the music for eight segments by the composers Tchaikovsky, Moussorgsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Ponchielli, Bach, Dukas, and Schubert. Not all the sequences were created equally, but a few are simply glorious, such as "Night on Bald Mountain," "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," and "The Nutcracker Suite." The animation ranges from subtly delicate to fiercely bold. The screen bursts with color and action as creatures transmute and convention is thrust aside. The painstaking detail and saturated hues are unique to this film, unmatched even by more advanced technology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie since I was kid and till this day, I still enjoy it. "Fantasia" not only has among the most beautiful two-dimensional animation, but it also has some of the greatest pieces of classical music ever.Every single animation sequence with a grand piece of classical music is amazing. From Mickey Mouse as the mischievous and rather comical "Sorcerer's Apprentice" to the scary and strong imagery of demons in "Night on Bald Mountain", it is all spectacular. This movie maybe over sixty years old, but I have to say that this is among the masterworks of animation not only of Walt Disney, but of everything else.I have to admit though that the "Rites of Spring", the life and destruction of the dinosaurs is rather dull and almost never-ending (since the piece is over 20 minutes long). Otherwise, I still enjoy it. If I can't see the movie, I'll listen to it on my soundtrack copy. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you expect from one of the first avant-garde movies?--that it was made by an indie company? with unknown actors and directors? with a weird, mystic plot and a lot of philosophy? Those might apply to some of the experimental work nowadays.But would you expect that one of the first avant-garde works would come from Disney?? The thought is surprising, but it's true! "Fantasia" is vastly different from anything made before its time, and it's still vastly different from anything made after its time. Disney would never make a film so daringly inventive nowadays.This film is a gem. From its mesmerizing cinematography during Bach's "Tocatta &amp; Fugue" to the comical storyline in "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" to the idyllic animation in Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" and all the way to the finale with "Night on Bald Mountain", this movie charms the viewer. This may be early animation, but the way it's put together allows it to compete in quality with even the most dazzling effects that modern computer animation can accomplish.However, although it bears the name of Disney, "Fantasia" is not for kids. I tried to watch this movie at least 4 times as a youngster, but I wasn't able to get all the way through it until recently, at the age of 17. This movie requires a level of patience that most kids (and some adults even) don't possess. I'll put it this way: if you liked "2001: A Space Odyssey" (which also has vast tracks of pictures put to music without dialogue), then you're good to go on this movie. If you have that sort of patience, "Fantasia" is a real reward.</fullReview>

My favorite scenes from the film are the "Nutcracker Suite" segment. The Sorcerer's Apprentice featuring Mickey Mouse, one of my favorite cartoon characters. The Pastoral Symphony segment set in Ancient Greece...I studied World Mythology as a hobby.

		<shortDescription>Such a beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an animated film with pieces of classical music along with animated stories. Most of the stories with classical music are absolutely beautiful and completely magical, which is why I like this film. Some other people will find all the stories boring, but they are simply classics and masterpieces in Disney. Here is a list of all the story pieces with their music accompanies:Johaan Sebastastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: Fantasia begins with this portrayal of what may pass through your mind when you hear music. When the music first plays, you see the large orchestra away at their instruments. As it goes onto cartoon, you see many different shapes, colours and movements. Whether this would pass through your mind or not when you listen to music, this story, to begin, is very beautiful and well animated. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker ,Part 1: This is the first part of the Nutracker, each one very short and showing a little story, all the parts are related. This part shows fairies in the night decorating flowers. Nice animation and music, but that is pretty much it. 6 and a half/10. Part 2: This part shows toadstalls dancing and is probably the most noticeable of the Nutcracker parts. The music here is pleasant and the toadstalls are entertaining, resembling Chinese people. 7/10 Part 3: Possibly the most mediocre of the Nutcracker parts, here flowers in water dance and there is one white flower that dances about the most. There is nothing really special about this story at all. It is not even that beautiful. Frankly I am not sure why the Disney company bothered. 5/10. Part 4: Other people will certainly think otherwise, but this is almost definitely my favourite Fantasia story. It shows fish in a river and has very beautiful animation and the situation under the water feels very interesting and surreal. The music is also very good here, but it does not seem to be very popular compared to some other parts of the Nutcracker. Well worth it for me. 10/10 Part 5: Also noticeable and very jolly, is this part of the Nutcracker. It shows flowers dancing, resembling Russian people. The animation is very interesting and so is the music. It is possibly a bit too short. 7/10 Part 6: A rather well-known part of Nutcracker in Fantasia, this one features fairies creating autumn, then spring. The animation and music are very beautiful here and the colours are well-portrayed for the seasons shown. 8/10Paul Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice: The most famous of all the Fantasia pieces, this one starrs the ever famous Mickey Mouse wtih his sorcerer's hat - trying to do magic - but not managing very well. I personally do not find this as good as it could be, but Mickey Mouse has a bright personality and this makes the story bearable. 7/10Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring: This has been transformed into a portrayal of the ancient world - the forming of the earth, the first creatures on earth and dinosaurs. Personally this is my third favourite of all the stories. The animation, the music and the modern (of that time) portrayal of ancient earth. 9/10.Meet the Soundtrack: This is a sweet little introduction of the person whom we all know well - the Soundtrack! As we meet him, portrayed as a line, he performs different pieces of instruments and forms into many different shapes and colours. The meeting is very pleasant, nice and relaxing - not really a story. 9/10Ludwig van Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony: This story shows many different creatures (none of them entirely human) in a mythical world, resembling Greek Mythology. The music, colours and plot are very interesting, bright and mythical. This piece has a very "Disney childish" feeling to it, unlike any of the other stories. Well worth watching. 8/10Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours: Also showing a slight "Disney Childish" style, is this story - featuring dancing ostriches, hippopotami, elephants and crocodiles doing ballet. The plot is not very structured, but it does not spoil this piece. This story is very light and silly. 7/10Modest Mussorgy's Night on Bald Mountain: This is my personal least favourite story in Fantasia as, because of the devil, it is very disturbing. The piece of music chosen helps with this scariness of the story, but it is really the animation that makes this story so terrifying. Funnily enough, this is one of the most well-known stories of Fantasia, among with, of course, The Sorcerer's Apprentice. I personally think that the music is very good. 3/10Franz Schubert's Ave Maria: This story is my second favourite Fantasia story. It comes right after Night on Bald Mountain and shows, in fabulous animated detail, who look like nuns going into church through a forest. The music and forest make this slow but incredible piece worthwhile. The opera is incredibly beautiful and so is the last five minutes of the story, which is very emotional.I recommend this to anyone who respects classical music and enjoys Disney. Enjoy "Fantasia"! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many people hear "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" and think Mickey Mouse and those bucket carrying mops. How about the fight between a Tyrannosaurus and another dinosaur when you hear "The Rite of Spring." Or the demons coming out in "Night on Bald Mountain" by Mussorsky? This film put classical music into the pockets of youth, not just its remarkable introduction in 1940, but to generations after that. It let us know that someone could take the notes and put them into a form accessible to all of us. Something that elementary teachers tried to do with "Peter and the Wolf." I know a couple of the pieces seem a little dated now, but collaborating with a a great conductor, Stokowski, brings this to us with great love. Each film is different. Its media is matched to its subject. There is a painless music lesson here and there, and even those are memorable. I have grown to love classical music, though my tastes are overall pretty eclectic, but I have to believe that this film gave me a head start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not just a movie. It is at the same time an experiment and a creation. It's a work of art. And it was made in a way it could entertain. This work deserves a 10 because of the achievements, the innovation and the quality it represents. The visual special effects are outstanding for the time and all of them are perfectly combine with the music. Let's remark that Fantasia was the FIRST commercial film with multichannel sound and that the idea for "Fantasound" came from Walt Disney himself. The resulting film was run in a theatre that was equipped with (depending upon available resources) anywhere between 30 and 80 individual speakers, set up behind the screen and around the perimeter of the theatre's ceiling. Fantasound also featured a wider dynamic range than conventional sound film, allowing for a fuller, stronger sound. So, in my opinion, this masterpiece deserves a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blue lights on a backdrop curtain. Shadows of musicians walking to their seats onstage cross the screen. The sounds of the orchestra warming up grow louder...then fall silent. The narrator walks on. And so "Fantasia" begins.Having two musicians for parents, I grew up watching this movie. It's hard to remember that this is actually quite an old Disney film--my grandmother remembers its debut. She and I are both of the opinion that "Fantasia" is a movie unlike any other, and still far ahead of its time, even generations after its release. I feel that perhaps the greatest asset of this film is introducing classical music to the public in a form that young children and adults alike can enjoy and get involved in."Fantasia" involves eight very famous pieces of music, each one set to a backdrop of differing and engaging animations. Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' is an excellent opening: it is the oldest piece of music in the film, and the animation consists of abstract visions that coincide with the music beautifully. This is the only purely abstract animation of the entire film, with the exception of the modest Soundtrack character that appears later, which introduces various instruments in the orchestra.The orchestra itself is often seen during the film, the musicians backlit with various colored lights, or their instruments spotlighted. The musicians themselves remain in the dark; even their conductor, the great Stokowski, is never seen in the light. We are forced to sit still and concentrate on the sounds that are made--a skill which many people today have not developed. However, even these people are riveted to the simplicity of the orchestra scenes, and even moreso to the animated sequences.The show continues with Tchaikovsky's famous (or infamous) 'Nutcracker Suite', where each dance is represented by different figures ranging from fancy goldfish to fairies to walking flowers. Then comes perhaps the most well-known part of the film: Dukas' 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. This is the only section of the film where a Disney character (Mickey Mouse) appears, as the title character. He learns the folly in pride when a magical spell goes horribly wrong and floods his master's castle.Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring' is a tale of the origin of life, and the epic battles of dinosaurs. It begins alone in space, with only a few stars and a bassoon's tune for company. It quickly moves to scenes of early earth, and simple ocean-dwelling creatures. Later, the dinosaurs take over, finally dying out when the earth's water supply disappears. While some of the science may be outdated by today's standards, it is still a spectacular piece of work that includes fairly realistic dinosaurs--a step away from Disney's habit of 'cutesy'ing animals.This solemn music is followed by the rambunctious ballet 'Dance of the Hours' by Ponchielli, where ostriches, elephants, and hippos dance, and are courted by excitable alligators. This one scene elicits the most smiles from its viewers out of the whole movie. The whole setting is like that of a real, staged ballet...the only difference being that unexpected animals perform the roles.The last animation of the film is actually a melding of two very different pieces: the nearly demonic 'A Night on Bald Mountain', by Mussourgsky, and the sacred piece by Schubert, 'Ave Maria'. While Chernobog, the demon from Bald Mountain, can be scary to young children, 'Ave Maria' offers relief with its soothing scenes of mountains and forests, and worshipers walking calmly through the early-morning light."Fantasia" remains one of my favorite films, and a testament to the amazing skills of the Disney animators who worked on it over 60 years ago. While modern copies of the movie tend to warp the sound, it is not to the extent that the overall experience is lessened. I DEFINITELY recommend this movie for everyone--especially those who think that classical music is boring and stodgy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen Fantasia about two times, both times when I was a young girl. I loved it very much. The first classical music album I ever got was the Fantasia soundtrack, and I have it in LP, cassette, and CD. I happen to have the movie in both VHS and DVD. I hope they do updates with some of the drawings submitted for other classical pieces. In fact, I wish the new short Destino could somehow be added to a future Fantasia update, since it was probably originally intended for one, along with Clair de Lune, which was cut from the original because of time limits, but is only available in its restored form in the deluxe Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 version, which is way too expensive for me. I would love to see what Disney (under Roy Disney, hopefully) would do with Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition; that could be a group of artists' tour de force.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasia (1940)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was the kind of geek that watched Fantasia a lot when he was a kid, and I must confess that, even after all of these years, it remains one of my very favorite films. But more importantly, it is one of the downright BEST films ever made. Walt Disney has given us some of the most popular and utterly entertaining motion pictures of all time -- among them Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Alice in Wonderland, and Beauty and the Beast (which remains the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award to date) --, but none were more daring (or interesting) than this. It is a genuine one-of-a-kind movie experience -- a seamless visualization of classical pieces that can be appreciated on so many different levels. Firstly (and foremostly) there is the animation, which was not only groundbreaking but appallingly well-done; each image is so meticulous and beautiful that it could almost stand alone as a silent film. But the music does, indeed, play a major role here: in fact -- as is joked about at one point by narrator Deems Taylor -- the soundtrack itself is the principal character of the picture. The film can be broken down into nine distinct segments: first, there is Bach's "Toccata and Fugue," set to abstract orchestral images; that is followed by my personal favorite, "The Nutcracker Suite" by Tchaikovsky; next we have the most popular vignette (it was originally intended to be a film of its own), Paul Dukas's "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," in which Mickey Mouse is immortalized as a magician who can't control a group of renegade brooms; Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" is set to a prehistoric visualization, and Greek mythology provides the setting for Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony" (the most controversial number of the movie -- the original print featured potentially racist imagery that has since been cropped out); Ponchielli's "Dance of the Hours" is oddly (yet very successfully) performed by a ballet company of ostriches, hippos, elephants, and crocodiles; "A Night on Bald Mountain" by Modest Mussorgsky is set to a surprisingly dark vignette of Satan summoning spirits, and it is countered by a very tranquil and spiritual representation of Schubert's "Ave Maria." Fantasia is possibly the most unpretentious art movie ever made: it doesn't assume that it's great, or even pretend to be anything more than light entertainment, and yet it is -- it is SO much more. With this film, Walt Disney opened the door for many future abstract film-makers, proving that you don't necessarily need a story as an excuse for your imagery. In fact, the parts that work best in Fantasia are those that DON'T have any particular meaning (see "The Nutcracker Suite"). But more than anything, this movie is a true American classic; its visuals have given new life to musical pieces that could have otherwise gone forgotten (in watching it today, you can tell things have changed when Taylor states that The Nutcracker hasn't been performed much), and they have fueled the imagination of many generations of viewers. Fantasia is innovative, imaginative, and creative -- it never ceases to amaze me with just how much it accomplishes; more than sixty years following its initial release, it remains just as important and timeless. While you could argue that it doesn't amount to much as a whole, you'd be missing the point: each gorgeous frame of this masterwork speaks for itself, whether or not it really adds up to anything.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Path Not Taken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1940, animation was still in infancy. Before -Fantasia- the usual view of animation was that it could be anything other than high art. It could be effective for entertainments for children, suitable at best for use in fairy-tale stories. To be sure, -Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs- got some respect, but could animation be art for its own sake? Could it have appeal without forcing one to revert to childhood?In a time of great movies, -Fantasia- had severe competition, and it created difficulties in presentation, most notably for the sound system necessary for showing this feature to its fullest effect. Today that is no problem; the home stereo and DVD or VHS player and home theater system serve adequately. In the early 1940s the expense of a sound system for the music alone was a BIG problem.-Fantasia- succeeds as art for its own sake. The "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" sequence sets one up for the contrast between realism, representation, and abstraction. The music may be hackneyed, but the visuals begin with something predictable (silhouettes of musicians, as) in the Toccata, only to lead to visual variations largely exploiting partial views of stringed instruments, their bows, and the fingerpads of flutes against odd landscapes.Music from Tchaikovsky's -Nutcracker- is used in a ballet, but one very different from the ballet that we see around Christmas. The dancers are fairies that force the changes of season and creatures of nature. The fairies bring spring plants to life. The dancing mushrooms are fluff, but the goldfish give a subdued, yet seductive dance. Thistles that we might despise in nature form a chorus line that daffodils join -- very impressively. Then the change of seasons from summer to fall is shown as fairies turn the colors of leaves (leaves turn in bunches as they do in nature where I live) and then bring the frosty chill of winter, complete with dancing snowflakes."Mickey Mouse" appears as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in a cautionary tale about using great powers before one fully understands their consequences. Little need be said but that the animation gives a power to the story that no other visual treatment could give to the music.We then get a treatment in a somewhat-educational, yet still-entertaining, depiction of the creation of Earth through the downfall of the dinosaurs. "Science", namely Darwinian evolution, sets the stage for a surprisingly-modern view of the dinosaurs as lively (if often violent) creatures capable of emotion -- almost sixty years before the animated -Walking With Dinosaurs- treatment.Beethoven's Sixth, or "Pastoral" Symphony is the setting for a depiction of the fantastic creatures of Greco-Roman myth: unicorns, pegasuses, centaurs, satyrs, and gods in a mostly-delightful romp, aside from a fearsome thunderstorm from the Big Boss, Zeus.Disney gives a witty treatment of the trite ballet "Dance of the Hours" from Ponchielli's opera -La Gioconda-, with ostriches, hippos, crocodiles, and elephants dancing in a nobleman's palace. At the end, Disney sets two pieces of music symbolizing an apocalyptic struggle between Evil (Mussorgsky's -Night on Bald Mountain-) and good (Schubert's reverential -Ave Maria-) that, although almost polar opposites in mood feed seamlessly as daybreak consigns nocturnal creatures to the netherworld where they belong.This feature should be seen in entirity because some of the images of one scene have parallels in another scene. This is the deliberate choice of one of the cultural giants of the twentieth century. For example, the dancing fish in -The Nutcracker- is recalled as an elephant blows a bubble in -The Dance of the Hours-.-Fantasia- had few imitators for decades. It was too good to imitate. Disney had ideas of replacing some of the scenes in re-releases, but that all came to naught. Animation of this sort would prove costly; moreover, World War II would create a need for propagandistic and educational materials at the expense of 'ars gratia artis'. Disney's postwar successes in more populistic animation probably kept him from making any sequels.Animation came of age in -Fantasia- and proved its usefulness not only in childish cartoons, but also in art and education. Disney took one great step along a path from which even he was compelled to retreat. It's not for a lack of music. Much music begs for such treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant and progressive film and a hallmark of animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1940, Walt Disney released the ambitious film "Fantasia," a marriage of classical music and (for the time) contemporary animation in an effort to expose audiences to the possibilities of animation as well as the beauty of the music presented. A dismal failure in its initial release, "Fantasia" was close to being forgotten by the world, and even Walt Disney himself had distanced himself from his once beloved creation. Subsequent re-releases, however, have exposed new and more receptive audiences to this brilliant film."Fantasia" takes many well-known pieces of classical music and presents them in new and dynamic ways. While some work better than others, none of them falls below a very high standard of quality. By today's standards, the animation could be considered crude and the images simplistic, but all of the CGI flash in the world couldn't replace the impact some of these images maintain.Several high points dot the film. The "Nutcracker Suite" is cast as a ballet of nature, with bouncing mushrooms in the "Chinese Dance" and tiny faeries spreading dew across the awakening world in "The Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy." "The Dance Of The Hours" takes a familiar, and perhaps staid, ballet piece and turns it on its ear, casting such unlikely prima ballerinas as ostriches, hippos, elephants, and a pack of menacing alligators.The crowning achievement of the film, however, is not the over-played "Sorceror's Apprentice," as many claim. Although the music is expressive and the animation well-done, it's commonality has taken some of the dynamic that the piece once had. No, the most striking moments come from the pairing of Mussorgsky's menacing "Night On Bald Mountain" and Schubert's celestial "Ave Maria.""Night On Bald Mountain" marks an undeniably mature moment in the Disney universe. In this piece, Tchernabog, an ancient god of evil (although he is associated with the Christian Devil in the film) summons his followers to Bald Mountain, where all manor of demons, wicked spirits, and imps cavort in his unholy presence. But as powerful as he may be, even the mighty god trembles before the power of the dawn, and with the church bells, his revelry is finished and the world sanctifies itself to the "Ave Maria", one of the most beautifully pure pieces ever composed (at least in this reviewer's opinion).As with all other Disney films, "Fantasia" is subject to the whims and fancies of the Disney marketing department, who infamously take titles out of production for years on end in an effort to build up consumer demand. Should "Fantasia" ever come to a theatre near you, do not hesitate to see it. Should you be lucky enough to find a copy to purchase, do so. A hallmark of animation such as this deserves to be enjoyed by as many people as possible. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FANTASIA C-126min**** (1940)D:Ben Sharpensteen, Hamilton Luske, Wilfred Jackson. Leopold Stokowski and his Philadelphia Orchestra, narrated by Deems Taylor. Walt Disney's speulbinding eight- part marriage, a unique, groundbreaking masterpiece of experimental mix of classical music and animation remains his greatest and yet the most amazing achievement he ever did. A box-office flop when released and upseted purists of classical music that could not take the plotless experimentation of music and animation ended up later on to become a masterpiece because of what it featured.Fantasia's origins where part of a planned Silly Symphony short subject featuring Mickey Mouse in "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". It brought Disney to bring an unexpected and celebrated collaborator. Stokowski and Disney then enbarked on a unique experiment known as Fantasia."Tocatta in Fugue in D Minor" begins Fantasia as an Overture presenting unique abstract geometrical symbols and silouhettes of the orchestra and symbols of representing different insturments of the orchestra. "The Nutcracker Suite" is a ballet of fairies, animals and plant life and features the various seasons. "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" now becoming the concert program'smemorable centerpiece as Mickey, the apprentice of Yen Sid causes havoc by bringing a broomstick magically to life to fullfill his responsibilities to fill a cauldron and starts something only the Sorcerer could finish."The Rite of Spring" vividly tells the story of the process of origins of life on Earth. They tell of the very complex cellular organisms development, the Earth consisting of volcanoes and molten lava, and the presense and extinctionof the dinosaurs."The Pastoral Symphony" is my least favorite segment telling a day of life in Mount Olympus featuring creatures in Ancient Greek mythology. "Dance of the Hours" features a 14th century doge's palace where animals engage in a bizzare dance during the hours of the day. "Night on Bald Mountain" is part of an amazing two-part brilliant climax with Chernoboug, the personification of evil whobrings the forces of Hell and the spirits of the dead into a night of so much furious insanity. "Ave Maria" brillliantly brings us to a lesson that life and hope will triumph over the powers of despair and death.Walt Disney initially wanted to re-release Fantasia each year with new segments. After the box-office results, the ambitious idea would be aborted and followed by a good but less ambitious sequel Fantasia/2000 but the original will always remain a classic and one of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

As I watched every single musical, I was continuing to be impressed by Stokowski's score and the production of Walt Disney. The Chernabog rose terror and excitement in my heart at the same time. This ballet of the hippo and the alligator made me smile, and everything else filled my heart with happiness. I give this musical a 10 and I immediately fell in love with that blue hat of Mickey's.

		<shortDescription>Disney's perfect classical mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's collection inventive animations to a classical music backdrop has passed into kitsch legend since its appearance in 1940. Not only do we have 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice', including Mickey Mouse as the apprentice set on getting his employer's magic to do his cleaning and sweeping tasks (superb, and the source for the reissue poster showing Mickey conducting the elements into a weather symphony); we also have some comical interludes (hippos and ostriches in 'The Dance of the Hours' - also the melodic source for the song 'Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah'; cupids, centaurs and nymphs in 'The Pastoral Symphony'; mushrooms and fairies gallivating to 'The Nutcracker Suite').Although other sections ('Toccata and Fugue', a blend of colours and movement; a tremendous piece on the first few ages of Earth including the death of the dinosaurs) deserve a mention, I think Disney left the best till last. 'Night on a Bare/Bald Mountain' with its devilish and sinister undertones blends beautifully into 'Ava Maria', all white lights and angels. It is an unforgettable moment.Fantasia is a milestone in animation and one which deserves to be remembered with great affection. I can't see its 2000 counterpart having the same standard of work, or the same overall effect. This is classic Disney at its very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasia is not just another animated picture. It is classical music(very good sometimes)combined with animation.Each scene is underscored,or overscored, by a legendary classical piece with the highlights:The dinosaurs,Sacre du Printemps by Stravinsky;Nature,Nutcracker by Tschajkovsky(my favorite composer) and the (almost)last piece by Moussorgsky with the devil himself.All Russian composers yes,but they are the best if you ask me. The scene with Mickey is also very good and very well interpreted.The other pieces aren't bad either but not of the high level of those mentioned above.Still,each piece is very well put together with the music although the music is often manipulated to serve the animation.The best scenes are also pretty scary and therefore not very well suited for the usual Disney viewer,small children.The devil and the T-Rex are very scary underlined by the frenzy of the musical pieces. And there is nudity(!)in this picture,the scene with the horsewomen and the scene with the devil has got nudity.Disney took a huge risk with making this movie but he succeeded very well and made one of his best efforts with this animated concert. Still,it hasn't got the brilliance and the entertainment of Dumbo,Disney's best ever work.A very good picture it is,though. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people say they didn't appreciate this movie until they were adults, but I loved it from the age of 6 and still do. It's in my personal top 5. Being a musician myself (piano and flute, VERY amateur), I love how Disney took some of the most well-known classical music and made beautiful and often amusing pictures to go with it. I personally don't like the "Rite of Spring" segment, but that's fine-it's allowed one bad segment, and the "Nutcracker" and "Pastoral Symphony" more than compensate. I also love how the narrator gives background on the music and the animation but isn't a well-known actor. (Perceptive readers can probably guess that this was my biggest gripe with Fantasia 2000.) It really gives the impression that you're in a concert hall and these are just the pictures that run through your head while hearing the music. All music does that to me, and congrats to Disney for taking that little phenomenon and making a movie out of it. This movie is personally responsible for the invention of surround sound and, if you think about it, it was the first music video. Disney was never afraid to take a chance, and this proved once more that he didn't need to worry at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disney Milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney's FANTASIA has always occupied a precarious niche in the Disney canon of animated masterpieces. For a masterpiece it truly is , a one-of-a -kind, oddball array of eight short features that depict in cartoon form a "story" to illustrate a popular work of classical music. Ever since its initial release in1940, music critics have generally scoffed at the film, deploring the act of illustrating a composer's work. Public reaction to the picture has varied widely, from wild applause to total apathy. Lacking a cohesive "beginning to end" storyline , the film seems to be geared more toward adults than children. The sequences are strung together by a very dry commentary narrated by DeemsTaylor. These introductory notes set up a brief explanation of what is to come, coupled with an anecdote about each specific composer. Although each segment is fascinating (and beautifully drawn), there are four standouts : the "Nutcracker Suite" is a sheer delight, featuring fairies dropping dewdrops on cobwebs and in a later section, mushrooms dancing as Chinese men ; Mickey Mouse as Dukas's "the Sorcerer's Apprentice wherein the famous little guy gets in over his head using magical powers ; the uproarious "Dance of the Hours" in which a company of crocodiles,elephants and hippopotamus divinely bounce, leap and pirouette in front, around and behind Grecian columns ; and finally Schubert's "Ave Maria, depicted as a calming aftermath to the frightening "Night on Bald Mountain" by Mussorgsky. FANTASIA is not a perfect film. It's very structure makes it difficult for some people to sit through all the way. It has its longueurs. But it also has some of the most inspired and gorgeous animation you'll ever see, and thanks to Mickey Mouse and Meastro Leopold Stowkowski, along with Disney's brilliant craftsmen, FANTASIA remains an indispensable work of motion picture art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few good things about "Fantasia 2000" is that after I saw it, it compelled me to dig out the original Fantasia and watch it again. I fell in love with it all over again. When I first saw it in 1990 at its theatrical re-release, I was only 8 years old. Ten years later, in 2000, I had taken up the violin and I was about to graduate from high school. Watching this film with a new appreciation for classical music that I didn't have in 1990, this film inspired me to stick with the violin and pursue a music major. Another thing that changed when I watched it again in 2000, was my view on the final segment, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Today it is my favorite segment of Fantasia. Fantasia's presentation of "Ave Maria" is one of the most spiritually uplifting endings in the history of cinema. The music in this segment is just gorgeous. It showed me that music can have an impact and that it is just as important as any other form of entertainment.Of coarse, it wouldn't be fair not to list some of the other highlights of this film. Highlights include J.S. Bach's "Toccata and Fugue in D minor" which shows off the orchestra and then dissolves into an abstract dream with flashes of light and flying bows and quaking landscapes, Beethoven's "Pastoral symphony" which is a pretty accurate perception of Greek Mythology, except for the centaurettes. Those are purely Disney's idea. Then we have "The Dance of the Hours" Fantasia's funniest and second-most famous (next to the `Sorcerer's Apprentice') this segment features dancing hippos, elephants, ostriches and alligators throughout the coarse of a day from morning to the afternoon, then into the evening and night. This is shown through some very beautiful animation. Sense I was only 8 when I saw this the first time, I was mainly focusing on the cartoon part of it, and the quality of animation made me think it was a new release, and not a 50 year old classic.Forget Fantasia 2000. This movie is the real deal. Read my review of Fantasia 2000 to see what I am talking about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was younger I was plagued by classical music, both parents having degrees in the subject. But nothing they could say or do got me interested in the subject as much as Fantasia did. The animation is incredible-each frame(And there were approximately thirty in each second of film) is lovingly, painstakingly planned, drawn and painted. The recording of the music is, even by today's standards, excellent. The orchestra is well-balanced and all of the instruments that may be heard can be heard, unlike Dad's copy of the Nutcracker Suite, which was recorded in 1997.The ideas for presenting each segment are brilliant;there are all different themes-abstract, cartoon, science, comedy, mythological, religious and nature. I could not imagine what manner of person could look at a plant and think it looks like a person, or create a ballet danced by the four creatures on the planet who are most ill-adapted for dancing. There are certain parts in the film which are not what you would associate with a film viewed by children, because they are the sort of thing that may give some people nightmares, but nobody took much notice about things like that in 1940-at that time they had more pressing matters to worry about. This film is beautiful, funny, frightening, primitive, and brilliant. A mix of beautiful artwork, famous music, and haunting images, I rate this film ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fantasia" is a pure work of art. It has terrific animation that was actually DRAWN. In the majority of today's animated movies, computers are used to animate. But "Fantasia" was hand-drawn and it looks better than most animated films today.The best segments in the movie are "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", which is without one doubt one of the most famous sequences in movie history; "Dance of the Hours", which is the most comedic sequence in the movie; and "A Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria", which is my personal favorite sequence. It actually scared me the first time I saw it when I was about 6. Nowadays, Disney doesn't use such frightening images as Satan on top of a mountain. Then of course there are ghosts, vampires, witches, and such.Bottom line: "Fantasia" is a work of fine art, but won't really entertain most people today. Society today wants violence, action, and humor. Although "Fantasia" does have its exciting and comedic moments, it is mostly just pure art, and so only those with tastes for amazing visuals and/or classical music will truly enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made in the 1940's "Fantasia" is nothing short of a monument as a sign of great Filmmaking.As the movie cover says, "This extraordinary blend of magnificent music and animation is an exhilarating sight and sound experience".I couldn't describe it better myself.The movie starts out as an elegant musical performance that is lead by Conductor Leopold Stokowski and The Philadelphia Orchestra.He explains every piece you hear will hear in this fantastic animated feature.There are works by John Sebastian Bach, a great German composer such As Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky, The Nutcracker Waltz by Pyotr Tchaikovsky , famous Russian composer that is recognized all over the world, all accompanied by great Disney Animation.There is also a segment featuring Mickey Mouse as the young apprentice who is trying to measure up to his Master who is a powerful sorcerer, but Mickey has trouble just taking control of a broom to clean his daily chores. As he tries to take control of it, he causes more trouble and fun for the viewing audience.We also get a fascinating look into the Prehistoric Age billions of years ago when Dinosaurs roamed the earth. You're kids will find this part exciting because Disney presents many Dinosaurs such as a Brontosaurus, Pterodactyls and even a Tyrannosaurus Rex. All the movements of the dinosaurs are wonderfully animated by Disney. The artists really capture their presence.Disney would use their beauty animating Dinosaurs `In The Land Before Time' movie series.Another great scene is where the conductor introduces In the soundtrack of the picture and produces to indulge in the many instruments and their sounds such as a harp, trumpet, violin and many other instruments.I would explain more of the scenes but that would take away from the anticipation of those people who haven't watched this film in years.There is a new version of Fantasia called `Fantasia 2000'Which includes new scenes and a computer restored version of the film.Whichever version you watch, it will be a viewing pleasure you won't forget.A must buy for Adults and Kids.This movie brought back great memories of when I was a kid, and now looking back at this movie, I can appreciate what Walt Disney did in creating this timeless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't remember the first time I saw this, but we own it now. And I must say that it's the prettiest, ugliest, darkest, most innocent, boring, fascinating piece Disney's ever produced. I do remember that when I used to watch it my mother would fast-forward over that devil sequence, and I never fancied the dinosaur thing either (partly because I'm a creationist, partly because it was a little too scary for my tender sensibilities at that age). Those two sequences continue to be my least favourite, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice (although very well done) I don't like much either. Maybe because I can never get that jolly music out of my head afterwards? The Nutcracker segment, though, is gorgeous- lovingly coloured and with those rather beautiful spiderwebs, and my favourite bit when the fairies dance on the ice and leave patterns. And who can forget those dancing mushrooms?The segment I like best, though, is the Greek mythology sequence. From the flying horses to the cupids and centaurs (and don't forget Bacchus), and the beautiful, pastel-coloured landscape, it's a place you want to be. I loved the way the female centaurs beautified themselves with the help of doves and cupids, and I loved watching the baby Pegasuses slide down the rainbow into the water. It's a treat to watch and I always feel afterwards that this was the way things were meant to be. Disney would never get away with naked centaurettes today, but still...And the hippo/ostrich/alligator/elephant sequence was rather nice as well. Must go, thank you for reading, donations willingly accepted, compliments likewise...Sarah.</fullReview>

My list included `Walt Disney'.Look: I am not joking. I was brought up as a kid on such fare as Bambi, Snow White and her cute dwarfs, Lady and The Tramp, Peter Pan and Wendy, and so on. But I grew up and tastes changed, and classical music moved into my life ? and so did `Fantasia'.Long before computers and digital electronics and all those special effects, so apparent in more recent times, back in the 40s and 50s Disney was already producing wonderful works. But `Fantasia' crowns them all. It is a triumph of imagination put to music which excels anything else I have ever seen in cartoon animation. Wonderful choice of music, and the great Leopold Stokowski, with what was in those times a new way of looking at classical music, conducting the Philadelphia, was indeed an excellent idea. Today, well into my 50s, I can put this video on as often as I wish: no way could it ever bore me. Absolutely a must present for teenagers, or even younger, who have any interest in real music and whose intellect clambers out of the foaming pool of idiocy in most brainless modern animated cartoons.Walt Disney's `Fantasia' is one of the most brilliant things ever to have been made for the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my reviews for each segment (rated out of ****):</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st segment: ties with the final segment as FANTASIA's worst. There is some pretty good music in this bit, but it's represented by meaningless pictures and movements. Still and all, don't fast forward through it, will you, there are some interesting moments. **2nd segment: uneven. Many exhilarating moments when images and music explode on the screen, several really magical spots with incredibly good animation, like the dancing of the mushrooms and flowers, but the last few minutes of it are uninteresting and drag quite a bit. Far from FANTASIA's worst, though. ***3rd segment: the best known --and arguably best-- segment of the film. It's the famous segment with Mickey Mouse as a sorcerer's apprentice. Magical animation, excitement, great music, and a classic bit where he's dreaming of shooting around stars and rising waves with his powers. Only complaint: it could've been longer (it's probably the film's shortest sequence). ****4th segment: stunning representation of Earth in its very prime, this is the one that has haunted by mental projection of our planet in its first millennia. Fantastic music and wonderfully drawn dinosaurs too. Great detail in the volcanoes, lava, and environment. Ties with Mickey Mouse's segment as the best this film has to offer. ****5th segment: generally considered one of FANTASIA's least compelling sequences; it deserves better. Set in mythological environments, this lengthy chapter has unicorns, centaurs, Zeus launching thunder bolts, rainbows, and lots more. Some really good moments, but lots of boring ones as well. Music is nothing exceptional, but the segment is surely worth seeing. ***6th segment: another uneven segment, I would put this one in more or less the same league as the previous one. The music is certainly a lot better though. This one has hippos, birds, and crocodiles dancing and elephants breezing away in the wind (don't ask). This could also be the weirdest segment of all, though the animation is stunning. **1/27th segment: almost the best saved for last. At least as good segments 3 and 4. Frightening representation of evil, the devil, terrorising a town beneath a mountain at night. The animation is absolutely stunning, as is some of the music, this segment will definitely give children (or even adults) a good jolt of fear. ****8th segment: vague shadows and lights singing "Ave Maria" after the devil goes to sleep again. Boring and uninteresting; thankfully, this is also FANTASIA's shortest (and, sigh, final) segment. *1/2Overall rating: **+***+****+****+***+**1/2+****+*1/2= 24 stars.24 stars divided by 8 segments: 3 stars out of 4.

		<shortDescription>Old School Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the golden age of Disney films comes this fantastic animated film with some breathtaking visuals. Unusual Disney film to say the least because its a little more darker than the animations that Disney is known for. Not as sappy or overly silly with exception of couple of episodes as in some Disney animated features. Also, it totally dispenses with plot and lets the imagination of the images run wild with style. Excellent mixture of images and music puts it above the average Disney cartoon as one of the best. Presents some extraordinary technicolors effects with fantastic results. The best episodes in Fantasia(1940) are "THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE" &amp; "NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN". "NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN" segment is possibly the scariest Cartoon that Disney put on film. Fantasia(1940) failed during its time due to its dark imagery and did not gain respect until years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in every sense of the word!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Fantasia" when it came out on video back in Nov. '91. It left an indelible mark on my impressions of Disney animation that remains with me today... when I think of Disney, I think of the usual things: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Snow White, Cinderella, etc. But when I think of a great Disney film, one that really stands out in my mind is "Fantasia", a film as monumental as "Snow White" and "Pinocchio". It's well-known that many saw it as a disappointment when "Fantasia" first came out and this was a thorn in Disney's side for the rest of his life. Too bad that he didn't hold out for at least three more years when a new generation discovered it and saw it as the classic that it always has been. "The Nutcracker Suite", "Dance of the Hours" and "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" are the major highlights of the film and I think that each generation will appreciate now since it has stood the test of time and is regarded as a major high point in motion picture history and I quite agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many Disney Movies have been dubbed "Walt Disney's Masterpeice" but few are actually as worthy of the title as "Fantasia"when I saw this Movie in the theaters in 1990, I thought it was a new release! The color, the overall "feal" to the movie, and the music! classics almost everyone knows, like "tocatta and fugue" by J.S. Bach, or the "Nutcracker suite" and "dance of the hours", and of coarse, "the sorcorer's apprentice" My most favorate segmants were the last 3. I like how they passed through the day in Beetoven's "pastoral Symphony" and the following "dance of the hours", and the transfer from "Night on bald mountain" to "Ave Maria" was good, and "Ave Maria" is an excellant peice.both Fantasia movies were good, but this one is still the best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless and ageless masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney's visionary masterpiece is as enduring today as when it was first released in 1940. Though one might assume that this is a film for children, it really knows no age, and it is just as enjoyable for adults. The combination of beautiful classical music led by renowned conductor Leopold Stokowski, and amazing animations from the Disney team is a banquet for the senses.What is so amazing about this film is how far ahead of its time it was. Disney had already pioneered the concept of bringing classical music to children with `Silly Symphonies' which were animated shorts set to familiar classical pieces. He had developed the Multiplane camera, which allowed animations to appear as if they had depth. He had assembled an enormous team of animators and redefined the industry. Everything was in place for a chance meeting with Leopold Stokowski that flowered into a collaboration of obsessive geniuses that would become Fantasia.Fantasia really consists of a series of enchanting animated shorts, each adapted to a particular piece of classical music. There are free form abstract interpretations like the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (Johann Sebastian Bach), a Mickey Mouse version of the Sorcerer's Apprentice (Paul Dukas), and interpretive pieces such as the Pastoral Symphony (Ludwig van Beethoven) and the Nutracker Suite (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky). The selection of the music and the animators' perfect synchronization of the visual images produces a magical and seamless product that makes it seem that the music is written for the images rather than the other way around.Another groundbreaking concept was the sound. Disney invented a system of multiple tracks that he called Fantasound, that placed microphones throughout the orchestra and recorded each track separately. The theaters were then fitted with numerous speakers all around the room that made the sound feel as if it was coming from everywhere. With this, Disney created surround-sound fifty years before its time. To understand what an achievement this was, one would need to understand that simple two speaker stereo hadn't yet been invented. The DVD was re-mastered from Disney's original Fantasound soundtrack making the surround-sound spectacular.The animations were nothing short of miraculous. There was neither digital technology nor computer graphics in 1940. Each frame of the film had to be individually drawn by an animator. One frame took an animator about three hours to complete and there were 24 frames per second. That meant that each second of the film required three full days of labor to produce. The work necessary to produce the smoothly flowing images we see is mind-boggling.The DVD contains a fascinating featurette on the making of the film, including some priceless footage of Disney interviews. He poured his soul into the project and he was crushed that Fantasia was a financial failure when it was released. He endured the negative criticism of its artistic value with great anguish. Little did he know that it would be re-released countless times and eventually become a pop cultural institution. This is a joyful assembly of imagination, invention and dedication, which has left the entire world richer. It is the consummate animated experience. My rating is 10/10. It is one of the few DVD's that I own. Buy it today and marvel at its timeless magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasia Is Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many comments about "Fantasia" and it certainly belongs on any list of the greatest films of all time. It can easily top most lists of the greatest animated film as well.Of course, by today's computer generated standards, the animation seems simple. But, to watch "Fantasia" you have to put it into perspective: it was released in 1940 and every single frame of the film was created by hand.Obviously, there were no hi-tech methods for film creation 60 years ago. "Fantasia" proves that low-tech can still be amazing.Warner Brothers was creating low-tech animation at the same time. As a matter of fact, 1940 saw the birth of Bugs Bunny. But, "Fantasia" easily shows that Walt Disney was the animation master of his time.Even within Mr. Disney's lifetime, (he died in 1966) there would be fancier and more beautiful pictures. Look at "Sleeping Beauty." However, if you keep in mind the era in which "Fantasia" was made, and the state-of-the-art at the time, you can appreciate Disney's work even more.Films like "Fantasia" were stepping stones for Disney that led to greatness like "Sleeping Beauty", "Beauty and the Beast", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", and others.Look at the innovation that Disney used. For example, in 1940, he had the soundtrack RECORDED IN STEREO! Practically every theater in the United States was unequipped to present it sufficiently.I bought my video of "Fantasia" in 1991. But, for the true Disney fan, the DVD is a MUST!I give an absolute, 100% recommendation to it. George</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's most ambitious film feature which bombed at the box office, is a blend of classical music masterpieces including Strauss, Bach, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, and many more and animated tales of interpretation. While some are better than others, the film as a whole is an extremely interesting narrative of the corrolation between music and film. If you have surround sound or a home theater system, it will make this movie that much more awesome. While some of the younger ones wont be able to make it through the nearly two hours, those who are old enough as well as the grown ups, will find Fantasia to be well worth the visit..on a scale of one to ten..8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What music video SHOULD strive to be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, we've all heard about Fantasia... "The Concert Film" was almost its title, certain historians who were children in 1940 claim that it was somehow Mr Disney's statement against the brewing 2nd explosion of Europe due to German nationalism, etc. etc. blah blah blah ad nauseum. But let's stop a minute to think about when this film came out: it was 1940. Fast food didn't exist, color movies were not universal, and toy marketing tie-ins weren't necessary to support crappy movie plots. Walt Disney, God rest his soul, went and made his 2nd feature film... a long-form full-length music video! 41 years before MTV began broadcasting!But enough with contextual social history. The animation in Fantasia is now 60 years old. It's not perfect; frankly it looks grainy and old compared to Fantasia 2000. However, the imperfections in the film's animation give evidence to its artistry: the animators of this film were human beings not Macs or Sparcstations. Now, I'm a big Lucas fan and I'm all for CGI work and digitally inserted characters... but my heart bows in awe to the color texturing and attention to detail that jumps off the screen at you when you see this film!And now, for the other star of Fantasia after its animation staff: its MUSIC. Whoever chose the music, chose very very very well.I was never a big fan of Tchaikovsky... but the Arabian Dance sequence alone, converted me to liking his music. The sequencing of Mussorgsky and Schubert is truly a yin-yang tour de force of musical history and more than makes up for the singular disappointment I have with almost all things Stravinsky [see my review of Fantasia 2000 for the exception!]. Beethoven, Dukas, Ponchielli... all masters. And then there was one, the master of masters [I freely admit to my bias here]: good ol' JS Bach himself. All united under the banner of mouse-ears. Hats off to Disney!To sum up: the animation is old, but give it a break, it's a classic! The music is without parallel. It's a damn-near-perfect film.Final thought -- a respectful suggestion to Disney Corp: EMBRACE THE DIGITAL AGE. RELEASE FANTASIA ON DVD! HIRE I.L.M AND SKYWALKER SOUND TO CLEAN IT UP FOR DIGITAL TRANSFER, THEN RELEASE IT A.S.A.P.!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real visual and musical symphony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few films are as far ahead of its time like this one. Initially a bomb, it took decades for it to be recognized as the work of art that it is. The animation was amazing for its time, and still holds up beautifully today. This film was just so visually inventive and flexible, from the abstract yet completely appropriate imagery of the Bach piece in the beginning, to the epic grandeur of the creation of life on earth for Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring", to the dark and hellish feel of "Night on Bald Mountain". Even throw in the giddy silliness of the dancing hippos, and the famous "Sorcerer's Apprentice", featuring Mickey Mouse at his best. And not to forget the music, either, which features some of the greatest pieces from composers such as Bach, Beethoven, and Tchaikofsky, my personal favorite of which was Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony. And of course, the people behind the music- conductor Leopold Stokowski and the Philadephia orchestra- sounded completely on the mark and accomplished in their trade. And both of these aspects perfectly mesh in the 120 minutes of this film. This time, the music does not simply aid what happens onscreen, but the animation and music are accompaniments for each other. Normally, music supplies the emotion, and visuals convey story. Here, it's a little bit of both- the music clearly weaves part of the story itself, and the animation adds to the feeling of what's going on. Never before have music and visuals so perfectly intertwined like in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive animated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one movie that anyone with even the slightest interest in either classical music or animation simply must see. Whether or not they enjoy it will vary individually, as the film is pretty dated and drawn out. Personally I love Fantasia, but it has its share of problems. It is not, as logic would suggest, a good movie for kids. Fantasia is to animation what 2001 is to sci-fi movies-- the classic genre favorite that ends up boring uninitiated viewers. There's a reason why the only images from this film that ended up permeating popular culture are Mickey's Sorcerer's Apprentice and the Night on Bald Mountain sequence at the end; those are the only two segments that entertain everyone who sees them (except the younger audience members, who'll be terrified by the satanic finale). It's probably just because I'm a child of the short attention span '90s, but I ended up enjoying Fantasia 2000 a lot more than the original. The new film's segments all have plots of some kind (even the triangle butterfly story at the beginning, which claims to be an abstract sequence but really isn't) and they seem to accommodate the musical selections more closely. I still love Fantasia, and I hope Disney gives us good DVD's of both Fantasia films (think about it-- that idiotic straight-to-video Lion King sequel is on DVD but not Fantasia, or even the first Lion King movie). Fantasia is a great film, but Disney deserves respect for giving us a great update in the form of Fantasia 2000, though I've heard the original is a better experience for those who experiment with certain illegal substances...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic use of colours and music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is not a cartoon made for children. This is an animated film made for adults. After watching this film, I have come upon the realization that most children would get bored and stop watching. Yes Fantasia has its dry parts, otherwise it is the best animated film I have seen.The use of music from such masters as Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Schubert and Tonchielli form the basis for the seven animated shorts that make up this film. Other than short breaks in between segments used to describe the next episode and a brief intermission used to explain sound, the film is basically all animation. Walt Disney had the right idea to go for perfection when making this film and the animators he hired sure did a splendid job.My favourite short was the fourth of the film. Called "The Right of Spring," it shows the formation of our planet all the way until the end of the dinosaurs. Starting off with a visually enthralling volcano sequence, we eventually see life change from one-celled organisms to crustaceans to fish to reptiles and then to dinosaurs. The whole dinosaur sequence was the best in the film with the close resemblance of the animated type to the real thing. The atmosphere and movements that surrounded the creatures was perfect, all flowing naturally until their death which is quite interestingly explained without words.The short titled "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" showcased Mickey Mouse and was quite entertaining, although rather short. Beethoven's 6th, "The Pastoral" was also done extremely well using the symphony piece in a mythological setting complete with centaurs, musical cherubs and half-man, half-horse characters and of course the typically fat leader who is having a jolly good time. Finally the seventh sequence using Moussorgska's "Night On Bald Mountain" showcased the transformation of all that is evil into "Ave Maria" and all things that make up heaven. The beast used in this short is rather frightening and would probably give many children nightmares for many nights to come. The short itself plays well to end the film, although could have ended on a greater high.I like the fact that some Disney films do not follow the formula that they use in all of their films today and in the past few decades. Perhaps Disney could try and create another film like Fantasia (I've heard of something called "Fantasia 2000" , but have no clue as to what it is all about) although most people would probably stay away from it just like most people stayed away from Fantasia in 1940. I fully recommend this film to any film lover.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

Quite frankly, it would a lot better with simple caption to indicate the music being played and its history. It would probably be more informative which seems to be important and they could deliver more information. The other main problem is the length. This is really only compelling for at most 30 minutes. It's material for a short. For a full length movie, this needs an actual story.There are some fun bits here and there. I like the Chinese mushrooms. Mickey Mouse as The Sorcerer's Apprentice is great but it's only about 10 minutes. Then there are the dancing hippos. That section is inspired. If these sections are combined, that would be a highly entertaining 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An undeniably important film for the animation industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is a great film that I never want to watch again, if that makes any sense. I watched it, saw much to appreciate about it, but I didn't feel the need to ever revisit it. I felt the same way about Dumbo actually. Both had plenty to offer, both influenced the animation industry heavily, and both made me not want to see them again. The entire premise of Fantasia is pretty cool though. The people behind this movie made various animations that they felt went along with several classical musical pieces. The best segment out of all of them is the very last one with the devil. It was incredibly atmospheric and well done. The Sorcerer's Apprentice bit was good for a laugh, and the abstract pieces at the beginning did a fine job at letting the animator's creativity flow. There isn't anything bad about the film to be honest. It just isn't something you can watch a whole lot. It is an undeniably important film and I think people should still watch it. In the end, I like it. Case closed.</fullReview>

And really, this is more about the music than the animation. Without the music, you have average short cartoons. Without the cartoons, you still have great music.What is somewhat interesting is that despite being two hours long, the film is mostly remembered for the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment, which is relatively short.

By closing my eyes I can also learn to notice differences and technicalities within the musical orchestra being conducted. Doing this surely takes the fun in watching the movie.

		<fullReview>Watching "Fantasia", one gets the feeling of how groundbreaking it must have been when it first came out. The idea of matching music with images may be commonplace to us nowadays, but this is still a unique experience. As it is, I don't know how much I can say about the movie that other people probably haven't already said, so I'm going to talk about various aspects.There was a Looney Tunes cartoon loosely spoofing "Fantasia" called "A Corny Concerto", in which an unkempt Elmer Fudd - with uncontrollable clothes - presented skits featuring the famous characters; one featured Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig (that must have been the only time that they co-starred) and the other featured Daffy Duck.During the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" sequence while Mickey Mouse was controlling the stars, I got the feeling that if I could do that, I would make the stars spell out messages. In fact, I would probably make them spell out dirty messages over religious fundamentalist gatherings (I would maybe write something about Elke Sommer; she fuels some of my raunchy thoughts). Speaking of religious fundamentalists, it's pathetic that they removed a scene from this movie that would have showed the evolution of mankind, lest they offend religious fundamentalists. I would have shown the evolution of mankind with the INTENT of irking religious fundamentalists. But getting back to "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", "The Simpsons" once portrayed a spoof of it in which Scratchy chops up Itchy, who keeps multiplying, so Scratchy chops him into dust, which he inhales...and the particles chop him up from the inside! Next, the Greek sequence. I noticed that some of the female centaurs were partly naked. How did that pass the censors?! And for a Disney movie, at that?! I now realize that "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" featured a few characters from this movie, namely the brooms, ostrich and hippo. In fact, the song played to accompany the dancing hippos has the same tune as "Camp Granada" (although I figure that this one came first). What would Walt Disney have thought had he known that this tune would one day get used for satire? And then, there's the whole end sequence. I see that the evil demon is Chernobog, the Slavonic god of evil. To be certain, the name Chernobog means "black god" (when the name got created how ever many hundred years ago, they probably didn't figure that the name might sound racist). "Night on Bald Mountain" leading into "Ave Maria" reminds me a little bit of the end of "2001: A Space Odyssey", where the fetus oversees what may be a new stage of humanity.To crown everything, they filmed the movie in Pathe Studios in Culver City, now the home of Sony Studios. To be specific, that's where they film "Jeopardy!". Whodathunkit?! OK, so I admit that I've written a totally incoherent review. I just write any idea that comes to me. But my point is that I totally recommend "Fantasia".PS: Deems Taylor mispronounced Modest Mussorgsky's last name. It's pronounced MOO-sorg-sky, not moo-SORG-sky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good children's movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is one of the best classic animated movies ever! It is an excellent film for young children. Without much dialogue, they must use their imaginations to tell the story. Fantasia is bound to please at any age with its timeless music pieces and brilliant artistry. I grew up on this movie, and i loved it. When i was young, i named a stray cat that kept returning to my house "Fantasia" after this movie. This is a good movie for long car trips, especially at night. This movie is a must-have with young children. It is hard to find, but i strongly recommend looking for it. Fantasia is a movie that will remain a masterpiece for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great music, wonderful interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that you don't have to like classical music to like this movie, but of course if you do it will add a lot. I like classical music, especially the more famous parts. 'Fantasia' contains a lot of those famous parts.It starts with Beethoven's "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor". The animations don't have a real storyline here. The same goes for the next segment put on Tchaichovsky's "The Nutcracker Suite". Then we get one of the most famous animated things Disney has ever done, "The Sorceror's Apprentice", In Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" we see the beginning of the world. Then we have a intermission where a string shows us how instruments look like when the sound would be animated. After this we have Beethoven's "Pastoral Symphony". This segment is set on Mount Olympus and we see all the famous creatures that lived there. This is followed by Ponchielli's "The Dance of the Hours" in which animals represent different parts of the day. The final segment is split in two. The first part is with the music of Moussorgsky's "A Night on Bald Mountain" in which the devil makes his dark creatures dance. This is probably the darkest thing I have ever seen in an animated film done by Disney (not counting the Nazi-cartoons they have made). The second part starts with church bells interrupting the devil and after this the morning comes and we hear the world-famous "Ave Maria" from Schubert. It is all beautiful, music and animations.If you don't like classical music just watch the wonderful images on screen. "The Sorceror's Apprentice" is my favorite segment, may be because it is the only one with a storyline that involves only one real character. All segments are worth watching, so 'Fantasia' is definitely worth watching. Just find anything to enjoy, there must be something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney movie ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Fantasia was when I was 2 and a half. My Mom bought me a 50th anniversary edition on VHS. I fell in love with the movie immediatly. Before we start the review, know that Fantasia is classical music with animation added on.fantasia has some of the best scores on it. Dance of the hrs., Nutcracker Suite, etc. In the movie there are 3 different kinds of animation. One is abstract, one has more deffinate pictures, one tells a story.So what makes Fantasia good. It is because it is colorful, musical, it is its own kind of movie. There are scary parts, Happy Parts, and parts that are not really happy or scary. i reccomen this movie to everyone who loves classiccal music and animation. Or just likes movies.</fullReview>

Then you gotta pay for the privilege" mentality that Disney has developed over the years it truly highlighted here. The movie itself is vastly overrated, patience pushing overly-long and aimed almost purely at classical music lovers, and I can only wonder how many children (and adults) this bored to tears over the many decades. Between each unrelated segment the conductor waffles on describing the very simple story you're about to see (thanks for that) and the segments themselves are a mixed bag. The Mickey part is good, along with the dinosaurs and devil parts, but many of the others are just too dull, overly simplistic or hardly anything brilliant, and they go on for far too long. Overall it is very well made and certain parts are still impressive, but the length is overindulgent by a least half an hour and it becomes a chore to sit through, and I doubt many kids, if at all, could make it through until the bitter end without wanting to do something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven in quality; what's great is great, what is not is mediocre or weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having rented a DVD and seen "Fantasia" for the first time in my life, I will say this: what is great in "Fantasia" is great, what is not great in "Fantasia" is mediocre or just plain weird or underdeveloped. First, let's start with the great. "Night on Bald Mountain" and the following "Ave Maria" are stunning. Those two cartoon segments should have been part of a separate movie altogether, blowing away all the contemporary "Horror" Manga comic stuff coming out of Japan. I never seen a cartoon before show the sides of "Good" and "Evil" in such contrasting manner, with a strong depth of spirituality. "Sorcerer's Apprentice" is a great Mickey Mouse feature that should have been made into a separate movie. That's segment's strong messages of "consequences" of one's actions is outstanding. The rest? The other segments are not worth talking about, because Warners Brothers Bugs Bunny and Co. did that stuff 20 times better and with a sense of humor. In ending, the uncut version presented here, with the narration, well, let me say this, the narration is not needed, it only slowed things down.</fullReview>

I need to be honest and say that I don't remember 100% of this video, but the songs played in the tape when I watched were sinister at times and others very beautiful. I always remember the scene were Mickey Mouse become a wizard and makes the broomsticks to walk and to carry water, and everything starts to go in a wrong way.

		<shortDescription>Fantasia Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With how far animation has come today with mind blowing pictures seen in films such as "Avatar", it's very interesting to go back to the roots of it all in Disney's Fantasia. Although there is a lot happening in this film in terms of color and music, you can't help but get a feeling of peace while watching. Disney has a reputation for being magical and this film is no different. The Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski is is just as essential to the film as the animations themselves. With little to no words spoken in almost all of the individual stories, it's essentially a silent film. In silent films, music was important to portray different emotions and feelings to the viewers that the actors simply couldn't: Fantasia is no different. Along with the music, the animation itself was amazing for its time. The vibrancy of different colors in motion obviously takes a lot of time and hard work and everyone involved did a great job in making Fantasia a classic animation film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasia was better than I thought it would be, yes, it's different, but it's that what makes it magical. It's unique and truly classical, and overall a special film.My favourite sequences were 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'The Pastoral Symphony'-Simply because I love Mickey Mouse and Legendary Creatures. The music in the film is excellent, and I've got to say, the animation isn't so bad for a classic.The downside is however, I think younger audiences will get quite bored, maybe because it's different. But the older generation, I think most will be charmed with Fantasia, like me.So, even though I wouldn't really recommend Fantasia to young kids, I'd say true Disney fans watch it. It's really a great film, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I know I wasn't. And just to think I doubted watching this movie at first. I'm glad I've watched it, as it's truly magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's simply magic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Snow White" and "Pinocchio", what would Walt Disney do next? Would he take another famous fairy tale and turn it into an animated musical? Or would he try to do something else? Something crazy? Innovative? Extraordinary? Well, simply said, he did something else. And not something ordinary, nor rudimentary.Disney, along with his faithful collaborators, created "Fantasia". What is "Fantasia"? For objective writers, it's a set of animated cartoons mixed with famous classical music pieces. For me, it's the most wonderful animated feature created by Walt Disney.The main reason why "Fantasia" is a unique animated picture is because animation becomes an entity itself, something that never happened with any animated feature, before or since. The best example is the first piece: "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" by Johann Sebastian Bach. In this part, music is mixed with simple images which represent nothing. You can see musical notes flying over a uniform font and dancing over and over. This kind of animated trick could be seen as easy and unextraordinary today, but remember that this was done in 1940, with archaic methods. The result of this part is the most intricate of all the sketches, while it may not appeal to everybody. In fact, it's the only moment where you can follow the music. Anywhere else, it's the animated scenes that catch you first.The second cartoon is "Nutcracker Suite". Here, it's still a ballet, but it's done by mushrooms, fairies, leaves etc. I loved it. The mix of natural elements with animation is simply well done and the music is enthralling.Then comes the most famous part of them all: "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". The main reason why it became the most popular piece of "Fantasia" is Mickey Mouse's presence, who stars as the young apprentice , who decide to test the wizard's hat powers in order to allege his tasks. Eventually, it turns into a catastrophe, but things go back in order with the wizard's intervention. That's maybe the easiest part to follow, because it's the only one which has a narrative. The catchiest parts are surely Mickey's dream with the shooting stars, the waves and the clouds."The Rite of Spring" is next and it features the Earth's evolution, from its creation till the dinosaurs' extinction. Inbetween, there's a spectacular volcanic eruption extravaganza and dinosaur battles. These scenes were controversial to me, because the level of fright during the battles was high and I don't think it should appeal to young children. But for more mature audience, it's a great show.Beethoven's 6th Symphony was one of my favorites, as it features mythological creatures, such as centaurs and Cupids, but also a funny Dionysos.The last ones ("Dance of the Hours", "Night on Bald Mountain" and "Ave Maria") were great as well, but I didn't find them as entertaining as the others.Overall, the musical feelings of the classical pieces and the animated scenes are matched together like magnets on a refrigerator and they perfectly fit together. They create a sense of wonder and magic, that makes the viewer dreaming and smiling for a long period of time. The failure of subsequent "Fantasia 2000" shows at what point "Fantasia" has a unique impact on today's culture and that nothing will ever be as well crafted and executed as Disney's masterpiece.I repeat it, it's the best animated feature of all time and it will certainly remain 'till the end of times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Challenging? Yes. In 1940, there were areas in the US where Darwinism was regarded as sinful. Many people (especially school teachers) challenging the Adam and Eve story were taking a hell of a risk, yet here we have Disney throwing the Godbook out the window and presenting life on earth as the result of a straight evolutionary series of events; pure survival of the fittest. Add to that small, but 'perfectly formed' fairies, throw in the odd nymph or two and round it off with Night on Bald Mountain, and you've got a very potent mix. Sure it's sugar coated, but it had to be. It's a pity the original release didn't include the Salvidor Dali sequence though...........Purely as a film, I think it's superb. One of the reasons behind it was to showcase the best that was possible, hence you have picture quality that at times was the closest you can get to 3D on a flat screen, coupled to what in effect was full surround sound audio. One question please. The Disney site shows a 60'th anniversary DVD version of the film but goes on to say it's not available to the public, yet 60'th anniversary DVD's are being sold on Ebay and Amazon. Can anyone tell me what gives? Does this DVD have sequences that were on the original film release, but edited out of the VHS Video tape?

		<fullReview>Fantasia is one of the most inspiring, original and creative movies to come out of Hollywood. It is a tour de force of the imagination. Disney's artists did justice to the great music they chose. I am sure the original composers would be delighted with the imagery and stories associated with their music. From the light and airy beauty of "Right of Spring" to the dark and forbidding "Night on Bald Mountain", to the amusing "Sorcerer's Apprentice", Disney captured a wide array of worlds, stories and emotions. The audience is never for a moment bored as it is taken from one fantastical world to another, all a delight.This picture is a masterpiece. It and 'Snow White' will always be the benchmarks to which all animation features are judged. Both were bold and daring in their time and established a new genre in the art of film. Comic Books &amp; Animated Features, like Jazz, Blues and Rock, are unique American contributions to the world of Art.Every parent should rent this for their child ? and for their own enjoyment and satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you judge this?It is an art form, that is all too obvious. Perhaps this is the closest thing to such a genre that Disney will ever undertake. If I have one complaint about the artwork, it's the clashing or repetition of styles. "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" and "Night on Bald Mountain" look the same whereas "Symphony No. 6" and "Dance of the Hours" carry a different visual theme. Nonetheless, this is probably Disney's most lavish visual work until The Rescuers Down Under and, subsequently, The Lion King. This is in a league all to its lonesome.Before MTV came around this was probably the best thing to represent the musical (this isn't to say MTV does a good job, far from it) because it isn't concerned about characters, acting, singing, or pacing. Just artists and musicians.My personal favorites have to go to "Rite of Spring" and "Night on Bald Mountain". In "Rite", the animators aren't trying to create some bulky hippo in a tutu or dancing fawns. It is concerned with realism and fluidity, not exaggeration. In that respect, it succeeds. "Night" remains the best marriage of music and visuals in the entire film because it is not afraid to go the distance. I haven't a clue what Disney's religious affiliation is, but this this is probably the closest he gets to debating "good and evil" in the harshest terms possible in all his work.Overall, beautifully made, this should be a must for music and art appreciators, Disney fans, and those looking for something different. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film which has had a considerable influence on the cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 60 years it does not need to be said that this is a great classic film, and it is one that certainly repays viewing periodically. I still find this to be true even though I personally am not a lover of animation, and the quality of the animation in this film is both a little dated and somewhat uneven. I have noted that the IMDB already has some 60 viewer comments about this film on line, and until today have not felt justified in adding to these. However I recently reviewed the very few films which I believe have made a major contribution to the development of cinematography as we know it today, and this has led me to decide to send you one brief additional review, making a point which perhaps has not been adequately covered by the comments you already have on line.The modern cinema is far too dependent upon the use of electronic mood music, usually of very poor quality, to help a viewer follow a story. Fantasia stands almost alone as a very popular film which showed that a good cinema with a high quality sound reproduction system has immense potential for use as a concert hall in many smaller communities where this is an unavailable luxury. It is a great pity that more film studios do not appreciate this and generate a series of films where the story is ancillary to the sound track and where really high quality music is offered to the audience as the prime attraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A National Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FANTASIA is simply one of the greatest American works of collaborative art of the entire 20th Century.Existing without precedent in American film history, FANTASIA was a desperate gamble, a unique act of madness, and an undeniable work of extraordinary craftsmanship. Producer Walt Disney - together with his legendary artists, the equally legendary Leopold Stokowski, and the music critic Deems Taylor - together, these artists absolutely exploded the idea of a what a film could be, and in the process, forever ended the notion that the medium of animation was a children's medium.The film ignored the conventions of mainstream film, especially in its original release version, and tossed all narrative and dramatic conventions overboard like so much dead weight.It was the first film to feature multi-channel sound. It was the first - and only - film to receive TWO special Academy Awards. It was among the first films added to the National Film Registry, officially declaring the film a National Treasure of the United States of America. And in its marriage of visuals to classical music, FANTASIA was the modern forerunner of films like APOCALYPSE NOW, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and even PLATOON.Walt Disney never lived to see FANTASIA become a true blockbuster. It would take YELLOW SUBMARINE - which followed in FANTASIA's footsteps by creating animated visuals to match the music of the Beatles - to turn on American audiences to the film's controlling idea. And ever since FANTASIA's re-release in the wake of YELLOW SUBMARINE, Disney's film has succeeded in collapsing the American prejudice against the animated medium, and the film's reputation has only grown more and more, almost exponentially, with each passing year, and each subsequent re-release.There are few films that can be described as true icons of American cinema. Porter's THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY. Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION. Welles' CITIZEN KANE. Kubrick's 2001. FANTASIA is such a film.It is a profound work of drama, audacity, whimsy, and beauty.It is one of the few true cinema legends.It is one of the greatest works of art of the entire 20th Century.Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 60 years, still one of the greatest animated films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Fantasia", Walt Disney reached the pinnacle of excellence in the animated feature category. The film, as most everyone now knows grew out of Walt's desire to cast Mickey Mouse in a cartoon short based on Paul Dukas' "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", but was expanded to a full-feature presentation, when costs of the short were three times that of a traditional Mickey Mouse cartoon. The film is, for lack of a better work, spectacular. Never before, or even since, had the animators at Disney executed such a lavish treatment on the field of animation. From the abstract drawings set to J.S. Bach's "Toccata &amp; Fugue in D Minor" to the thrilling dinosaur duel in Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring"; from the ballet dancing hippo's in Ponchielli's "Dance of the Hours" to the good vs. evil finale of Mussorgsky's "Night On Bald Mountain" paired with Schubert's "Ave Maria" this film is crammed full of memorable images. Sadly, however Walt Disney never lived to see his most personal film become the classic that it is regarded today. Critical and audience indifference in the '40's, '50's, and most of the '60's kept the film "an expensive experiment that failed". Today however there are few who don't look at "Fantasia" as a classic and it is still one of the most often cited films that provided many with the dream of becoming involved in the world of animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FANTASIA may never let anyone listening to classic music hear it the same way--especially after his treatment of "Dance of the Hours", one of the film's most hilarious segments, with hippos, ostriches and elephants in tutu executing all the clumsy ballet movements. It's priceless, but is probably one of the more controversial elements in this uneven mixture of Disney shorts with the emphasis on music.Personally, I'm fonder of Disney doing SNOW WHITE, BAMBI or PINOCCHIO, and found certain segments a turn-off ("The Rite of Spring" episode seemed awfully barren and dull), and others a complete delight. "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" with Mickey Mouse trying his magic with disastrous results is one of the best.Another very impressive segment is "A Night On Bald Mountain" which has every scary element giving it the height of interest, followed soothingly by the closing "Ave Maria" sequence.Bold in color and conception, this is an uneven blend of Disney's artistic work from his army of animators. He certainly was an artist who wanted to "stretch" and this was his exercise in uniquely imaginative images and sounds. My favorite moments came during "The Nutcracker Suite" with mushrooms in the shape of Chinese men doing their intricate thing and the spidery webs glowing like gold as tiny fairies sprinted across them. That was Disney magic at its best.Whether or not this is a totally successful experiment, is up to each individual viewer.</fullReview>

No longer confined to its short compilations, nor its storyboarded full-length features, the artists let loose their timeless visions on the unsuspecting audiences of the time. Strangely, it was not well received...Until now, where many feel it to be one of the studios most visually stimulating and captivating films. I find it to be quite an amazing work for its time. Fantasia moves well with the classical pieces of Beethoven, Stravinsky, Tchiakowsky, and many others.

I even love the newer Disney movies like Tangled(which is my all time favourite movie btw) and of course Frozen. So my cousin bought me this on DVD for the Xmas as I have never seen Fantasia in my life.According to Disney this is the ONLY Disney movie to have a long running time of 119 minutes. 10 mins in and I was bored of it. Basically its set with orchestra music and we see segments of cartoons. One was about fairies and the music from the nutcracker was been played by some Leopold dude. Then we get to see other bizarre creatures lurking upon us once the film progresses. But if I had to pick one I enjoyed its the Sorcerers one with Mickey Mouse and his broom. I dunno why but that one was good. As for the rest don't even bother. If you are looking for a sing along with talking charcthers then you are in for a shock as this film isn't really a movie AT ALL in fact its more like some concert that Disney wanted to add in his Disney canon next to Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs and Pinochio. Want my advice go watch Tangled or any of the other Disney movies instead. Fantasia is just a boring bland mediocre rip off that I thought would have charcthers talking and singing. BOY I was wrong.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all that great, good for classical music fans only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Fantasia for the first time when it was re-released in theatres while I was in my 20's. I was excited to see it after hearing so much about it over the years. The animation was good, and the clssical score was fine, but since I am a minor classical music fan it got really boring really fast. You gotta give me SOME kind of action! The Sorcerer's Apprentice scene was great, but that is the only praise I can give it. When the screen went dark and the lights came up I was happy it was finally over, then the narrator came on informing my wife and I that it was merely time for intermission. We quickly stepped to the exit and to this day remains the only film we ever walked out on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I will be called a troll, but I don't get this. Feel free to check out my other posts, I am not a troll and I apologize if people find me to be one.I watched it because it was the only movie in the AFI top 100 I had not seen. Everyone I talked to about this told me it was terrible. I have never heard an actual person say anything good about this. I looked at the threads and really don't see anyone ripping the movie. I have never heard a negative review. So I had hopes as I have liked many movies my friends and family have hated.I watched it thinking my friends and family were wrong, but I found them to be correct. I can't put in to context what was bad, except I just felt like it was nothing more than a series of meaningless cartoons meant for someone on heavy drugs. The closest I can compare to anything I have ever seen is some psychedelic (spelling is wrong) hippee movies that I would never have forced my self to sit through. It was like a bad Pink Floyd album like Atom Heart Mother Suite, Saucerful of Secrets or Ummagumma or the Beatles song Revolution Number 9. Only this lasted 2 painful hours.It seems to be pretentious tripe that everyone who is "anyone" has to say is good. But it seems average people hate it. I truly want to find an actual person who likes this so they can explain to me why.Maybe I lack class. Always a possibility. Maybe I am not smart enough. Always a possibility.Out of over 3200 movies ranked I have only given 10 other rankings of 1. I feel I am being unfair to the other 1's by giving this a 1. It is so much worse</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I remember from childhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember loving Fantasia as a kid; the music, the imagery, the majesty. What happened? Come to think of it, I never actually watched the entire Fantasia film as a child. I watched the scenes that were of particular interest. In short; the one with Micky, and the dancing hippos. Visually, Fantasia is just as gorgeous now as it was in 1940. The music is enthralling and as a result it's a masterpiece. What its not is an interesting film. At over 2 hours long this film lacks any resemblance of a plot, dialog, character development or any other story. It's a music video of its time and an impressive one at that, but I had a difficult time watching it in its entirety without feeling heavy eyelids.I love Disney films and I appreciate what Fantasia means to the history of films, but on its own it fails as a watchable film. It lacks the one key thing that every film requires to be worth seeing. A story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only good Disney movie in existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney movies tend to be overrated. Most of the movies are about musical numbers performed by live-action pedophile actors with live-action children superimposed with anthropomorphic plants and animals scurrying about a cartoon forest and everyone in that scene is singing about something stupid. How are these movies supposed to represent American family values!? The only reason why Fantasia is better than every other Disney movie is because there is absolutely no singing (not counting the Ave Maria segment, I did not notice there was singing in it until just a few years ago and I could not tell it was in English until literally just at the time of this writing) and only a few seconds of legitimate dialog. Instead, animated segments timed to classical music are projected to give a surreal audio/visual experience (like a drug trip). This saves the trouble of having to go through with a bunch of idiot animals running around singing about how great manual labor is.I feel that this movie is revolutionary because its segments are the first music videos. Without this movie I could never justify why Pink Floyd: The Wall is a real work of art and not just an overlong music video.The direction that this movie takes is genius. Instead of overly happy dogs bursting into inappropriate dancing, the audience enjoys the sight of a T-Rex mauling the crap out of a triceratops, Mickey Mouse chopping a walking broom to pieces with a battle-ax, Zeus throwing a bunch of lightning bolts at some naked horse chicks and scaring them s***less, and Chernobog, the giant demon of Bald Mountain, kicking ass and taking names.This movie is much too good to pass up. There has never been a movie with so much appeal to watch again and again and the animated sequences even sync up with Metallica (try Master of Puppets with the Sorcerer's Apprentice) just like how Dark Side of The Moon syncs with Wizard of Oz. No matter who you might be, this movie will simply blow your mind, words cannot describe how monumental of a film this piece really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning of this film is quite different from any other animated film. I thought it was terrific, but then the film goes downhill after that, picks up for a brief period and peters out more. The dull parts tend to be the slow classical pieces. Overall, the movie is difficult to rate.The first part, with symbols and other things popping up all over the screen as a symphony orchestra plays, is almost worth the price of the video. Kudos for whomever re-mastered the sound in here, as it is excellent stereo, amazing for a film over 65 years old.Granted some of the stuff is very original and much of it is colorful, but two hours of animation is long time....too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I never write reviews but this movie compelled me to share what I believe is the foremost authority on this movie. The effects are unrealistic, the music is all a cover of old songs and the hippo scene had Way to many bubbles. Deems Taylor claims to be an authority on scientific theories of how the world was created but if you really look in to his credentials you start to realize this man has absolutely no education built behind theoretical science. The depiction of Sorcerers was also very offensive to me, for some reason they chose to create a world in which the sorcerers "Hats" hold all the magic. To me the sorcerer had a lot more qualities of a Wizard than that of a sorcerer. I also didn't appreciate how they put cartoon mice in a bad light saying that they are lazy, broom homicidal and have no work ethic. I think we can all agree cartoon mice are hard working just like any cartoon mammal and would never kill a broom in there life. If we keep pigeon holing cartoon rodents we will never have a good fictional equilibrium. oh and Don't even get me started on the overuse of animal yawns there were, almost if the animals were tired, Cartoons have no metabolism or need for oxygen so why would they yawn?! However the trees were nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique and original but not as good as the 1999 version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course it's a real accomplishment to let the images fit so well to the classic music but it just isn't the most exciting movie to watch. I prefer the 1999 version "Fantasia/2000" of Disney because that version features different animations styles for basically each segment. This movie is just more or less of the same the whole time, no matter how good looking it is all and how well the music sounds.Of course it's not an horrible movie though, not at all. It was a very special and original project for its time to mix animated sequences with classical music, from some well known composers, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The movie for its time also used some unique stereo techniques to really bring out the best when it comes down to its music. All of the animations from the Disney studios are great looking and the movie features some unique moments but most importantly it fits the music very well, A real accomplishment and it must have been a real pain for the animators to work on this movie, to get the timing constantly right.The movie features 7 different segments, to 7 different classical compositions from composers such as Tchaikovsky, Bach and Beethoven. Of course some of the segments are better and more enjoyable than others but overall it's balanced out very well, although some segments drag on for too long.This is also a complaint. This movie was obviously also made to introduce the youth of its time to classical music but using animations. After all; it's a Disney! I however just can't imaging a 10 or 12 year old enjoying this movie, not even in 1940. It's just too slow for that in parts and the images are not always compelling nor entertaining enough for them, to keep them interested throughout, also because not every segment really follows a clear main story. Personally I as a kid really couldn't watch this movie, or the 1999 because it was way too boring. Perhaps this also still would had been a better movie if it only had been a bit shorter. 2 hours just seems a bit too much.A real accomplishment but I wish it had been done a bit more entertaining, with different styles and a bit more pace. Something the 1999 version did much better.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic must-have, but the second half is unnecessary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasia is a must-have. Every family should own a copy of this movie; however, the second half is not nearly as good as the first half. I don't exactly know if the reason why I think the first half is better is because I grew up watching the first half and stopping there to do something else for whatever reason.The Sorcerer's Apprentice segment is arguably the most classic scene in Disney history. Every family must know where the image of Mickey with a sorcerer's hat came from. The beginning Toccata and Fugue segment, although only with orchestra musicians, shapes, and colors, is a good beginning segment. The Nutcracker segment is also somewhat classic.The second half is not nearly as important as the first. The short segment where the narrator is talking to the Soundtrack (vertical line that makes shapes for every musical sound) is very fun to watch. The ballet segment with ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators is very good for kids. Other than those latter two, Fantasia could have done without the second half. The Rite of Spring segment with volcanoes and dinosaurs, is enjoyable to me personally, because I like dinosaur movies, but it may be a little too tense for some young kids. The same with the big black devil in the last segment. There is some partial nudity in Beethoven's mythological segment and the last segment, though some may say it's not too offensive. And in my opinion, the second half of the last segment, with nuns walking with candles slowly in the soft music, is just plain boring. There's no music in the closing credits, which makes my personal hobby of watching credits less fun.As for comparing it to Fantasia 2000, I actually like 2000 better, because every segment is good to watch. For more on comparing the two, look for my Fantasia 2000 comment.My recommendation: Own this movie. Whenever you watch it, you can watch the whole thing if you want, but more often, you can watch the first half, and stop after The Sorcerer's Apprentice. If the kids like dinosaurs and don't mind the scary parts, then they can watch the Rite of Spring segment. And if you go that long, then stay for the short Soundtrack segment.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually like Fantasia 2000 better than the original. OH MY GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE SAID THAT! This is why: I do love the original Fantasia, but I find that the animated segments resemble each other too much. Only Night on Bald Mountain (and Ave Maria, which is attached to Night on Bald Mountain) is completely unattached from the style of the rest of the animation from the film. Everything, from the abstract Toccata and Fugue segment, the Nutcracker Suite, The Rites of Spring, even The Sorcerer's Apprentice tend to look as if they were animated by Disney artists. This is why, I assume: Disney was the greatest producer of feature-length animation. The styles of other animated films, such as Warner Brothers and UA (e.g., Popeye), were rough and obviously made for sort subjects. Disney probably did not think that his animators needed to look at other artwork in order to inspire their drawings. Therefore, everything begins to look the same, except for the final two pieces, which are completely different. This film's sequel, Fantasia 2000, obviously searches around more to find different inspirations. You cannot tell that the Rhapsody in Blue segment, inspired by the caricatures of Al Hirschfeld, was created by the same person who did The Carnival of Animals, a work on watercolor that looks inspired by Matisse or other similar artists. The Symphony #5 piece does not in any way resemble any other piece. This can be said about every segment in Fantasia 2000. Different art styles, different colors, different media were used in every segment. I gave them both a 9/10, but I do think Fantasia 2000 provides more variety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From brilliant to awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fantasia" is a very uneven piece of entertainment. It contains some amazing and heart-warming sequences (take the one with the fairies as an example) and some boring and heart-worming parts (cf. the one with centaurs). The range of my emotions can be described from "Superb! Enthralling! Amazing!" (cf. "Tagline") to "Is it supposed to be ... what? Who is responsible for this stupid "ani-mess"?".Music goes from enjoyable (Tchaikovskiy) to something unintelligible (don't know who is the composer but I simply cannot catch a beautiful melody - what is it for, then?). In my humble opinion, they should have picked out only the most memorable classic music scores. A plain gal or boy could help them to carry out this task without scientifically metaphysical (or should I say "metaschizically"?) approach. Some super intelligent professor was in charge of that task instead, I guess.As to the "cast", the famous characters are ruining "Fantasia". Instead of receiving a universal status it becomes "one of Mickey's adventures" on screen. Did the animators run out of the ideas? Where is Donald Duck then? And Goofy? And Mermaid? If I want to see Mickey Mouse, I watch his adventures (there are loads of those shorties) but what the hell is this mouse doing here? What do I consider to be brilliant? Well, the first abstract animated piece that is developed from the musicians' silhouettes. The piece with the goldfish. The piece with the dancing flowers.5 out of 10. A very good and innovative try but half of the running time it is, alas, awkward and I would not show the whole feature to children - only, maybe, 45 enjoyable minutes out of this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious and well-intentioned, but ultimately a misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fuelled with the noble ambition of bringing classical music to a wider audience, especially children, Fantasia succeeds and fails in equal amounts. Some of it works, some it bores. It could have made a perfect 85 minute movie if the crap was cut out.The first segment is enough to put you off completely. We have to suffer blips and bloops twinkling across the screen as acid-trip visuals match the music that is being played (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor). Kind of like turning on the spirograph-like visuals on Windows Media Player. This is a bad way to introduce the film and it's techniques. I can only imagine the audience of the time watching it and thinking 'What the hell is this?' The three good segments in the movie are the story of the Dinosaurs to the music of The Rite of Spring, the over publicised Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Nutcracker Suite and A Night on Bald Mountain. All effect a wonderful atmosphere that is so lacking in modern animation.Segments featuring dancing Alligators romancing fat hippos (The Pastoral Symphony) or the 'meet the soundtrack' interstitial are yawnfests with pretty much nothing happening at all, I'm sorry to say.The animation is always top-notch however and very vivid as Disney cartoons usually are. But ultimately, Fantasia is a mixed bag that not a lot of people will like or appreciate. Still worth checking out though.</fullReview>

This segment alone is an example of what was the great thing about cartoons in the 1940's, no speech amongst the characters, which allows your imagination run wild and the music went right along with the cartoon. With exception of the narrator there is no speech in Fantasia but, unlike my comments about the "Sorcerers Apprentice" this hurts the rest of the movie for the animation on the rest of movie just doesn't grab you and with the classical music playing in the background I am always put to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music is lovely throughout most of the movie. And, I like Diney animation. So, why did I dislike this movie?! Well, because it was so boring! Although a "classic" film, many children who are shown the film are really bored except for the cute stuff (like the Sorcerer's Apprentice and the dancing mushrooms). And, many adults will, perhaps, like the music but find it more fun just to turn on a CD of classical tunes (I fall in that category). This is because many of the segments just seem to fall flat (particularly the dinosaur portion). I would have much preferred the efforts to have been spent on producing a movie like "Bambi" or "Pinocchio" (which came out around the same time).I know people who like it, so I am not saying they are WRONG. Instead, I am pointing out that this movie will NOT appeal to everyone--certainly not me or my family--though we might like a segment here or there.As for me, I'd much rather watch a fun Disney film!UPDATE: Since reviewing "Fantasia", I have seen a similar sort of Disney film "Make Mine Music"--which lacks almost everything good about "Fantasia". The art is noticeably cheaper looking and the music was often much more forgettable. The net effect was to make me appreciate "Fantasia" a bit more. Perhaps I was too harsh towards this 1940 film and I'll amend my score to 7--though it STILL is pretty to look at and listen to but also often quite dull (especially for kids).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classical music, Uncle Walt style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences of the 1940's may have found Walt Disney's visual interpretation of some of the world's greatest classical music enthralling, but I found the whole experience rather underwhelming. The soundtrack was, as I expected, fantastic; however, several of the animated sequences are dreadfully dull, whilst some of the more 'experimental' imagery seem tame by today's standards.A rather dry narrator introduces the film and reveals the intentions of its creators: to represent the music through visual artistry. The orchestra assembles and the conductor, Leopold Stokowski, takes his place. Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor begins, accompanied by garish multicoloured silhouettes of the musicians. Resisting the urge to switch off at this mind numbingly awful start, I soldiered on.Next up for the Disney treatment is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker Suite, in which all manner of animals and plants are anthropomorphised and dance to the music. The animation here is pretty good, but the sequence seems to last forever.Mickey Mouse takes centre stage in the third segment, playing The Sorcerer's Apprentice (with music composed by Paul Dukas). This is certainly an iconic piece of cinema, but I never was a fan of the helium-voiced rodent and once again found my mind wandering, despite the great instrumentals and the chaotic kinetic power of the visuals.Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring accompanies the story of life on Earth, from the forming of the planet to the death of the dinosaurs. Impressive animation and rousing dramatic music make this my favourite part of the movie.In complete contrast, Ludwid Van Beethoven's The Pastoral Symphony and Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours are teamed up with some of the dullest animated moments in Disney history. In the first, sickly sweet cherubs, centaurs, unicorns and flying horses frolic in an idyllic country setting whilst boring the pants off the audience. And the latter features unlikely animals (hippos, ostriches, crocodiles) performing ballet routines. It's yawn inducing and not in the slightest bit funny.Fortunately, the film ends with a wonderfully dark interpretation of Modeste Moussorgsky's Night On Bold Mountain (demons, ghosts and spirits party 'til dawn) and a beautifully tranquil finale accompanied by Franz Schubert's Ave Maria.This is certainly bold movie making from The House of Mouse, but it is not entirely successful. Definitely not a 'routine' film for kids (although some may enjoy it), Fantasia is worth watching, but it didn't work its way into my heart like so many of Walt's other masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why this is considered such a Disney classic is far beyond me. It's is so boring. It is not mature enough for adults and it is either too boring or way too scary for little children. Their is no plot, so someone with a short attention span like me will be in pain watching this. The only part that little kids would really like is the part with Mickey Mouse as the Soucerer's apprentice. Though i am really not getting the whole broomsticks with arms thing. Aside from hat there was one cute part, which was the dancing hippos and the alligators. That part is far more enjoyable than the Mickey Mouse section. But overall i just a a brief summary of this film. and that is that it was long boring pointless and STUPID STUPIDS STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated this film. The whole movie is brooms getting water. This film made me sleep. I can't believe that it is in IMDb's Top 250 list. This is the worst film I have ever seen. This should be #1 on the bottom 100 on IMDb. If you liked this movie, you need new taste. If you hated this film, you got good taste.</fullReview>
